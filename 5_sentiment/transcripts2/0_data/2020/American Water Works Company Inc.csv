Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us.

As you know,",971,"Thanks, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, our COO and CEO-elect, Walter Lynch, will give key updates on our operations; and our CFO, Susan Hardwick, will cover the fourth quarter and full year financial results. 
As you know, this is my last earnings call, and I'm excited to say something I've had the privilege of repeating on every earnings call since May of 2014. Yet again, American Water employees delivered strong results as we continue to grow our business and execute on our strategies. I've said many times that very few people get the opportunity and privilege of working with their heroes every day, and I do. The amazing people of American Water consistently deliver outstanding service and results, and they do so with incredibly inspiring commitment and dedication to our customers and to our communities. 
Now let me highlight just a few of our 2019 accomplishments. We continued our strong financial performance. Adjusted earnings were up 9.4% year-over-year, with strong growth in both our Regulated and Market-Based businesses. We added 67,000 customer connections in our Regulated business in 2019 through both closed acquisitions and organic growth. And just over the past 7 weeks, in 2020, we have closed an additional 5,100 customer connections. Walter will cover this in detail, but we closed on a total of 21 acquisitions in 8 different states in 2019. We are proud to truly be providing solutions across the United States. We want communities to be better because we're there, and we're excited to welcome our new customers and our new employees to the American Water family. And in addition to these closed acquisitions, we will welcome more than 44,000 new customer connections already under agreement over the next several months. Our growth wouldn't be possible without being customer-obsessed and being the best at the fundamentals of delivering safe, reliable and affordable water and wastewater services to our customers. 
We invested about $1.9 billion in 2019, with $1.7 billion going into our existing regulated infrastructure and $235 million for regulated acquisitions. We work to be as efficient as possible in both our O&M costs and in our capital projects work and by leveraging our buying power and strategic sourcing to keep customer bills affordable. We continue to implement practical technology tools for our frontline employees to enhance their ability to serve our customers more effectively. And we're also working on customer interfaces that deliver a highly personalized and satisfying customer experience. 
Moving to our Market-Based businesses. Homeowner Services continued its strong performance, most recently launching a partnership with the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. This represents about 100,000 potential new customers for that business. And as you know, we were extremely honored in 2019 to be awarded the Department of Defense contracts for water and wastewater systems at both joint base San Antonio and Texas and the United States Military Academy at West Point in New York. We now provide water and wastewater services on 16 military bases across the U.S., and it is a true honor to serve the men and women who serve our country. 
We also announced in November an agreement to sell our New York American Water subsidiary to Liberty Utilities Company. And in December, we completed the sale of our Keystone operations. 
Moving to Slide 6. With our continued strong performance and our commitment to the disciplined execution of our strategies, we are affirming our 2020 EPS guidance initiated this past December of $3.79 to $3.89 per share and our long-term 5-year growth of 7% to 10%. And for the sixth year in a row, our Board of Directors approved a dividend increase that is at the high end of our long-term growth. 
We remain a regulated water utility at our core, with a low-risk and predictable growth story further enhanced with a strong ESG performance record. We plan to invest $20 billion to $22 billion in capital over the next 10 years. This includes replacing pipe, pumps and plants, and it also includes investing in critical resiliency and asset-hardening projects related to climate variability. Again, this will be balanced by our continuing O&M and capital cost efficiency efforts, constructive regulatory and legislative policy and technology deployment. 
The successful execution of our strategies has enabled us to achieve a 5-year total shareholder return of 156% compared to the S&P 500's 5-year TSR of 74%. Strong financial performance is a direct outcome of our steadfast focus on and execution of the fundamentals of our business. 
Moving to Slide 7. Let me talk just a moment about how we deliver results. It is our firm belief that companies do well by doing good. Just last month, we were named to the Global 100 index as one of the world's 100 most sustainable companies. American Water ranked 16th, fourth among only 17 total U.S. companies of any sector, making the list and the only U.S.-based utility. We were also just named, for the third year in a row, to Barron's 100 Most Sustainable Companies as the highest ranked utility. We are extremely proud of these recognitions as they validate from external sources our deep commitment to be an ESG leader. This slide lists several of our most recent 2019 and 2020 ESG recognitions. 
We know that investors are actively searching for companies who deliver strong financial results, while they also fully engage and develop employees, continually improve customer experiences, protect the planet and make communities stronger because they're there. When these things are in the fabric of your culture and you also excel at the fundamentals of your business, long-term financial sustainability follows. And this is why we are confident in our business and our growth for the future. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Walter to give a more detailed update on our Regulated business."
250885,650981022,1914035,"American Water Works Company, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 19, 2020",2020-02-19,"Earnings Calls","American Water Works Company, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Susan. Good morning, everyone. Our Regulated businesses had a strong fourth quarter with significant capital investment, strategic acquisitions and continued O&M efficiency. Turning to Slide 9.

Our Regulated businesses had a strong fourth quarter with significant capital investment, strategic acquisitions and continued O&M efficiency. 
Turning to Slide 9. There was a substantial amount of progress in the regulatory front throughout 2019 and continuing into 2020. In 2019, we concluded 4 rate cases in Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginia and Maryland. In total, these 4 cases included more than $860 million of capital investment to provide reliable service for our customers. They also reflect a concerted effort in cost management, which I'll speak to shortly. 
We have 3 pending rate cases in New Jersey, Virginia and California. In December 2019, New Jersey American Water filed a general rate case requesting an overall revenue increase of approximately $88 million, excluding the revenue from the distribution system improvement charge, or DC. Since our last rate case in 2018, we have or will invest more than $1 billion in system upgrades, including 95 miles of water mains, which is critical to water quality, reliability and fire protection. That level of investment also addresses New Jersey American Water's compliance with the state's Water Quality Accountability Act. 
In November 2018, Virginia American Water filed a general rate case requesting an overall revenue increase of $5.6 million, driven by approximately $98 million in infrastructure upgrades since April 2017. Interim rates became effective on May 1, 2019, and  we expect a decision later this year. 
Moving west, California American Water filed for new rates in July 2019. The case covers 2021 through 2023 and request an increase in authorized revenue of $46.6 million over 3 years, beginning with a $26 million increase proposed for January 1, 2021. The request seeks $197 million for infrastructure improvements planned for 2021 and 2022. We expect a decision on this case late this year, with new rates to take effect on January 1, 2021. California American Water also joined a multi-company request on January 22, 2020, that requested a 1-year delay in filing a new cost of capital application and an extension of the currently authorized cost of capital. 
Turning to Slide 10. We continue to balance making critical investments to provide reliable service while limiting the impact to our customers' bills. For 2019, we've invested a total of $1.9 billion in our regulated operations. At the same time, we continue making progress towards our long-term O&M efficiency goal of 31.3% by 2024. 
To put this effort in perspective, our adjusted O&M expenses are just slightly higher today than they were in 2010. Since then, we've added approximately 270,000 customer connections while expenses only increased at a compound annual growth rate of 0.6%. We're extremely proud of our employees' focus and commitment to controlling costs on behalf of our customers. 
Turning to Slide 11. As Susan said, we continue to grow the size of our footprint with 21 acquisitions occurring in 8 states, adding about 53,100 new customer connections. In 2020 year-to-date, we've added approximately 5,100 new customer connections through 2 closed acquisitions, with the majority coming from the Fruitridge Vista water system in California. 
In 2019, we were successful in continuing to expand our wastewater footprint in areas where we serve water customers. It just makes great sense to use our existing resources in areas where we already provide water services. This was the case last year in Alton, Illinois, where we welcomed 23,000 wastewater customer connections and in Exiter, Pennsylvania, where we welcomed 9,000 wastewater customer connections. We also added 14,000 new customer connections from organic growth in 2019, and we'll welcome another 44,200 customer connections through 28 signed agreements in 9 states, 7 were signed since we last spoke at Investor Day in early December. These agreements will add about 15,000 water customer connections and about 29,000 wastewater customer connections. 
Moving to Slide 12. We continue to achieve our 1% to 2% growth of customer connections through acquisitions, which equates to about 30,000 to 60,000 new customer connections per year. As you can see, since 2015, we've completed 83 acquisitions, adding about 173,000 new customer connections in 10 states. Of those 83 acquisitions, 50 were acquisitions of water systems, adding 43,000 customers; and 33 were acquisitions of wastewater systems, adding 130,000 customers. Our customer base is now 93% water and 7% wastewater, which provides us tremendous opportunities to grow our wastewater business in areas where we already provide water service. 
We're very disciplined in our approach to acquisitions, leveraging our tremendous expertise to find solutions for communities. We now have about 695,000 customer opportunities in our pipeline, up from about 650,000 customer opportunities in our last update at Investor Day. This consistent growth in our pipeline is bolstered by key regulatory mechanisms and legislative enablers. We work constructively with regulators and legislators in the states where we operate to receive these key mechanisms and enablers. We now have fair market value in 8 of our states, consolidated tariffs in 12 of our states and water quality accountability legislation in 2 of our states, with other states within our footprint considering similar legislation. 
We're a purpose-driven company, and every one of our employees plays a role in supporting our disciplined growth strategy. For us, it's about providing meaningful water and wastewater solutions to communities and welcoming these new employees into our company culture of purpose and safety. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Susan Hardwick for more detail on our financial performance."

Let me start on Slide 14 with a summary of our results. Fourth quarter 2019 consolidated GAAP earnings were $0.54 per share compared to $0.62 per share in 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2019, GAAP earnings we",768,"Thank you, Walter, and good morning, everyone. Let me start on Slide 14 with a summary of our results. Fourth quarter 2019 consolidated GAAP earnings were $0.54 per share compared to $0.62 per share in 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2019, GAAP earnings were adjusted for the December sale of our Keystone operations, and 2018 GAAP earnings were adjusted for the remeasurement of deferred taxes resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Excluding these adjustments, adjusted earnings per share were up $0.04 per share, driven primarily by growth in the Regulated business. 
The Regulated business segment results were up $0.13 per share or an increase of 18.3% compared to 2018 earnings. The Market-Based businesses results were up $0.03 per share, and the parent company decreased $0.12 per share compared to 2018, primarily reflecting higher interest expense to support growth in the business. And for the year, our 2019 adjusted earnings were $3.61 per share, or a 9.4% increase over the same period last year. Our Regulated Businesses increased $0.28 per share; our Market-Based Businesses increased $0.12 per share, primarily from homeowner services; and finally, the parent results decreased by $0.09 per share year-over-year, driven by higher interest expense, which was partially offset by the sale of the legacy investment that occurred in the second quarter of 2019. 
Moving on to Slide 15. Let me walk through a bit more detail of the 2019 results by business. As I mentioned, regulated operations were up $0.28 per share in total. We had a $0.49 per share increase from additional authorized revenue and surcharges to support infrastructure investments, acquisitions and organic growth. Offsetting the revenue increase, the second quarter of 2019, which was the wettest on record, had a $0.04 per share unfavorable impact from weather. Also, O&M expense increased $0.03 per share and depreciation and interest increased $0.14 per share, both to support regulated acquisitions and other growth. 
The Market-Based Businesses reported strong results in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily driven by organic growth of the Homeowner Services group and from the addition of the 2 contracts in our military services group in 2018. 
Finally, the parent was down $0.09 per share, primarily reflecting higher interest expense to support growth in the business and a $1.5 million or about $0.01 per share donation to the American Water Charitable Foundation. 
Moving to Slide 16. We have been very active on the regulatory front. The Regulated Businesses received $98 million in annualized new revenues in 2019. And  this includes $45 million from rate cases and $53 million from infrastructure surcharges. We have also filed requests and are awaiting final orders on 3 rate cases and 1 infrastructure surcharge proceeding for a total annualized revenue request of $126 million. The continued successful execution of our regulatory strategy is a key element of our ability to consistently deliver results. 
Moving to Slide 17. As Susan said, we are affirming our 2020 EPS guidance range of $3.79 to $3.89 per share that we initiated in December. We are also affirming our long-term earnings compounded annual growth rate expectation on an earnings per share basis of 7% to 10%, while investing capital in the range of $8.8 billion to $9.4 billion over the next 5 years. 
Moving to Slide 18, let me summarize. We've invested capital of $1.9 billion in 2019, including $1.7 billion of regulated system improvements to better serve our customers and $235 million in closed regulated acquisitions that added over 53,000 new customer connections. These investments increased our estimated rate base at the end of 2019 to $13.7 billion, a 10.1% increase from the prior year. Our cash flow from operations held steady on a year-over-year basis from strong net income growth and the cash flow from our Market-Based Businesses. 
We continue to deliver strong consolidated results. Our total company consolidated actual return on equity was 10.6% for 2019. Regulatory execution, along with strong results from our Market-Based Businesses, allows us to consistently deliver on our earnings commitment. We believe that delivering on results, combined with our strong earnings growth and superior dividend expectations, continues to provide excellent value for our investors. 
And we continue to be a top leader in dividend growth. We have grown our dividend at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 10% or more over the last 5 years, and we expect to continue this growth at the high end of the 7% to 10% range. Also, we continue to target a dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60% of earnings. 
And with that, let me turn it back to Walter for a few additional comments."

For me, it's been an absolute honor to work with Susan over the past 6 years as CEO, and a year before that as CFO. She cares deeply about our people, our customers and our communities. Her commitment to do well by doing good has led to so many of our successes. There are too many accomplishments to name, but I will note that our commitment to the health and safety of our employees has been extraordinary. Susan always lives up to the company's strong values, especially safety. Nothing has mattered more. She cares about every single employee in our company and constantly reminds us that every employee should go home to their families in the same or better shape in which they came to work. We've had a 63% reduction in overall OSHA recordable injury rates and a 72% reduction in the serious injury rates than she became CEO. Our goal is to have 0 injuries, and we're working to make that a reality. 
During Susan's tenure, American Water became the first and continues to be the only water utility in the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Utility Average and the Philadelphia Utilities Index. Additionally, our 6-year total shareholder return is 230.8%. Market capitalization increased from $8.6 billion in May of 2014 to over $25 billion currently. And our dividend growth compound annual growth rate over the past 6 years is 10.2%. 
Susan has been instrumental in guiding us on our current journey as a people power culture and a customer-obsessed organization with a strong commitment to environmental leadership, water quality, operational excellence and growth. Our entire leadership team is deeply committed to the execution of our strategies and our company values. So Susan, on behalf of all the employees at American Water, thank you so much."

And perhaps just to turn it back to our regularly tuned program here. Just if I can. I appreciate the commentary. If we can talk about PFAS and brief, and I want to break this into a couple of different pieces. First, with respect to military sites, I know you guys have been obviously very involved for a while. Does PFAS start to change the opportunity set for your existing sites? And secondly, does it change the opportunity set for incremental sites and/or accelerate those opportunities in terms of of bases that may or may not be looking at opportunities, including yourself. And then separately, coming back to PFAS, more holistically, I know EPA is looking at setting perhaps updated targets. And to what extent could either state, more importantly, federal level efforts. And I know a lot of the specific states you guys operate in already have been looking at or have already instituted more specific and stringent targets, does that change the name of the game? And I know we talked about this a few months ago at your Analyst Day, but again, even in that short-read time, it seems like the conversation has evolved."

So you're right. Let me take the first one about the military bases. Because as we know that a majority of the source of PFAS are firefighting film and many military installations through the years, of course, doing exercises and those type of things tend to have a concentration. The Department of Defense is actively working at its bases to determine if and whether they have issues. We have, as you noted, already done work on 2 of our military bases. We have been working on PFAS for well over a decade, we are able to treat it successfully. We've done so with Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey, for example. So we're working with the bases that we serve in order to help look at what do they have, and then we feel certain that we're able to treat those. And remember that with military bases that we can, with the newer bases actually, every year instead of every 2 years, go in, look at the assets, look at something above and beyond what we bid on to begin with, and we have the ability to change those O&M contracts to recover those costs. So from that standpoint, we'll be working on that over the next several months to work with those bases to do that. The second thing about the EPA and updated targets. So keep in mind that the EPA has 2 classifications. One is called maximum contaminant level and there's close to 100 contaminants that they basically say, this is a regulation, you must meet these. Then they have something called a health advisory that actually doesn't have the weight of required adherence to that. Believe it or not, PFAS is actually not an MCL, or Maximum Contaminant Level. It's a health advisory. And right now, they're looking at 70 parts per trillion. So what the -- or that's what they have. What they're looking at doing is codifying that, making it an MCL, so that they do have the weight of required compliance behind it. There's a lot of questions, as you said, about levels, and we're seeing the different states. New Jersey, for example, has a 13 or 14 parts per trillion based on the top of PFA, it is. We're seeing New York look at it, California's looking at it, several states are. We at American water, working closely with the EPA, very closely, we think it's better to have one for the entire country. We can treat to whatever level is needed, it isn't an expense issue as we go through there, plus some capital investment in how we treat that. So it is a growing field. It is a field in which we believe we have tremendous expertise.

Today, our COO and CEO-elect, Walter Lynch, will give key updates on our operations; and our CFO, Susan Hardwick, will cover the fourth quarter and full year financial results. 
As you know, this is my last earnings call, and I'm excited to say something I've had the privilege of repeating on every earnings call since May of 2014. Yet again, American Water employees delivered strong results as we continue to grow our business and execute on our strategies. I've said many times that very few people get the opportunity and privilege of working with their heroes every day, and I do. The amazing people of American Water consistently deliver outstanding service and results, and they do so with incredibly inspiring commitment and dedication to our customers and to our community. 
Now let me highlight just a few of our 2019 accomplishments. We continued our strong financial performance. Adjusted earnings were up 9.4% year-over-year with strong growth in both our Regulated and Market-Based businesses. We added 67,000 customer connections in our Regulated business in 2019 through both closed acquisitions and organic growth. And just over the past 7 weeks, in 2020, we have closed an additional 5,100 customer connections. Walter will cover this in detail, but we closed on a total of 21 acquisitions in 8 different states in 2019. We are proud to truly be providing solutions across the United States. We want communities to be better because we're there, and we're excited to welcome our new customers and our new employees to the American Water family. 
And in addition to these closed acquisitions, we will welcome more than 44,000 new customer connections already under agreement over the next several months. Our growth wouldn't be possible without being customer-obsessed and being the best at the fundamentals of delivering safe, reliable and affordable water and wastewater services to our customers. We invested about $1.9 billion in 2019 with $1.7 billion going into our existing regulated infrastructure and $235 million for regulated acquisitions. 
We work to be as efficient as possible in both our O&M costs and in our capital projects work and by leveraging our buying power and strategic sourcing to keep customer bills affordable. We continue to implement practical technology tools for our frontline employees to enhance their ability to serve our customers more effectively. And we're also working on customer interfaces that deliver a highly personalized and satisfying customer experience. 
Moving to our Market-Based businesses. Homeowner Services continued its strong performance, most recently launching a partnership with the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. This represents about 100,000 potential new customers for that business. And as you know, we were extremely honored in 2019 to be awarded the Department of Defense contracts for water and wastewater systems at both joint base San Antonio and Texas and the United States Military Academy at West Point in New York. We now provide water and wastewater services on 16 military bases across the U.S., and it is a true honor to serve the men and women who serve our country. We also announced in November an agreement to sell our New York American Water subsidiary to Liberty Utilities Co. And in December, we completed the sale of our Keystone operations. 
Moving to Slide 6. With our continued strong performance and our commitment to the disciplined execution of our strategies, we are affirming our 2020 EPS guidance initiated this past December of $3.79 to $3.89 per share and our long-term 5-year growth of 7% to 10%. And for the sixth year in a row, our Board of Directors approved a dividend increase that is at the high end of our long-term growth. 
We remain a regulated water utility at our core with a low-risk and predictable growth story further enhanced with a strong ESG performance record. We plan to invest $20 billion to $22 billion in capital over the next 10 years. This includes replacing pipe, pumps and plants, and it also includes investing in critical resiliency and asset-hardening projects related to climate variability. Again, this will be balanced by our continuing O&M and capital cost efficiency efforts, constructive regulatory and legislative policy and technology deployment. 
The successful execution of our strategies has enabled us to achieve a 5-year total shareholder return of 156% compared to the S&P 500's 5-year TSR of 74%. Strong financial performance is a direct outcome of our steadfast focus on and execution of the fundamentals of our business. 
Moving to Slide 7. Let me talk just a moment about how we deliver results. It is our firm belief that companies do well by doing good. Just last month, we were named to the Global 100 Index as one of the world's 100 most sustainable company. American Water ranked 16th, fourth among only 17 total U.S. companies of any sector making the list and the only U.S.-based utility. We were also just named for the third year in a row to Barron's 100 Most Sustainable Companies as the highest ranked utility. We are extremely proud of these recognitions as they validate from external sources our deep commitment to be an ESG leader. This slide lists several of our most recent 2019 and 2020 ESG recognitions. 
We know that investors are actively searching for companies who deliver strong financial results while they also fully engage and develop employees, continually improve customer experiences, protect the planet and make communities stronger because they're there. When these things are in the fabric of your culture and you also excel at the fundamentals of your business, long-term financial sustainability follows. And this is why we are confident in our business and our growth for the future. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Walter to give a more detailed update on our Regulated business."

Good morning, everyone. Our Regulated businesses had a strong fourth quarter with significant capital investment, strategic acquisitions and continued O&M efficiency. Turning to Slide 9. There was a substantial amount of progress in the",904,"Thanks, Susan. Good morning, everyone. 
Our Regulated businesses had a strong fourth quarter with significant capital investment, strategic acquisitions and continued O&M efficiency. 
Turning to Slide 9. There was a substantial amount of progress in the regulatory front throughout 2019 and continuing into 2020. In 2019, we concluded 4 rate cases in Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginia and Maryland. In total, these 4 cases included more than $860 million of capital investment to provide reliable service for our customers. They also reflect a concerted effort in cost management, which I'll speak to you shortly. We have 3 pending rate cases in New Jersey, Virginia and California. 
In December 2019, New Jersey American Water filed a general rate case requesting an overall revenue increase of approximately $88 million, excluding the revenue from the distribution system improvement charge, or DSIC. Since our last rate case in 2018, we have or will invest more than $1 billion in system upgrades, including 95 miles of water mains, which is critical to water quality, reliability and fire protection. That level of investment also addresses New Jersey American Water's compliance with the state's Water Quality Accountability Act. 
In November 2018, Virginia American Water filed a general rate case requesting an overall revenue increase of $5.6 million driven by approximately $98 million in infrastructure upgrades since April 2017. Interim rates became effective on May 1, 2019, and we expect a decision later this year. 
Moving west. California American Water filed for new rates in July 2019. The case covers 2021 through 2023 and request an increase in authorized revenue of $46.6 million over 3 years, beginning with a $26 million increase proposed for January 1, 2021. The request seeks $197 million for infrastructure improvements planned for 2021 and 2022. We expect a decision on this case late this year with new rates to take effect on January 1, 2021. California American Water also joined a multicompany request on January 22, 2020, that requested a 1-year delay in filing a new cost of capital application and an extension of the currently authorized cost of capital. 
Turning to Slide 10. We continue to balance making critical investments to provide reliable service while limiting the impact to our customers' bills. For 2019, we've invested a total of $1.9 billion in our Regulated Operations. At the same time, we continue making progress towards our long-term O&M efficiency goal of 31.3% by 2024. To put this effort in perspective, our adjusted O&M expenses are just slightly higher today than they were in 2010. Since then, we've added approximately 270,000 customer connections while expenses only increased at a compound annual growth rate of 0.6%. We're extremely proud of our employees' focus and commitment to controlling costs on behalf of our customers. 
Turning to Slide 11. As Susan said, we continue to grow the size of our footprint with 21 acquisitions occurring in 8 states adding about 53,100 new customer connections. In 2020, year-to-date, we've added approximately 5,100 new customer connections through 2 closed acquisitions with the majority coming from the Fruitridge Vista water system in California. In 2019, we were successful in continuing to expand our wastewater footprint in areas where we serve water customers. It just makes great sense to use our existing resources in areas where we already provide water services. This was the case last year in Alton, Illinois where we welcomed 23,000 wastewater customer connections and in Exeter, Pennsylvania where we welcomed 9,000 wastewater customer connections. We also added 14,000 new customer connections from organic growth in 2019, and we'll welcome another 44,200 customer connections through 28 signed agreements in 9 states. 7 were signed since we last spoke at Investor Day in early December. These agreements will add about 15,000 water customer connections and about 29,000 wastewater customer connections. 
Moving to Slide 12. We continue to achieve our 1% to 2% growth of customer connections through acquisitions, which equates to about 30,000 to 60,000 new customer connections per year. As you can see, since 2015, we've completed 83 acquisitions, adding about 173,000 new customer connections in 10 states. Of those 83 acquisitions, 50 were acquisitions of water systems, adding 43,000 customers; and 33 were acquisitions of wastewater systems, adding 130,000 customers. Our customer base is now 93% water and 7% wastewater, which provides us tremendous opportunities to grow our wastewater business in areas where we already provide water service. We're very disciplined in our approach to acquisitions, leveraging our tremendous expertise to find solutions for communities. We now have about 695,000 customer opportunities in our pipeline, up from about 650,000 customer opportunities in our last update at Investor Day. 
This consistent growth in our pipeline is bolstered by key regulatory mechanisms and legislative enablers. We work constructively with regulators and legislators in the states where we operate to receive these key mechanisms and enablers. We now have fair market value in 8 of our states, consolidated tariffs in 12 of our states and water quality accountability legislation in 2 of our states with other states within our footprint considering similar legislation. We're a purpose-driven company, and every one of our employees plays a role in supporting our disciplined growth strategy. For us, it's about providing meaningful water and wastewater solutions to communities and welcoming these new employees into our company culture of purpose and safety. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Susan Hardwick for more detail on our financial performance."
250885,650981022,1914191,"American Water Works Company, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 19, 2020",2020-02-19,"Earnings Calls","American Water Works Company, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Walter, and good morning, everyone. Let me start on Slide 14 with a summary of our results. Fourth quarter 2019 consolidated GAAP earnings were $0.54 per share compared to $0.62 per share in 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2019, GAAP earnings",768,"Thank you, Walter, and good morning, everyone. 
Let me start on Slide 14 with a summary of our results. Fourth quarter 2019 consolidated GAAP earnings were $0.54 per share compared to $0.62 per share in 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2019, GAAP earnings were adjusted for the December sale of our Keystone operations and 2018 GAAP earnings were adjusted for the remeasurement of deferred taxes resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Excluding these adjustments, adjusted earnings per share were up $0.04 per share driven primarily by growth in the Regulated business. 
The Regulated business segment results were up $0.13 per share or an increase of 18.3% compared to 2018 earnings. The Market-Based businesses results were up $0.03 per share, and the parent company decreased $0.12 per share compared to 2018 primarily reflecting higher interest expense to support growth in the business. And for the year, our 2019 adjusted earnings were $3.61 per share or a 9.4% increase over the same period last year. Our Regulated Businesses increased $0.28 per share. Our Market-Based Businesses increased $0.12 per share primarily from Homeowner Services. And finally, the parent results decreased by $0.09 per share year-over-year driven by higher interest expense, which was partially offset by the sale of the legacy investment that occurred in the second quarter of 2019. 
Moving on to Slide 15. Let me walk through a bit more detail of the 2019 results by business. As I mentioned, Regulated Operations were up $0.28 per share in total. We had a $0.49 per share increase from additional authorized revenue and surcharges to support infrastructure investments, acquisitions and organic growth. Offsetting the revenue increase, the second quarter of 2019, which was the wettest on record, had a $0.04 per share unfavorable impact from weather. Also, O&M expense increased $0.03 per share and depreciation and interest increased $0.14 per share, both to support regulated acquisitions and other growth. 
The Market-Based Businesses reported strong results in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily driven by organic growth of the Homeowner Services group and from the addition of the 2 contracts in our military services group in 2018. Finally, the parent was down $0.09 per share primarily reflecting higher interest expense to support growth in the business and a $1.5 million or about $0.01 per share donation to the American Water Charitable Foundation. 
Moving to Slide 16. We have been very active on the regulatory front. The Regulated Businesses received $98 million in annualized new revenues in 2019. And this includes $45 million from rate cases and $53 million from infrastructure surcharges. We have also filed requests and are awaiting final orders on 3 rate cases and 1 infrastructure surcharge proceeding for a total annualized revenue request of $126 million. The continued successful execution of our regulatory strategy is a key element of our ability to consistently deliver results. 
Moving to Slide 17. As Susan said, we are affirming our 2020 EPS guidance range of $3.79 to $3.89 per share that we initiated in December. We are also affirming our long-term earnings compounded annual growth rate expectation on an earnings per share basis of 7% to 10% while investing capital in the range of $8.8 billion to $9.4 billion over the next 5 years. 
Moving to Slide 18. Let me summarize. We've invested capital of $1.9 billion in 2019, including $1.7 billion of regulated system improvements to better serve our customers and $235 million in closed regulated acquisitions that added over 53,000 new customer connections. These investments increased our estimated rate base at the end of 2019 to $13.7 billion, a 10.1% increase from the prior year. Our cash flow from operations held steady on a year-over-year basis from strong net income growth and the cash flow from our Market-Based Businesses. 
We continue to deliver strong consolidated results. Our total company consolidated actual return on equity was 10.6% for 2019. Regulatory execution along with strong results from our Market-Based Businesses allows us to consistently deliver on our earnings commitment. We believe that delivering on results, combined with our strong earnings growth and superior dividend expectations, continues to provide excellent value for our investors. And we continue to be a top leader in dividend growth. We have grown our dividend at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 10% or more over the last 5 years, and we expect to continue this growth at the high end of the 7% to 10% range. Also, we continue to target a dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60% of earnings. 
And with that, let me turn it back to Walter for a few additional comments."

As you all know, this is Susan Story's last earnings call with American Water, and I wanted to take this opportunity to reflect on her tenure with us. For me, it's been an absolute honor to work with Susan over the past 6 years as CEO and a year before that as CFO. She cares deeply about our people, our customers and our communities. Her commitment to do well by doing good has led to so many of our successes. There are too many accomplishments to name, but I will note that our commitment to the health and safety of our employees has been extraordinary. Susan always lives up to the company's strong values, especially safety. Nothing has mattered more. She cares about every single employee in our company and constantly reminds us that every employee should go home to their families in the same or better shape in which they came to work. We've had a 63% reduction in overall OSHA recordable injury rates and a 72% reduction in the serious injury rate since she became CEO. Our goal is to have 0 injuries, and we're working to make that a reality. 
During Susan's tenure, American Water became the first and continues to be the only water utility in the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Utility Average and the Philadelphia Utilities Index. Additionally, our 6-year total shareholder return is 230.8%. Market capitalization increased from $8.6 billion in May of 2014 to over $25 billion currently. And our dividend growth compound annual growth rate over the past 6 years is 10.2%. 
Susan has been instrumental in guiding us on our current journey as a people power culture and a customer-obsessed organization with a strong commitment to environmental leadership, water quality, operational excellence and growth. Our entire leadership team is deeply committed to the execution of our strategies and our company values. 
So Susan, on behalf of all the employees at American Water, thank you so much."

Does PFAS start to change the opportunity set for your existing sites? 
And secondly, does it change the opportunity set for incremental sites and/or accelerate those opportunities in terms of bases that may or may not be looking at opportunities, including yourself. 
And then separately, coming back to PFAS, more holistically, I know EPA is looking at setting perhaps updated targets. And to what extent could either state or more importantly, federal level efforts -- and I know a lot of the specific states you guys operate in already have been looking at or have already instituted more specific and stringent targets. Does that change the name of the game? And I know we talked about this a few months ago at your Analyst Day, but again, even in that short brief time, it seems like the conversation has evolved."

So you're right. Let me take the first one about the military bases. Because as we know that a majority of the source of PFAS are firefighting foam and many military installations through the years, of course, doing exercises and those type of things tend to have a concentration, the Department of Defense is actively working at its bases to determine if and whether they have issues. We have, as you noted, already done work on 2 of our military bases. We have been working on PFAS for well over a decade. We were able to treat it successfully. We've done so with Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey, for example. So we're working with the bases that we serve in order to help look at what do they have, and then we feel certain that we're able to treat those. And remember that with military bases that we can, with the newer bases, actually, every year instead of every 2 years, go in, look at the assets, look at something above and beyond what we bid on to begin with, and we have the ability to change those O&M contracts to recover those costs. So from that standpoint, we'll be working on that over the next several months to work with those bases to do that. 
The second thing about the EPA and updated targets. So keep in mind that the EPA has 2 classifications. One is called maximum contaminant level. And there's close to 100 contaminants that they basically say, ""This is the regulation. You must meet this."" Then they have something called a health advisory that actually doesn't have the weight of required adherence to that. Believe it or not, PFAS is actually not an MCL, or maximum contaminant level. It's a health advisory. And right now, they're looking at 70 parts per trillion. So what the -- or that's what they have. What they're looking at doing is codifying that, making it an MCL so that they do have the weight of required compliance behind it. There's a lot of questions, as you said, about levels, and we're seeing the different states. New Jersey, for example, has a 13 or 14 parts per trillion based on the top of PFA it is. We're seeing New York look at it, California's looking at it, several states are. We at American water are working closely with the EPA, very closely. We think it's better to have one for the entire country. We can treat to whatever level is needed. It is an expense issue as we go through there plus some capital investment in how we treat that. So it is a growing field. It is a field in which we believe we have tremendous expertise. We're an adviser to the EPA on this issue, and we will be -- as we go down this road and we look at what the finalization of these targets are, we can look at what impact that would have to our investment levels as well as what it would have to O&M."

We treat in each of our states to the health advisory level of 70 parts per trillion, unless the state has a more stringent requirement, and then we treat to that, such as California and New Jersey and New York. So that's how we address it. But as Susan said, we are working with the EPA to make sure that we put our views in there about what we think the MCL should be. And it's going to take, I think, some time for the EPA to go through their testing protocols to determine the MCL, but we're going to continue again to treat it to 70 parts per trillion or less if the state has a more stringent requirement."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, our COO and CEO-elect, Walter Lynch, will give key updates on our operations; and our CFO, Susan Hardwick, will cover the fourth quarter and full year financial results. As you know,",972,"Thanks, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, our COO and CEO-elect, Walter Lynch, will give key updates on our operations; and our CFO, Susan Hardwick, will cover the fourth quarter and full year financial results. 
As you know, this is my last earnings call, and I'm excited to say something I've had the privilege of repeating on every earnings call since May of 2014. Yet again, American Water employees delivered strong results as we continue to grow our business and execute on our strategies. I've said many times that very few people get the opportunity and privilege of working with their heroes every day, and I do. The amazing people of American Water consistently deliver outstanding service and results, and they do so with incredibly inspiring commitment and dedication to our customers and to our communities. 
Now let me highlight just a few of our 2019 accomplishments. We continued our strong financial performance. Adjusted earnings were up 9.4% year-over-year with strong growth in both our Regulated and Market-Based businesses. We added 67,000 customer connections in our Regulated business in 2019 through both closed acquisitions and organic growth. And just over the past 7 weeks, in 2020, we have closed an additional 5,100 customer connections. Walter will cover this in detail, but we closed on a total of 21 acquisitions in 8 different states in 2019. We are proud to truly be providing solutions across the United States. We want communities to be better because we're there, and we're excited to welcome our new customers and our new employees to the American Water family. 
And in addition to these closed acquisitions, we will welcome more than 44,000 new customer connections already under agreement over the next several months. Our growth wouldn't be possible without being customer-obsessed and being the best at the fundamentals of delivering safe, reliable and affordable water and wastewater services to our customers. 
We invested about $1.9 billion in 2019, with $1.7 billion going into our existing regulated infrastructure and $235 million for regulated acquisitions. We work to be as efficient as possible in both our O&M costs and in our capital projects work and by leveraging our buying power and strategic sourcing to keep customer bills affordable. 
We continue to implement practical technology tools for our frontline employees to enhance their ability to serve our customers more effectively. And we're also working on customer interfaces that deliver a highly personalized and satisfying customer experience. 
Moving to our Market-Based businesses. Homeowner Services continued its strong performance, most recently launching a partnership with the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. This represents about 100,000 potential new customers for that business. And as you know, we were extremely honored in 2019 to be awarded the Department of Defense contracts for water and wastewater systems at both joint base San Antonio and Texas and the United States Military Academy at West Point in New York. We now provide water and wastewater services on 16 military bases across the U.S., and it is a true honor to serve the men and women who serve our country. 
We also announced in November an agreement to sell our New York American Water subsidiary to Liberty Utilities Co. And in December, we completed the sale of our Keystone operations. 
Moving to Slide 6. With our continued strong performance and our commitment to the disciplined execution of our strategies, we are affirming our 2020 EPS guidance initiated this past December of $3.79 to $3.89 per share and our long-term 5-year growth of 7% to 10%. And for the sixth year in a row, our Board of Directors approved a dividend increase that is at the high end of our long-term growth. 
We remain a regulated water utility at our core with a low-risk and predictable growth story further enhanced with a strong ESG performance record. We plan to invest $20 billion to $22 billion in capital over the next 10 years. This includes replacing pipe, pumps and plants, and it also includes investing in critical resiliency and asset-hardening projects related to climate variability. Again, this will be balanced by our continuing O&M and capital cost efficiency efforts, constructive regulatory and legislative policy and technology deployment. 
The successful execution of our strategies has enabled us to achieve a 5-year total shareholder return of 156% compared to the S&P 500's 5-year TSR of 74%. Strong financial performance is a direct outcome of our steadfast focus on and the execution of the fundamentals of our business. 
Moving to Slide 7. Let me talk just a moment about how we deliver results. It is our firm belief that companies do well by doing good. Just last month, we were named to the Global 100 Index as one of the World's 100 Most Sustainable Companies. American Water ranked 16th, fourth among only 17 total U.S. companies of any sector making the list and the only U.S.-based utility. We were also just named for the third year in a row to Barron's 100 Most Sustainable Companies as the highest ranked utility. We are extremely proud of these recognitions as they validate from external sources our deep commitment to be an ESG leader. This slide lists several of our most recent 2019 and 2020 ESG recognitions. 
We know that investors are actively searching for companies who deliver strong financial results while they also fully engage and develop employees, continually improve customer experiences, protect the planet and make communities stronger because they're there. When these things are in the fabric of your culture and you also excel at the fundamentals of your business, long-term financial sustainability follows. And this is why we are confident in our business and our growth for the future. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Walter to give a more detailed update on our Regulated business."

Our Regulated businesses had a strong fourth quarter with significant capital investment, strategic acquisitions and continued O&M efficiency. 
Turning to Slide 9. There was a substantial amount of progress in the regulatory front throughout 2019 and continuing into 2020. In 2019, we concluded 4 rate cases in Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginia and Maryland. In total, these 4 cases included more than $860 million of capital investment to provide reliable service for our customers. They also reflect a concerted effort in cost management, which I'll speak to you shortly. 
We have 3 pending rate cases in New Jersey, Virginia and California. In December 2019, New Jersey American Water filed a general rate case requesting an overall revenue increase of approximately $88 million, excluding the revenue from the distribution system improvement charge, or DSIC. Since our last rate case in 2018, we have or will invest more than $1 billion in system upgrades, including 95 miles of water mains, which is critical to water quality, reliability and fire protection. That level of investment also addresses New Jersey American Water's compliance with the state's Water Quality Accountability Act. 
In November 2018, Virginia American Water filed a general rate case requesting an overall revenue increase of $5.6 million driven by approximately $98 million in infrastructure upgrades since April 2017. Interim rates became effective on May 1, 2019, and we expect a decision later this year. 
Moving West. California American Water filed for new rates in July 2019. The case covers 2021 through 2023 and request an increase in authorized revenue of $46.6 million over 3 years, beginning with a $26 million increase proposed for January 1, 2021. The request seeks $197 million for infrastructure improvements planned for 2021 and 2022. We expect a decision on this case late this year with new rates to take effect on January 1, 2021. California American Water also joined a multicompany request on January 22, 2020, that requested a 1-year delay in filing a new cost of capital application and an extension of the currently authorized cost of capital. 
Turning to Slide 10. We continue to balance making critical investments to provide reliable service while limiting the impact to our customers' bills. For 2019, we've invested a total of $1.9 billion in our Regulated Operations. At the same time, we continue making progress towards our long-term O&M efficiency goal of 31.3% by 2024. 
To put this effort in perspective, our adjusted O&M expenses are just slightly higher today than they were in 2010. Since then, we've added approximately 270,000 customer connections while expenses only increased at a compound annual growth rate of 0.6%. We're extremely proud of our employees' focus and commitment to controlling costs on behalf of our customers. 
Turning to Slide 11. As Susan said, we continue to grow the size of our footprint with 21 acquisitions occurring in 8 states, adding about 53,100 new customer connections. In 2020 year-to-date, we've added approximately 5,100 new customer connections through 2 closed acquisitions with the majority coming from the Fruitridge Vista water system in California. In 2019, we were successful in continuing to expand our wastewater footprint in areas where we serve water customers. It just makes great sense to use our existing resources in areas where we already provide water services. 
This was the case last year in Alton, Illinois where we welcomed 23,000 wastewater customer connections, and in Exeter, Pennsylvania where we welcomed 9,000 wastewater customer connections. We also added 14,000 new customer connections from organic growth in 2019, and we'll welcome another 44,200 customer connections through 28 signed agreements in 9 states. 7 were signed since we last spoke at Investor Day in early December. These agreements will add about 15,000 water customer connections and about 29,000 wastewater customer connections. 
Moving to Slide 12. We continue to achieve our 1% to 2% growth of customer connections through acquisitions, which equates to about 30,000 to 60,000 new customer connections per year. As you can see, since 2015, we've completed 83 acquisitions, adding about 173,000 new customer connections in 10 states. Of those 83 acquisitions, 50 were acquisitions of water systems, adding 43,000 customers; and 33 were acquisitions of wastewater systems, adding 130,000 customers. Our customer base is now 93% water and 7% wastewater, which provides us tremendous opportunities to grow our wastewater business in areas where we already provide water service. 
We're very disciplined in our approach to acquisitions, leveraging our tremendous expertise to find solutions for communities. We now have about 695,000 customer opportunities in our pipeline, up from about 650,000 customer opportunities in our last update at Investor Day. This consistent growth in our pipeline is bolstered by key regulatory mechanisms and legislative enablers. We work constructively with regulators and legislators in the states where we operate to receive these key mechanisms and enablers. 
We now have fair market value in 8 of our states, consolidated tariffs in 12 of our states and water quality accountability legislation in 2 of our states with other states within our footprint considering similar legislation. 
We're a purpose-driven company, and every one of our employees plays a role in supporting our disciplined growth strategy. For us, it's about providing meaningful water and wastewater solutions to communities and welcoming these new employees into our company culture of purpose and safety. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Susan Hardwick for more detail on our financial performance."

Let me start on Slide 14 with a summary of our results. Fourth quarter 2019 consolidated GAAP earnings were $0.54 per share compared to $0.62 per share in 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2019, GAAP earnings we",768,"Thank you, Walter, and good morning, everyone. Let me start on Slide 14 with a summary of our results. Fourth quarter 2019 consolidated GAAP earnings were $0.54 per share compared to $0.62 per share in 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2019, GAAP earnings were adjusted for the December sale of our Keystone operations and 2018 GAAP earnings were adjusted for the remeasurement of deferred taxes resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Excluding these adjustments, adjusted earnings per share were up $0.04 per share driven primarily by growth in the Regulated business. 
The Regulated business segment results were up $0.13 per share or an increase of 18.3% compared to 2018 earnings. The Market-Based businesses results were up $0.03 per share, and the parent company decreased $0.12 per share compared to 2018 primarily reflecting higher interest expense to support growth in the business. And for the year, our 2019 adjusted earnings were $3.61 per share or a 9.4% increase over the same period last year. 
Our Regulated Businesses increased $0.28 per share. Our Market-Based Businesses increased $0.12 per share primarily from Homeowner Services. And finally, the parent results decreased by $0.09 per share year-over-year driven by higher interest expense, which was partially offset by the sale of the legacy investment that occurred in the second quarter of 2019. 
Moving on to Slide 15. Let me walk through a bit more detail of the 2019 results by business. As I mentioned, Regulated Operations were up $0.28 per share in total. We had a $0.49 per share increase from additional authorized revenue and surcharges to support infrastructure investments, acquisitions and organic growth. Offsetting the revenue increase, the second quarter of 2019, which was the wettest on record, had a $0.04 per share unfavorable impact from weather. Also, O&M expense increased $0.03 per share and depreciation and interest increased $0.14 per share, both to support regulated acquisitions and other growth. 
The Market-Based Businesses reported strong results in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily driven by organic growth of the Homeowner Services group and from the addition of the 2 contracts in our Military Services group in 2018. 
Finally, the parent was down $0.09 per share primarily reflecting higher interest expense to support growth in the business and a $1.5 million or about $0.01 per share donation to the American Water Charitable Foundation. 
Moving to Slide 16. We have been very active on the regulatory front. The Regulated Businesses received $98 million in annualized new revenues in 2019. And this includes $45 million from rate cases and $53 million from infrastructure surcharges. We have also filed requests and are awaiting final orders on 3 rate cases and 1 infrastructure surcharge proceeding for a total annualized revenue request of $126 million. The continued successful execution of our regulatory strategy is a key element of our ability to consistently deliver results. 
Moving to Slide 17. As Susan said, we are affirming our 2020 EPS guidance range of $3.79 to $3.89 per share that we initiated in December. We are also affirming our long-term earnings compounded annual growth rate expectation on an earnings per share basis of 7% to 10% while investing capital in the range of $8.8 billion to $9.4 billion over the next 5 years. 
Moving to Slide 18. Let me summarize. We've invested capital of $1.9 billion in 2019, including $1.7 billion of regulated system improvements to better serve our customers and $235 million in closed regulated acquisitions that added over 53,000 new customer connections. These investments increased our estimated rate base at the end of 2019 to $13.7 billion, a 10.1% increase from the prior year. Our cash flow from operations held steady on a year-over-year basis from strong net income growth and the cash flow from our Market-Based Businesses. 
We continue to deliver strong consolidated results. Our total company consolidated actual return on equity was 10.6% for 2019. Regulatory execution along with strong results from our Market-Based Businesses allows us to consistently deliver on our earnings commitment. We believe that delivering on results, combined with our strong earnings growth and superior dividend expectations, continues to provide excellent value for our investors. And we continue to be a top leader in dividend growth. We have grown our dividend at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 10% or more over the last 5 years, and we expect to continue this growth at the high end of the 7% to 10% range. Also, we continue to target a dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60% of earnings. 
And with that, let me turn it back to Walter for a few additional comments."

As you all know, this is Susan Story's last earnings call with American Water, and I wanted to take this opportunity to reflect on her tenure with us. For me, it's been an absolute honor to work with Susan over the past 6 years as CEO and a year before that as CFO. She cares deeply about our people, our customers and our communities. Her commitment to do well by doing good has led to so many of our successes. 
There are too many accomplishments to name, but I will note that our commitment to the health and safety of our employees has been extraordinary. Susan always lives up to the company's strong values, especially safety. Nothing has mattered more. She cares about every single employee in our company and constantly reminds us that every employee should go home to their families in the same or better shape in which they came to work. 
We've had a 63% reduction in overall OSHA recordable injury rates and a 72% reduction in the serious injury rate since she became CEO. Our goal is to have 0 injuries, and we're working to make that a reality. 
During Susan's tenure, American Water became the first and continues to be the only water utility in the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Utility Average and the Philadelphia Utilities Index. Additionally, our 6-year total shareholder return is 230.8%. Market capitalization increased from $8.6 billion in May of 2014 to over $25 billion currently. And our dividend growth compound annual growth rate over the past 6 years is 10.2%. 
Susan has been instrumental in guiding us on our current journey as a people power culture and a customer-obsessed organization with a strong commitment to environmental leadership, water quality, operational excellence and growth. Our entire leadership team is deeply committed to the execution of our strategies and our company values. 
So Susan, on behalf of all the employees at American Water, thank you so much."

And perhaps just to turn it back to our regularly tuned program here, just if I can. I appreciate the commentary. If we can talk about PFAS in brief, and I want to break this into a couple of different pieces. First, with respect to military sites, I know you guys have been obviously very involved for a while. Does PFAS start to change the opportunity set for your existing sites? And secondly, does it change the opportunity set for incremental sites and/or accelerate those opportunities in terms of bases that may or may not be looking at opportunities, including yourself?
And then separately, coming back to PFAS, more holistically, I know EPA is looking at setting perhaps updated targets. And to what extent could either a state or, more importantly, federal level efforts -- and I know a lot of the specific states you guys operate in already have been looking at or have already instituted more specific and stringent targets. Does that change the name of the game? And I know we talked about this a few months ago at your Analyst Day, but again, even in that short brief time, it seems like the conversation has evolved."

So you're right. Let me take the first one about the military bases. Because as we know that majority of the source of PFAS are firefighting foam and many military installations through the years, of course, doing exercises and those type of things tend to have a concentration. The Department of Defense is actively working at its bases to determine if and whether they have issues. We have, as you noted, already done work on 2 of our military bases. We have been working on PFAS for well over a decade. We were able to treat it successfully. We've done so with Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey, for example. So we're working with the bases that we serve in order to help look at what do they have, and then we feel certain that we're able to treat those. 
And remember that with military bases that we can, with the newer bases, actually, every year instead of every 2 years, go in, look at the assets, look at something above and beyond what we bid on to begin with, and we have the ability to change those O&M contracts to recover those costs. So from that standpoint, we'll be working on that over the next several months to work with those bases to do that. 
The second thing about the EPA and the updated targets. So keep in mind that the EPA has 2 classifications. One is called maximum contaminant level. And there's close to 100 contaminants that they basically say, ""This is the regulation. You must meet this."" Then they have something called a health advisory that actually doesn't have the weight of required adherence to that. Believe it or not, PFAS is actually not an MCL, or maximum contaminant level. It's a health advisory. And right now, they're looking at 70 parts per trillion. So what the -- or that's what they have. What they're looking at doing is codifying that, making it an MCL so that they do have the weight of required compliance behind it. There's a lot of questions, as you said, about levels, and we're seeing the different states. New Jersey, for example, has a 13 or 14 parts per trillion based on the top of PFA it is. We're seeing New York look at it, California's looking at it, several states are. We at American water are working closely with the EPA very closely. We think it's better to have one for the entire country. We can treat to whatever level is needed. It is an expense issue as we go through there plus some capital investment in how we treat that. So it is a growing field. It is a field in which we believe we have tremendous expertise. We're an adviser to the EPA on this issue, and we will be -- as we go down this road and we look at what the finalization of these targets are, we can look at what impact that would have to our investment levels as well as what it would have to O&M."

We treat in each of our states to the health advisory level of 70 parts per trillion, unless the state has a more stringent requirement, and then we treat to that, such as California and New Jersey and New York. So that's how we address it. But as Susan said, we are working with the EPA to make sure that we put our views in there about what we think the MCL should be. And it's going to take, I think, some time for the EPA to go through their testing protocols to determine the MCL, but we're going to continue again to treat it at 70 parts per trillion or less if the state has a more stringent requirement."

I think going forward, it's part of our culture to look at every dollar in our business. And that's I think what sets us apart. If you look at the O&M efficiency improvements that we've had, every dollar that we spend, our teams are out challenging, do we need to spend that dollar, is there a benefit to our customers. And so it's that culture that I think is driving our O&M efficiency in the right way. I think we're going to continue to leverage technology. And technology has been a key enabler for us and will continue to be a key enabler going forward, making our employees more efficient, providing better service for our customers. So we're going to continue to leverage that as we move forward as well."

Today, our COO and CEO-elect, Walter Lynch, will give key updates on our operations; and our CFO, Susan Hardwick, will cover the fourth quarter and full year financial results. 
As you know, this is my last earnings call, and I'm excited to say something I've had the privilege of repeating on every earnings call since May of 2014. Yet again, American Water employees delivered strong results as we continue to grow our business and execute on our strategies. I've said many times that very few people get the opportunity and privilege of working with their heroes every day, and I do. The amazing people of American Water consistently deliver outstanding service and results, and they do so with incredibly inspiring commitment and dedication to our customers and to our communities. 
Now let me highlight just a few of our 2019 accomplishments. We continued our strong financial performance. Adjusted earnings were up 9.4% year-over-year with strong growth in both our Regulated and Market-Based businesses. We added 67,000 customer connections in our Regulated business in 2019 through both closed acquisitions and organic growth. And just over the past 7 weeks, in 2020, we have closed an additional 5,100 customer connections. Walter will cover this in detail, but we closed on a total of 21 acquisitions in 8 different states in 2019. We are proud to truly be providing solutions across the United States. We want communities to be better because we're there, and we're excited to welcome our new customers and our new employees to the American Water family. 
And in addition to these closed acquisitions, we will welcome more than 44,000 new customer connections already under agreement over the next several months. Our growth wouldn't be possible without being customer-obsessed and being the best at the fundamentals of delivering safe, reliable and affordable water and wastewater services to our customers. 
We invested about $1.9 billion in 2019, with $1.7 billion going into our existing regulated infrastructure and $235 million for regulated acquisitions. We work to be as efficient as possible in both our O&M costs and in our capital projects work and by leveraging our buying power and strategic sourcing to keep customer bills affordable. 
We continue to implement practical technology tools for our frontline employees to enhance their ability to serve our customers more effectively. And we're also working on customer interfaces that deliver a highly personalized and satisfying customer experience. 
Moving to our Market-Based businesses. Homeowner Services continued its strong performance, most recently launching a partnership with the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. This represents about 100,000 potential new customers for that business. And as you know, we were extremely honored in 2019 to be awarded the Department of Defense contracts for water and wastewater systems at both joint base San Antonio and Texas and the United States Military Academy at West Point in New York. We now provide water and wastewater services on 16 military bases across the U.S., and it is a true honor to serve the men and women who serve our country. 
We also announced in November an agreement to sell our New York American Water subsidiary to Liberty Utilities Co. And in December, we completed the sale of our Keystone operations. 
Moving to Slide 6. With our continued strong performance and our commitment to the disciplined execution of our strategies, we are affirming our 2020 EPS guidance initiated this past December of $3.79 to $3.89 per share and our long-term 5-year growth of 7% to 10%. And for the sixth year in a row, our Board of Directors approved a dividend increase that is at the high end of our long-term growth. 
We remain a regulated water utility at our core with a low-risk and predictable growth story further enhanced with a strong ESG performance record. We plan to invest $20 billion to $22 billion in capital over the next 10 years. This includes replacing pipe, pumps and plants, and it also includes investing in critical resiliency and asset-hardening projects related to climate variability. Again, this will be balanced by our continuing O&M and capital cost efficiency efforts, constructive regulatory and legislative policy and technology deployment. 
The successful execution of our strategies has enabled us to achieve a 5-year total shareholder return of 156% compared to the S&P 500's 5-year TSR of 74%. Strong financial performance is a direct outcome of our steadfast focus on and the execution of the fundamentals of our business. 
Moving to Slide 7. Let me talk just a moment about how we deliver results. It is our firm belief that companies do well by doing good. Just last month, we were named to the Global 100 Index as one of the World's 100 Most Sustainable Companies. American Water ranked 16th, fourth among only 17 total U.S. companies of any sector making the list and the only U.S.-based utility. We were also just named for the third year in a row to Barron's 100 Most Sustainable Companies as the highest ranked utility. We are extremely proud of these recognitions as they validate from external sources our deep commitment to be an ESG leader. This slide lists several of our most recent 2019 and 2020 ESG recognitions. 
We know that investors are actively searching for companies who deliver strong financial results while they also fully engage and develop employees, continually improve customer experiences, protect the planet and make communities stronger because they're there. When these things are in the fabric of your culture and you also excel at the fundamentals of your business, long-term financial sustainability follows. And this is why we are confident in our business and our growth for the future. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Walter to give a more detailed update on our Regulated business."
250885,650981022,1922824,"American Water Works Company, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 19, 2020",2020-02-19,"Earnings Calls","American Water Works Company, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Susan.

Our Regulated businesses had a strong fourth quarter with significant capital investment, strategic acquisitions and continued O&M efficiency. 
Turning to Slide 9. There was a substantial amount of progress in the regulatory front throughout 2019 and continuing into 2020. In 2019, we concluded 4 rate cases in Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginia and Maryland. In total, these 4 cases included more than $860 million of capital investment to provide reliable service for our customers. They also reflect a concerted effort in cost management, which I'll speak to you shortly. 
We have 3 pending rate cases in New Jersey, Virginia and California. In December 2019, New Jersey American Water filed a general rate case requesting an overall revenue increase of approximately $88 million, excluding the revenue from the distribution system improvement charge, or DSIC. Since our last rate case in 2018, we have or will invest more than $1 billion in system upgrades, including 95 miles of water mains, which is critical to water quality, reliability and fire protection. That level of investment also addresses New Jersey American Water's compliance with the state's Water Quality Accountability Act. 
In November 2018, Virginia American Water filed a general rate case requesting an overall revenue increase of $5.6 million driven by approximately $98 million in infrastructure upgrades since April 2017. Interim rates became effective on May 1, 2019, and we expect a decision later this year. 
Moving West. California American Water filed for new rates in July 2019. The case covers 2021 through 2023 and request an increase in authorized revenue of $46.6 million over 3 years, beginning with a $26 million increase proposed for January 1, 2021. The request seeks $197 million for infrastructure improvements planned for 2021 and 2022. We expect a decision on this case late this year with new rates to take effect on January 1, 2021. California American Water also joined a multicompany request on January 22, 2020, that requested a 1-year delay in filing a new cost of capital application and an extension of the currently authorized cost of capital. 
Turning to Slide 10. We continue to balance making critical investments to provide reliable service while limiting the impact to our customers' bills. For 2019, we've invested a total of $1.9 billion in our Regulated Operations. At the same time, we continue making progress towards our long-term O&M efficiency goal of 31.3% by 2024. 
To put this effort in perspective, our adjusted O&M expenses are just slightly higher today than they were in 2010. Since then, we've added approximately 270,000 customer connections while expenses only increased at a compound annual growth rate of 0.6%. We're extremely proud of our employees' focus and commitment to controlling costs on behalf of our customers. 
Turning to Slide 11. As Susan said, we continue to grow the size of our footprint with 21 acquisitions occurring in 8 states, adding about 53,100 new customer connections. In 2020 year-to-date, we've added approximately 5,100 new customer connections through 2 closed acquisitions with the majority coming from the Fruitridge Vista water system in California. In 2019, we were successful in continuing to expand our wastewater footprint in areas where we serve water customers. It just makes great sense to use our existing resources in areas where we already provide water services. 
This was the case last year in Alton, Illinois where we welcomed 23,000 wastewater customer connections, and in Exeter, Pennsylvania where we welcomed 9,000 wastewater customer connections. We also added 14,000 new customer connections from organic growth in 2019, and we'll welcome another 44,200 customer connections through 28 signed agreements in 9 states. 7 were signed since we last spoke at Investor Day in early December. These agreements will add about 15,000 water customer connections and about 29,000 wastewater customer connections. 
Moving to Slide 12. We continue to achieve our 1% to 2% growth of customer connections through acquisitions, which equates to about 30,000 to 60,000 new customer connections per year. As you can see, since 2015, we've completed 83 acquisitions, adding about 173,000 new customer connections in 10 states. Of those 83 acquisitions, 50 were acquisitions of water systems, adding 43,000 customers; and 33 were acquisitions of wastewater systems, adding 130,000 customers. Our customer base is now 93% water and 7% wastewater, which provides us tremendous opportunities to grow our wastewater business in areas where we already provide water service. 
We're very disciplined in our approach to acquisitions, leveraging our tremendous expertise to find solutions for communities. We now have about 695,000 customer opportunities in our pipeline, up from about 650,000 customer opportunities in our last update at Investor Day. This consistent growth in our pipeline is bolstered by key regulatory mechanisms and legislative enablers. We work constructively with regulators and legislators in the states where we operate to receive these key mechanisms and enablers. 
We now have fair market value in 8 of our states, consolidated tariffs in 12 of our states and water quality accountability legislation in 2 of our states with other states within our footprint considering similar legislation. 
We're a purpose-driven company, and every one of our employees plays a role in supporting our disciplined growth strategy. For us, it's about providing meaningful water and wastewater solutions to communities and welcoming these new employees into our company culture of purpose and safety. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Susan Hardwick for more detail on our financial performance."

Fourth quarter 2019 consolidated GAAP earnings were $0.54 per share compared to $0.62 per share in 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2019, GAAP earnings were adjusted for the December sale of our Keystone operations and 2018 GAAP earnings were adjusted for the remeasurement of deferred taxes resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Excluding these adjustments, adjusted earnings per share were up $0.04 per share driven primarily by growth in the Regulated business. 
The Regulated business segment results were up $0.13 per share or an increase of 18.3% compared to 2018 earnings. The Market-Based businesses results were up $0.03 per share, and the parent company decreased $0.12 per share compared to 2018 primarily reflecting higher interest expense to support growth in the business. And for the year, our 2019 adjusted earnings were $3.61 per share or a 9.4% increase over the same period last year. 
Our Regulated Businesses increased $0.28 per share. Our Market-Based Businesses increased $0.12 per share primarily from Homeowner Services. And finally, the parent results decreased by $0.09 per share year-over-year driven by higher interest expense, which was partially offset by the sale of the legacy investment that occurred in the second quarter of 2019. 
Moving on to Slide 15. Let me walk through a bit more detail of the 2019 results by business. As I mentioned, Regulated Operations were up $0.28 per share in total. We had a $0.49 per share increase from additional authorized revenue and surcharges to support infrastructure investments, acquisitions and organic growth. Offsetting the revenue increase, the second quarter of 2019, which was the wettest on record, had a $0.04 per share unfavorable impact from weather. Also, O&M expense increased $0.03 per share and depreciation and interest increased $0.14 per share, both to support regulated acquisitions and other growth. 
The Market-Based Businesses reported strong results in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily driven by organic growth of the Homeowner Services group and from the addition of the 2 contracts in our Military Services group in 2018. 
Finally, the parent was down $0.09 per share primarily reflecting higher interest expense to support growth in the business and a $1.5 million or about $0.01 per share donation to the American Water Charitable Foundation. 
Moving to Slide 16. We have been very active on the regulatory front. The Regulated Businesses received $98 million in annualized new revenues in 2019. And this includes $45 million from rate cases and $53 million from infrastructure surcharges. We have also filed requests and are awaiting final orders on 3 rate cases and 1 infrastructure surcharge proceeding for a total annualized revenue request of $126 million. The continued successful execution of our regulatory strategy is a key element of our ability to consistently deliver results. 
Moving to Slide 17. As Susan said, we are affirming our 2020 EPS guidance range of $3.79 to $3.89 per share that we initiated in December. We are also affirming our long-term earnings compounded annual growth rate expectation on an earnings per share basis of 7% to 10% while investing capital in the range of $8.8 billion to $9.4 billion over the next 5 years. 
Moving to Slide 18. Let me summarize. We've invested capital of $1.9 billion in 2019, including $1.7 billion of regulated system improvements to better serve our customers and $235 million in closed regulated acquisitions that added over 53,000 new customer connections. These investments increased our estimated rate base at the end of 2019 to $13.7 billion, a 10.1% increase from the prior year. Our cash flow from operations held steady on a year-over-year basis from strong net income growth and the cash flow from our Market-Based Businesses. 
We continue to deliver strong consolidated results. Our total company consolidated actual return on equity was 10.6% for 2019. Regulatory execution along with strong results from our Market-Based Businesses allows us to consistently deliver on our earnings commitment. We believe that delivering on results, combined with our strong earnings growth and superior dividend expectations, continues to provide excellent value for our investors. And we continue to be a top leader in dividend growth. We have grown our dividend at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 10% or more over the last 5 years, and we expect to continue this growth at the high end of the 7% to 10% range. Also, we continue to target a dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60% of earnings. 
And with that, let me turn it back to Walter for a few additional comments."

As you all know, this is Susan Story's last earnings call with American Water, and I wanted to take this opportunity to reflect on her tenure with us. For me, it's been an absolute honor to work with Susan over the past 6 years as CEO and a year before that as CFO. She cares deeply about our people, our customers and our communities. Her commitment to do well by doing good has led to so many of our successes. 
There are too many accomplishments to name, but I will note that our commitment to the health and safety of our employees has been extraordinary. Susan always lives up to the company's strong values, especially safety. Nothing has mattered more. She cares about every single employee in our company and constantly reminds us that every employee should go home to their families in the same or better shape in which they came to work. 
We've had a 63% reduction in overall OSHA recordable injury rates and a 72% reduction in the serious injury rate since she became CEO. Our goal is to have 0 injuries, and we're working to make that a reality. 
During Susan's tenure, American Water became the first and continues to be the only water utility in the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Utility Average and the Philadelphia Utilities Index. Additionally, our 6-year total shareholder return is 230.8%. Market capitalization increased from $8.6 billion in May of 2014 to over $25 billion currently. And our dividend growth compound annual growth rate over the past 6 years is 10.2%. 
Susan has been instrumental in guiding us on our current journey as a people power culture and a customer-obsessed organization with a strong commitment to environmental leadership, water quality, operational excellence and growth. Our entire leadership team is deeply committed to the execution of our strategies and our company values. 
So Susan, on behalf of all the employees at American Water, thank you so much."

Walter has been a critical key leader for this company for almost 2 decades, and his experience and steady hand will successfully guide this company into the coming years. And I'm also thankful I've had the opportunity to work with 2 of the best CFOs in the entire utility industry. First, Linda Sullivan and now Susan Hardwick.

And perhaps just to turn it back to our regularly tuned program here, just if I can. I appreciate the commentary. If we can talk about PFAS in brief, and I want to break this into a couple of different pieces. First, with respect to military sites, I know you guys have been obviously very involved for a while. Does PFAS start to change the opportunity set for your existing sites? And secondly, does it change the opportunity set for incremental sites and/or accelerate those opportunities in terms of bases that may or may not be looking at opportunities, including yourself?
And then separately, coming back to PFAS, more holistically, I know EPA is looking at setting perhaps updated targets. And to what extent could either a state or, more importantly, federal level efforts -- and I know a lot of the specific states you guys operate in already have been looking at or have already instituted more specific and stringent targets. Does that change the name of the game? And I know we talked about this a few months ago at your Analyst Day, but again, even in that short brief time, it seems like the conversation has evolved."
250885,650981022,1922824,"American Water Works Company, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 19, 2020",2020-02-19,"Earnings Calls","American Water Works Company, Inc.","Executives","Julien, that's a great question. And I will start and then Walter can pick up after this. So you're right. Let me take the first one about the military bases.

So you're right. Let me take the first one about the military bases. Because as we know that majority of the source of PFAS are firefighting foam and many military installations through the years, of course, doing exercises and those type of things tend to have a concentration. The Department of Defense is actively working at its bases to determine if and whether they have issues. We have, as you noted, already done work on 2 of our military bases. We have been working on PFAS for well over a decade. We were able to treat it successfully. We've done so with Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey, for example. So we're working with the bases that we serve in order to help look at what do they have, and then we feel certain that we're able to treat those. 
And remember that with military bases that we can, with the newer bases, actually, every year instead of every 2 years, go in, look at the assets, look at something above and beyond what we bid on to begin with, and we have the ability to change those O&M contracts to recover those costs. So from that standpoint, we'll be working on that over the next several months to work with those bases to do that. 
The second thing about the EPA and the updated targets. So keep in mind that the EPA has 2 classifications. One is called maximum contaminant level. And there's close to 100 contaminants that they basically say, ""This is the regulation. You must meet this."" Then they have something called a health advisory that actually doesn't have the weight of required adherence to that. Believe it or not, PFAS is actually not an MCL, or maximum contaminant level. It's a health advisory. And right now, they're looking at 70 parts per trillion. So what the -- or that's what they have. What they're looking at doing is codifying that, making it an MCL so that they do have the weight of required compliance behind it. There's a lot of questions, as you said, about levels, and we're seeing the different states. New Jersey, for example, has a 13 or 14 parts per trillion based on the top of PFA it is. We're seeing New York look at it, California's looking at it, several states are. We at American water are working closely with the EPA very closely. We think it's better to have one for the entire country. We can treat to whatever level is needed. It is an expense issue as we go through there plus some capital investment in how we treat that. So it is a growing field. It is a field in which we believe we have tremendous expertise. We're an adviser to the EPA on this issue, and we will be -- as we go down this road and we look at what the finalization of these targets are, we can look at what impact that would have to our investment levels as well as what it would have to O&M."

We treat in each of our states to the health advisory level of 70 parts per trillion, unless the state has a more stringent requirement, and then we treat to that, such as California and New Jersey and New York. So that's how we address it. But as Susan said, we are working with the EPA to make sure that we put our views in there about what we think the MCL should be. And it's going to take, I think, some time for the EPA to go through their testing protocols to determine the MCL, but we're going to continue again to treat it at 70 parts per trillion or less if the state has a more stringent requirement."

Today, our COO and CEO-elect, Walter Lynch, will give key updates on our operations; and our CFO, Susan Hardwick, will cover the fourth quarter and full year financial results. 
As you know, this is my last earnings call, and I'm excited to say something I've had the privilege of repeating on every earnings call since May of 2014. Yet again, American Water employees delivered strong results as we continue to grow our business and execute on our strategies. I've said many times that very few people get the opportunity and privilege of working with their heroes every day, and I do. The amazing people of American Water consistently deliver outstanding service and results, and they do so with incredibly inspiring commitment and dedication to our customers and to our communities. 
Now let me highlight just a few of our 2019 accomplishments. We continued our strong financial performance. Adjusted earnings were up 9.4% year-over-year with strong growth in both our Regulated and Market-Based businesses. We added 67,000 customer connections in our Regulated business in 2019 through both closed acquisitions and organic growth. And just over the past 7 weeks, in 2020, we have closed an additional 5,100 customer connections. Walter will cover this in detail, but we closed on a total of 21 acquisitions in 8 different states in 2019. We are proud to truly be providing solutions across the United States. We want communities to be better because we're there, and we're excited to welcome our new customers and our new employees to the American Water family. 
And in addition to these closed acquisitions, we will welcome more than 44,000 new customer connections already under agreement over the next several months. Our growth wouldn't be possible without being customer-obsessed and being the best at the fundamentals of delivering safe, reliable and affordable water and wastewater services to our customers. 
We invested about $1.9 billion in 2019, with $1.7 billion going into our existing regulated infrastructure and $235 million for regulated acquisitions. We work to be as efficient as possible in both our O&M costs and in our capital projects work and by leveraging our buying power and strategic sourcing to keep customer bills affordable. 
We continue to implement practical technology tools for our frontline employees to enhance their ability to serve our customers more effectively. And we're also working on customer interfaces that deliver a highly personalized and satisfying customer experience. 
Moving to our Market-Based businesses. Homeowner Services continued its strong performance, most recently launching a partnership with the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. This represents about 100,000 potential new customers for that business. And as you know, we were extremely honored in 2019 to be awarded the Department of Defense contracts for water and wastewater systems at both joint base San Antonio and Texas and the United States Military Academy at West Point in New York. We now provide water and wastewater services on 16 military bases across the U.S., and it is a true honor to serve the men and women who serve our country. 
We also announced in November an agreement to sell our New York American Water subsidiary to Liberty Utilities Co. And in December, we completed the sale of our Keystone operations. 
Moving to Slide 6. With our continued strong performance and our commitment to the disciplined execution of our strategies, we are affirming our 2020 EPS guidance initiated this past December of $3.79 to $3.89 per share and our long-term 5-year growth of 7% to 10%. And for the sixth year in a row, our Board of Directors approved a dividend increase that is at the high end of our long-term growth. 
We remain a regulated water utility at our core with a low-risk and predictable growth story further enhanced with a strong ESG performance record. We plan to invest $20 billion to $22 billion in capital over the next 10 years. This includes replacing pipe, pumps and plants, and it also includes investing in critical resiliency and asset-hardening projects related to climate variability. Again, this will be balanced by our continuing O&M and capital cost efficiency efforts, constructive regulatory and legislative policy and technology deployment. 
The successful execution of our strategies has enabled us to achieve a 5-year total shareholder return of 156% compared to the S&P 500's 5-year TSR of 74%. Strong financial performance is a direct outcome of our steadfast focus on and the execution of the fundamentals of our business. 
Moving to Slide 7. Let me talk just a moment about how we deliver results. It is our firm belief that companies do well by doing good. Just last month, we were named to the Global 100 Index as one of the World's 100 Most Sustainable Companies. American Water ranked 16th, fourth among only 17 total U.S. companies of any sector making the list and the only U.S.-based utility. We were also just named for the third year in a row to Barron's 100 Most Sustainable Companies as the highest ranked utility. We are extremely proud of these recognitions as they validate from external sources our deep commitment to be an ESG leader. This slide lists several of our most recent 2019 and 2020 ESG recognitions. 
We know that investors are actively searching for companies who deliver strong financial results while they also fully engage and develop employees, continually improve customer experiences, protect the planet and make communities stronger because they're there. When these things are in the fabric of your culture and you also excel at the fundamentals of your business, long-term financial sustainability follows. And this is why we are confident in our business and our growth for the future. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Walter to give a more detailed update on our Regulated business."

Good morning, everyone. Our Regulated businesses had a strong fourth quarter with significant capital investment, strategic acquisitions and continued O&M efficiency. Turning to Slide 9.

Our Regulated businesses had a strong fourth quarter with significant capital investment, strategic acquisitions and continued O&M efficiency. 
Turning to Slide 9. There was a substantial amount of progress in the regulatory front throughout 2019 and continuing into 2020. In 2019, we concluded 4 rate cases in Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginia and Maryland. In total, these 4 cases included more than $860 million of capital investment to provide reliable service for our customers. They also reflect a concerted effort in cost management, which I'll speak to you shortly. 
We have 3 pending rate cases in New Jersey, Virginia and California. In December 2019, New Jersey American Water filed a general rate case requesting an overall revenue increase of approximately $88 million, excluding the revenue from the distribution system improvement charge, or DSIC. Since our last rate case in 2018, we have or will invest more than $1 billion in system upgrades, including 95 miles of water mains, which is critical to water quality, reliability and fire protection. That level of investment also addresses New Jersey American Water's compliance with the state's Water Quality Accountability Act. 
In November 2018, Virginia American Water filed a general rate case requesting an overall revenue increase of $5.6 million driven by approximately $98 million in infrastructure upgrades since April 2017. Interim rates became effective on May 1, 2019, and we expect a decision later this year. 
Moving West. California American Water filed for new rates in July 2019. The case covers 2021 through 2023 and request an increase in authorized revenue of $46.6 million over 3 years, beginning with a $26 million increase proposed for January 1, 2021. The request seeks $197 million for infrastructure improvements planned for 2021 and 2022. We expect a decision on this case late this year with new rates to take effect on January 1, 2021. California American Water also joined a multicompany request on January 22, 2020, that requested a 1-year delay in filing a new cost of capital application and an extension of the currently authorized cost of capital. 
Turning to Slide 10. We continue to balance making critical investments to provide reliable service while limiting the impact to our customers' bills. For 2019, we've invested a total of $1.9 billion in our Regulated Operations. At the same time, we continue making progress towards our long-term O&M efficiency goal of 31.3% by 2024. 
To put this effort in perspective, our adjusted O&M expenses are just slightly higher today than they were in 2010. Since then, we've added approximately 270,000 customer connections while expenses only increased at a compound annual growth rate of 0.6%. We're extremely proud of our employees' focus and commitment to controlling costs on behalf of our customers. 
Turning to Slide 11. As Susan said, we continue to grow the size of our footprint with 21 acquisitions occurring in 8 states, adding about 53,100 new customer connections. In 2020 year-to-date, we've added approximately 5,100 new customer connections through 2 closed acquisitions with the majority coming from the Fruitridge Vista water system in California. In 2019, we were successful in continuing to expand our wastewater footprint in areas where we serve water customers. It just makes great sense to use our existing resources in areas where we already provide water services. 
This was the case last year in Alton, Illinois where we welcomed 23,000 wastewater customer connections, and in Exeter, Pennsylvania where we welcomed 9,000 wastewater customer connections. We also added 14,000 new customer connections from organic growth in 2019, and we'll welcome another 44,200 customer connections through 28 signed agreements in 9 states. 7 were signed since we last spoke at Investor Day in early December. These agreements will add about 15,000 water customer connections and about 29,000 wastewater customer connections. 
Moving to Slide 12. We continue to achieve our 1% to 2% growth of customer connections through acquisitions, which equates to about 30,000 to 60,000 new customer connections per year. As you can see, since 2015, we've completed 83 acquisitions, adding about 173,000 new customer connections in 10 states. Of those 83 acquisitions, 50 were acquisitions of water systems, adding 43,000 customers; and 33 were acquisitions of wastewater systems, adding 130,000 customers. Our customer base is now 93% water and 7% wastewater, which provides us tremendous opportunities to grow our wastewater business in areas where we already provide water service. 
We're very disciplined in our approach to acquisitions, leveraging our tremendous expertise to find solutions for communities. We now have about 695,000 customer opportunities in our pipeline, up from about 650,000 customer opportunities in our last update at Investor Day. This consistent growth in our pipeline is bolstered by key regulatory mechanisms and legislative enablers. We work constructively with regulators and legislators in the states where we operate to receive these key mechanisms and enablers. 
We now have fair market value in 8 of our states, consolidated tariffs in 12 of our states and water quality accountability legislation in 2 of our states with other states within our footprint considering similar legislation. 
We're a purpose-driven company, and every one of our employees plays a role in supporting our disciplined growth strategy. For us, it's about providing meaningful water and wastewater solutions to communities and welcoming these new employees into our company culture of purpose and safety. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Susan Hardwick for more detail on our financial performance."

Let me start on Slide 14 with a summary of our results. Fourth quarter 2019 consolidated GAAP earnings were $0.54 per share compared to $0.62 per share in 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2019, GAAP earnings we",768,"Thank you, Walter, and good morning, everyone. Let me start on Slide 14 with a summary of our results. Fourth quarter 2019 consolidated GAAP earnings were $0.54 per share compared to $0.62 per share in 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2019, GAAP earnings were adjusted for the December sale of our Keystone operations and 2018 GAAP earnings were adjusted for the remeasurement of deferred taxes resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Excluding these adjustments, adjusted earnings per share were up $0.04 per share driven primarily by growth in the Regulated business. 
The Regulated business segment results were up $0.13 per share or an increase of 18.3% compared to 2018 earnings. The Market-Based businesses results were up $0.03 per share, and the parent company decreased $0.12 per share compared to 2018 primarily reflecting higher interest expense to support growth in the business. And for the year, our 2019 adjusted earnings were $3.61 per share or a 9.4% increase over the same period last year. 
Our Regulated Businesses increased $0.28 per share. Our Market-Based Businesses increased $0.12 per share primarily from Homeowner Services. And finally, the parent results decreased by $0.09 per share year-over-year driven by higher interest expense, which was partially offset by the sale of the legacy investment that occurred in the second quarter of 2019. 
Moving on to Slide 15. Let me walk through a bit more detail of the 2019 results by business. As I mentioned, Regulated Operations were up $0.28 per share in total. We had a $0.49 per share increase from additional authorized revenue and surcharges to support infrastructure investments, acquisitions and organic growth. Offsetting the revenue increase, the second quarter of 2019, which was the wettest on record, had a $0.04 per share unfavorable impact from weather. Also, O&M expense increased $0.03 per share and depreciation and interest increased $0.14 per share, both to support regulated acquisitions and other growth. 
The Market-Based Businesses reported strong results in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily driven by organic growth of the Homeowner Services group and from the addition of the 2 contracts in our Military Services group in 2018. 
Finally, the parent was down $0.09 per share primarily reflecting higher interest expense to support growth in the business and a $1.5 million or about $0.01 per share donation to the American Water Charitable Foundation. 
Moving to Slide 16. We have been very active on the regulatory front. The Regulated Businesses received $98 million in annualized new revenues in 2019. And this includes $45 million from rate cases and $53 million from infrastructure surcharges. We have also filed requests and are awaiting final orders on 3 rate cases and 1 infrastructure surcharge proceeding for a total annualized revenue request of $126 million. The continued successful execution of our regulatory strategy is a key element of our ability to consistently deliver results. 
Moving to Slide 17. As Susan said, we are affirming our 2020 EPS guidance range of $3.79 to $3.89 per share that we initiated in December. We are also affirming our long-term earnings compounded annual growth rate expectation on an earnings per share basis of 7% to 10% while investing capital in the range of $8.8 billion to $9.4 billion over the next 5 years. 
Moving to Slide 18. Let me summarize. We've invested capital of $1.9 billion in 2019, including $1.7 billion of regulated system improvements to better serve our customers and $235 million in closed regulated acquisitions that added over 53,000 new customer connections. These investments increased our estimated rate base at the end of 2019 to $13.7 billion, a 10.1% increase from the prior year. Our cash flow from operations held steady on a year-over-year basis from strong net income growth and the cash flow from our Market-Based Businesses. 
We continue to deliver strong consolidated results. Our total company consolidated actual return on equity was 10.6% for 2019. Regulatory execution along with strong results from our Market-Based Businesses allows us to consistently deliver on our earnings commitment. We believe that delivering on results, combined with our strong earnings growth and superior dividend expectations, continues to provide excellent value for our investors. And we continue to be a top leader in dividend growth. We have grown our dividend at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 10% or more over the last 5 years, and we expect to continue this growth at the high end of the 7% to 10% range. Also, we continue to target a dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60% of earnings. 
And with that, let me turn it back to Walter for a few additional comments."

Her commitment to do well by doing good has led to so many of our successes. 
There are too many accomplishments to name, but I will note that our commitment to the health and safety of our employees has been extraordinary. Susan always lives up to the company's strong values, especially safety. Nothing has mattered more. She cares about every single employee in our company and constantly reminds us that every employee should go home to their families in the same or better shape in which they came to work. 
We've had a 63% reduction in overall OSHA recordable injury rates and a 72% reduction in the serious injury rate since she became CEO. Our goal is to have 0 injuries, and we're working to make that a reality. 
During Susan's tenure, American Water became the first and continues to be the only water utility in the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Utility Average and the Philadelphia Utilities Index. Additionally, our 6-year total shareholder return is 230.8%. Market capitalization increased from $8.6 billion in May of 2014 to over $25 billion currently. And our dividend growth compound annual growth rate over the past 6 years is 10.2%. 
Susan has been instrumental in guiding us on our current journey as a people power culture and a customer-obsessed organization with a strong commitment to environmental leadership, water quality, operational excellence and growth. Our entire leadership team is deeply committed to the execution of our strategies and our company values.

And I'm also thankful I've had the opportunity to work with 2 of the best CFOs in the entire utility industry. First, Linda Sullivan and now Susan Hardwick. And to top it off, you have Institutional Investor magazine's Sell-side Analyst Choice for the Best RRVP in Utilities, Ed Vallejo, and his entire team providing continuing expertise to ensure that you and your clients get the information you need to make your best decisions, which we think is us, of course. 
So thanks to all of you for everything. And with that, we're happy to take your questions."

And perhaps just to turn it back to our regularly tuned program here, just if I can. I appreciate the commentary. If we can talk about PFAS in brief, and I want to break this into a couple of different pieces. First, with respect to military sites, I know you guys have been obviously very involved for a while. Does PFAS start to change the opportunity set for your existing sites? And secondly, does it change the opportunity set for incremental sites and/or accelerate those opportunities in terms of bases that may or may not be looking at opportunities, including yourself?
And then separately, coming back to PFAS, more holistically, I know EPA is looking at setting perhaps updated targets. And to what extent could either a state or, more importantly, federal level efforts -- and I know a lot of the specific states you guys operate in already have been looking at or have already instituted more specific and stringent targets. Does that change the name of the game? And I know we talked about this a few months ago at your Analyst Day, but again, even in that short brief time, it seems like the conversation has evolved."

So you're right. Let me take the first one about the military bases. Because as we know that majority of the source of PFAS are firefighting foam and many military installations through the years, of course, doing exercises and those type of things tend to have a concentration. The Department of Defense is actively working at its bases to determine if and whether they have issues. We have, as you noted, already done work on 2 of our military bases. We have been working on PFAS for well over a decade. We were able to treat it successfully. We've done so with Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey, for example. So we're working with the bases that we serve in order to help look at what do they have, and then we feel certain that we're able to treat those. 
And remember that with military bases that we can, with the newer bases, actually, every year instead of every 2 years, go in, look at the assets, look at something above and beyond what we bid on to begin with, and we have the ability to change those O&M contracts to recover those costs. So from that standpoint, we'll be working on that over the next several months to work with those bases to do that. 
The second thing about the EPA and the updated targets. So keep in mind that the EPA has 2 classifications. One is called maximum contaminant level. And there's close to 100 contaminants that they basically say, ""This is the regulation. You must meet this."" Then they have something called a health advisory that actually doesn't have the weight of required adherence to that. Believe it or not, PFAS is actually not an MCL, or maximum contaminant level. It's a health advisory. And right now, they're looking at 70 parts per trillion. So what the -- or that's what they have. What they're looking at doing is codifying that, making it an MCL so that they do have the weight of required compliance behind it. There's a lot of questions, as you said, about levels, and we're seeing the different states. New Jersey, for example, has a 13 or 14 parts per trillion based on the top of PFA it is. We're seeing New York look at it, California's looking at it, several states are. We at American water are working closely with the EPA very closely. We think it's better to have one for the entire country. We can treat to whatever level is needed. It is an expense issue as we go through there plus some capital investment in how we treat that. So it is a growing field. It is a field in which we believe we have tremendous expertise. We're an adviser to the EPA on this issue, and we will be -- as we go down this road and we look at what the finalization of these targets are, we can look at what impact that would have to our investment levels as well as what it would have to O&M."

We treat in each of our states to the health advisory level of 70 parts per trillion, unless the state has a more stringent requirement, and then we treat to that, such as California and New Jersey and New York. So that's how we address it. But as Susan said, we are working with the EPA to make sure that we put our views in there about what we think the MCL should be. And it's going to take, I think, some time for the EPA to go through their testing protocols to determine the MCL, but we're going to continue again to treat it at 70 parts per trillion or less if the state has a more stringent requirement."

Today, I'll start by giving you a brief update on our COVID-19 response and then provide key updates on our business. Susan Hardwick, our CFO, will cover the first quarter financial results and provide a few additional comments related to the implications of COVID-19. 
As you know, American Water provides clean, safe, reliable water and wastewater services and has continued to do so throughout this pandemic. American Water has established clear priorities across our organization focused in 3 areas. The first is the care and safety of our employees and their families. The second is the safety of our customers and the communities we serve. And the third area of focus is the execution of our preparedness plans, so we can continue to provide essential services and help our communities get through this crisis. 
Let me give some examples of the measures we've implemented. Because safety is our top priority, we've implemented a required work-from-home policy where possible as well as social distancing and other enhanced safety measures for employees and customers. For example, we've suspended all nonemergency and home appointments and limited the amount and nature of contact with customers during field appointments. We've also worked hand in hand with labor across the business and supported our employees with paid leave for COVID-19 diagnosis, quarantine and child care. 
We suspended building-related service shutoffs, suspended late fees and [have restarted] service to customers who were previously shut off for nonpayment. We're also working with customers who are experiencing financial hardships by offering customer assistance programs and access to low-income programs. Susan will cover this a bit more later but we've implemented actions to strengthen our liquidity and ensure access to capital. 
We also continue to execute on our core strategies such as needed capital investment. We increased communications with public service commissions, customers and public officials. As the COVID-19 impact continues to be assessed, American Water will work constructively with public service commissions. They look to address utility response measures, customer protection and cost recovery for all regulated utilities in their jurisdictions. 
Finally, we provided a $500,000 donation to the American Water Charitable Foundation to help fund COVID-19 relief efforts across the United States. This was in addition to a $100,000 donation made to Feed America to help support food banks. 
We understand we have a very important role during this crisis. We provide water and wastewater services for hygiene, hospitals, sanitation and fire protection. We thank all our employees for continuing to provide these essential services.
Moving on to first quarter results. The employees of American Water delivered solid results and further strengthened our low-risk profile and predictable growth story. Our first quarter 2020 adjusted earnings per share increased 9.8% compared to first quarter 2019. We invested capital of $457 million in the first quarter of 2020, which is a 36% increase over the same period last year. This increase is driven by the continued investment in our systems and the communities we serve along with more favorable construction weather this year versus last. 
As you know, we work hard to minimize the customer bill impacts of these investments through a continued focus on controlling O&M costs. I'll talk more in a moment about our regulated operations, our continuing progress on regulated acquisitions and their contributions to our long-term growth story. 
Our Market-Based Businesses were up $0.01 in earnings per share. This was due primarily to growth in customer contracts from Homeowner Services. As a reminder, in the third quarter of 2019, our Military Services Group was awarded 2 military contracts: Joint Base San Antonio in Texas and the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. We're on track to assume operations by the second quarter of 2020. 
Moving to Slide 7. The foundation of our earnings growth continues to be the capital investment we make in our regulated operations to provide clean, safe and reliable service to our customers. We believe that long-term financial success depends on effectively executing the fundamentals of our business every day. We plan to invest $20 billion to $22 billion in capital over the next 10 years to ensure the quality and reliability of our services and to bring water and wastewater solutions to communities across the country. 
We're affirming our long-term EPS compound annual growth rate in the 7% to 10% range. We also expect our 2020 adjusted earnings to be in the range of $3.79 to $3.89 per share. This is the same range we communicated in February, which should have been identified as an adjusted EPS range. Our GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $3.85 to $3.95 per share. In her comments, Susan will provide additional information about the difference between our GAAP and adjusted guidance ranges. 
Also consistent with our previous dividend guidance, on April 29, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend payment from $0.50 per share to $0.55 per share, a 10% increase. We understand that a secure and growing dividend is important to our shareholders, while striking the right balance with continued investment in our regulated operations.
Turning to Slide 8. Let's walk through some of the regulatory highlights of the first quarter of 2020. Pennsylvania American Water filed a general rate case last week, requesting $92 million in the first year and $46 million in the second year. Since our last case in 2017, Pennsylvania American Water will have invested $1.64 billion in infrastructure upgrades for the 4-year period of 2019 through 2022, including replacing more than 427 miles of aging water and [SOAR] pipes. The case also includes enhancements to our customer assistance program. Traditionally, the Public Utility Commission's review of the filing may take up to 9 months and new rates would not be effective until 2021. 
Also in Pennsylvania, the Public Utility Commission approved the company's revision to its wastewater DSIC. This action allows the DSIC to be applied to another 50,000 wastewater customers effective May 1. 
We also have 3 pending rate cases in New Jersey, Virginia and California. New Jersey American Water filed a general rate case in December 2019 requesting an overall revenue increase of approximately $88 million excluding the revenue from DSIC. Since our last rate case, we've invested more than $1 billion in system upgrades. 
Virginia American Water filed a general rate case requesting an overall revenue increase of $5.6 million in November 2018. This case was driven by approximately $98 million in infrastructure upgrades since April 2017. Interim rates became effective on May 1, 2019, and we expect a decision later this year. 
Moving west, California American Water filed for new rates in July 2019. The case covers 2021 through 2023 and requests an increase in authorized revenue of $46.6 million over 3 years. The request seeks $197 million for infrastructure improvements planned for 2021 and 2022. Due to COVID-19, the evidentiary hearings were moved from April and May to early June with final hearing dates expected in late August. We now expect a decision on this case as early as first quarter of 2021. In addition, we filed a motion for interim rates to be effective back to January 1, 2021. 
On the legislative front, during the quarter, Indiana Governor Holcom signed 2 bills. The first one authorizes recovery for above-ground infrastructure without a full rate case. And the second establishes an appraisal process for nonmunicipal utilities to establish fair value and a reasonable purchase price. 
In West Virginia, Governor Justice has signed the water and Wastewater Investment and Infrastructure Improvement Act. Effective June 5, this legislation creates a voluntary process to use fair value assessments to determine the value of the water or wastewater systems, enables combined water and wastewater ratemaking, and expands how municipalities can use the proceeds they receive from selling utility assets to better address needs in their communities. 
Finally in Virginia, Governor Northam signed fair market value legislation, which will go into effect on July 1. This is now the ninth state that has adopted fair market value legislation across our footprint. 
All this legislation is focused to helping communities and utilities address water and wastewater challenges.
Moving on Slide 9. Customers remain at the center of every decision we make today and into the future. This means smart investments balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. As I mentioned earlier, in the first quarter, we invested $457 million with at in our Regulated Businesses, including $432 million in infrastructure investment and $21 million in regulated acquisitions. 
As we make these critical investments to maintain reliable service, we must also ensure affordability for our customers. We'll continue to focus on O&M efficiency and work toward our O&M efficiency goal of 31.3% by 2024. For the 12-month period ended March 31, 2020, our O&M efficiency ratio improved to 34.5% compared to 35.5% for the 12-month period ended March 31, 2019. 
Now to put this into perspective, our adjusted O&M expenses are just slightly higher today than they were in 2010. Since then, we've added approximately 276,000 customer connections while expenses only increased at a compound annual growth rate of 0.7%. We're very proud of our employees' focus and commitment to controlling costs on behalf of our customers, especially given the current situation and economic challenges some of our customers are now facing.
Moving on to Slide 10. We believe our commitment to putting customers first is a key to growing our regulated footprint. So far in 2020, we've closed on 5 acquisitions in 4 different states, adding about 6,200 new customer connections. We've also added more than 3,200 customer connections through organic growth in the first quarter. We look forward to adding another 45,800 customer connections through currently signed agreements in 8 states, most of which we expect to close this year in 2020. These new agreements reflect our commitment to provide water and wastewater solutions to communities across our footprint. 
And with that, let me now turn it over to Susan."
250885,661837677,1975430,"American Water Works Company, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 07, 2020",2020-05-07,"Earnings Calls","American Water Works Company, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Walter, and good morning, everyone. Let me first start on Slide 12 with a bit more detail on results for the quarter. First quarter 2020 consolidated GAAP earnings were $0.68 per share compared to $0.62 per share in 2019. In the first quarter o",1595,"Thank you, Walter, and good morning, everyone. Let me first start on Slide 12 with a bit more detail on results for the quarter. First quarter 2020 consolidated GAAP earnings were $0.68 per share compared to $0.62 per share in 2019. In the first quarter of 2020, GAAP earnings were adjusted for depreciation expense that would have been recorded in the quarter related to the New York subsidiary assets having not been classified for accounting purposes as assets held for sale. [Although] 2019 GAAP earnings were adjusted for a reduction in the settlement liability related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill. Excluding these 2 adjustments, earnings per share as adjusted increased $0.06 per share or 9.8% driven primarily by growth in the regulated business. 
The regulated business segment results increased $0.08 per share or an increase of 13.6% compared to 2019 earnings. The market-based business results increased $0.01 per share. And the parent company decreased $0.03 per share compared to 2019 primarily reflecting higher interest expense to support growth in the business.
Moving on Slide 13. Regulated operations increased $0.08 per share in total. We saw a $0.14 per share increase from additional authorized revenue and surcharges to support infrastructure investment, acquisition and organic growth. 
O&M expense increased $0.06 per share and depreciation increased $0.03 per share, both to support regulated acquisitions and growth. Also, results reflect a $0.03 per share benefit primarily related to lower pension expense from a higher assumed return on assets used to set expense for 2020. 
The Market-Based Businesses first quarter result increased compared to 2019 primarily by the Homeowner Services Group's organic growth and contract price increases. Also, as Walter already mentioned, we expect Joint Base San Antonio and the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York to resume operations by the second quarter of 2020. 
And finally, the parent results decreased $0.03 per share primarily reflecting higher interest expense to support growth in the regulated business.
Moving on to Slide 14. The Regulated Businesses received $53 million in annualized new revenue in 2020. This includes $18 million from step increases and $35 million from infrastructure surcharges. We have also filed requests and are awaiting final orders on 4 rate cases and 3 infrastructure surcharge proceedings for a total annualized revenue request of $224 million. The continued successful execution of our regulatory strategy is a key element of our ability to consistently deliver on these financial results. 
And before I wrap up on Slide 15, let me add a few additional thoughts related to the expected implications of COVID-19. First, as it relates to demand for our services, American Water has a predominantly residential customer base. Residential revenues including [volt] sales are about 69%. Commercial is 21% mostly in the food and beverage sector. And industrial is only 4% of our total revenue. Our very early indications are that our residential load is higher, and our commercial and industrial loads are trending down as business close -- businesses closed and certain other slowdowns occur. 
Disconnections and late fees have been suspended and disconnection notices have stopped as Walter mentioned earlier. We have also reconnected customers previously disconnected for nonpayment and suspended reconnection fees. This is critical to our customers as they work through the difficult situation, and we currently don't expect the impact of this temporary measure to be material. It's too early to tell how customers' overall ability to pay will be impacted by COVID-19, so estimating uncollectible accounts exposure to this risk is not yet possible. 
As is evidenced by regulatory actions across the country to date, we expect issues like this will be addressed timely and certainly in future rate cases at the very least. We will work quickly with regulators in our jurisdictions on how the cost of this pandemic will be treated for recovery purposes. 
As Walter mentioned, we invested capital of $457 million in the first quarter of 2020 to better serve our customers. At this point, we believe our regularly scheduled capital products will continue as planned, perhaps with some slowdowns that could be made up later in the year. So I don't believe we'll have any adjustments to our 2020 CapEx levels at this time. 
We continue to monitor our key suppliers and today have had no major disruptions to our supply chain. Our key distributors are reporting an excess inventory of materials like pipes, valves, hydrates, couplings. And our chemical providers are meeting our needs and are reporting those shortages as of this point. 
As we think about the impact of COVID-19 on our Market-Based Businesses, for military services, O&M operations currently continue as normal subject to each installation's individual requirement. As you know, our services are deemed essential. So we continue to do what the Department of Defense has hired us to do, which is to deliver safe, clean and reliable water to our military-based partners. 
For Homeowner Services, while development of new partner relationships may be delayed [a while], we believe we can maintain our customer base during periods of economic downturn. And homeowners really do value in these products that protect them against large unexpected expenses. 
And perhaps maybe one final comment before I talk about how we've addressed liquidity. I'd simply mention that our pension plans were funded at just over 80% as of year-end 2019. And though there has been much volatility in the equity markets as you all know, I'd remind you that the pension obligation remeasurement will be done at the end of 2020. 
Moving to Slide 16 as a [bridge to] liquidity. Obviously, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a great deal of uncertainty and volatility in the debt capital markets. And like many others, we experienced some constraints in the commercial paper market, and we have now seen a large -- a general loosening in that area. We've been focused on liquidity since the situation really accelerated. In addition to our existing $2.25 billion revolving credit facility that supports working capital needs and capital spending, on March 20, we entered into a $750 million 364-day term loan at a very favorable rate of LIBOR plus 80 basis points. And we have drawn on that term loan at $500 million, and we're holding that amount in cash currently. 
As part of our planned financing for 2020, we executed on the issuance of $1 billion in long-term debt on April 14. The issue consisted of $500 million in 2.8% coupon senior notes due 2030 and $500 million in 3.45% coupon senior notes due 2050. The proceeds from the long-term debt issuance were used primarily to repay outstanding commercial paper obligations and outstanding draws against our revolving credit facility. We're confident we have sufficient liquidity available for the foreseeable future, with $2.8 billion available at the end of April.
Moving on to Slide 17, let me summarize now. As Walter said, we expect our 2020 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $3.79 to $3.89 per share, which is consistent with the guidance range we last announced in February 2020 and which should have been identified as an adjusted guidance range at that time. Our 2020 GAAP earnings guidance range is $3.85 to $3.95 per share. The difference of $0.06 relates to the expected annual depreciation on the New York subsidiary assets, which have been presented as assets held for sale. With the accounting treatment of held for sale, GAAP requires the depreciation fees on those assets, and the only adjustment currently anticipated between our expected GAAP results and our expected adjusted earnings per share result is that $0.06 of depreciation expense. We have reflected $0.01 per share of that in the first quarter reconciliation of GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS. 
As Walter also mentioned, we are affirming our long-term earnings compounded annual growth rate expectation on an earnings per share basis of a range of 7% to 10% while investing capital in the range of $8.8 billion to $9.4 billion over the next 5 years. The decades of capital investment need continue and drives our $20 billion to $22 billion of investment over the next 10 years. 
The fragmented water and wastewater landscape continues to provide what we see as a growing pipeline for acquisition. The capital-light Market-Based Businesses continue to increase customer experience and generate cash. And simply put, our business model and resulting investment thesis is built on fundamentals. And though all segments of the economy are being impacted by this crisis, we see our business as quite resilient, and we have built in a way to endure challenges like this. 
Finally, moving on to Slide 18. While working through these very difficult and turbulent times, we continue to deliver strong consolidated results. Our total company consolidated actual return on equity is 10.6% for the 12 months ended March 31, 2020. Regulatory execution, along with strong results from our market-based businesses, allows us to consistently deliver on our earnings commitment. We believe delivering on results combined with our strong earnings growth and superior dividend growth expectations continue to provide excellent value for our investors. 
We continue to be a top leader in dividend growth. With our announced increase in the dividend of 10%, we have grown our dividend at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 10% or more over the last 5 years. And we expect to continue that growth well into the 7% to 10% range. Also, we continue to target a dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60% of earnings. 
And with that, let me simply turn it back to Walter for a few additional remarks."

Let me make just a few comments, Durgesh. And again, I would reiterate it is early.

Let me make just a few comments, Durgesh. And again, I would reiterate it is early. And as we think about across all of our jurisdictions, the various states implemented restrictions and stay-at-home orders at different times. So obviously depending on when that occurred in each of our jurisdictions, that's going to impact when we really started to see a shift in demand expectations. 
I'd again reiterate what I said in our prepared remarks. Roughly 70% of our load is residential. And as you can imagine, obviously folks are at home. So we are seeing in our early data that residential sales are up. And again, I hesitate to quantify it because it's still so early. In some cases, we may have 6 weeks' worth of demand data. In other cases, we may only have 3 or 4 weeks, again depending on when those measures were put in place. And in some cases, we have real-time meters, some cases we don't, so we have to wait until we have actual billing data. But we certainly are seeing residential usage up. 
On the commercial side, again it depends on the jurisdiction and it depends on the mix of customers in a particular state. But as you can imagine, commercial is trending down because of business closures, restaurants closing, et cetera. 
And on the industrial side, while in a particular state it could be a material change, and I'll give you an example in Kentucky. We've got a large plant there, an auto manufacturer. So in the state of Kentucky, we're seeing a pretty substantial decline in industrial sales because of the concentration there. But overall, our industrial sales makeup is only about 4% of our total. 
So again, as you sort of roll all that together, residential is up. The other 2 are down. Our current thinking is that they may tend to offset each other. But I think it also depends on how long this goes. It depends on sort of a variety of factors in each of the jurisdictions. So again, I'm not getting directly to your quantify it, but hope a bit more color there is helpful. 
On the collections side, again I'd say it's too early to really see much on the regulated side. And we certainly haven't seen anything on the market-based side either that gives us immediate concern about collection. On the market-based side in particular, I don't think we expect much in the way of difficulties there. Again, we think customers appreciate and are willing to sort of stay with the programs because it helps them avoid unexpected future expenditures. So we're quite confident we'll be able to retain customers, and with that goes the ability to collect on the fees of those contracts."

Okay, great. And then just driving on just the last question here, when you look at the guidance for the year of $3.79 to $3.89, and you look into the model and you also think back to the Analyst Day of how the company now intends to issue equity at some point over the next 5 years, debt to capital is targeted to come down to the 59% to 61 -- to 60% range over time. And then we have a CapEx plan and then there's also COVID now. 
And at least in my model when you start to bring down diluted earnings per share below that $3.79 figure into the low $3.70s, the flow-through impact of that is that your cash, your operating cash drops. And you either need to make up for that by issuing debt which will increase your debt to total capital, before you issue more equity which could possibly dilute the EPS growth rate, or you peel back on Capex. And no one knows what -- I mean you guys are doing a great job obviously so far, but no one knows, right? It could go on for a long time. It could be really unfavorable. 
So let's just assume a doomsday scenario. What would be the -- where would the company look to try to remedy the situation but also try to keep the long-term growth guidance in range? Does the company say, okay, we're going to let our debt ratios maybe kind of list at risk of further credit downgrades? Why don't we issue more equity? Do we peel back Capex? I mean I'm sure you guys have kind of ran scenarios internally there. What's kind of in a doomsday scenario, what would the strategy if that were to occur?"

I would say to you that as you outlined them in all other remarks, we would have many levers to pull. And I'm probably not going to comment beyond that. I just think the strength of the balance sheet and the strength of our credit, the diversity of our operations, there's a whole variety of things about our business model that are set up in a way that makes it possible for us to navigate through situations like this.

Today, I'll start by giving you a brief update on our COVID-19 response and then provide key updates on our business. Susan Hardwick, our CFO, will cover the first quarter financial results and provide a few additional comments related to the implications of COVID-19. 
As you know, American Water provides clean, safe, reliable water and wastewater services and has continued to do so throughout this pandemic. American Water has established clear priorities across our organization focused in 3 areas. The first is the care and safety of our employees and their families. The second is the safety of our customers and the communities we serve. And the third area of focus is the execution of our preparedness plans, so we can continue to provide essential services and help our communities get through this crisis. 
Let me give some examples of the measures we've implemented. Because safety is our top priority, we've implemented a required work-from-home policy where possible as well as social distancing and other enhanced safety measures for employees and customers. For example, we've suspended all nonemergency and home appointments and limited the amount and nature of contact with customers during field appointments. We've also worked hand in hand with labor across the business and supported our employees with paid leave for COVID-19 diagnosis, quarantine and childcare. 
We suspended building-related service shutoffs, suspended late fees and have restored service to customers who were previously shut off for nonpayment. We're also working with customers who are experiencing financial hardships by offering customer assistance programs and access to low-income programs. Susan will cover this a bit more later but we've implemented actions to strengthen our liquidity and ensure access to capital. 
We also continue to execute on our core strategies such as making needed capital investment. We increased communications with public service commissions, customers and public officials. As the COVID-19 impact continues to be assessed, American Water will work constructively with public service commissions as they look to address utility response measures, customer protection and cost recovery for all regulated utilities in their jurisdictions. 
Finally, we provided a $500,000 donation to the American Water Charitable Foundation to help fund COVID-19 relief efforts across the United States. This was in addition to a $100,000 donation made to Feeding America to help support food banks. 
We understand we have a very important role during this crisis. We provide water and wastewater services for hygiene, hospitals, sanitation and fire protection. We thank all our employees for continuing to provide these essential services.
Moving on to first quarter results. The employees of American Water delivered solid results and further strengthened our low-risk profile and predictable growth story. Our first quarter 2020 adjusted earnings per share increased 9.8% compared to first quarter 2019. We invested capital of $457 million in the first quarter of 2020, which is a 36% increase over the same period last year. This increase is driven by the continued investment in our systems and the communities we serve along with more favorable construction weather this year versus last. 
As you know, we work hard to minimize the customer bill impacts of these investments through a continued focus on controlling O&M costs. I'll talk more in a moment about our regulated operations, our continuing progress on regulated acquisitions and their contributions to our long-term growth story. 
Our Market-Based Businesses were up $0.01 in earnings per share. This was due primarily to growth in customer contracts from Homeowner Services. As a reminder, in the third quarter of 2019, our Military Services Group was awarded 2 military contracts: Joint Base San Antonio in Texas and the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. We're on track to assume operations by the second quarter of 2020. 
Moving to Slide 7. The foundation of our earnings growth continues to be the capital investment we make in our regulated operations to provide clean, safe and reliable service to our customers. We believe that long-term financial success depends on effectively executing the fundamentals of our business every day. We plan to invest $20 billion to $22 billion in capital over the next 10 years to ensure the quality and reliability of our services and to bring water and wastewater solutions to communities across the country. 
We're affirming our long-term EPS compound annual growth rate in the 7% to 10% range. We also expect our 2020 adjusted earnings to be in the range of $3.79 to $3.89 per share. This is the same range we communicated in February, which should have been identified as an adjusted EPS range. Our GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $3.85 to $3.95 per share. In her comments, Susan will provide additional information about the difference between our GAAP and adjusted guidance ranges. 
Also consistent with our previous dividend guidance, on April 29, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend payment from $0.50 per share to $0.55 per share, a 10% increase. We understand that a secure and growing dividend is important to our shareholders, while striking the right balance with continued investment in our regulated operations.
Turning to Slide 8. Let's walk through some of the regulatory highlights of the first quarter of 2020. Pennsylvania American Water filed a general rate case last week, requesting $92 million in the first year and $46 million in the second year. Since our last case in 2017, Pennsylvania American Water will have invested $1.64 billion in infrastructure upgrades for the 4-year period of 2019 through 2022, including replacing more than 427 miles of aging water and sewer pipes. The case also includes enhancements to our customer assistance program. Traditionally, the Public Utility Commission's review of the filing may take up to 9 months and new rates would not be effective until 2021. 
Also in Pennsylvania, the Public Utility Commission approved the company's revision to its wastewater DSIC. This action allows the DSIC to be applied to another 50,000 wastewater customers effective May 1. 
We also have 3 pending rate cases in New Jersey, Virginia and California. New Jersey American Water filed a general rate case in December 2019 requesting an overall revenue increase of approximately $88 million excluding the revenue from DSIC. Since our last rate case, we've invested more than $1 billion in system upgrades. 
Virginia American Water filed a general rate case requesting an overall revenue increase of $5.6 million in November 2018. This case was driven by approximately $98 million in infrastructure upgrades since April 2017. Interim rates became effective on May 1, 2019, and we expect a decision later this year. 
Moving west, California American Water filed for new rates in July 2019. The case covers 2021 through 2023 and requests an increase in authorized revenue of $46.6 million over 3 years. The request seeks $197 million for infrastructure improvements planned for 2021 and 2022. Due to COVID-19, the evidentiary hearings were moved from April and May to early June with final hearing dates expected in late August. We now expect a decision on this case as early as first quarter of 2021. In addition, we filed a motion for interim rates to be effective back to January 1, 2021. 
On the legislative front, during the quarter, Indiana Governor Holcomb signed 2 bills. The first one authorizes recovery for aboveground infrastructure without a full rate case. And the second establishes an appraisal process for nonmunicipal utilities to establish fair value and a reasonable purchase price. 
In West Virginia, Governor Justice has signed the Water and Wastewater Investment and Infrastructure Improvement Act. Effective June 5, this legislation creates a voluntary process to use fair value assessments to determine the value of the water or wastewater systems, enables combined water and wastewater ratemaking, and expands how municipalities can use the proceeds they receive from selling utility assets to better address needs in their communities. 
Finally in Virginia, Governor Northam signed fair market value legislation, which will go into effect on July 1. This is now the ninth state that has adopted fair market value legislation across our footprint. 
All this legislation is focused on helping communities and utilities address water and wastewater challenges.
Moving on Slide 9. Customers remain at the center of every decision we make today and into the future. This means smart investments balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. As I mentioned earlier, in the first quarter, we invested $457 million with a majority in our Regulated Businesses, including $432 million in infrastructure investment and $21 million in regulated acquisitions. 
As we make these critical investments to maintain reliable service, we must also ensure affordability for our customers. We'll continue to focus on O&M efficiency and work toward our O&M efficiency goal of 31.3% by 2024. For the 12-month period ended March 31, 2020, our O&M efficiency ratio improved to 34.5% compared to 35.5% for the 12-month period ended March 31, 2019. 
Now to put this into perspective, our adjusted O&M expenses are just slightly higher today than they were in 2010. Since then, we've added approximately 276,000 customer connections while expenses only increased at a compound annual growth rate of 0.7%. We're very proud of our employees' focus and commitment to controlling costs on behalf of our customers, especially given the current situation and economic challenges some of our customers are now facing.
Moving on to Slide 10. We believe our commitment to putting customers first is a key to growing our regulated footprint. So far in 2020, we've closed on 5 acquisitions in 4 different states, adding about 6,200 new customer connections. We've also added more than 3,200 customer connections through organic growth in the first quarter. We look forward to adding another 45,800 customer connections through currently signed agreements in 8 states, most of which we expect to close this year in 2020. These new agreements reflect our commitment to provide water and wastewater solutions to communities across our footprint. 
And with that, let me now turn it over to Susan."
250885,661837677,1975875,"American Water Works Company, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 07, 2020",2020-05-07,"Earnings Calls","American Water Works Company, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Walter, and good morning, everyone. Let me first start on Slide 12 with a bit more detail on results for the quarter. First quarter 2020 consolidated GAAP earnings were $0.68 per share compared to $0.62 per share in 2019. In the first quarter o",1600,"Thank you, Walter, and good morning, everyone. Let me first start on Slide 12 with a bit more detail on results for the quarter. First quarter 2020 consolidated GAAP earnings were $0.68 per share compared to $0.62 per share in 2019. In the first quarter of 2020, GAAP earnings were adjusted for depreciation expense that would have been recorded in the quarter related to the New York subsidiary assets having not been classified for accounting purposes as assets held for sale. Also 2019 GAAP earnings were adjusted for a reduction in the settlement liability related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill. Excluding these 2 adjustments, earnings per share as adjusted increased $0.06 per share or 9.8% driven primarily by growth in the regulated business. 
The regulated business segment results increased $0.08 per share or an increase of 13.6% compared to 2019 earnings. The market-based business results increased $0.01 per share. And the parent company decreased $0.03 per share compared to 2019 primarily reflecting higher interest expense to support growth in the business.
Moving on Slide 13. Regulated operations increased $0.08 per share in total. We saw a $0.14 per share increase from additional authorized revenue and surcharges to support infrastructure investment, acquisition and organic growth. 
O&M expense increased $0.06 per share and depreciation increased $0.03 per share, both to support regulated acquisitions and growth. Also, results reflect a $0.03 per share benefit primarily related to lower pension expense from a higher assumed return on assets used to set expense for 2020. 
The Market-Based Businesses first quarter result increased compared to 2019 primarily by the Homeowner Services Group's organic growth and contract price increases. Also, as Walter already mentioned, we expect Joint Base San Antonio and the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York to resume operations by the second quarter of 2020. 
And finally, the parent results decreased $0.03 per share primarily reflecting higher interest expense to support growth in the regulated business.
Moving on to Slide 14. The Regulated Businesses received $53 million in annualized new revenue in 2020. This includes $18 million from step increases and $35 million from infrastructure surcharges. We have also filed requests and are awaiting final orders on 4 rate cases and 3 infrastructure surcharge proceedings for a total annualized revenue request of $224 million. The continued successful execution of our regulatory strategy is a key element of our ability to consistently deliver on these financial results. 
And before I wrap up on Slide 15, let me add a few additional thoughts related to the expected implications of COVID-19. First, as it relates to demand for our services, American Water has a predominantly residential customer base. Residential revenues including bulk sales are about 69%. Commercial is 21% mostly in the food and beverage sector. And industrial is only 4% of our total revenue. Our very early indications are that our residential load is higher, and our commercial and industrial loads are trending down as business close -- businesses closed and certain other slowdowns occur. 
Disconnections and late fees have been suspended and disconnection notices have stopped as Walter mentioned earlier. We have also reconnected customers previously disconnected for nonpayment and suspended reconnection fees. This is critical to our customers as they work through this difficult situation, and we currently don't expect the impact of this temporary measure to be material. It's too early to tell how customers' overall ability to pay will be impacted by COVID-19, so estimating uncollectible accounts exposure to this risk is not yet possible. 
As is evidenced by regulatory actions across the country to date, we expect issues like this will be addressed timely and certainly in future rate cases at the very least. We will work closely with regulators in our jurisdictions on how the cost of this pandemic will be treated for recovery purposes. 
As Walter mentioned, we invested capital of $457 million in the first quarter of 2020 to better serve our customers. At this point, we believe our regularly scheduled capital projects will continue as planned, perhaps with some slowdowns that could be made up later in the year. So I don't believe we'll have any adjustments to our 2020 CapEx levels at this time. 
We continue to monitor our key suppliers and today have had no major disruptions to our supply chain. Our key distributors are reporting an excess inventory of materials like pipes, valves, hydrates, couplings. And our chemical providers are meeting our needs and are reporting those shortages as of this point. 
As we think about the impact of COVID-19 on our Market-Based Businesses, for military services, O&M operations currently continue as normal subject to each installation's individual requirement. As you know, our services are deemed essential. So we continue to do what the Department of Defense has hired us to do, which is to deliver safe, clean and reliable water to our military-based partners. 
For Homeowner Services, while development of new partner relationships may be delayed for a while, we believe we can maintain our customer base during periods of economic downturn. And that homeowners really do see value in these products that protect them against large unexpected expenses. 
And perhaps maybe one final comment before I talk about how we've addressed liquidity. I'd simply mention that our pension plans were funded at just over 80% as of year-end 2019. And though there has been much volatility in the equity markets as you all know, I'd remind you that the pension obligation remeasurement will be done at the end of 2020. 
Moving to Slide 16 as it relates liquidity. Obviously, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a great deal of uncertainty and volatility in the debt capital markets. And like many others, we experienced some constraints in the commercial paper market, and we have now seen a large -- a general loosening in that area. We've been focused on liquidity since the situation really accelerated. In addition to our existing $2.25 billion revolving credit facility that supports working capital needs and capital spending, on March 20, we entered into a $750 million 364-day term loan at a very favorable rate of LIBOR plus 80 basis points. And we have drawn on that term loan at $500 million, and we're holding that amount in cash currently. 
As part of our planned financing for 2020, we executed on the issuance of $1 billion in long-term debt on April 14. The issue consisted of $500 million in 2.8% coupon senior notes due 2030 and $500 million in 3.45% coupon senior notes due 2050. The proceeds from the long-term debt issuance were used primarily to repay outstanding commercial paper obligations and outstanding draws against our revolving credit facility. We're confident we have sufficient liquidity available for the foreseeable future, with $2.8 billion available at the end of April.
Moving on to Slide 17, let me summarize now. As Walter said, we expect our 2020 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $3.79 to $3.89 per share, which is consistent with the guidance range we last announced in February 2020 and which should have been identified as an adjusted guidance range at that time. Our 2020 GAAP earnings guidance range is $3.85 to $3.95 per share. The difference of $0.06 relates to the expected annual depreciation on the New York subsidiary assets, which have been presented as assets held for sale. With the accounting treatment of assets held for sale, GAAP requires the depreciation fees on those assets, and the only adjustment currently anticipated between our expected GAAP results and our expected adjusted earnings per share result is that $0.06 of depreciation expense. We have reflected $0.01 per share of that in the first quarter reconciliation of GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS. 
As Walter also mentioned, we are affirming our long-term earnings compounded annual growth rate expectation on an earnings per share basis of a range of 7% to 10% while investing capital in the range of $8.8 billion to $9.4 billion over the next 5 years. The decades of capital investment need continue and drives our $20 billion to $22 billion of investment over the next 10 years. 
The fragmented water and wastewater landscape continues to provide what we see as a growing pipeline for acquisition. The capital-light Market-Based Businesses continue to increase customer experience and generate cash. And simply put, our business model and resulting investment thesis is built on fundamentals. And though all segments of the economy are being impacted by this crisis, we see our business as quite resilient, and we have built it in a way to endure challenges like this. 
Finally, moving on to Slide 18. While working through these very difficult and turbulent times, we continue to deliver strong consolidated results. Our total company consolidated actual return on equity is 10.6% for the 12 months ended March 31, 2020. Regulatory execution, along with strong results from our market-based businesses, allows us to consistently deliver on our earnings commitment. We believe that delivering on results combined with our strong earnings growth and superior dividend growth expectations continue to provide excellent value for our investors. 
We continue to be a top leader in dividend growth. With our announced increase in the dividend of 10%, we have grown our dividend at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 10% or more over the last 5 years. And we expect to continue that growth well into the 7% to 10% range. Also, we continue to target a dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60% of earnings. 
And with that, let me simply turn it back to Walter for a few additional remarks."

Let me make just a few comments, Durgesh. And again, I would reiterate it is early.

Let me make just a few comments, Durgesh. And again, I would reiterate it is early. And as we think about across all of our jurisdictions, the various states implemented restrictions and stay-at-home orders at different times. So obviously depending on when that occurred in each of our jurisdictions, that's going to impact when we really started to see a shift in demand expectations. 
I'd again reiterate what I said in our prepared remarks. Roughly 70% of our load is residential. And as you can imagine, obviously folks are at home. So we are seeing in our early data that residential sales are up. And again, I hesitate to quantify it because it's still so early. In some cases, we may have 6 weeks' worth of demand data. In other cases, we may only have 3 or 4 weeks, again depending on when those measures were put in place. And in some cases, we have real-time meters, some cases we don't, so we have to wait until we have actual billing data. But we certainly are seeing residential usage up. 
On the commercial side, again it depends on the jurisdiction and it depends on the mix of customers in a particular state. But as you can imagine, commercial is trending down because of business closures, restaurants closing, et cetera. 
And on the industrial side, while in a particular state it could be a material change, and I'll give you an example in Kentucky. We've got a large plant there, an auto manufacturer. So in the state of Kentucky, we're seeing a pretty substantial decline in industrial sales because of the concentration there. But overall, our industrial sales makeup is only about 4% of our total. 
So again, as you sort of roll all that together, residential is up. The other 2 are down. Our current thinking is that they may tend to offset each other. But I think it also depends on how long this goes. It depends on sort of a variety of factors in each of the jurisdictions. So again, I'm not getting direct until you quantify it, but hopefully a bit more color there is helpful. 
On the collections side, again I'd say it's too early to really see much on the regulated side. And we certainly haven't seen anything on the market-based side either that gives us immediate concern about collection. On the market-based side in particular, I don't think we expect much in the way of difficulties there. Again, we think customers appreciate and are willing to sort of stay with these programs because it helps them avoid unexpected future expenditures. So we're quite confident we'll be able to retain customers, and with that goes the ability to collect on the fees under those contracts."

The only thing I would add maybe just as a specific example, and you mentioned travel was one, obviously we've implemented no travel across all of our jurisdictions. But what you might not be thinking about is added PPE that we've added for all of our employees, including office employees. So there's added expense there while we may have saved in other areas. 
So the bigger picture is we are still on target for our earnings expectations for the year. And I think our ability to navigate all the variables and the result is our expectations remain the same. I think that gives you a pretty good indication of how we're managing."

So I think it's the trust and confidence that they have in our Military Services Group to take over their water and wastewater systems and do it in a professional and an amazing way as our group does with our Military Services Group. 
So again, we're really proud to have those 2 new installations, particularly West Point, one of the most important military installations in the country. I'm a graduate of West Point, right? I'd like to say that. 
But no, we're really proud of our Military Services Group. They've developed a tremendous reputation in brand with the government. And I think it's the confidence that they have in our group that has moved those forward as quickly as we have."

And then just -- driving on just the last question here, when you look at the guidance for the year of $3.79 to $3.89, and you look into the model and you also think back to the Analyst Day of how the company now intends to issue equity at some point over the next 5 years, debt to capital is targeted to come down to the 59% to 61 -- to 60% range over time. And then we have a CapEx plan and then there's also COVID now. 
And at least in my model when you start to bring down diluted earnings per share below that $3.79 figure into the low $3.70s, the flow-through impact of that is that your cash, your operating cash drops. And you either need to make up for that by issuing debt which will increase your debt to total capital, before you issue more equity which could possibly dilute the EPS growth rate, or you peel back on Capex. And no one knows what -- I mean you guys are doing a great job obviously so far, but no one knows, right? It could go on for a long time. It could be really unfavorable. 
So let's just assume a doomsday scenario. What would be the -- where would the company look to try to remedy the situation but also try to keep the long-term growth guidance in range? Does the company say, okay, we're going to let our debt ratios maybe kind of list at risk of further credit downgrades? Why don't we issue more equity? Do we peel back Capex? I mean I'm sure you guys have kind of ran scenarios internally there. What's kind of a doomsday scenario, what would a strategy if that were to occur?"

I would say to you that as you outlined them in all of your remarks, we would have many levers to pull. And I'm probably not going to comment beyond that. I just think the strength of the balance sheet and the strength of our credit, the diversity of our operations, there's a whole variety of things about our business model that are set up in a way that makes it possible for us to navigate through situations like this. I made the comment in my remarks that, again we're built on fundamentals and believe this is a very resilient business, and I believe that to be absolutely true.

Today, I'll start by giving you a brief update on our COVID-19 response and then provide key updates on our business. Susan Hardwick, our CFO, will cover the first quarter financial results and provide a few additional comments related to the implications of COVID-19. 
As you know, American Water provides clean, safe, reliable water and wastewater services and has continued to do so throughout this pandemic. American Water has established clear priorities across our organization focused in 3 areas. The first is the care and safety of our employees and their families. The second is the safety of our customers and the communities we serve. And the third area of focus is the execution of our preparedness plans, so we can continue to provide essential services and help our communities get through this crisis. 
Let me give some examples of the measures we've implemented. Because safety is our top priority, we've implemented a required work-from-home policy where possible as well as social distancing and other enhanced safety measures for employees and customers. For example, we've suspended all nonemergency and home appointments and limited the amount and nature of contact with customers during field appointments. We've also worked hand in hand with labor across the business and supported our employees with paid leave for COVID-19 diagnosis, quarantine and childcare. 
We suspended building-related service shutoffs, suspended late fees and have restored service to customers who were previously shut off for nonpayment. We're also working with customers who are experiencing financial hardships by offering customer assistance programs and access to low-income programs. Susan will cover this a bit more later but we've implemented actions to strengthen our liquidity and ensure access to capital. 
We also continue to execute on our core strategies such as making needed capital investment. We increased communications with public service commissions, customers and public officials. As the COVID-19 impact continues to be assessed, American Water will work constructively with public service commissions as they look to address utility response measures, customer protection and cost recovery for all regulated utilities in their jurisdictions. 
Finally, we provided a $500,000 donation to the American Water Charitable Foundation to help fund COVID-19 relief efforts across the United States. This was in addition to a $100,000 donation made to Feeding America to help support food banks. 
We understand we have a very important role during this crisis. We provide water and wastewater services for hygiene, hospitals, sanitation and fire protection. We thank all our employees for continuing to provide these essential services.
Moving on to first quarter results. The employees of American Water delivered solid results and further strengthened our low-risk profile and predictable growth story. Our first quarter 2020 adjusted earnings per share increased 9.8% compared to first quarter 2019. We invested capital of $457 million in the first quarter of 2020, which is a 36% increase over the same period last year. This increase is driven by the continued investment in our systems and the communities we serve along with more favorable construction weather this year versus last. 
As you know, we work hard to minimize the customer bill impacts of these investments through a continued focus on controlling O&M costs. I'll talk more in a moment about our regulated operations, our continuing progress on regulated acquisitions and their contributions to our long-term growth story. 
Our Market-Based Businesses were up $0.01 in earnings per share. This was due primarily to growth in customer contracts from Homeowner Services. As a reminder, in the third quarter of 2019, our Military Services Group was awarded 2 military contracts: Joint Base San Antonio in Texas and the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. We're on track to assume operations by the second quarter of 2020. 
Moving to Slide 7. The foundation of our earnings growth continues to be the capital investment we make in our regulated operations to provide clean, safe and reliable service to our customers. We believe that long-term financial success depends on effectively executing the fundamentals of our business every day. We plan to invest $20 billion to $22 billion in capital over the next 10 years to ensure the quality and reliability of our services and to bring water and wastewater solutions to communities across the country. 
We're affirming our long-term EPS compound annual growth rate in the 7% to 10% range. We also expect our 2020 adjusted earnings to be in the range of $3.79 to $3.89 per share. This is the same range we communicated in February, which should have been identified as an adjusted EPS range. Our GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $3.85 to $3.95 per share. In her comments, Susan will provide additional information about the difference between our GAAP and adjusted guidance ranges. 
Also consistent with our previous dividend guidance, on April 29, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend payment from $0.50 per share to $0.55 per share, a 10% increase. We understand that a secure and growing dividend is important to our shareholders, while striking the right balance with continued investment in our regulated operations.
Turning to Slide 8. Let's walk through some of the regulatory highlights of the first quarter of 2020. Pennsylvania American Water filed a general rate case last week, requesting $92 million in the first year and $46 million in the second year. Since our last case in 2017, Pennsylvania American Water will have invested $1.64 billion in infrastructure upgrades for the 4-year period of 2019 through 2022, including replacing more than 427 miles of aging water and sewer pipes. The case also includes enhancements to our customer assistance program. Traditionally, the Public Utility Commission's review of the filing may take up to 9 months and new rates would not be effective until 2021. 
Also in Pennsylvania, the Public Utility Commission approved the company's revision to its wastewater DSIC. This action allows the DSIC to be applied to another 50,000 wastewater customers effective May 1. 
We also have 3 pending rate cases in New Jersey, Virginia and California. New Jersey American Water filed a general rate case in December 2019 requesting an overall revenue increase of approximately $88 million excluding the revenue from DSIC. Since our last rate case, we've invested more than $1 billion in system upgrades. 
Virginia American Water filed a general rate case requesting an overall revenue increase of $5.6 million in November 2018. This case was driven by approximately $98 million in infrastructure upgrades since April 2017. Interim rates became effective on May 1, 2019, and we expect a decision later this year. 
Moving west, California American Water filed for new rates in July 2019. The case covers 2021 through 2023 and requests an increase in authorized revenue of $46.6 million over 3 years. The request seeks $197 million for infrastructure improvements planned for 2021 and 2022. Due to COVID-19, the evidentiary hearings were moved from April and May to early June with final hearing dates expected in late August. We now expect a decision on this case as early as first quarter of 2021. In addition, we filed a motion for interim rates to be effective back to January 1, 2021. 
On the legislative front, during the quarter, Indiana Governor Holcomb signed 2 bills. The first one authorizes recovery for aboveground infrastructure without a full rate case. And the second establishes an appraisal process for nonmunicipal utilities to establish fair value and a reasonable purchase price. 
In West Virginia, Governor Justice has signed the Water and Wastewater Investment and Infrastructure Improvement Act. Effective June 5, this legislation creates a voluntary process to use fair value assessments to determine the value of the water or wastewater systems, enables combined water and wastewater ratemaking, and expands how municipalities can use the proceeds they receive from selling utility assets to better address needs in their communities. 
Finally in Virginia, Governor Northam signed fair market value legislation, which will go into effect on July 1. This is now the ninth state that has adopted fair market value legislation across our footprint. 
All this legislation is focused on helping communities and utilities address water and wastewater challenges.
Moving on Slide 9. Customers remain at the center of every decision we make today and into the future. This means smart investments balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. As I mentioned earlier, in the first quarter, we invested $457 million with a majority in our Regulated Businesses, including $432 million in infrastructure investment and $21 million in regulated acquisitions. 
As we make these critical investments to maintain reliable service, we must also ensure affordability for our customers. We'll continue to focus on O&M efficiency and work toward our O&M efficiency goal of 31.3% by 2024. For the 12-month period ended March 31, 2020, our O&M efficiency ratio improved to 34.5% compared to 35.5% for the 12-month period ended March 31, 2019. 
Now to put this into perspective, our adjusted O&M expenses are just slightly higher today than they were in 2010. Since then, we've added approximately 276,000 customer connections while expenses only increased at a compound annual growth rate of 0.7%. We're very proud of our employees' focus and commitment to controlling costs on behalf of our customers, especially given the current situation and economic challenges some of our customers are now facing.
Moving on to Slide 10. We believe our commitment to putting customers first is a key to growing our regulated footprint. So far in 2020, we've closed on 5 acquisitions in 4 different states, adding about 6,200 new customer connections. We've also added more than 3,200 customer connections through organic growth in the first quarter. We look forward to adding another 45,800 customer connections through currently signed agreements in 8 states, most of which we expect to close this year in 2020. These new agreements reflect our commitment to provide water and wastewater solutions to communities across our footprint. 
And with that, let me now turn it over to Susan."
250885,661837677,2016899,"American Water Works Company, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 07, 2020",2020-05-07,"Earnings Calls","American Water Works Company, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Walter, and good morning, everyone. Let me first start on Slide 12 with a bit more detail on results for the quarter. First quarter 2020 consolidated GAAP earnings were $0.68 per share compared to $0.62 per share in 2019. In the first quarter o",1600,"Thank you, Walter, and good morning, everyone. Let me first start on Slide 12 with a bit more detail on results for the quarter. First quarter 2020 consolidated GAAP earnings were $0.68 per share compared to $0.62 per share in 2019. In the first quarter of 2020, GAAP earnings were adjusted for depreciation expense that would have been recorded in the quarter related to the New York subsidiary assets having not been classified for accounting purposes as assets held for sale. Also 2019 GAAP earnings were adjusted for a reduction in the settlement liability related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill. Excluding these 2 adjustments, earnings per share as adjusted increased $0.06 per share or 9.8% driven primarily by growth in the regulated business. 
The regulated business segment results increased $0.08 per share or an increase of 13.6% compared to 2019 earnings. The market-based business results increased $0.01 per share. And the parent company decreased $0.03 per share compared to 2019 primarily reflecting higher interest expense to support growth in the business.
Moving on Slide 13. Regulated operations increased $0.08 per share in total. We saw a $0.14 per share increase from additional authorized revenue and surcharges to support infrastructure investment, acquisition and organic growth. 
O&M expense increased $0.06 per share and depreciation increased $0.03 per share, both to support regulated acquisitions and growth. Also, results reflect a $0.03 per share benefit primarily related to lower pension expense from a higher assumed return on assets used to set expense for 2020. 
The Market-Based Businesses first quarter result increased compared to 2019 primarily by the Homeowner Services Group's organic growth and contract price increases. Also, as Walter already mentioned, we expect Joint Base San Antonio and the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York to resume operations by the second quarter of 2020. 
And finally, the parent results decreased $0.03 per share primarily reflecting higher interest expense to support growth in the regulated business.
Moving on to Slide 14. The Regulated Businesses received $53 million in annualized new revenue in 2020. This includes $18 million from step increases and $35 million from infrastructure surcharges. We have also filed requests and are awaiting final orders on 4 rate cases and 3 infrastructure surcharge proceedings for a total annualized revenue request of $224 million. The continued successful execution of our regulatory strategy is a key element of our ability to consistently deliver on these financial results. 
And before I wrap up on Slide 15, let me add a few additional thoughts related to the expected implications of COVID-19. First, as it relates to demand for our services, American Water has a predominantly residential customer base. Residential revenues including bulk sales are about 69%. Commercial is 21% mostly in the food and beverage sector. And industrial is only 4% of our total revenue. Our very early indications are that our residential load is higher, and our commercial and industrial loads are trending down as business close -- businesses closed and certain other slowdowns occur. 
Disconnections and late fees have been suspended and disconnection notices have stopped as Walter mentioned earlier. We have also reconnected customers previously disconnected for nonpayment and suspended reconnection fees. This is critical to our customers as they work through this difficult situation, and we currently don't expect the impact of this temporary measure to be material. It's too early to tell how customers' overall ability to pay will be impacted by COVID-19, so estimating uncollectible accounts exposure to this risk is not yet possible. 
As is evidenced by regulatory actions across the country to date, we expect issues like this will be addressed timely and certainly in future rate cases at the very least. We will work closely with regulators in our jurisdictions on how the cost of this pandemic will be treated for recovery purposes. 
As Walter mentioned, we invested capital of $457 million in the first quarter of 2020 to better serve our customers. At this point, we believe our regularly scheduled capital projects will continue as planned, perhaps with some slowdowns that could be made up later in the year. So I don't believe we'll have any adjustments to our 2020 CapEx levels at this time. 
We continue to monitor our key suppliers and today have had no major disruptions to our supply chain. Our key distributors are reporting an excess inventory of materials like pipes, valves, hydrates, couplings. And our chemical providers are meeting our needs and are reporting those shortages as of this point. 
As we think about the impact of COVID-19 on our Market-Based Businesses, for military services, O&M operations currently continue as normal subject to each installation's individual requirement. As you know, our services are deemed essential. So we continue to do what the Department of Defense has hired us to do, which is to deliver safe, clean and reliable water to our military-based partners. 
For Homeowner Services, while development of new partner relationships may be delayed for a while, we believe we can maintain our customer base during periods of economic downturn. And that homeowners really do see value in these products that protect them against large unexpected expenses. 
And perhaps maybe one final comment before I talk about how we've addressed liquidity. I'd simply mention that our pension plans were funded at just over 80% as of year-end 2019. And though there has been much volatility in the equity markets as you all know, I'd remind you that the pension obligation remeasurement will be done at the end of 2020. 
Moving to Slide 16 as it relates liquidity. Obviously, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a great deal of uncertainty and volatility in the debt capital markets. And like many others, we experienced some constraints in the commercial paper market, and we have now seen a large -- a general loosening in that area. We've been focused on liquidity since the situation really accelerated. In addition to our existing $2.25 billion revolving credit facility that supports working capital needs and capital spending, on March 20, we entered into a $750 million 364-day term loan at a very favorable rate of LIBOR plus 80 basis points. And we have drawn on that term loan at $500 million, and we're holding that amount in cash currently. 
As part of our planned financing for 2020, we executed on the issuance of $1 billion in long-term debt on April 14. The issue consisted of $500 million in 2.8% coupon senior notes due 2030 and $500 million in 3.45% coupon senior notes due 2050. The proceeds from the long-term debt issuance were used primarily to repay outstanding commercial paper obligations and outstanding draws against our revolving credit facility. We're confident we have sufficient liquidity available for the foreseeable future, with $2.8 billion available at the end of April.
Moving on to Slide 17, let me summarize now. As Walter said, we expect our 2020 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $3.79 to $3.89 per share, which is consistent with the guidance range we last announced in February 2020 and which should have been identified as an adjusted guidance range at that time. Our 2020 GAAP earnings guidance range is $3.85 to $3.95 per share. The difference of $0.06 relates to the expected annual depreciation on the New York subsidiary assets, which have been presented as assets held for sale. With the accounting treatment of assets held for sale, GAAP requires the depreciation fees on those assets, and the only adjustment currently anticipated between our expected GAAP results and our expected adjusted earnings per share result is that $0.06 of depreciation expense. We have reflected $0.01 per share of that in the first quarter reconciliation of GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS. 
As Walter also mentioned, we are affirming our long-term earnings compounded annual growth rate expectation on an earnings per share basis of a range of 7% to 10% while investing capital in the range of $8.8 billion to $9.4 billion over the next 5 years. The decades of capital investment need continue and drives our $20 billion to $22 billion of investment over the next 10 years. 
The fragmented water and wastewater landscape continues to provide what we see as a growing pipeline for acquisition. The capital-light Market-Based Businesses continue to increase customer experience and generate cash. And simply put, our business model and resulting investment thesis is built on fundamentals. And though all segments of the economy are being impacted by this crisis, we see our business as quite resilient, and we have built it in a way to endure challenges like this. 
Finally, moving on to Slide 18. While working through these very difficult and turbulent times, we continue to deliver strong consolidated results. Our total company consolidated actual return on equity is 10.6% for the 12 months ended March 31, 2020. Regulatory execution, along with strong results from our market-based businesses, allows us to consistently deliver on our earnings commitment. We believe that delivering on results combined with our strong earnings growth and superior dividend growth expectations continue to provide excellent value for our investors. 
We continue to be a top leader in dividend growth. With our announced increase in the dividend of 10%, we have grown our dividend at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 10% or more over the last 5 years. And we expect to continue that growth well into the 7% to 10% range. Also, we continue to target a dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60% of earnings. 
And with that, let me simply turn it back to Walter for a few additional remarks."

We've also had a significant increase in customer satisfaction. We've achieved all this since the beginning of the year. 
Our company will emerge strong from this COVID-19 pandemic. How we've worked together throughout this crisis will have a lasting positive impact on our culture of trust and teamwork.

Let me make just a few comments, Durgesh. And again, I would reiterate it is early.

Let me make just a few comments, Durgesh. And again, I would reiterate it is early. And as we think about across all of our jurisdictions, the various states implemented restrictions and stay-at-home orders at different times. So obviously depending on when that occurred in each of our jurisdictions, that's going to impact when we really started to see a shift in demand expectations. 
I'd again reiterate what I said in our prepared remarks. Roughly 70% of our load is residential. And as you can imagine, obviously folks are at home. So we are seeing in our early data that residential sales are up. And again, I hesitate to quantify it because it's still so early. In some cases, we may have 6 weeks' worth of demand data. In other cases, we may only have 3 or 4 weeks, again depending on when those measures were put in place. And in some cases, we have real-time meters, some cases we don't, so we have to wait until we have actual billing data. But we certainly are seeing residential usage up. 
On the commercial side, again it depends on the jurisdiction and it depends on the mix of customers in a particular state. But as you can imagine, commercial is trending down because of business closures, restaurants closing, et cetera. 
And on the industrial side, while in a particular state it could be a material change, and I'll give you an example in Kentucky. We've got a large plant there, an auto manufacturer. So in the state of Kentucky, we're seeing a pretty substantial decline in industrial sales because of the concentration there. But overall, our industrial sales makeup is only about 4% of our total. 
So again, as you sort of roll all that together, residential is up. The other 2 are down. Our current thinking is that they may tend to offset each other. But I think it also depends on how long this goes. It depends on sort of a variety of factors in each of the jurisdictions. So again, I'm not getting direct until you quantify it, but hopefully a bit more color there is helpful. 
On the collections side, again I'd say it's too early to really see much on the regulated side. And we certainly haven't seen anything on the market-based side either that gives us immediate concern about collection. On the market-based side in particular, I don't think we expect much in the way of difficulties there. Again, we think customers appreciate and are willing to sort of stay with these programs because it helps them avoid unexpected future expenditures. So we're quite confident we'll be able to retain customers, and with that goes the ability to collect on the fees under those contracts."

I just wanted to start very quickly with the military operation. Typically, a turnaround on new contracts can take 12 to 18 months, and it's the same with your peers obviously. And so it just seems kind of quick of a turnaround that we're going to start to see work being done here in the second quarter of 2020.

And we work very well at both installations with Joint Base San Antonio and West Point showing the value to the communities. And we're going to be starting full operations, as I said in my prepared remarks, in the second quarter. So I think it's the trust and confidence that they have in our Military Services Group to take over their water and wastewater systems and do it in a professional and an amazing way as our group does with our Military Services Group. 
So again, we're really proud to have those 2 new installations, particularly West Point, one of the most important military installations in the country. I'm a graduate of West Point, right? I'd like to say that. 
But no, we're really proud of our Military Services Group. They've developed a tremendous reputation in brand with the government. And I think it's the confidence that they have in our group that has moved those forward as quickly as we have."

And then just -- driving on just the last question here, when you look at the guidance for the year of $3.79 to $3.89, and you look into the model and you also think back to the Analyst Day of how the company now intends to issue equity at some point over the next 5 years, debt to capital is targeted to come down to the 59% to 61 -- to 60% range over time. And then we have a CapEx plan and then there's also COVID now. 
And at least in my model when you start to bring down diluted earnings per share below that $3.79 figure into the low $3.70s, the flow-through impact of that is that your cash, your operating cash drops. And you either need to make up for that by issuing debt which will increase your debt to total capital, before you issue more equity which could possibly dilute the EPS growth rate, or you peel back on Capex. And no one knows what -- I mean you guys are doing a great job obviously so far, but no one knows, right? It could go on for a long time. It could be really unfavorable. 
So let's just assume a doomsday scenario. What would be the -- where would the company look to try to remedy the situation but also try to keep the long-term growth guidance in range? Does the company say, okay, we're going to let our debt ratios maybe kind of list at risk of further credit downgrades? Why don't we issue more equity? Do we peel back Capex? I mean I'm sure you guys have kind of ran scenarios internally there. What's kind of a doomsday scenario, what would a strategy if that were to occur?"

I would say to you that as you outlined them in all of your remarks, we would have many levers to pull. And I'm probably not going to comment beyond that. I just think the strength of the balance sheet and the strength of our credit, the diversity of our operations, there's a whole variety of things about our business model that are set up in a way that makes it possible for us to navigate through situations like this. I made the comment in my remarks that, again we're built on fundamentals and believe this is a very resilient business, and I believe that to be absolutely true.

Today, I'll start by giving you a brief update on our COVID-19 response and then provide key updates on our business. Susan Hardwick, our CFO, will cover the first quarter financial results and provide a few additional comments related to the implications of COVID-19. 
As you know, American Water provides clean, safe, reliable water and wastewater services and has continued to do so throughout this pandemic. American Water has established clear priorities across our organization focused in 3 areas. The first is the care and safety of our employees and their families. The second is the safety of our customers and the communities we serve. And the third area of focus is the execution of our preparedness plans, so we can continue to provide essential services and help our communities get through this crisis. 
Let me give some examples of the measures we've implemented. Because safety is our top priority, we've implemented a required work-from-home policy where possible as well as social distancing and other enhanced safety measures for employees and customers. For example, we've suspended all nonemergency and home appointments and limited the amount and nature of contact with customers during field appointments. We've also worked hand in hand with labor across the business and supported our employees with paid leave for COVID-19 diagnosis, quarantine and childcare. 
We suspended building-related service shutoffs, suspended late fees and have restored service to customers who were previously shut off for nonpayment. We're also working with customers who are experiencing financial hardships by offering customer assistance programs and access to low-income programs. Susan will cover this a bit more later but we've implemented actions to strengthen our liquidity and ensure access to capital. 
We also continue to execute on our core strategies such as making needed capital investment. We increased communications with public service commissions, customers and public officials. As the COVID-19 impact continues to be assessed, American Water will work constructively with public service commissions as they look to address utility response measures, customer protection and cost recovery for all regulated utilities in their jurisdictions. 
Finally, we provided a $500,000 donation to the American Water Charitable Foundation to help fund COVID-19 relief efforts across the United States. This was in addition to a $100,000 donation made to Feeding America to help support food banks. 
We understand we have a very important role during this crisis. We provide water and wastewater services for hygiene, hospitals, sanitation and fire protection. We thank all our employees for continuing to provide these essential services.
Moving on to first quarter results. The employees of American Water delivered solid results and further strengthened our low-risk profile and predictable growth story. Our first quarter 2020 adjusted earnings per share increased 9.8% compared to first quarter 2019. We invested capital of $457 million in the first quarter of 2020, which is a 36% increase over the same period last year. This increase is driven by the continued investment in our systems and the communities we serve along with more favorable construction weather this year versus last. 
As you know, we work hard to minimize the customer bill impacts of these investments through a continued focus on controlling O&M costs. I'll talk more in a moment about our regulated operations, our continuing progress on regulated acquisitions and their contributions to our long-term growth story. 
Our Market-Based Businesses were up $0.01 in earnings per share. This was due primarily to growth in customer contracts from Homeowner Services. As a reminder, in the third quarter of 2019, our Military Services Group was awarded 2 military contracts: Joint Base San Antonio in Texas and the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. We're on track to assume operations by the second quarter of 2020. 
Moving to Slide 7. The foundation of our earnings growth continues to be the capital investment we make in our regulated operations to provide clean, safe and reliable service to our customers. We believe that long-term financial success depends on effectively executing the fundamentals of our business every day. We plan to invest $20 billion to $22 billion in capital over the next 10 years to ensure the quality and reliability of our services and to bring water and wastewater solutions to communities across the country. 
We're affirming our long-term EPS compound annual growth rate in the 7% to 10% range. We also expect our 2020 adjusted earnings to be in the range of $3.79 to $3.89 per share. This is the same range we communicated in February, which should have been identified as an adjusted EPS range. Our GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $3.85 to $3.95 per share. In her comments, Susan will provide additional information about the difference between our GAAP and adjusted guidance ranges. 
Also consistent with our previous dividend guidance, on April 29, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend payment from $0.50 per share to $0.55 per share, a 10% increase. We understand that a secure and growing dividend is important to our shareholders, while striking the right balance with continued investment in our regulated operations.
Turning to Slide 8. Let's walk through some of the regulatory highlights of the first quarter of 2020. Pennsylvania American Water filed a general rate case last week, requesting $92 million in the first year and $46 million in the second year. Since our last case in 2017, Pennsylvania American Water will have invested $1.64 billion in infrastructure upgrades for the 4-year period of 2019 through 2022, including replacing more than 427 miles of aging water and sewer pipes. The case also includes enhancements to our customer assistance program. Traditionally, the Public Utility Commission's review of the filing may take up to 9 months and new rates would not be effective until 2021. 
Also in Pennsylvania, the Public Utility Commission approved the company's revision to its wastewater DSIC. This action allows the DSIC to be applied to another 50,000 wastewater customers effective May 1. 
We also have 3 pending rate cases in New Jersey, Virginia and California. New Jersey American Water filed a general rate case in December 2019 requesting an overall revenue increase of approximately $88 million excluding the revenue from DSIC. Since our last rate case, we've invested more than $1 billion in system upgrades. 
Virginia American Water filed a general rate case requesting an overall revenue increase of $5.6 million in November 2018. This case was driven by approximately $98 million in infrastructure upgrades since April 2017. Interim rates became effective on May 1, 2019, and we expect a decision later this year. 
Moving west, California American Water filed for new rates in July 2019. The case covers 2021 through 2023 and requests an increase in authorized revenue of $46.6 million over 3 years. The request seeks $197 million for infrastructure improvements planned for 2021 and 2022. Due to COVID-19, the evidentiary hearings were moved from April and May to early June with final hearing dates expected in late August. We now expect a decision on this case as early as first quarter of 2021. In addition, we filed a motion for interim rates to be effective back to January 1, 2021. 
On the legislative front, during the quarter, Indiana Governor Holcomb signed 2 bills. The first one authorizes recovery for aboveground infrastructure without a full rate case. And the second establishes an appraisal process for nonmunicipal utilities to establish fair value and a reasonable purchase price. 
In West Virginia, Governor Justice has signed the Water and Wastewater Investment and Infrastructure Improvement Act. Effective June 5, this legislation creates a voluntary process to use fair value assessments to determine the value of the water or wastewater systems, enables combined water and wastewater ratemaking, and expands how municipalities can use the proceeds they receive from selling utility assets to better address needs in their communities. 
Finally in Virginia, Governor Northam signed fair market value legislation, which will go into effect on July 1. This is now the ninth state that has adopted fair market value legislation across our footprint. 
All this legislation is focused on helping communities and utilities address water and wastewater challenges.
Moving on Slide 9. Customers remain at the center of every decision we make today and into the future. This means smart investments balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. As I mentioned earlier, in the first quarter, we invested $457 million with a majority in our Regulated Businesses, including $432 million in infrastructure investment and $21 million in regulated acquisitions. 
As we make these critical investments to maintain reliable service, we must also ensure affordability for our customers. We'll continue to focus on O&M efficiency and work toward our O&M efficiency goal of 31.3% by 2024. For the 12-month period ended March 31, 2020, our O&M efficiency ratio improved to 34.5% compared to 35.5% for the 12-month period ended March 31, 2019. 
Now to put this into perspective, our adjusted O&M expenses are just slightly higher today than they were in 2010. Since then, we've added approximately 276,000 customer connections while expenses only increased at a compound annual growth rate of 0.7%. We're very proud of our employees' focus and commitment to controlling costs on behalf of our customers, especially given the current situation and economic challenges some of our customers are now facing.
Moving on to Slide 10. We believe our commitment to putting customers first is a key to growing our regulated footprint. So far in 2020, we've closed on 5 acquisitions in 4 different states, adding about 6,200 new customer connections. We've also added more than 3,200 customer connections through organic growth in the first quarter. We look forward to adding another 45,800 customer connections through currently signed agreements in 8 states, most of which we expect to close this year in 2020. These new agreements reflect our commitment to provide water and wastewater solutions to communities across our footprint. 
And with that, let me now turn it over to Susan."
250885,661837677,2016900,"American Water Works Company, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 07, 2020",2020-05-07,"Earnings Calls","American Water Works Company, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Walter. And good morning, everyone. Let me first start on Slide 12 with a bit more detail on results for the quarter. First quarter 2020 consolidated GAAP earnings were $0.68 per share compared to $0.62 per share in 2019. In the first quarter o",1600,"Thank you, Walter. And good morning, everyone. Let me first start on Slide 12 with a bit more detail on results for the quarter. First quarter 2020 consolidated GAAP earnings were $0.68 per share compared to $0.62 per share in 2019. In the first quarter of 2020, GAAP earnings were adjusted for depreciation expense that would have been recorded in the quarter related to the New York subsidiary assets having not been classified for accounting purposes as assets held for sale. Also 2019 GAAP earnings were adjusted for a reduction in the settlement liability related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill. Excluding these 2 adjustments, earnings per share as adjusted increased $0.06 per share or 9.8% driven primarily by growth in the regulated business. 
The regulated business segment results increased $0.08 per share or an increase of 13.6% compared to 2019 earnings. The market-based business results increased $0.01 per share. And the parent company decreased $0.03 per share compared to 2019 primarily reflecting higher interest expense to support growth in the business.
Moving on Slide 13. Regulated operations increased $0.08 per share in total. We saw a $0.14 per share increase from additional authorized revenue and surcharges to support infrastructure investment, acquisition and organic growth. 
O&M expense increased $0.06 per share and depreciation increased $0.03 per share, both to support regulated acquisitions and growth. Also, results reflect a $0.03 per share benefit primarily related to lower pension expense from a higher assumed return on assets used to set expense for 2020. 
The Market-Based Businesses first quarter result increased compared to 2019 primarily by the Homeowner Services Group's organic growth and contract price increases. Also, as Walter already mentioned, we expect Joint Base San Antonio and the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York to resume operations by the second quarter of 2020. 
And finally, the parent results decreased $0.03 per share primarily reflecting higher interest expense to support growth in the regulated business.
Moving on to Slide 14. The Regulated Businesses received $53 million in annualized new revenue in 2020. This includes $18 million from step increases and $35 million from infrastructure surcharges. We have also filed requests and are awaiting final orders on 4 rate cases and 3 infrastructure surcharge proceedings for a total annualized revenue request of $224 million. The continued successful execution of our regulatory strategy is a key element of our ability to consistently deliver on these financial results. 
And before I wrap up on Slide 15, let me add a few additional thoughts related to the expected implications of COVID-19. First, as it relates to demand for our services, American Water has a predominantly residential customer base. Residential revenues including bulk sales are about 69%. Commercial is 21% mostly in the food and beverage sector. And industrial is only 4% of our total revenue. Our very early indications are that our residential load is higher, and our commercial and industrial loads are trending down as business close -- businesses closed and certain other slowdowns occur. 
Disconnections and late fees have been suspended and disconnection notices have stopped as Walter mentioned earlier. We have also reconnected customers previously disconnected for nonpayment and suspended reconnection fees. This is critical to our customers as they work through this difficult situation, and we currently don't expect the impact of this temporary measure to be material. It's too early to tell how customers' overall ability to pay will be impacted by COVID-19, so estimating uncollectible accounts exposure to this risk is not yet possible. 
As is evidenced by regulatory actions across the country to date, we expect issues like this will be addressed timely and certainly in future rate cases at the very least. We will work closely with regulators in our jurisdictions on how the cost of this pandemic will be treated for recovery purposes. 
As Walter mentioned, we invested capital of $457 million in the first quarter of 2020 to better serve our customers. At this point, we believe our regularly scheduled capital projects will continue as planned, perhaps with some slowdowns that could be made up later in the year. So I don't believe we'll have any adjustments to our 2020 CapEx levels at this time. 
We continue to monitor our key suppliers and today have had no major disruptions to our supply chain. Our key distributors are reporting an excess inventory of materials like pipes, valves, hydrates, couplings. And our chemical providers are meeting our needs and are reporting those shortages as of this point. 
As we think about the impact of COVID-19 on our Market-Based Businesses, for military services, O&M operations currently continue as normal subject to each installation's individual requirement. As you know, our services are deemed essential. So we continue to do what the Department of Defense has hired us to do, which is to deliver safe, clean and reliable water to our military-based partners. 
For Homeowner Services, while development of new partner relationships may be delayed for a while, we believe we can maintain our customer base during periods of economic downturn. And that homeowners really do see value in these products that protect them against large unexpected expenses. 
And perhaps maybe one final comment before I talk about how we've addressed liquidity. I'd simply mention that our pension plans were funded at just over 80% as of year-end 2019. And though there has been much volatility in the equity markets as you all know, I'd remind you that the pension obligation remeasurement will be done at the end of 2020. 
Moving to Slide 16 as it relates liquidity. Obviously, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a great deal of uncertainty and volatility in the debt capital markets. And like many others, we experienced some constraints in the commercial paper market, and we have now seen a large -- a general loosening in that area. We've been focused on liquidity since the situation really accelerated. In addition to our existing $2.25 billion revolving credit facility that supports working capital needs and capital spending, on March 20, we entered into a $750 million 364-day term loan at a very favorable rate of LIBOR plus 80 basis points. And we have drawn on that term loan at $500 million, and we're holding that amount in cash currently. 
As part of our planned financing for 2020, we executed on the issuance of $1 billion in long-term debt on April 14. The issue consisted of $500 million in 2.8% coupon senior notes due 2030 and $500 million in 3.45% coupon senior notes due 2050. The proceeds from the long-term debt issuance were used primarily to repay outstanding commercial paper obligations and outstanding draws against our revolving credit facility. We're confident we have sufficient liquidity available for the foreseeable future, with $2.8 billion available at the end of April.
Moving on to Slide 17, let me summarize now. As Walter said, we expect our 2020 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $3.79 to $3.89 per share, which is consistent with the guidance range we last announced in February 2020 and which should have been identified as an adjusted guidance range at that time. Our 2020 GAAP earnings guidance range is $3.85 to $3.95 per share. The difference of $0.06 relates to the expected annual depreciation on the New York subsidiary assets, which have been presented as assets held for sale. With the accounting treatment of assets held for sale, GAAP requires the depreciation fees on those assets, and the only adjustment currently anticipated between our expected GAAP results and our expected adjusted earnings per share result is that $0.06 of depreciation expense. We have reflected $0.01 per share of that in the first quarter reconciliation of GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS. 
As Walter also mentioned, we are affirming our long-term earnings compounded annual growth rate expectation on an earnings per share basis of a range of 7% to 10% while investing capital in the range of $8.8 billion to $9.4 billion over the next 5 years. The decades of capital investment need continue and drives our $20 billion to $22 billion of investment over the next 10 years. 
The fragmented water and wastewater landscape continues to provide what we see as a growing pipeline for acquisition. The capital-light Market-Based Businesses continue to increase customer experience and generate cash. And simply put, our business model and resulting investment thesis is built on fundamentals. And though all segments of the economy are being impacted by this crisis, we see our business as quite resilient, and we have built it in a way to endure challenges like this. 
Finally, moving on to Slide 18. While working through these very difficult and turbulent times, we continue to deliver strong consolidated results. Our total company consolidated actual return on equity is 10.6% for the 12 months ended March 31, 2020. Regulatory execution, along with strong results from our market-based businesses, allows us to consistently deliver on our earnings commitment. We believe that delivering on results combined with our strong earnings growth and superior dividend growth expectations continue to provide excellent value for our investors. 
We continue to be a top leader in dividend growth. With our announced increase in the dividend of 10%, we have grown our dividend at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 10% or more over the last 5 years. And we expect to continue that growth well into the 7% to 10% range. Also, we continue to target a dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60% of earnings. 
And with that, let me simply turn it back to Walter for a few additional remarks."

We've also had a significant increase in customer satisfaction. We've achieved all this since the beginning of the year. 
Our company will emerge strong from this COVID-19 pandemic. How we've worked together throughout this crisis will have a lasting positive impact on our culture of trust and teamwork.

Let me make just a few comments, Durgesh. And again, I would reiterate it is early. And as we think about across all of our jurisdictions, the various states implemented restrictions and stay-at-home orders at different times. So obviously depending on when that occurred in each of our jurisdictions, that's going to impact when we really started to see a shift in demand expectations. 
I'd again reiterate what I said in our prepared remarks. Roughly 70% of our load is residential. And as you can imagine, obviously folks are at home. So we are seeing in our early data that residential sales are up. And again, I hesitate to quantify it because it's still so early. In some cases, we may have 6 weeks' worth of demand data. In other cases, we may only have 3 or 4 weeks, again depending on when those measures were put in place. And in some cases, we have real-time meters, some cases we don't, so we have to wait until we have actual billing data. But we certainly are seeing residential usage up. 
On the commercial side, again it depends on the jurisdiction and it depends on the mix of customers in a particular state. But as you can imagine, commercial is trending down because of business closures, restaurants closing, et cetera. 
And on the industrial side, while in a particular state it could be a material change, and I'll give you an example in Kentucky. We've got a large plant there, an auto manufacturer. So in the state of Kentucky, we're seeing a pretty substantial decline in industrial sales because of the concentration there. But overall, our industrial sales makeup is only about 4% of our total. 
So again, as you sort of roll all that together, residential is up. The other 2 are down. Our current thinking is that they may tend to offset each other. But I think it also depends on how long this goes. It depends on sort of a variety of factors in each of the jurisdictions. So again, I'm not getting direct until you quantify it, but hopefully a bit more color there is helpful. 
On the collections side, again I'd say it's too early to really see much on the regulated side. And we certainly haven't seen anything on the market-based side either that gives us immediate concern about collection. On the market-based side in particular, I don't think we expect much in the way of difficulties there. Again, we think customers appreciate and are willing to sort of stay with these programs because it helps them avoid unexpected future expenditures. So we're quite confident we'll be able to retain customers, and with that goes the ability to collect on the fees under those contracts."

On our 2 new bases, we've been in transition services since we got the award. And we work very well at both installations with Joint Base San Antonio and West Point showing the value to the communities. And we're going to be starting full operations, as I said in my prepared remarks, in the second quarter. So I think it's the trust and confidence that they have in our Military Services Group to take over their water and wastewater systems and do it in a professional and an amazing way as our group does with our Military Services Group. 
So again, we're really proud to have those 2 new installations, particularly West Point, one of the most important military installations in the country. I'm a graduate of West Point, right? I'd like to say that. 
But no, we're really proud of our Military Services Group. They've developed a tremendous reputation in brand with the government. And I think it's the confidence that they have in our group that has moved those forward as quickly as we have."

And then just -- driving on just the last question here, when you look at the guidance for the year of $3.79 to $3.89, and you look into the model and you also think back to the Analyst Day of how the company now intends to issue equity at some point over the next 5 years, debt to capital is targeted to come down to the 59% to 61 -- to 60% range over time. And then we have a CapEx plan and then there's also COVID now. 
And at least in my model when you start to bring down diluted earnings per share below that $3.79 figure into the low $3.70s, the flow-through impact of that is that your cash, your operating cash drops. And you either need to make up for that by issuing debt which will increase your debt to total capital, before you issue more equity which could possibly dilute the EPS growth rate, or you peel back on Capex. And no one knows what -- I mean you guys are doing a great job obviously so far, but no one knows, right? It could go on for a long time. It could be really unfavorable. 
So let's just assume a doomsday scenario. What would be the -- where would the company look to try to remedy the situation but also try to keep the long-term growth guidance in range? Does the company say, okay, we're going to let our debt ratios maybe kind of list at risk of further credit downgrades? Why don't we issue more equity? Do we peel back Capex?

We have a lot to cover today, and we thought it might be helpful to first address the impacts of COVID-19 in our operations and our estimates of the financial impact so far. As we've done since the onset of this health emergency, American water continues to provide essential water and wastewater services to our customers. And we know the critical role we play in helping our customers and communities through this pandemic. As we relate on our first quarter call, we remain focused in 3 areas. The first is the care and safety of our employees and their families. The second is the safety of our customers and the communities we serve. And the third is the execution of our preparedness plans. We can continue to provide essential services and help our communities get through the pandemic. 
With recent surges of COVID-19 cases in many parts of our country, the measures we took early on remain in place while adding additional measures. These include employee health screenings prior to coming to work, social distancing, suspension of all nonemergency in-home appointments, limiting the amount and nature of contact with customers during field appointments and a required work-from-home policy for nonessential employees where possible. Because the number of cases varies across our footprint, we're taking into account CDC and local and state guidance as we work on plans to return to a more normal state of operation when possible with safety as the primary driver. 
As you know, we were among the first utilities to suspend shutoffs and late fees prior to any orders being issued by states. We continue to work with customers who are experiencing financial hardships by offering customer assistance programs and access to low-income programs. Susan will cover this in greater detail, but we're working constructively with public service commissions as they look to address utility response measures, customer protections and cost recovery for regulated utilities in their jurisdictions. 
Additionally, our liquidity and access to capital remains strong, and we continue our disciplined approach to execute on our core strategies, such as making needed capital investment. Finally, American Water and the American Water Charitable Foundation continue to help the communities we serve, giving more than $400,000 in charitable contributions over the past 3 months to help mitigate impacts of COVID-19 in the communities we serve. Before I ask Susan to discuss the financial impacts of COVID-19 so far, I want to thank our employees, not only for their tremendous effort throughout the pandemic but also for what they've done all year to stay safe and provide essential service to the communities we serve. 
Now let me turn the call over to Susan."

Slide 6 summarizes the estimated impact of the pandemic on results through June 30, 2020. We've seen an estimated 5% increase in residential customer volumetric demand over this period that we think is directly",805,"Thanks, Walter, and good morning, everyone. Slide 6 summarizes the estimated impact of the pandemic on results through June 30, 2020. We've seen an estimated 5% increase in residential customer volumetric demand over this period that we think is directly related to the impact of COVID-19, as many of our customers have been working from home and/or sheltered in place because of the pandemic. Likewise, we have seen commercial and industrial demand weakened by about 13% and 7%, respectively, as our best estimate of the impact of COVID-19 over this period as many businesses have shuttered. And I'd simply remind you that we are about 70% residential on an annual revenue basis. As Walter mentioned, we discontinued service shutoffs that would normally occur due to nonpayment and are no longer charging late fees. As a result, those revenue categories are also down. 
Also, we've incurred some incremental operating costs to keep our employees and customers safe and have seen some increase in uncollectible accounts expense. The total estimated impact of the lost demand, foregone revenue and increased cost is estimated at about $21 million, which equates to about $15 million after-tax or $0.09 per share before considering the accounting for future recovery. We've been working with regulators across our entire service territory alongside other utilities to address how these impacts to cost of service and recovery should be addressed. 
As a result of those discussions and regulatory orders received to date, at June 30, 2020, we have recorded a net regulatory asset of $12 million for future recovery, which represents a significant portion of the total estimated impact. After considering the accounting for future recovery, the impact resulting from COVID-19 year-to-date is an estimated $0.05 per share in total. 
Let's turn to Slide 7 to look at some of the specific regulatory activities. As we said, we've been in discussions on behalf of our customers with public service commissions across our service area. Currently, 10 of our 14 regulatory jurisdictions have issued orders to address the impacts of COVID-19, authorizing deferral of incremental costs and certain other financial impacts resulting from the implementation of moratorium on shutoffs and disconnections. Four states, Missouri, New York, Tennessee and Kentucky have pending proceedings, where we also expect to receive authority to capture the financial impacts of COVID-19. The as a result of the orders received and expected actions by regulators, as I mentioned, we've recorded $12 million for future recovery, primarily related to foregone revenues from reconnect and late fees and estimated uncollectible accounts expense. Now as it relates to the demand for our services, American Water has a predominantly residential customer base. As I mentioned just a minute ago. As noted, our residential load is higher, and our commercial and industrial loads have trended down due to business closures. We estimate that the net demand loss directly related to COVID-19 to be approximately $10 million through June 30. This lost revenue is being tracked in each of our utilities. We believe that this lost demand relates directly to the pandemic. And while we've conservatively not recorded a regulatory asset at a consolidated level for future recovery, we believe we have strong arguments and good opportunity to recover the lost revenue in our future COVID-19 or other filings. This lost revenue was essentially $0.04 per share of the total $0.05 per share estimated unfavorable impact from COVID-19 in the quarter and year-to-date periods. 
We will work diligently to seek recovery of these lost revenues as we think that makes more sense than making arbitrary cost reductions that could have longer-term impacts on service delivery. As we think about the impact of COVID-19 on our Market Based businesses for military services, O&M operations currently continue as normal, subject to each installations individual requirements. Our services are deemed essential so we continue to deliver safe, clean and reliable water and essential wastewater services to our Military Based partners. 
For Homeowner Services, there has been some delay in new partner relationships and some delays in the launch of new products that we attribute directly to COVID-19. And the estimated impact of those delays is about $0.01 per share year-to-date. We believe we can maintain our customer base during this period of economic downturn because homeowners see value in these products that protect them against large unexpected expenses. And perhaps just a couple of final comments before I turn it back to Walter. We are executing on our capital investment plan for the year and are looking for additional ways to assist communities' needs as we go forward. And we continue to remain confident we have sufficient liquidity available for the foreseeable future with $2.3 billion available at the end of June. 
And let me turn it back to Walter for a discussion of the remainder of the results for the quarter."

Through trying tim",1543,"Yes. Thanks, Susan. Let's move on to second quarter and 6-month results as it's been an eventful year-to-date with several key rate cases, significant capital investment, multiple acquisitions and a sharp focus on business fundamentals. Through trying times, once again, the employees of American Water delivered solid results and further strengthened our low-risk profile and predictable growth story. 
Our second quarter 2020 GAAP earnings per share increased 3.2% compared to second quarter 2019. Included in GAAP results are $0.02 per share for depreciation not recorded due to assets held for sale and an estimated $0.05 per share unfavorable impact from COVID-19 pandemic. We invested capital of $930 million in the first half of 2020, which is a 17% increase over the same period last year. This increase is driven by the continued investment in our systems and the communities we serve along with more favorable construction weather this year versus last. We also continue to work hard to minimize the customer bill impacts of these investments by controlling O&M costs. We continue our disciplined approach to regulated acquisitions. 
We've added more than 17,700 customer connections to date through closed acquisitions and organic growth, and look forward to welcoming an additional 43,600 customer connections through pending acquisitions, most of which we expect to close in 2020. Our Market Based businesses were up $0.01 in earnings per share, reflecting year-to-date price increases and organic growth from Homeowner Services. We're also very honored to assume operations of Joint Basin San Antonio and Texas and the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York in the second quarter of 2020. 
Moving to Slide 9. The foundation of our earnings growth continues to be the capital investment we make in our regulated operations to provide clean, safe and reliable water and wastewater services to our customers. Our strategy remains consistent as we plan to invest $20 billion to $22 billion in capital over the next 10 years to ensure the quality and reliability of our services and to bring water and wastewater solutions to communities across the United States. We're affirming our long-term EPS compound annual growth rate in the 7% to 10% range, and we expect our 2020 GAAP earnings to be in the range of $3.79 to $3.89 per share. 
Susan will talk more about that in a few minutes. Also, consistent with our previous dividend guidance on July 29, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.55 per share of common stock payable on September 1, 2020. 
Turning to Slide 10. Let's walk through some of the regulatory highlights of the second quarter 2020. On June 30, Missouri American Water filed a rate request with the Missouri Public Service Commission. The case includes $920 million in water system improvements and $30 million in sewer system improvements from January 2018 and to May 2022. This includes the replacement of approximately 275 miles of aging water and sewer pipes as well as the upgrading of treatment plants, storage tanks, wells and pumping stations across the state. The company's request is expected to take 11 months to complete, and any new rates would not become effective until mid-2021. Pennsylvania American Water filed a general rate case in April, requesting $92 million in the first year and $46 million in the second year. Since our last case in 2017, Pennsylvania American Water will have invested $1.6 billion in infrastructure upgrades for the 4-year period of 2019 through 2022, including replacing more than 427 miles of aging water and sewer pipes. 
Traditionally, the Public Utility Commission's review of the filing may take up to 9 months, and new rates would not be effective until 2021. New Jersey American Water filed a general rate case in December 2019, requesting an overall revenue increase of approximately $88 million, excluding the revenue from DSIC. Since our last rate case, we will have invested more than $1 billion in system upgrades in New Jersey. Virginia American Water filed a general rate case requesting an overall revenue increase of $5.6 million in November 2018. This case was driven by approximately $98 million in infrastructure upgrades since April 2017, and we expect the decision later this year. 
Now let me turn to California where there's been quite a bit of activity. California American Water filed for new rates in July 2019. The case covers 2021 through 2023 and requests an increase in authorized revenue of $46.6 million over 3 years. The request seeks $197 million for infrastructure improvements planned for 2021 and 2022. Due to COVID-19, we now expect the decision on this case in the first quarter of 2021. In addition, we filed a motion for interim rates to be effective back to January 1, 2021. Also, our Monterey Peninsula Water Supply project is now scheduled to go before the California Coastal Commission for approval in mid-September. In early July, the California Public Utility Commission released a proposed decision on a low-income rate payer assistance proceeding with a common period currently underway and possible vote in August. The decision would require California American Water to file a proposal to alter its water revenue adjustment mechanism known as RAM in its next general rate case filing in July 2022, becoming effective in January 2024. RAMs are mechanisms commonly used across utility sectors and really have proven critical to promoting conservation and infrastructure investment. From our experience, we believe the best way to address concerns with the impacts of RAMs is to improve forecasting and the rate making process. We're hopeful issues with the proposed decision will be resolved before the decision is voted on. If the proposed decision is adopted as is, California American Water will consider options when they file their next rate case in 2022, which would affect rates starting in 2024. 
On the legislative front this year, I would highlight 2 bills that were signed by the Governor of Indiana. The first one authorizes recovery for above-ground infrastructure without a full rate case and the second establishes an appraisal process for non municipal utilities to establish fair value and a reasonable purchase price. 
Additionally, Missouri passed a Water Safety and Security Act. Which requires most water utilities with up to 30,000 customers to establish a cybersecurity plan and a valve and hydro inspection program. This is similar to legislation that exists in Indiana and New Jersey. Finally, the sale of New York American Water continues to progress, and we anticipate the closing of the acquisition by Liberty Utilities in early 2021. 
Moving on to Slide 11. Customers remain at the center of every decision we make today and into the future. This means smart investments, balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. As I mentioned earlier, in the first half of this year, we invested a total of $930 million, with the majority in our regulated businesses, including $881 million in infrastructure investment and $40 million in regulated acquisitions. 
As we make these critical investments to maintain reliable service, we must also ensure affordability for our customers. We'll continue to focus on O&M efficiency and work toward our O&M efficiency goal of 31.3% by 2024. For the 12-month period ending June 30, 2020, our O&M efficiency ratio improved to 34.3% compared to 35.2% for the 12-month period ended June 30, 2019. Our adjusted O&M expenses are just slightly higher today than they were in 2010. Since then, we've added approximately 281,000 customer connections while expenses only increased at a compound annual growth rate of 0.8%. We're very proud of our employees' focus and commitment to controlling costs on behalf of our customers, especially given the current economic challenges some of our customers are facing. 
Moving on to Slide 12. We believe our commitment to putting customers first is a key to growing our regulated footprint. So far in 2020, we've closed on 13 acquisitions in 6 different states, adding approximately 10,800 new customer connections. We've also added more than 6,900 customer connections to organic growth in the first 6 months. We look forward to adding another 43,600 customer connections through currently signed agreements in 9 states, most of which we expect to close in 2020. These new agreements reflect our commitment to provide water and wastewater solutions to communities across our footprint. We know that many communities are facing unprecedented challenges now. And so we're pleased when we're able to help. 
This includes our recent acquisition in the Village of Shiloh wastewater system in Illinois. This is another example of acquiring the wastewater system in an area where we provided water services for decades. According to the Village Mayor, James Renier, the sale of the wastewater system to Illinois American Water ""allows the village to focus on other priorities."" He also went on to say: ""Illinois American water has provided excellent water service to our residents for many decades. We look forward to expanding our partnership."" we're very disciplined in our approach to acquisitions, leveraging our tremendous expertise to find solutions for communities. We now have about 800,000 customer opportunities in our pipeline as many communities are seeking solutions to increase challenges, which include regulatory, financial and those posed by COVID-19 in managing water and wastewater systems. 
And with that, let me now turn the call over to Susan."

Second quarter 2020 consolidated GAAP earnings were $0.97 per share compared to $0.94 per share in 2019. As Walter mentioned, included in GAAP earnings is $0.02 per share for depreciation not recorded due to assets held for sale accounting and the estimated $0.05 per share unfavorable impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. The regulated business segment results increased $0.10 per share or an increase of 11.5% compared to 2019 earnings. The market-based business results increased $0.01 per share, and the parent company decreased $0.08 per share compared to 2019. Our 2020 GAAP earnings through June 30 were $1.65 per share or a 5.8% increase over the same period last year. In the 6-month period, results include $0.03 related to depreciation not recorded due to assets held for sale and an estimated $0.05 per share unfavorable impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. Our Regulated Businesses increased $0.18 per share. Our Market Based businesses increased $0.02 per share, primarily from Homeowner Services. And finally, the [ parent ] results decreased by $0.11 per share year-over-year. 
Moving to Slide 15. Let me walk through the second quarter results by business. Regulated operations increased $0.14 per share before considering the $0.04 per share estimated unfavorable impact from COVID-19 on the regulated business. We saw a $0.20 per share increase from additional authorized revenue and surcharge charges to support infrastructure investments, acquisitions and organic growth. Walter mentioned, as a reminder, that 2019 results included $0.04 per share of unusually wet weather in the regulated business. 
O&M expense increased $0.05 per share, and depreciation related to ongoing operations increased $0.07 per share, both to support regulated acquisitions and other growth. The Market Based businesses second quarter results in 2020 increased $0.02 per share compared to 2019 before considering the $0.01 estimated unfavorable impact from COVID-19 on the Market Based businesses. The increase was driven primarily by Homeowner Services group organic growth and contract price increases. 
Also during the second quarter, we are now fully operational on Joint Base San Antonio and the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. The parent results decreased $0.08 per share with $0.02 per share, reflecting higher interest expense to support growth in the regulated business. The remaining $0.06 per share was the $0.03 per share sale of a legacy investment that occurred in 2019 and timing of expenses and other items of $0.03 per share. 
And finally, on Slide 15, you'll see the total $0.05 per share estimated impact from COVID, as we've discussed. 
Moving to Slide 16. 6-month GAAP EPS increased 5.8% year-over-year, as I mentioned, and many of the drivers of the variances in the quarter noted previously also explained the year-over-year results. 
Moving to Slide 17. The Regulated Businesses received $80 million in annualized new revenues in 2020, and this includes $18 million from stepped increases and $62 million from infrastructure surcharges. We've also filed requests and are awaiting final orders on 5 rate cases, as Walter just walked you through and 2 infrastructure surcharge proceedings for a total annualized revenue request of $294 million. The continued successful execution of our regulatory strategy is a key element of our ability to consistently deliver financial results. 
Moving on to Slide '18. The company expects its 2020 earnings to be in the range of $3.79 per share to $3.89 per share on a GAAP basis. Included in this guidance range is the estimated $0.06 per share for depreciation not recorded as required by the accounting for assets held for sale and the estimated $0.05 to $0.08 per share unfavorable impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. The full year estimated impact of COVID-19 is highly dependent on the projected impact of a number of unknown factors, which include the length and severity of decreased demand for services and the nature and scope of regulatory solutions. 
Our current thoughts are that we start to see moderation in the impact on demand in the third quarter of 2020. This guidance range is the same range that was previously announced on an adjusted basis. But let me be clear, our 2020 expectation of results in the range of $3.79 to $3.89 per share is unchanged from prior expectations. We continue to believe this range is reflective of expected results on a normalized basis, normalized for the 2 unusual items in 2020 related to the depreciation issue and COVID-19. The we think that guiding to GAAP results, which include these 2 items, makes the message quite clear. And I also want to repeat what Walter said. We are affirming our long-term earnings compound annual growth rate expectation on an earnings per share basis of a range of 7% to 10% while investing capital in the range of $8.8 billion to $9.4 billion over the next 5 years. 
Finally, moving on to Slide '19. As we noted in the release, on July 29, 2020, the company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share of common stock payable on September 1, 2020. This reflects the continuation of the 10% increase in the annual dividend declared by the Board on April 29, 2020. We continue to be a top leader in dividend growth. We have grown our dividend at a compound annual growth rate of 10.1% over the last 5 years, and we expect to continue that growth at the high end of the 7% to 10% range. Also, we continue to target a dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60% of earnings. Our total company consolidated actual return on equity is 10.7% for the 12 months ended June 30, 2020. Regulatory execution, along with strong results from our Market Based businesses allows us to consistently deliver on our earnings commitment. We believe that delivering on results, combined with our strong earnings growth and superior dividend growth expectations continue to provide excellent value for our shareholders. 
To summarize, the decades of capital investment need continue and drives our planned $20 billion to $22 billion of capital investment over the next 10 years. With the fragmented water and wastewater landscape and the states and local communities continue to face added challenges from impacts of COVID-19, we believe we can provide those states and towns water and wastewater solutions to help mitigate those impacts. The capital-light Market Based businesses continue to improve customer experience and generate cash, and simply put, our business model and resulting investment thesis is built on fundamentals. And though all segments of the economy are being impacted by this health emergency, we see our business as resilient, and we have built it in a way to endure these challenges. And with that, let me turn the call back to Walter for a few additional remarks."

We now have a better insight as to what those COVID estimates are. But I think fundamentally, it's important to stay focused on that range of $3.79 to $3.89, which is where we believe we will end the year and whether you think about that as adjusted or as GAAP, I think it's important to note, that's what we believe to be sort of normalized operations.

I would give you relative to this that maybe add to Angie's response. If we were continuing to provide adjusted guidance, let's say, using that terminology. We would certainly look at these COVID costs as an item that we would adjust for. So they would be considered part of that adjusted guidance just like we have done New York. So we would be adjusting for them and essentially saying, they shouldn't be considered as part of normalized operations. And as we thought through that, we said, it just makes more sense to go straight to GAAP guidance and say, these are going to be the results on the books, and they happen to be exactly the same guidance we've been providing all along on a normalized basis, again, the $3.79 to $3.89. So we view this as literally no change in guidance. So again, that's how we think about guidance. As it relates to sort of recovery, again, we've got orders in 10 of 14 states, and we've got proceedings in the other 4 that we believe will allow us fully to seek recovery of all of the costs associated with COVID with the exception of the lost demand revenue. That is really the piece that ultimately falls through in that $0.05, the lost demand, $0.04 on the regulated side of the business. 
So again, we're going to continue to work with regulators on recovery of the lost demand dollars. And again, we think it makes sense to work through the regulatory process on recovery before we start to again, sort of arbitrarily reduce costs that again can have longer-term impacts on our ability to continue to deliver services. We think this is a an event that has occurred during this period, we're hoping that we start to see some moderation of that exposure in the third quarter, as I mentioned. So we believe there's some isolation to it. And we can again sort of work with regulators to seek recovery. And cost reductions, while we continue to focus heavily on them, as we've outlined here, we've made progress again on the O&M efficiency ratio.

I think commercial is probably the biggest variable, to be honest with you. As you think about restaurants and some of the smaller commercial enterprises, they're likely going to have a little bit longer recovery period. So I think that is the biggest variable. Our current view is that we'll see some of that moderation here in the third quarter.

The lost revenue piece is sort of another layer of challenge that we need to work through with regulators. And that may take a bit of time.

And as I mentioned in the script or in our prepared remarks, and it may have been sort of a subtle comment, at the state level, we are -- we have recorded these loss revenues as recoverable items.

We have a lot to cover today, and we thought it might be helpful to first address the impacts of COVID-19 in our operations and our estimates of the financial impact so far. As we've done since the onset of this health emergency, American Water continues to provide essential water and wastewater services to our customers. And we know the critical role we play in helping our customers and communities through this pandemic. As we relayed on our first quarter call, we remain focused in 3 areas: the first is the care and safety of our employees and their families. The second is the safety of our customers and the communities we serve. And the third is the execution of our preparedness plans. We can continue to provide essential services and help our communities get through the pandemic.
With recent surges of COVID-19 cases in many parts of our country, the measures we took early on remain in place while adding additional measures. These include employee health screenings prior to coming to work, social distancing, suspension of all nonemergency in-home appointments, limiting the amount and nature of contact with customers during field appointments and a required work-from-home policy for nonessential employees where possible. Because the number of cases varies across our footprint, we're taking into account CDC and local and state guidance as we work on plans to return to a more normal state of operation when possible with safety as the primary driver.
As you know, we were among the first utilities to suspend shutoffs and late fees prior to any orders being issued by states. We continue to work with customers who are experiencing financial hardships by offering customer assistance programs and access to low-income programs. Susan will cover this in greater detail, but we're working constructively with public service commissions as they look to address utility response measures, customer protections and cost recovery for regulated utilities in their jurisdictions.
Additionally, our liquidity and access to capital remains strong, and we continue our disciplined approach to execute on our core strategies, such as making needed capital investment. 
Finally, American Water and the American Water Charitable Foundation continue to help the communities we serve, giving more than $400,000 in charitable contributions over the past 3 months to help mitigate impacts of COVID-19 in the communities we serve. 
Before I ask Susan to discuss the financial impacts of COVID-19 so far, I want to thank our employees, not only for their tremendous effort throughout the pandemic but also for what they've done all year to stay safe and provide essential service to the communities we serve.
Now let me turn the call over to Susan."

Slide 6 summarizes the estimated impact of the pandemic on results through June 30, 2020. We've seen an estimated 5% increase in residential customer volumetric demand over this period that we think is directly",802,"Thanks, Walter, and good morning, everyone. Slide 6 summarizes the estimated impact of the pandemic on results through June 30, 2020. We've seen an estimated 5% increase in residential customer volumetric demand over this period that we think is directly related to the impact of COVID-19, as many of our customers have been working from home and/or sheltered in place because of the pandemic. Likewise, we have seen commercial and industrial demand weakened by about 13% and 7%, respectively, as our best estimate of the impact of COVID-19 over this period as many businesses have shuttered. And I'd simply remind you that we are about 70% residential on an annual revenue basis. As Walter mentioned, we discontinued service shutoffs that would normally occur due to nonpayment and are no longer charging late fees. As a result, those revenue categories are also down.
Also, we've incurred some incremental operating costs to keep our employees and customers safe and have seen some increase in uncollectible accounts expense. The total estimated impact of the lost demand, foregone revenue and increased cost is estimated at about $21 million, which equates to about $15 million after-tax or $0.09 per share before considering the accounting for future recovery. We've been working with regulators across our entire service territory alongside other utilities to address how these impacts to cost of service and recovery should be addressed.
As a result of those discussions and regulatory orders received to date, at June 30, 2020, we have recorded a net regulatory asset of $12 million for future recovery, which represents a significant portion of the total estimated impact. After considering the accounting for future recovery, the impact resulting from COVID-19 year-to-date is an estimated $0.05 per share in total.
Let's turn to Slide 7 to look at some of the specific regulatory activities. As we said, we've been in discussions on behalf of our customers with public service commissions across our service area. Currently, 10 of our 14 regulatory jurisdictions have issued orders to address the impacts of COVID-19, authorizing deferral of incremental costs and certain other financial impacts resulting from the implementation of moratorium on shutoffs and disconnections. Four states, Missouri, New York, Tennessee and Kentucky have pending proceedings, where we also expect to receive authority to capture the financial impacts of COVID-19. As a result of the orders received and expected actions by regulators, as I mentioned, we've recorded $12 million for future recovery, primarily related to foregone revenues from reconnect and late fees and estimated uncollectible accounts expense. 
Now as it relates to the demand for our services, American Water has a predominantly residential customer base, as I mentioned just a minute ago. As noted, our residential load is higher, and our commercial and industrial loads have trended down due to business closures. We estimate that the net demand loss directly related to COVID-19 to be approximately $10 million through June 30. This lost revenue is being tracked in each of our utilities. We believe that this lost demand relates directly to the pandemic. And while we've conservatively not recorded a regulatory asset at a consolidated level for future recovery, we believe we have strong arguments and good opportunity to recover the lost revenue in our future COVID-19 or other filings. This lost revenue was essentially $0.04 per share of the total $0.05 per share estimated unfavorable impact from COVID-19 in the quarter and year-to-date periods.
We will work diligently to seek recovery of these lost revenues as we think that makes more sense than making arbitrary cost reductions that could have longer-term impacts on service delivery. As we think about the impact of COVID-19 on our Market-Based Businesses for military services, O&M operations currently continue as normal, subject to each installations individual requirements. Our services are deemed essential so we continue to deliver safe, clean and reliable water and essential wastewater services to our military-based partners.
For Homeowner Services, there has been some delay in new partner relationships and some delays in the launch of new products that we attribute directly to COVID-19. And the estimated impact of those delays is about $0.01 per share year-to-date. We believe we can maintain our customer base during this period of economic downturn because homeowners see value in these products that protect them against large unexpected expenses. 
And perhaps just a couple of final comments before I turn it back to Walter. We are executing on our capital investment plan for the year and are looking for additional ways to assist communities' needs as we go forward. And we continue to remain confident we have sufficient liquidity available for the foreseeable future with $2.3 billion available at the end of June.
And let me turn it back to Walter for a discussion of the remainder of the results for the quarter."

Through trying tim",1542,"Yes. Thanks, Susan. Let's move on to second quarter and 6-month results as it's been an eventful year-to-date with several key rate cases, significant capital investment, multiple acquisitions and a sharp focus on business fundamentals. Through trying times, once again, the employees of American Water delivered solid results and further strengthened our low-risk profile and predictable growth story.
Our second quarter 2020 GAAP earnings per share increased 3.2% compared to second quarter 2019. Included in GAAP results are $0.02 per share for depreciation not recorded due to assets held for sale and an estimated $0.05 per share unfavorable impact from COVID-19 pandemic. We invested capital of $930 million in the first half of 2020, which is a 17% increase over the same period last year. This increase is driven by the continued investment in our systems and the communities we serve along with more favorable construction weather this year versus last. We also continue to work hard to minimize the customer bill impacts of these investments by controlling O&M costs. We continue our disciplined approach to regulated acquisitions.
We've added more than 17,700 customer connections to date through closed acquisitions and organic growth, and look forward to welcoming an additional 43,600 customer connections through pending acquisitions, most of which we expect to close in 2020. Our Market Based businesses were up $0.01 in earnings per share, reflecting year-to-date price increases and organic growth from Homeowner Services. We're also very honored to assume operations of Joint Basin San Antonio and Texas and the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York in the second quarter of 2020.
Moving to Slide 9. The foundation of our earnings growth continues to be the capital investment we make in our regulated operations to provide clean, safe and reliable water and wastewater services to our customers. Our strategy remains consistent as we plan to invest $20 billion to $22 billion in capital over the next 10 years to ensure the quality and reliability of our services and to bring water and wastewater solutions to communities across the United States. We're affirming our long-term EPS compound annual growth rate in the 7% to 10% range, and we expect our 2020 GAAP earnings to be in the range of $3.79 to $3.89 per share.
Susan will talk more about that in a few minutes. Also, consistent with our previous dividend guidance on July 29, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.55 per share of common stock payable on September 1, 2020.
Turning to Slide 10. Let's walk through some of the regulatory highlights of the second quarter 2020. On June 30, Missouri American Water filed a rate request with the Missouri Public Service Commission. The case includes $920 million in water system improvements and $30 million in sewer system improvements from January 2018 and to May 2022. This includes the replacement of approximately 275 miles of aging water and sewer pipes as well as the upgrading of treatment plants, storage tanks, wells and pumping stations across the state. The company's request is expected to take 11 months to complete, and any new rates would not become effective until mid-2021. Pennsylvania American Water filed a general rate case in April, requesting $92 million in the first year and $46 million in the second year. Since our last case in 2017, Pennsylvania American Water will have invested $1.6 billion in infrastructure upgrades for the 4-year period of 2019 through 2022, including replacing more than 427 miles of aging water and sewer pipes.
Traditionally, the Public Utility Commission's review of the filing may take up to 9 months, and new rates would not be effective until 2021. New Jersey American Water filed a general rate case in December 2019, requesting an overall revenue increase of approximately $88 million, excluding the revenue from DSIC. Since our last rate case, we will have invested more than $1 billion in system upgrades in New Jersey. Virginia American Water filed a general rate case requesting an overall revenue increase of $5.6 million in November 2018. This case was driven by approximately $98 million in infrastructure upgrades since April 2017, and we expect the decision later this year.
Now let me turn to California where there's been quite a bit of activity. California American Water filed for new rates in July 2019. The case covers 2021 through 2023 and requests an increase in authorized revenue of $46.6 million over 3 years. The request seeks $197 million for infrastructure improvements planned for 2021 and 2022. Due to COVID-19, we now expect the decision on this case in the first quarter of 2021. In addition, we filed a motion for interim rates to be effective back to January 1, 2021. Also, our Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project is now scheduled to go before the California Coastal Commission for approval in mid-September. In early July, the California Public Utility Commission released a proposed decision on a low-income rate payer assistance proceeding with a common period currently underway and possible vote in August. The decision would require California American Water to file a proposal to alter its water revenue adjustment mechanism known as RAM in its next general rate case filing in July 2022, becoming effective in January 2024. RAMs are mechanisms commonly used across utility sectors, and really have proven critical to promoting conservation and infrastructure investment. From our experience, we believe the best way to address concerns with the impacts of RAMs is to improve forecasting and the rate making process. We're hopeful issues with the proposed decision will be resolved before the decision is voted on. If the proposed decision is adopted as is, California American Water will consider options when they file their next rate case in 2022, which would affect rates starting in 2024.
On the legislative front this year, I would highlight 2 bills that were signed by the Governor of Indiana. The first one authorizes recovery for above-ground infrastructure without a full rate case and the second establishes an appraisal process for non-municipal utilities to establish fair value and a reasonable purchase price.
Additionally, Missouri passed a Water Safety and Security Act. Which requires most water utilities with up to 30,000 customers to establish a cybersecurity plan and a valve and hydrant inspection program. This is similar to legislation that exists in Indiana and New Jersey. Finally, the sale of New York American Water continues to progress, and we anticipate the closing of the acquisition by Liberty Utilities in early 2021.
Moving on to Slide 11. Customers remain at the center of every decision we make today and into the future. This means smart investments, balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. As I mentioned earlier, in the first half of this year, we invested a total of $930 million, with the majority in our Regulated Businesses, including $881 million in infrastructure investment and $40 million in regulated acquisitions.
As we make these critical investments to maintain reliable service, we must also ensure affordability for our customers. We'll continue to focus on O&M efficiency and work toward our O&M efficiency goal of 31.3% by 2024. For the 12-month period ending June 30, 2020, our O&M efficiency ratio improved to 34.3% compared to 35.2% for the 12-month period ended June 30, 2019. 
Our adjusted O&M expenses are just slightly higher today than they were in 2010. Since then, we've added approximately 281,000 customer connections while expenses only increased at a compound annual growth rate of 0.8%. We're very proud of our employees' focus and commitment to controlling costs on behalf of our customers, especially given the current economic challenges some of our customers are facing.
Moving on to Slide 12. We believe our commitment to putting customers first is a key to growing our regulated footprint. So far in 2020, we've closed on 13 acquisitions in 6 different states, adding approximately 10,800 new customer connections. We've also added more than 6,900 customer connections through organic growth in the first 6 months. We look forward to adding another 43,600 customer connections through currently signed agreements in 9 states, most of which we expect to close in 2020. These new agreements reflect our commitment to provide water and wastewater solutions to communities across our footprint. We know that many communities are facing unprecedented challenges now. And so we're pleased when we're able to help.
This includes our recent acquisition in the Village of Shiloh wastewater system in Illinois. This is another example of acquiring the wastewater system in an area where we provided water services for decades. According to the Village Mayor, James Vernier, the sale of the wastewater system to Illinois American Water ""allows the village to focus on other priorities."" He also went on to say: ""Illinois American Water has provided excellent water service to our residents for many decades. We look forward to expanding our partnership."" 
We're very disciplined in our approach to acquisitions, leveraging our tremendous expertise to find solutions for communities. We now have about 800,000 customer opportunities in our pipeline as many communities are seeking solutions to increase challenges, which include regulatory, financial and those posed by COVID-19 in managing water and wastewater systems.
And with that, let me now turn the call over to Susan."

Second quarter 2020 consolidated GAAP earnings were $0.97 per share compared to $0.94 per share in 2019. As Walter mentioned, included in GAAP earnings is $0.02 per share for depreciation not recorded due to assets held for sale accounting and the estimated $0.05 per share unfavorable impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Regulated Business segment results increased $0.10 per share or an increase of 11.5% compared to 2019 earnings. The Market-Based Business results increased $0.01 per share, and the parent company decreased $0.08 per share compared to 2019. 
Our 2020 GAAP earnings through June 30 were $1.65 per share or a 5.8% increase over the same period last year. In the 6-month period, results include $0.03 related to depreciation not recorded due to assets held for sale and an estimated $0.05 per share unfavorable impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. Our Regulated Businesses increased $0.18 per share. Our Market-Based Businesses increased $0.02 per share, primarily from Homeowner Services. And finally, the parent results decreased by $0.11 per share year-over-year.
Moving to Slide 15. Let me walk through the second quarter results by business. Regulated Operations increased $0.14 per share before considering the $0.04 per share estimated unfavorable impact from COVID-19 on the Regulated Business. We saw a $0.20 per share increase from additional authorized revenue and surcharge charges to support infrastructure investments, acquisitions and organic growth. Walter mentioned, as a reminder, that 2019 results included $0.04 per share of unusually wet weather in the Regulated Business.
O&M expense increased $0.05 per share, and depreciation related to ongoing operations increased $0.07 per share, both to support regulated acquisitions and other growth. The Market-Based Businesses second quarter results in 2020 increased $0.02 per share compared to 2019 before considering the $0.01 estimated unfavorable impact from COVID-19 on the Market-Based Businesses. The increase was driven primarily by Homeowner Services Group organic growth and contract price increases.
Also during the second quarter, we are now fully operational on Joint Base San Antonio and the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. The parent results decreased $0.08 per share with $0.02 per share, reflecting higher interest expense to support growth in the Regulated Business. The remaining $0.06 per share was the $0.03 per share sale of a legacy investment that occurred in 2019 and timing of expenses and other items of $0.03 per share.
And finally, on Slide 15, you'll see the total $0.05 per share estimated impact from COVID, as we've discussed.
Moving to Slide 16. 6-month GAAP EPS increased 5.8% year-over-year, as I mentioned, and many of the drivers of the variances in the quarter, noted previously, also explained the year-over-year results.
Moving to Slide 17. The Regulated Businesses received $80 million in annualized new revenues in 2020, and this includes $18 million from step increases and $62 million from infrastructure surcharges. We've also filed requests and are awaiting final orders on 5 rate cases, as Walter just walked you through and 2 infrastructure surcharge proceedings for a total annualized revenue request of $294 million. The continued successful execution of our regulatory strategy is a key element of our ability to consistently deliver financial results.
Moving on to Slide 18. The company expects its 2020 earnings to be in the range of $3.79 per share to $3.89 per share on a GAAP basis. Included in this guidance range is the estimated $0.06 per share for depreciation not recorded as required by the accounting for assets held for sale and the estimated $0.05 to $0.08 per share unfavorable impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. The full year estimated impact of COVID-19 is highly dependent on the projected impact of a number of unknown factors, which include the length and severity of decreased demand for services and the nature and scope of regulatory solutions.
Our current thoughts are that we start to see moderation in the impact on demand in the third quarter of 2020. This guidance range is the same range that was previously announced on an adjusted basis. But let me be clear, our 2020 expectation of results in the range of $3.79 to $3.89 per share is unchanged from prior expectations. We continue to believe this range is reflective of expected result on a normalized basis, normalized for the 2 unusual items in 2020 related to the depreciation issue and COVID-19. The we think that guiding to GAAP results, which include these 2 items, makes the message quite clear. And I also want to repeat what Walter said. We are affirming our long-term earnings compound annual growth rate expectation on an earnings per share basis of a range of 7% to 10% while investing capital in the range of $8.8 billion to $9.4 billion over the next 5 years.
Finally, moving on to Slide 19. As we noted in the release on July 29, 2020, the company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share of common stock payable on September 1, 2020. This reflects the continuation of the 10% increase in the annual dividend declared by the Board on April 29, 2020. We continue to be a top leader in dividend growth. We have grown our dividend at a compound annual growth rate of 10.1% over the last 5 years, and we expect to continue that growth at the high end of the 7% to 10% range. Also, we continue to target a dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60% of earnings. Our total company consolidated actual return on equity is 10.7% for the 12 months ended June 30, 2020. Regulatory execution, along with strong results from our Market-Based Businesses allows us to consistently deliver on our earnings commitment. We believe that delivering on results, combined with our strong earnings growth and superior dividend growth expectations continue to provide excellent value for our shareholders.
To summarize, the decades of capital investment need continue and drives our planned $20 billion to $22 billion of capital investment over the next 10 years. With the fragmented water and wastewater landscape and the states and local communities continue to face added challenges from impacts of COVID-19, we believe we can provide those states and towns water and wastewater solutions to help mitigate those impacts. The capital-light Market-Based Businesses continue to improve customer experience and generate cash, and simply put our business model and resulting investment thesis is built on fundamentals. And though all segments of the economy are being impacted by this health emergency, we see our business as resilient, and we have built it in a way to endure these challenges. And with that, let me turn the call back to Walter for a few additional remarks."

We now have a better insight as to what those COVID estimates are. But I think fundamentally, it's important to stay focused on that range of $3.79 to $3.89, which is where we believe we will end the year and whether you think about that as adjusted or as GAAP, I think it's important to note, that's what we believe to be sort of normalized operations. And that's what we've always said. We've gone to a GAAP guidance approach here, I think just to make it easier to understand and easier to follow what our guidance is.

But I guess just from an apples-to-apples comparison versus the range that you had given out on adjusted basis as the first quarter, it seems like either the COVID expense impact expectation is excluded from an apples-to-apples basis?

I would give you relative to this that maybe add to Angie's response. If we were continuing to provide adjusted guidance, let's say, using that terminology, we would certainly look at these COVID costs as an item that we would adjust for. So they would be considered part of that adjusted guidance just like we have done New York. So we would be adjusting for them and essentially saying, they shouldn't be considered as part of normalized operations. And as we thought through that, we said, it just makes more sense to go straight to GAAP guidance and say, these are going to be the results on the books, and they happen to be exactly the same guidance we've been providing all along on a normalized basis, again, the $3.79 to $3.89. So we view this as literally no change in guidance. So again, that's how we think about guidance. As it relates to sort of recovery, again, we've got orders in 10 of 14 states, and we've got proceedings in the other 4 that we believe will allow us fully to seek recovery of all of the costs associated with COVID with the exception of the lost demand revenue. That is really the piece that ultimately falls through in that $0.05, the lost demand, $0.04 on the regulated side of the business.
So again, we're going to continue to work with regulators on recovery of the lost demand dollars. And again, we think it makes sense to work through the regulatory process on recovery before we start to, again, sort of arbitrarily reduce costs that again can have longer-term impacts on our ability to continue to deliver services. We think this is an event that has occurred during this period, we're hoping that we start to see some moderation of that exposure in the third quarter, as I mentioned. So we believe there's some isolation to it. And we can again sort of work with regulators to seek recovery. And cost reductions, while we continue to focus heavily on them, as we've outlined here, we've made progress again on the O&M efficiency ratio. And we continue to focus very heavily on cost and our cost structure in the business, we think that's where our focus should be and not on sort of arbitrary reductions that could potentially affect our ability to deliver service."

To the extent we see lingering impacts into '21, we'll continue to talk about the impact of COVID and make it very transparent to you what those impacts might be and how we're addressing them, whether they be from a regulatory perspective or some other. I'm not saying that we'll adjust for them. Again, I'm a bit of a purist as it relates to reporting. I think GAAP results are the the best indicator of performance. And so we're -- we think transparency around GAAP results is the right approach, and that's what we're doing here."

Again, we've started to see employees return to work across our territory. We've seen industrial demand start to come back up. I think commercial is probably the biggest variable, to be honest with you. As you think about restaurants and some of the smaller commercial enterprises, they're likely going to have a little bit longer recovery period. So I think that is the biggest variable. 
Our current view is that we'll see some of that moderation here in the third quarter. So that $0.05 to $0.08 range we've given around COVID really reflects that set of assumptions that for the balance of the year, again, we should be able to sort of contain it within those -- that range.

We have a lot to cover today, and we thought it might be helpful to first address the impacts of COVID-19 in our operations and our estimates of the financial impact so far. As we've done since the onset of this health emergency, American Water continues to provide essential water and wastewater services to our customers. And we know the critical role we play in helping our customers and communities through this pandemic. As we relayed on our first quarter call, we remain focused in 3 areas: the first is the care and safety of our employees and their families. The second is the safety of our customers and the communities we serve. And the third is the execution of our preparedness plans. We can continue to provide essential services and help our communities get through the pandemic.
With recent surges of COVID-19 cases in many parts of our country, the measures we took early on remain in place while adding additional measures. These include employee health screenings prior to coming to work, social distancing, suspension of all nonemergency in-home appointments, limiting the amount and nature of contact with customers during field appointments and a required work-from-home policy for nonessential employees where possible. Because the number of cases varies across our footprint, we're taking into account CDC and local and state guidance as we work on plans to return to a more normal state of operation when possible with safety as the primary driver.
As you know, we were among the first utilities to suspend shutoffs and late fees prior to any orders being issued by states. We continue to work with customers who are experiencing financial hardships by offering customer assistance programs and access to low-income programs. Susan will cover this in greater detail, but we're working constructively with public service commissions as they look to address utility response measures, customer protections and cost recovery for regulated utilities in their jurisdictions.
Additionally, our liquidity and access to capital remains strong, and we continue our disciplined approach to execute on our core strategies, such as making needed capital investment. 
Finally, American Water and the American Water Charitable Foundation continue to help the communities we serve, giving more than $400,000 in charitable contributions over the past 3 months to help mitigate impacts of COVID-19 in the communities we serve. 
Before I ask Susan to discuss the financial impacts of COVID-19 so far, I want to thank our employees, not only for their tremendous effort throughout the pandemic but also for what they've done all year to stay safe and provide essential service to the communities we serve.
Now let me turn the call over to Susan."

Slide 6 summarizes the estimated impact of the pandemic on results through June 30, 2020. We've seen an estimated 5% increase in residential customer volumetric demand over this period that we think is directly",802,"Thanks, Walter, and good morning, everyone. Slide 6 summarizes the estimated impact of the pandemic on results through June 30, 2020. We've seen an estimated 5% increase in residential customer volumetric demand over this period that we think is directly related to the impact of COVID-19, as many of our customers have been working from home and/or sheltered in place because of the pandemic. Likewise, we have seen commercial and industrial demand weakened by about 13% and 7%, respectively, as our best estimate of the impact of COVID-19 over this period as many businesses have shuttered. And I'd simply remind you that we are about 70% residential on an annual revenue basis. As Walter mentioned, we discontinued service shutoffs that would normally occur due to nonpayment and are no longer charging late fees. As a result, those revenue categories are also down.
Also, we've incurred some incremental operating costs to keep our employees and customers safe and have seen some increase in uncollectible accounts expense. The total estimated impact of the lost demand, foregone revenue and increased cost is estimated at about $21 million, which equates to about $15 million after-tax or $0.09 per share before considering the accounting for future recovery. We've been working with regulators across our entire service territory alongside other utilities to address how these impacts to cost of service and recovery should be addressed.
As a result of those discussions and regulatory orders received to date, at June 30, 2020, we have recorded a net regulatory asset of $12 million for future recovery, which represents a significant portion of the total estimated impact. After considering the accounting for future recovery, the impact resulting from COVID-19 year-to-date is an estimated $0.05 per share in total.
Let's turn to Slide 7 to look at some of the specific regulatory activities. As we said, we've been in discussions on behalf of our customers with public service commissions across our service area. Currently, 10 of our 14 regulatory jurisdictions have issued orders to address the impacts of COVID-19, authorizing deferral of incremental costs and certain other financial impacts resulting from the implementation of moratorium on shutoffs and disconnections. Four states, Missouri, New York, Tennessee and Kentucky have pending proceedings, where we also expect to receive authority to capture the financial impacts of COVID-19. As a result of the orders received and expected actions by regulators, as I mentioned, we've recorded $12 million for future recovery, primarily related to foregone revenues from reconnect and late fees and estimated uncollectible accounts expense. 
Now as it relates to the demand for our services, American Water has a predominantly residential customer base, as I mentioned just a minute ago. As noted, our residential load is higher, and our commercial and industrial loads have trended down due to business closures. We estimate that the net demand loss directly related to COVID-19 to be approximately $10 million through June 30. This lost revenue is being tracked in each of our utilities. We believe that this lost demand relates directly to the pandemic. And while we've conservatively not recorded a regulatory asset at a consolidated level for future recovery, we believe we have strong arguments and good opportunity to recover the lost revenue in our future COVID-19 or other filings. This lost revenue was essentially $0.04 per share of the total $0.05 per share estimated unfavorable impact from COVID-19 in the quarter and year-to-date periods.
We will work diligently to seek recovery of these lost revenues as we think that makes more sense than making arbitrary cost reductions that could have longer-term impacts on service delivery. As we think about the impact of COVID-19 on our Market-Based Businesses for military services, O&M operations currently continue as normal, subject to each installations individual requirements. Our services are deemed essential so we continue to deliver safe, clean and reliable water and essential wastewater services to our military-based partners.
For Homeowner Services, there has been some delay in new partner relationships and some delays in the launch of new products that we attribute directly to COVID-19. And the estimated impact of those delays is about $0.01 per share year-to-date. We believe we can maintain our customer base during this period of economic downturn because homeowners see value in these products that protect them against large unexpected expenses. 
And perhaps just a couple of final comments before I turn it back to Walter. We are executing on our capital investment plan for the year and are looking for additional ways to assist communities' needs as we go forward. And we continue to remain confident we have sufficient liquidity available for the foreseeable future with $2.3 billion available at the end of June.
And let me turn it back to Walter for a discussion of the remainder of the results for the quarter."

We invested capital of $930 million in the first half of 2020, which is a 17% increase over the same period last year. This increase is driven by the continued investment in our systems and the communities we serve along with more favorable construction weather this year versus last. We also continue to work hard to minimize the customer bill impacts of these investments by controlling O&M costs. We continue our disciplined approach to regulated acquisitions.
We've added more than 17,700 customer connections to date through closed acquisitions and organic growth, and look forward to welcoming an additional 43,600 customer connections through pending acquisitions, most of which we expect to close in 2020. Our Market Based businesses were up $0.01 in earnings per share, reflecting year-to-date price increases and organic growth from Homeowner Services. We're also very honored to assume operations of Joint Basin San Antonio and Texas and the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York in the second quarter of 2020.
Moving to Slide 9. The foundation of our earnings growth continues to be the capital investment we make in our regulated operations to provide clean, safe and reliable water and wastewater services to our customers. Our strategy remains consistent as we plan to invest $20 billion to $22 billion in capital over the next 10 years to ensure the quality and reliability of our services and to bring water and wastewater solutions to communities across the United States. We're affirming our long-term EPS compound annual growth rate in the 7% to 10% range, and we expect our 2020 GAAP earnings to be in the range of $3.79 to $3.89 per share.
Susan will talk more about that in a few minutes. Also, consistent with our previous dividend guidance on July 29, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.55 per share of common stock payable on September 1, 2020.
Turning to Slide 10. Let's walk through some of the regulatory highlights of the second quarter 2020. On June 30, Missouri American Water filed a rate request with the Missouri Public Service Commission. The case includes $920 million in water system improvements and $30 million in sewer system improvements from January 2018 and to May 2022. This includes the replacement of approximately 275 miles of aging water and sewer pipes as well as the upgrading of treatment plants, storage tanks, wells and pumping stations across the state. The company's request is expected to take 11 months to complete, and any new rates would not become effective until mid-2021. Pennsylvania American Water filed a general rate case in April, requesting $92 million in the first year and $46 million in the second year. Since our last case in 2017, Pennsylvania American Water will have invested $1.6 billion in infrastructure upgrades for the 4-year period of 2019 through 2022, including replacing more than 427 miles of aging water and sewer pipes.
Traditionally, the Public Utility Commission's review of the filing may take up to 9 months, and new rates would not be effective until 2021. New Jersey American Water filed a general rate case in December 2019, requesting an overall revenue increase of approximately $88 million, excluding the revenue from DSIC. Since our last rate case, we will have invested more than $1 billion in system upgrades in New Jersey. Virginia American Water filed a general rate case requesting an overall revenue increase of $5.6 million in November 2018. This case was driven by approximately $98 million in infrastructure upgrades since April 2017, and we expect the decision later this year.
Now let me turn to California where there's been quite a bit of activity. California American Water filed for new rates in July 2019. The case covers 2021 through 2023 and requests an increase in authorized revenue of $46.6 million over 3 years. The request seeks $197 million for infrastructure improvements planned for 2021 and 2022. Due to COVID-19, we now expect the decision on this case in the first quarter of 2021. In addition, we filed a motion for interim rates to be effective back to January 1, 2021. Also, our Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project is now scheduled to go before the California Coastal Commission for approval in mid-September. 
In early July, the California Public Utility Commission released a proposed decision on a low-income rate payer assistance proceeding with a common period currently underway and possible vote in August. The decision would require California American Water to file a proposal to alter its water revenue adjustment mechanism known as RAM in its next general rate case filing in July 2022, becoming effective in January 2024. RAMs are mechanisms commonly used across utility sectors, and really have proven critical to promoting conservation and infrastructure investment. From our experience, we believe the best way to address concerns with the impacts of RAMs is to improve forecasting and the rate making process. We're hopeful issues with the proposed decision will be resolved before the decision is voted on. If the proposed decision is adopted as is, California American Water will consider options when they file their next rate case in 2022, which would affect rates starting in 2024.
On the legislative front this year, I would highlight 2 bills that were signed by the Governor of Indiana. The first one authorizes recovery for above-ground infrastructure without a full rate case and the second establishes an appraisal process for non-municipal utilities to establish fair value and a reasonable purchase price.
Additionally, Missouri passed a Water Safety and Security Act. Which requires most water utilities with up to 30,000 customers to establish a cybersecurity plan and a valve and hydrant inspection program. This is similar to legislation that exists in Indiana and New Jersey. Finally, the sale of New York American Water continues to progress, and we anticipate the closing of the acquisition by Liberty Utilities in early 2021.
Moving on to Slide 11. Customers remain at the center of every decision we make today and into the future. This means smart investments, balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. As I mentioned earlier, in the first half of this year, we invested a total of $930 million, with the majority in our Regulated Businesses, including $881 million in infrastructure investment and $40 million in regulated acquisitions.
As we make these critical investments to maintain reliable service, we must also ensure affordability for our customers. We'll continue to focus on O&M efficiency and work toward our O&M efficiency goal of 31.3% by 2024. For the 12-month period ending June 30, 2020, our O&M efficiency ratio improved to 34.3% compared to 35.2% for the 12-month period ended June 30, 2019. 
Our adjusted O&M expenses are just slightly higher today than they were in 2010. Since then, we've added approximately 281,000 customer connections while expenses only increased at a compound annual growth rate of 0.8%. We're very proud of our employees' focus and commitment to controlling costs on behalf of our customers, especially given the current economic challenges some of our customers are facing.
Moving on to Slide 12. We believe our commitment to putting customers first is a key to growing our regulated footprint. So far in 2020, we've closed on 13 acquisitions in 6 different states, adding approximately 10,800 new customer connections. We've also added more than 6,900 customer connections through organic growth in the first 6 months. We look forward to adding another 43,600 customer connections through currently signed agreements in 9 states, most of which we expect to close in 2020. These new agreements reflect our commitment to provide water and wastewater solutions to communities across our footprint. We know that many communities are facing unprecedented challenges now. And so we're pleased when we're able to help.
This includes our recent acquisition in the Village of Shiloh wastewater system in Illinois. This is another example of acquiring the wastewater system in an area where we provided water services for decades. According to the Village Mayor, James Vernier, the sale of the wastewater system to Illinois American Water ""allows the village to focus on other priorities."" He also went on to say: ""Illinois American Water has provided excellent water service to our residents for many decades. We look forward to expanding our partnership."" 
We're very disciplined in our approach to acquisitions, leveraging our tremendous expertise to find solutions for communities. We now have about 800,000 customer opportunities in our pipeline as many communities are seeking solutions to increase challenges, which include regulatory, financial and those posed by COVID-19 in managing water and wastewater systems.
And with that, let me now turn the call over to Susan."

Second quarter 2020 consolidated GAAP earnings were $0.97 per share compared to $0.94 per share in 2019. As Walter mentioned, included in GAAP earnings is $0.02 per share for depreciation not recorded due to assets held for sale accounting and the estimated $0.05 per share unfavorable impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Regulated Business segment results increased $0.10 per share or an increase of 11.5% compared to 2019 earnings. The Market-Based Business results increased $0.01 per share, and the parent company decreased $0.08 per share compared to 2019. 
Our 2020 GAAP earnings through June 30 were $1.65 per share or a 5.8% increase over the same period last year. In the 6-month period, results include $0.03 related to depreciation not recorded due to assets held for sale and an estimated $0.05 per share unfavorable impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. Our Regulated Businesses increased $0.18 per share. Our Market-Based Businesses increased $0.02 per share, primarily from Homeowner Services. And finally, the parent results decreased by $0.11 per share year-over-year.
Moving to Slide 15. Let me walk through the second quarter results by business. Regulated Operations increased $0.14 per share before considering the $0.04 per share estimated unfavorable impact from COVID-19 on the Regulated Business. We saw a $0.20 per share increase from additional authorized revenue and surcharge charges to support infrastructure investments, acquisitions and organic growth. Walter mentioned, as a reminder, that 2019 results included $0.04 per share of unusually wet weather in the Regulated Business.
O&M expense increased $0.05 per share, and depreciation related to ongoing operations increased $0.07 per share, both to support regulated acquisitions and other growth. The Market-Based Businesses second quarter results in 2020 increased $0.02 per share compared to 2019 before considering the $0.01 estimated unfavorable impact from COVID-19 on the Market-Based Businesses. The increase was driven primarily by Homeowner Services Group organic growth and contract price increases.
Also during the second quarter, we are now fully operational on Joint Base San Antonio and the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. The parent results decreased $0.08 per share with $0.02 per share, reflecting higher interest expense to support growth in the Regulated Business. The remaining $0.06 per share was the $0.03 per share sale of a legacy investment that occurred in 2019 and timing of expenses and other items of $0.03 per share.
And finally, on Slide 15, you'll see the total $0.05 per share estimated impact from COVID, as we've discussed.
Moving to Slide 16. 6-month GAAP EPS increased 5.8% year-over-year, as I mentioned, and many of the drivers of the variances in the quarter, noted previously, also explained the year-over-year results.
Moving to Slide 17. The Regulated Businesses received $80 million in annualized new revenues in 2020, and this includes $18 million from step increases and $62 million from infrastructure surcharges. We've also filed requests and are awaiting final orders on 5 rate cases, as Walter just walked you through and 2 infrastructure surcharge proceedings for a total annualized revenue request of $294 million. The continued successful execution of our regulatory strategy is a key element of our ability to consistently deliver financial results.
Moving on to Slide 18. The company expects its 2020 earnings to be in the range of $3.79 per share to $3.89 per share on a GAAP basis. Included in this guidance range is the estimated $0.06 per share for depreciation not recorded as required by the accounting for assets held for sale and the estimated $0.05 to $0.08 per share unfavorable impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. The full year estimated impact of COVID-19 is highly dependent on the projected impact of a number of unknown factors, which include the length and severity of decreased demand for services and the nature and scope of regulatory solutions.
Our current thoughts are that we start to see moderation in the impact on demand in the third quarter of 2020. This guidance range is the same range that was previously announced on an adjusted basis. But let me be clear, our 2020 expectation of results in the range of $3.79 to $3.89 per share is unchanged from prior expectations. We continue to believe this range is reflective of expected result on a normalized basis, normalized for the 2 unusual items in 2020 related to the depreciation issue and COVID-19. The we think that guiding to GAAP results, which include these 2 items, makes the message quite clear. And I also want to repeat what Walter said. We are affirming our long-term earnings compound annual growth rate expectation on an earnings per share basis of a range of 7% to 10% while investing capital in the range of $8.8 billion to $9.4 billion over the next 5 years.
Finally, moving on to Slide 19. As we noted in the release on July 29, 2020, the company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share of common stock payable on September 1, 2020. This reflects the continuation of the 10% increase in the annual dividend declared by the Board on April 29, 2020. We continue to be a top leader in dividend growth. We have grown our dividend at a compound annual growth rate of 10.1% over the last 5 years, and we expect to continue that growth at the high end of the 7% to 10% range. Also, we continue to target a dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60% of earnings. Our total company consolidated actual return on equity is 10.7% for the 12 months ended June 30, 2020. Regulatory execution, along with strong results from our Market-Based Businesses allows us to consistently deliver on our earnings commitment. We believe that delivering on results, combined with our strong earnings growth and superior dividend growth expectations continue to provide excellent value for our shareholders.
To summarize, the decades of capital investment need continue and drives our planned $20 billion to $22 billion of capital investment over the next 10 years. With the fragmented water and wastewater landscape and the states and local communities continue to face added challenges from impacts of COVID-19, we believe we can provide those states and towns water and wastewater solutions to help mitigate those impacts. The capital-light Market-Based Businesses continue to improve customer experience and generate cash, and simply put our business model and resulting investment thesis is built on fundamentals. And though all segments of the economy are being impacted by this health emergency, we see our business as resilient, and we have built it in a way to endure these challenges. 
And with that, let me turn the call back to Walter for a few additional remarks."

We now have a better insight as to what those COVID estimates are. But I think fundamentally, it's important to stay focused on that range of $3.79 to $3.89, which is where we believe we will end the year and whether you think about that as adjusted or as GAAP, I think it's important to note, that's what we believe to be sort of normalized operations. And that's what we've always said. We've gone to a GAAP guidance approach here, I think just to make it easier to understand and easier to follow what our guidance is.

And longer term, I do agree with the fact on a normalized base, that is what it is. But I guess just from an apples-to-apples comparison versus the range that you had given out on adjusted basis as the first quarter, it seems like either the COVID expense impact expectation is excluded from an apples-to-apples basis? Or with it, you're essentially trending $0.05 to $0.08 below the original plan. You've talked about your confidence in getting a lot of that back on the discontent costs and whatnot.

I would give you relative to this that maybe add to Angie's response. If we were continuing to provide adjusted guidance, let's say, using that terminology, we would certainly look at these COVID costs as an item that we would adjust for. So they would be considered part of that adjusted guidance just like we have done New York. So we would be adjusting for them and essentially saying, they shouldn't be considered as part of normalized operations. And as we thought through that, we said, it just makes more sense to go straight to GAAP guidance and say, these are going to be the results on the books, and they happen to be exactly the same guidance we've been providing all along on a normalized basis, again, the $3.79 to $3.89. So we view this as literally no change in guidance. So again, that's how we think about guidance. As it relates to sort of recovery, again, we've got orders in 10 of 14 states, and we've got proceedings in the other 4 that we believe will allow us fully to seek recovery of all of the costs associated with COVID with the exception of the lost demand revenue. That is really the piece that ultimately falls through in that $0.05, the lost demand, $0.04 on the regulated side of the business.
So again, we're going to continue to work with regulators on recovery of the lost demand dollars. And again, we think it makes sense to work through the regulatory process on recovery before we start to, again, sort of arbitrarily reduce costs that again can have longer-term impacts on our ability to continue to deliver services. We think this is an event that has occurred during this period, we're hoping that we start to see some moderation of that exposure in the third quarter, as I mentioned. So we believe there's some isolation to it. And we can again sort of work with regulators to seek recovery. And cost reductions, while we continue to focus heavily on them, as we've outlined here, we've made progress again on the O&M efficiency ratio. And we continue to focus very heavily on cost and our cost structure in the business, we think that's where our focus should be and not on sort of arbitrary reductions that could potentially affect our ability to deliver service."

Again, we've started to see employees return to work across our territory. We've seen industrial demand start to come back up. I think commercial is probably the biggest variable, to be honest with you. As you think about restaurants and some of the smaller commercial enterprises, they're likely going to have a little bit longer recovery period. So I think that is the biggest variable. 
Our current view is that we'll see some of that moderation here in the third quarter. So that $0.05 to $0.08 range we've given around COVID really reflects that set of assumptions that for the balance of the year, again, we should be able to sort of contain it within those -- that range.

The lost revenue piece is sort of another layer of challenge that we need to work through with regulators. And that may take a bit of time.

We have a lot to cover today, and we thought it might be helpful to first address the impacts of COVID-19 in our operations and our estimates of the financial impact so far. As we've done since the onset of this health emergency, American Water continues to provide essential water and wastewater services to our customers. And we know the critical role we play in helping our customers and communities through this pandemic. As we relayed on our first quarter call, we remain focused in 3 areas: the first is the care and safety of our employees and their families. The second is the safety of our customers and the communities we serve. And the third is the execution of our preparedness plans. We can continue to provide essential services and help our communities get through the pandemic.
With recent surges of COVID-19 cases in many parts of our country, the measures we took early on remain in place while adding additional measures. These include employee health screenings prior to coming to work, social distancing, suspension of all nonemergency in-home appointments, limiting the amount and nature of contact with customers during field appointments and a required work-from-home policy for nonessential employees where possible. Because the number of cases varies across our footprint, we're taking into account CDC and local and state guidance as we work on plans to return to a more normal state of operation when possible with safety as the primary driver.
As you know, we were among the first utilities to suspend shutoffs and late fees prior to any orders being issued by states. We continue to work with customers who are experiencing financial hardships by offering customer assistance programs and access to low-income programs. Susan will cover this in greater detail, but we're working constructively with public service commissions as they look to address utility response measures, customer protections and cost recovery for regulated utilities in their jurisdictions.
Additionally, our liquidity and access to capital remains strong, and we continue our disciplined approach to execute on our core strategies, such as making needed capital investment. 
Finally, American Water and the American Water Charitable Foundation continue to help the communities we serve, giving more than $400,000 in charitable contributions over the past 3 months to help mitigate impacts of COVID-19 in the communities we serve. 
Before I ask Susan to discuss the financial impacts of COVID-19 so far, I want to thank our employees, not only for their tremendous effort throughout the pandemic but also for what they've done all year to stay safe and provide essential service to the communities we serve.
Now let me turn the call over to Susan."

Slide 6 summarizes the estimated impact of the pandemic on results through June 30, 2020. We've seen an estimated 5% increase in residential customer volumetric demand over this period that we think is directly",802,"Thanks, Walter, and good morning, everyone. Slide 6 summarizes the estimated impact of the pandemic on results through June 30, 2020. We've seen an estimated 5% increase in residential customer volumetric demand over this period that we think is directly related to the impact of COVID-19, as many of our customers have been working from home and/or sheltered in place because of the pandemic. Likewise, we have seen commercial and industrial demand weakened by about 13% and 7%, respectively, as our best estimate of the impact of COVID-19 over this period as many businesses have shuttered. And I'd simply remind you that we are about 70% residential on an annual revenue basis. As Walter mentioned, we discontinued service shutoffs that would normally occur due to nonpayment and are no longer charging late fees. As a result, those revenue categories are also down.
Also, we've incurred some incremental operating costs to keep our employees and customers safe and have seen some increase in uncollectible accounts expense. The total estimated impact of the lost demand, foregone revenue and increased cost is estimated at about $21 million, which equates to about $15 million after-tax or $0.09 per share before considering the accounting for future recovery. We've been working with regulators across our entire service territory alongside other utilities to address how these impacts to cost of service and recovery should be addressed.
As a result of those discussions and regulatory orders received to date, at June 30, 2020, we have recorded a net regulatory asset of $12 million for future recovery, which represents a significant portion of the total estimated impact. After considering the accounting for future recovery, the impact resulting from COVID-19 year-to-date is an estimated $0.05 per share in total.
Let's turn to Slide 7 to look at some of the specific regulatory activities. As we said, we've been in discussions on behalf of our customers with public service commissions across our service area. Currently, 10 of our 14 regulatory jurisdictions have issued orders to address the impacts of COVID-19, authorizing deferral of incremental costs and certain other financial impacts resulting from the implementation of moratorium on shutoffs and disconnections. Four states, Missouri, New York, Tennessee and Kentucky have pending proceedings, where we also expect to receive authority to capture the financial impacts of COVID-19. As a result of the orders received and expected actions by regulators, as I mentioned, we've recorded $12 million for future recovery, primarily related to foregone revenues from reconnect and late fees and estimated uncollectible accounts expense. 
Now as it relates to the demand for our services, American Water has a predominantly residential customer base, as I mentioned just a minute ago. As noted, our residential load is higher, and our commercial and industrial loads have trended down due to business closures. We estimate that the net demand loss directly related to COVID-19 to be approximately $10 million through June 30. This lost revenue is being tracked in each of our utilities. We believe that this lost demand relates directly to the pandemic. And while we've conservatively not recorded a regulatory asset at a consolidated level for future recovery, we believe we have strong arguments and good opportunity to recover the lost revenue in our future COVID-19 or other filings. This lost revenue was essentially $0.04 per share of the total $0.05 per share estimated unfavorable impact from COVID-19 in the quarter and year-to-date periods.
We will work diligently to seek recovery of these lost revenues as we think that makes more sense than making arbitrary cost reductions that could have longer-term impacts on service delivery. As we think about the impact of COVID-19 on our Market-Based Businesses for military services, O&M operations currently continue as normal, subject to each installations individual requirements. Our services are deemed essential so we continue to deliver safe, clean and reliable water and essential wastewater services to our military-based partners.
For Homeowner Services, there has been some delay in new partner relationships and some delays in the launch of new products that we attribute directly to COVID-19. And the estimated impact of those delays is about $0.01 per share year-to-date. We believe we can maintain our customer base during this period of economic downturn because homeowners see value in these products that protect them against large unexpected expenses. 
And perhaps just a couple of final comments before I turn it back to Walter. We are executing on our capital investment plan for the year and are looking for additional ways to assist communities' needs as we go forward. And we continue to remain confident we have sufficient liquidity available for the foreseeable future with $2.3 billion available at the end of June.
And let me turn it back to Walter for a discussion of the remainder of the results for the quarter."

Through trying tim",1542,"Yes. Thanks, Susan. Let's move on to second quarter and 6-month results as it's been an eventful year-to-date with several key rate cases, significant capital investment, multiple acquisitions and a sharp focus on business fundamentals. Through trying times, once again, the employees of American Water delivered solid results and further strengthened our low-risk profile and predictable growth story.
Our second quarter 2020 GAAP earnings per share increased 3.2% compared to second quarter 2019. Included in GAAP results are $0.02 per share for depreciation not recorded due to assets held for sale and an estimated $0.05 per share unfavorable impact from COVID-19 pandemic. We invested capital of $930 million in the first half of 2020, which is a 17% increase over the same period last year. This increase is driven by the continued investment in our systems and the communities we serve along with more favorable construction weather this year versus last. We also continue to work hard to minimize the customer bill impacts of these investments by controlling O&M costs. We continue our disciplined approach to regulated acquisitions.
We've added more than 17,700 customer connections to date through closed acquisitions and organic growth, and look forward to welcoming an additional 43,600 customer connections through pending acquisitions, most of which we expect to close in 2020. Our Market Based businesses were up $0.01 in earnings per share, reflecting year-to-date price increases and organic growth from Homeowner Services. We're also very honored to assume operations of Joint Basin San Antonio and Texas and the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York in the second quarter of 2020.
Moving to Slide 9. The foundation of our earnings growth continues to be the capital investment we make in our regulated operations to provide clean, safe and reliable water and wastewater services to our customers. Our strategy remains consistent as we plan to invest $20 billion to $22 billion in capital over the next 10 years to ensure the quality and reliability of our services and to bring water and wastewater solutions to communities across the United States. We're affirming our long-term EPS compound annual growth rate in the 7% to 10% range, and we expect our 2020 GAAP earnings to be in the range of $3.79 to $3.89 per share.
Susan will talk more about that in a few minutes. Also, consistent with our previous dividend guidance on July 29, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.55 per share of common stock payable on September 1, 2020.
Turning to Slide 10. Let's walk through some of the regulatory highlights of the second quarter 2020. On June 30, Missouri American Water filed a rate request with the Missouri Public Service Commission. The case includes $920 million in water system improvements and $30 million in sewer system improvements from January 2018 and to May 2022. This includes the replacement of approximately 275 miles of aging water and sewer pipes as well as the upgrading of treatment plants, storage tanks, wells and pumping stations across the state. The company's request is expected to take 11 months to complete, and any new rates would not become effective until mid-2021. Pennsylvania American Water filed a general rate case in April, requesting $92 million in the first year and $46 million in the second year. Since our last case in 2017, Pennsylvania American Water will have invested $1.6 billion in infrastructure upgrades for the 4-year period of 2019 through 2022, including replacing more than 427 miles of aging water and sewer pipes.
Traditionally, the Public Utility Commission's review of the filing may take up to 9 months, and new rates would not be effective until 2021. New Jersey American Water filed a general rate case in December 2019, requesting an overall revenue increase of approximately $88 million, excluding the revenue from DSIC. Since our last rate case, we will have invested more than $1 billion in system upgrades in New Jersey. Virginia American Water filed a general rate case requesting an overall revenue increase of $5.6 million in November 2018. This case was driven by approximately $98 million in infrastructure upgrades since April 2017, and we expect the decision later this year.
Now let me turn to California where there's been quite a bit of activity. California American Water filed for new rates in July 2019. The case covers 2021 through 2023 and requests an increase in authorized revenue of $46.6 million over 3 years. The request seeks $197 million for infrastructure improvements planned for 2021 and 2022. Due to COVID-19, we now expect the decision on this case in the first quarter of 2021. In addition, we filed a motion for interim rates to be effective back to January 1, 2021. Also, our Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project is now scheduled to go before the California Coastal Commission for approval in mid-September. 
In early July, the California Public Utility Commission released a proposed decision on a low-income rate payer assistance proceeding with a common period currently underway and possible vote in August. The decision would require California American Water to file a proposal to alter its water revenue adjustment mechanism known as RAM in its next general rate case filing in July 2022, becoming effective in January 2024. RAMs are mechanisms commonly used across utility sectors, and really have proven critical to promoting conservation and infrastructure investment. From our experience, we believe the best way to address concerns with the impacts of RAMs is to improve forecasting and the rate making process. We're hopeful issues with the proposed decision will be resolved before the decision is voted on. If the proposed decision is adopted as is, California American Water will consider options when they file their next rate case in 2022, which would affect rates starting in 2024.
On the legislative front this year, I would highlight 2 bills that were signed by the Governor of Indiana. The first one authorizes recovery for above-ground infrastructure without a full rate case and the second establishes an appraisal process for nonmunicipal utilities to establish fair value and a reasonable purchase price.
Additionally, Missouri passed a Water Safety and Security Act. Which requires most water utilities with up to 30,000 customers to establish a cybersecurity plan and a valve and hydrant inspection program. This is similar to legislation that exists in Indiana and New Jersey. Finally, the sale of New York American Water continues to progress, and we anticipate the closing of the acquisition by Liberty Utilities in early 2021.
Moving on to Slide 11. Customers remain at the center of every decision we make today and into the future. This means smart investments, balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. As I mentioned earlier, in the first half of this year, we invested a total of $930 million, with the majority in our Regulated Businesses, including $881 million in infrastructure investment and $40 million in regulated acquisitions.
As we make these critical investments to maintain reliable service, we must also ensure affordability for our customers. We'll continue to focus on O&M efficiency and work toward our O&M efficiency goal of 31.3% by 2024. For the 12-month period ending June 30, 2020, our O&M efficiency ratio improved to 34.3% compared to 35.2% for the 12-month period ended June 30, 2019. 
Our adjusted O&M expenses are just slightly higher today than they were in 2010. Since then, we've added approximately 281,000 customer connections while expenses only increased at a compound annual growth rate of 0.8%. We're very proud of our employees' focus and commitment to controlling costs on behalf of our customers, especially given the current economic challenges some of our customers are facing.
Moving on to Slide 12. We believe our commitment to putting customers first is a key to growing our regulated footprint. So far in 2020, we've closed on 13 acquisitions in 6 different states, adding approximately 10,800 new customer connections. We've also added more than 6,900 customer connections through organic growth in the first 6 months. We look forward to adding another 43,600 customer connections through currently signed agreements in 9 states, most of which we expect to close in 2020. These new agreements reflect our commitment to provide water and wastewater solutions to communities across our footprint. We know that many communities are facing unprecedented challenges now. And so we're pleased when we're able to help.
This includes our recent acquisition in the Village of Shiloh wastewater system in Illinois. This is another example of acquiring the wastewater system in an area where we provided water services for decades. According to the Village Mayor, James Vernier, the sale of the wastewater system to Illinois American Water ""allows the village to focus on other priorities."" He also went on to say: ""Illinois American Water has provided excellent water service to our residents for many decades. We look forward to expanding our partnership."" 
We're very disciplined in our approach to acquisitions, leveraging our tremendous expertise to find solutions for communities. We now have about 800,000 customer opportunities in our pipeline as many communities are seeking solutions to increase challenges, which include regulatory, financial and those posed by COVID-19 in managing water and wastewater systems.
And with that, let me now turn the call over to Susan."

Second quarter 2020 consolidated GAAP earnings were $0.97 per share compared to $0.94 per share in 2019. As Walter mentioned, included in GAAP earnings is $0.02 per share for depreciation not recorded due to assets held for sale accounting and the estimated $0.05 per share unfavorable impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Regulated Business segment results increased $0.10 per share or an increase of 11.5% compared to 2019 earnings. The Market-Based Business results increased $0.01 per share, and the parent company decreased $0.08 per share compared to 2019. 
Our 2020 GAAP earnings through June 30 were $1.65 per share or a 5.8% increase over the same period last year. In the 6-month period, results include $0.03 related to depreciation not recorded due to assets held for sale and an estimated $0.05 per share unfavorable impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. Our Regulated Businesses increased $0.18 per share. Our Market-Based Businesses increased $0.02 per share, primarily from Homeowner Services. And finally, the parent results decreased by $0.11 per share year-over-year.
Moving to Slide 15. Let me walk through the second quarter results by business. Regulated Operations increased $0.14 per share before considering the $0.04 per share estimated unfavorable impact from COVID-19 on the Regulated Business. We saw a $0.20 per share increase from additional authorized revenue and surcharge charges to support infrastructure investments, acquisitions and organic growth. Walter mentioned, as a reminder, that 2019 results included $0.04 per share of unusually wet weather in the Regulated Business.
O&M expense increased $0.05 per share, and depreciation related to ongoing operations increased $0.07 per share, both to support regulated acquisitions and other growth. The Market-Based Businesses second quarter results in 2020 increased $0.02 per share compared to 2019 before considering the $0.01 estimated unfavorable impact from COVID-19 on the Market-Based Businesses. The increase was driven primarily by Homeowner Services Group organic growth and contract price increases.
Also during the second quarter, we are now fully operational on Joint Base San Antonio and the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. The parent results decreased $0.08 per share with $0.02 per share, reflecting higher interest expense to support growth in the Regulated Business. The remaining $0.06 per share was the $0.03 per share sale of a legacy investment that occurred in 2019 and timing of expenses and other items of $0.03 per share.
And finally, on Slide 15, you'll see the total $0.05 per share estimated impact from COVID, as we've discussed.
Moving to Slide 16. 6-month GAAP EPS increased 5.8% year-over-year, as I mentioned, and many of the drivers of the variances in the quarter, noted previously, also explained the year-over-year results.
Moving to Slide 17. The Regulated Businesses received $80 million in annualized new revenues in 2020, and this includes $18 million from step increases and $62 million from infrastructure surcharges. We've also filed requests and are awaiting final orders on 5 rate cases, as Walter just walked you through and 2 infrastructure surcharge proceedings for a total annualized revenue request of $294 million. The continued successful execution of our regulatory strategy is a key element of our ability to consistently deliver financial results.
Moving on to Slide 18. The company expects its 2020 earnings to be in the range of $3.79 per share to $3.89 per share on a GAAP basis. Included in this guidance range is the estimated $0.06 per share for depreciation not recorded as required by the accounting for assets held for sale and the estimated $0.05 to $0.08 per share unfavorable impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. The full year estimated impact of COVID-19 is highly dependent on the projected impact of a number of unknown factors, which include the length and severity of decreased demand for services and the nature and scope of regulatory solutions.
Our current thoughts are that we start to see moderation in the impact on demand in the third quarter of 2020. This guidance range is the same range that was previously announced on an adjusted basis. But let me be clear, our 2020 expectation of results in the range of $3.79 to $3.89 per share is unchanged from prior expectations. We continue to believe this range is reflective of expected result on a normalized basis, normalized for the 2 unusual items in 2020 related to the depreciation issue and COVID-19. The we think that guiding to GAAP results, which include these 2 items, makes the message quite clear. And I also want to repeat what Walter said. We are affirming our long-term earnings compound annual growth rate expectation on an earnings per share basis of a range of 7% to 10% while investing capital in the range of $8.8 billion to $9.4 billion over the next 5 years.
Finally, moving on to Slide 19. As we noted in the release on July 29, 2020, the company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share of common stock payable on September 1, 2020. This reflects the continuation of the 10% increase in the annual dividend declared by the Board on April 29, 2020. We continue to be a top leader in dividend growth. We have grown our dividend at a compound annual growth rate of 10.1% over the last 5 years, and we expect to continue that growth at the high end of the 7% to 10% range. Also, we continue to target a dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60% of earnings. Our total company consolidated actual return on equity is 10.7% for the 12 months ended June 30, 2020. Regulatory execution, along with strong results from our Market-Based Businesses allows us to consistently deliver on our earnings commitment. We believe that delivering on results, combined with our strong earnings growth and superior dividend growth expectations continue to provide excellent value for our shareholders.
To summarize, the decades of capital investment need continue and drives our planned $20 billion to $22 billion of capital investment over the next 10 years. With the fragmented water and wastewater landscape and the states and local communities continue to face added challenges from impacts of COVID-19, we believe we can provide those states and towns water and wastewater solutions to help mitigate those impacts. The capital-light Market-Based Businesses continue to improve customer experience and generate cash, and simply put our business model and resulting investment thesis is built on fundamentals. And though all segments of the economy are being impacted by this health emergency, we see our business as resilient, and we have built it in a way to endure these challenges. 
And with that, let me turn the call back to Walter for a few additional remarks."

We now have a better insight as to what those COVID estimates are. But I think fundamentally, it's important to stay focused on that range of $3.79 to $3.89, which is where we believe we will end the year and whether you think about that as adjusted or as GAAP, I think it's important to note, that's what we believe to be sort of normalized operations. And that's what we've always said. We've gone to a GAAP guidance approach here, I think just to make it easier to understand and easier to follow what our guidance is.

And longer term, I do agree with the fact on a normalized base, that is what it is. But I guess just from an apples-to-apples comparison versus the range that you had given out on adjusted basis as the first quarter, it seems like either the COVID expense impact expectation is excluded from an apples-to-apples basis? Or with it, you're essentially trending $0.05 to $0.08 below the original plan. You've talked about your confidence in getting a lot of that back on the discontent costs and whatnot. If those things do not materialize, what type of cost measures do you have to potentially offset this? Or is it something that you're just going to hold back until -- to deal with it in 2021?"

I would give you relative to this that maybe add to Angie's response. If we were continuing to provide adjusted guidance, let's say, using that terminology, we would certainly look at these COVID costs as an item that we would adjust for. So they would be considered part of that adjusted guidance just like we have done New York. So we would be adjusting for them and essentially saying, they shouldn't be considered as part of normalized operations. And as we thought through that, we said, it just makes more sense to go straight to GAAP guidance and say, these are going to be the results on the books, and they happen to be exactly the same guidance we've been providing all along on a normalized basis, again, the $3.79 to $3.89. So we view this as literally no change in guidance. So again, that's how we think about guidance. As it relates to sort of recovery, again, we've got orders in 10 of 14 states, and we've got proceedings in the other 4 that we believe will allow us fully to seek recovery of all of the costs associated with COVID with the exception of the lost demand revenue. That is really the piece that ultimately falls through in that $0.05, the lost demand, $0.04 on the regulated side of the business.
So again, we're going to continue to work with regulators on recovery of the lost demand dollars. And again, we think it makes sense to work through the regulatory process on recovery before we start to, again, sort of arbitrarily reduce costs that again can have longer-term impacts on our ability to continue to deliver services. We think this is an event that has occurred during this period, we're hoping that we start to see some moderation of that exposure in the third quarter, as I mentioned. So we believe there's some isolation to it. And we can again sort of work with regulators to seek recovery. And cost reductions, while we continue to focus heavily on them, as we've outlined here, we've made progress again on the O&M efficiency ratio. And we continue to focus very heavily on cost and our cost structure in the business, we think that's where our focus should be and not on sort of arbitrary reductions that could potentially affect our ability to deliver service."

And you all track this just like we do. It's a changing landscape every single day. But we have an expectation that the largest portion of the impact, again, this $0.05, or $0.04 on the regulated side, is really driven by demand changes. And we expect that to start to moderate. Again, we've started to see employees return to work across our territory. We've seen industrial demand start to come back up. I think commercial is probably the biggest variable, to be honest with you. As you think about restaurants and some of the smaller commercial enterprises, they're likely going to have a little bit longer recovery period. So I think that is the biggest variable. 
Our current view is that we'll see some of that moderation here in the third quarter. So that $0.05 to $0.08 range we've given around COVID really reflects that set of assumptions that for the balance of the year, again, we should be able to sort of contain it within those -- that range.

We'll have to work through a process to get those dollars reflected for recovery. So it may take a bit of time where there's been quick action by regulators to date, literally across the country, as you know. The regulatory community has been very supportive of the process to identify a need for a solution here around -- particularly around disconnects and that sort of thing. The lost revenue piece is sort of another layer of challenge that we need to work through with regulators. And that may take a bit of time. But yes, I mean, if we can work through that, there is potential upside there. And as I mentioned in the script or in our prepared remarks, and it may have been sort of a subtle comment, at the state level, we are -- we have recorded these lost revenues as recoverable items. We just took a conservative view at the parent and said, we don't have regulatory orders in place to support it yet. So at the consolidated level, we did not record those regulatory assets.

We have a lot to cover today. I'll start with a few comments on the national election. Then move to key updates on our business, including our continued focus on the implications of COVID-19. Susan will then provide a more detailed review of our third quarter and year-to-date financial results along with other updates. 
So let me start with Tuesday's election. American Water has and will continue to work with both sides of the isle and constructive water policy. Water and wastewater infrastructure remain a bipartisan issue, and we'll stay engaged with leaders at the state and federal level on this issue on behalf of our customers. We continue to believe that investment in the country's water and wastewater infrastructure is important. Supportive legislation and regulation are also critical to ensure customer bills are affordable. 
Let's move to Slide 5 and our third quarter results. The employees of American Water delivered solid results and further strengthened our low-risk profile and predictable growth story. Our results were driven by the continued execution of our strategies. Our third quarter 2020 earnings per share were up 9.8% compared to third quarter 2019. We invested capital of $1.38 billion in the first 3 quarters of 2020, which is a 10.4% increase over the same period last year. We balanced that investment through our focused effort to control cost as we work towards our long-term O&M efficiency goal of 31.3% by 2024. We've added more than 47,000 customer connections to date through closed acquisitions and organic growth and look forward to welcoming an additional 19,000 customer connections through pending acquisitions, most of which we expect to close in 2021. As it relates to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, safety continues to be our top priority. Susan will give more detail in a minute, but as you saw in our 10-Q, residential demand continued higher, and we saw some rebound in commercial demand as businesses started to reopen. As a result of this higher demand in the third quarter, we saw an estimated favorable impact of $0.03 per share. We'll continue to assess the situation across our service territory. Recognizing that it's difficult to predict the impact, we currently anticipate a full year unfavorable $0.03 to $0.06 per share from the COVID-19 pandemic. Also included in the results is an estimated $0.06 per share favorable impact in 2020 from hotter, dryer weather across some of our regulated states. This compares to $0.04 per share unfavorable impact for the same period in 2019 from wetter than normal conditions in both the Midwest and Northeast. 
Moving to our Market-Based Businesses. We were very proud to announce that our Military Services Group was awarded the contract for the operation and maintenance of the water and wastewater utility systems at Joint Base Lewis McCord in Washington state. We're now honored to provide water and wastewater services to more than 425,000 military men, women and their families at 17 installations across the United States. 
Moving to Slide 6. The foundation of our earnings growth continues to be the capital investment we make in our regulated operations. We plan to invest $20 billion to $22 billion in capital over the next 10 years to ensure the quality and reliability of our services and to bring water and wastewater solutions to communities across the country. We're increasing our 2020 earnings range to $3.87 to $3.93 per share, up from $3.79 to $3.89 per share. This reflects the favorable weather in the quarter. We're also affirming our long-term EPS compound annual growth rate in the 7% to 10% range. Also consistent with our previous dividend guidance on October 26, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.55 per share of common stock payable on December 2, 2020. 
Turning to Slide 7. Let's go through some of the regulatory highlights of the third quarter 2020. We currently have 5 pending rate cases, and I'll cover the more significant development since our last call. Last week, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities approved a settlement between New Jersey American Water, BPU staff and the New Jersey division of ray console for new water and wastewater rates. The new rates represent a $39 million annual increase in water and wastewater revenues. In a separate proceeding, the BPU also approved the customer credit associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that will offset the rate increase for the average residential customer through August 31, 2021. While the customer credit will benefit customer bills, it will have no earnings impact in New Jersey American Water as it's offset by lower tax expense during this period. The company's rate case was driven by more than $1 billion in infrastructure investments since the last rate case. Last week, Pennsylvania American Water, and the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission and eau of Investigation and Enforcement entered into a settlement agreement, providing for a total annualized revenue increase of $70.5 million over a 2- year period. The terms of the proposed settlement have been presented for review to the PUC Administrative of Law Judge. Until the Administrative Law Judge and Commission are able to review their proposed settlement and render their decisions, it would be premature to discuss the terms of the settlement any further. As you recall, Pennsylvania American Water's general rate case requested $92 million in the first year and $46 million in the second year. Pennsylvania American Water will have invested $1.6 billion in infrastructure upgrades for the 4-year period of 2019 through 2022. We also have pending rate cases in Missouri, Iowa, California and Virginia, and those cases are moving along on schedule. 
Also, in California, the California Public Utility Commission released the decision in September under its low-income rate payer assistance program rule making. The decision will require California American Water to file a proposal to alter its water Revenue Adjustment Mechanism, or RAM, in its next general rate case filing in 2022, which will become effective in January 2024. California American Water has filed an application for a rehearing of the decision.  Finally, in September, and after careful consideration, California American Water withdraw a portion of its application at the California Coastal Commission for the Monterey peninsula water supply project in an effort to further educate stakeholders on environmental and water supply benefits of the project. The company will be resubmitting its application in the near future, and once submitted by statute, the California Coastal Commission would add 180 days to process after it deems the application complete. 
Lastly, regarding the sale of New York American Water. Last week, the governor announced proposed legislation that would include a PSC study of a public takeover option. We'll review the legislation when a bill is introduced. We still firmly believe the sale of New York American Water to liberty is in the best interest of our customers, and we'll continue to take the needed steps to close the transaction in early 2021. Regarding state legislation, we've seen multiple states take action to help tackle water and wastewater challenges. In Indiana, legislation pass that authorizes recovery for aboveground infrastructure without a full rate case. And separate legislation pass that establishes an appraisal process for non-municipal utilities establish fair market value and a reasonable purchase price. Iowa amended legislation that gives the Iowa Utilities Board 180 days to approve acquisitions and allow system to qualify as a distressed system when they don't have a certified operator. Virginia also signed its version of fair market value legislation into law this year, and West Virginia passed a bill that allows for expanded asset valuation, combined water and wastewater ratemaking and expansion of how municipalities can use proceeds from the sale of a water or wastewater system. 
Moving on to Slide 8. In addition to legislative action to help communities solve water and wastewater challenges, we believe our commitment to putting customers first is key to growing our regulated footprint. As I mentioned, so far in 2020, we've closed on 20 acquisitions in 9 different states, adding approximately 36,200 new customer connections. We've also added approximately 10,900 customer connections to organic growth through 9 months. We look forward to adding another 19,000 customer connections to currently sign agreements in 7 states. Also, the pipeline of opportunities we've noted are a result of increased conversations we're having across our footprint with communities looking for solutions to water and wastewater challenges. These opportunities are in various stages of development, and as you know, the process can take multiple years. We know that many communities are facing unprecedented challenges now, and our mission is to help make those communities better because we're there. This includes our recent acquisitions of the city of Jerseyville, water and wastewater system in Illinois and the long hail sewer system in New Jersey. According to the city of Jerseyville mayor, William Russell, ""We can trust that our water and wastewater systems are in professional caring hands."" 
Moving on to Slide 9. Customers remain at the center of every decision we make. This means smart investments, balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. For the 12-month period ending September 30, 2020, our O&M efficiency ratio improved to 34.2% compared to 34.8% for the 12-month period ended September 30, 2019. Our adjusted O&M expenses are just slightly higher today than they were in 2010. Since then, we've added approximately 317,000 customer connections while expenses only increased at a compound annual growth rate of 0.9%. This is incredible work by our employees. 
Finally, before I turn the call over to Susan, I want to thank all American Water employees for their commitment to safety as we continue to provide essential services during this pandemic. I also want to send a special thanks to our employees in California, who once again are safely and successfully providing critical water service as that state deals with catastrophic wildfires. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Susan."

Results for the 9-month period include an estimated $0.10 per share increase year-over-year for warmer and drier than normal weather in the third quarter of 2020 versus wetter than normal conditions in the second quarter of 2019. Also for the year-to-date period, results reflect $0.04 per share for depreciation not recorded as required by assets held for sale accounting and an estimated $0.02 per share unfavorable impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. Our Regulated Businesses increased $0.32 per share, our Market-Based Businesses increased $0.02 per share, and finally, the parent results decreased by $0.12 per share year-over-year, primarily due to higher interest expense to support growth in the regulated business and the sale of a legacy investment in 2019. 
Moving to Slide 12. Let me walk through the third quarter results by business. The Regulated Operations increased $0.11 per share before considering the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic for the quarter. We saw a $0.16 per share increase from additional authorized revenue and surcharges to support infrastructure investments, acquisitions and organic growth. As I mentioned previously, results reflect an estimated $0.06 per share increase from favorable weather in various parts of our service territory. O&M expense increased by $0.06 per share and depreciation increased $0.05 per share, net of the $0.01 per share for depreciation not recorded as required by assets held for sale accounting. The Market-Based Business third quarter results in 2020 were consistent with 2019, and the parent results decreased $0.01 per share, reflecting higher interest expense. And lastly, there was an estimated $0.03 per share favorable net impact from the COVID-19 pandemic as demand revenues in the Regulated Businesses improved, primarily in the residential customer class. During the quarter, we saw residential demand increased 13.6%. The increase reflects the impact of weather, normal changes in demand, growth and certainly the impact of more stay at home activities. Further, during the quarter, we saw commercial and industrial volumes improved to nearly flat year-over-year, reflective of what we expect is at least a partial recovery as local communities began to reopen. Recall, we saw commercial volumes down 10.3% through the second quarter. In the third quarter, we have seen the impact of the pandemic on the homeowner services group from delays in new partnerships and a launch of new products, and we started to see some recovery with 2 new partnership adds in the third quarter as companies are able to start to prioritize normal operations. And the ability to fully estimate the impact of the pandemic is challenging, as Walter said, but the anecdotal information from our state teams and our Market-Based Business team validates the trends we have seen in the third quarter. 
Moving to Slide 13. 9-month EPS increased 7.6% year-over-year. Regulated Operations increased $0.32 per share for the period, and we saw $0.48 per share increase from additional authorized revenue and an estimated $0.10 per share increase from weather year-over-year. O&M expense increased by $0.16 per share and depreciation increased $0.10 per share, net of the $0.04 per share for depreciation not recorded on assets held for sale. The Market-Based Businesses increased $0.04 per share due to Joint Base in San Antonio and the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York going into full operation as of June 1, 2020, for military services as well as price increases and organic growth in homeowner services. Current results decreased $0.12 per share, largely driven by $0.03 per share due to the sale of a legacy investment in 2019, and a $0.05 per share increase in interest expense. The estimated net impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is $0.02 per share unfavorable for the year-to-date period. As mentioned in the regulated business, increased demand in the residential customer class has largely offset decreases in revenue from the commercial and industrial classes to date. So the second quarter trend was a bit more negative, as we discussed, our initial intuition was that this offset would ultimately be the case. The unknown remains, though, as we -- as to how long, to what degree the pandemic continues. As we continue to watch these rate -- these case rates increase in many of our territories, it's possible that additional restrictions are put in place that could again negatively impact demand for our commercial customers. 
Moving on to Slide 14. The continued successful execution of our regulatory strategy is a key element of our ability to consistently deliver financial results. As of October 31, the Regulated Business received $127 million in annualized new revenues in 2020. This includes $57 million from rate cases, including step increases and $70 million from infrastructure surcharges. Included in this number is the outcome from our most recent rate case in New Jersey, as Walter mentioned, at the start of the call. We have also filed requests and are awaiting final orders on the 5 rate cases previously discussed by Walter, and 3 infrastructure surcharge proceedings for a total annualized revenue request of $212 million. From a regulatory perspective, we are continuing to work diligently to address the impact of the pandemic in our service territories. As of today, we have commissioned orders, authorizing deferred accounting for COVID-19 financial impacts in 11 of our 14 jurisdictions with 3 proceedings pending in Kentucky, Tennessee and New York. Essentially, all direct costs and foregone revenues are being captured for future recovery. Currently, the bottom line impact on the regulated business from the pandemic is the estimated variance in demand revenues, as we just discussed and the minor impact on homeowner services. 
Moving on to Slide 15. As Walter said, we now expect our 2020 earnings to be in the range of $3.87 per share to $3.93 per share, up from $3.79 to $3.89 per share. This guidance range reflects the favorable benefit of weather year-to-date and assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year. It reflects an estimated $0.06 per share for depreciation not recorded as required by the assets held for sale accounting, and it also reflects an estimated $0.03 to $0.06 per share unfavorable impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. As we've said throughout this call, the full year estimated impact of COVID-19 is highly dependent on the projected impact of a number of unknown factors, which could include the length and severity of any impact on the demand for services and the nature and scope of any regulatory solutions. 
Finally, moving on to Slide 16. As Walter noted, the company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share of common stock in October. This reflects the continuation of the 10% increase in the annual dividend declared by the Board on April 29, 2020. We continue to be a top leader in dividend growth. We have grown our dividend at a compound annual growth rate of 10.1% over the last 5 years against the target of the high end of the 7% to 10% range. Also, we continue to target a dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60% of earnings. As we've discussed all year, our total company consolidated actual return on equity is 10.6% now for the 12-month period ended September 30, 2020. Regulatory execution, along with the strong results from our Market-Based Businesses, allows us to consistently deliver on our earnings commitment. We continue to believe that delivering on results combined with our strong earnings growth and superior dividend growth expectations provides excellent value for our investors. The decades of investment need continues and drives our planned $20 billion to $22 billion of capital investment over the next 2 years. With the fragmented water and wastewater landscape and as states and local communities continue to face added challenges from impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe we can provide those states and towns water and wastewater solutions to help mitigate those impacts. We see our business as resilient, and we have built it in a way to endure challenges like we are seeing with the current pandemic. 
And with that, let me turn the call back over to Walter for few additional remarks."

We saw a fairly substantial impact through the second quarter, and it's recovered some in the third as we saw the commercial business. The commercial sector come back a bit, and the residential sector, again, continues to be pretty strong growth there. I think the challenge, of course, is to try to estimate how long this thing lasts and what the sort of new surge of cases may, in fact, do to businesses across our service territory, did they go into some additional phase of shutdown. So again, we've tried to capture some assumptions around that in our guidance range of the $0.03 to $0.06 unfavorable. Just difficult to predict, obviously, as we see this thing continue to unfold.

Or not like just a couple of [indiscernible], but just kind of curious."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We have a lot to cover today.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We have a lot to cover today. I'll start with a few comments on the national election, then move to key updates on our business, including our continued focus on the implications of COVID-19. Susan will then provide a more detailed review of our third quarter and year-to-date financial results along with other updates.
So let me start with Tuesday's election. American Water has and will continue to work with both sides of the isle in constructive water policy. Water and wastewater infrastructure remain a bipartisan issue, and we'll stay engaged with leaders at the state and federal level on this issue on behalf of our customers. We continue to believe that investment in the country's water and wastewater infrastructure is important. Supportive legislation and regulation are also critical to ensure customer bills are affordable.
Let's move to Slide 5 and our third quarter results. The employees of American Water delivered solid results and further strengthened our low-risk profile and predictable growth story. Our results were driven by the continued execution of our strategies. Our third quarter 2020 earnings per share were up 9.8% compared to third quarter 2019. We invested capital of $1.38 billion in the first 3 quarters of 2020, which is a 10.4% increase over the same period last year. We balanced that investment through our focused effort to control cost as we work towards our long-term O&M efficiency goal of 31.3% by 2024. We've added more than 47,000 customer connections to date through closed acquisitions and organic growth and look forward to welcoming an additional 19,000 customer connections through pending acquisitions, most of which we expect to close in 2021. 
As it relates to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, safety continues to be our top priority. Susan will give more detail in a minute, but as you saw in our 10-Q, residential demand continued higher, and we saw some rebound in commercial demand as businesses started to reopen. As a result of this higher demand in the third quarter, we saw an estimated favorable impact of $0.03 per share. We'll continue to assess the situation across our service territory. 
Recognizing that it's difficult to predict the impact, we currently anticipate a full year unfavorable $0.03 to $0.06 per share from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Also included in the results is an estimated $0.06 per share favorable impact in 2020 from hotter, drier weather across some of our regulated states. This compares to $0.04 per share unfavorable impact for the same period in 2019 from wetter-than-normal conditions in both the Midwest and Northeast.
Moving to our Market-Based Businesses. We were very proud to announce that our Military Services Group was awarded the contract for the operation and maintenance of the water and wastewater utility systems at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state. We're now honored to provide water and wastewater services to more than 425,000 military men, women and their families at 17 installations across the United States.
Moving to Slide 6. The foundation of our earnings growth continues to be the capital investment we make in our regulated operations. We plan to invest $20 billion to $22 billion in capital over the next 10 years to ensure the quality and reliability of our services and to bring water and wastewater solutions to communities across the country. 
We're increasing our 2020 earnings range to $3.87 to $3.93 per share, up from $3.79 to $3.89 per share. This reflects the favorable weather in the quarter. We're also affirming our long-term EPS compound annual growth rate in the 7% to 10% range. Also, consistent with our previous dividend guidance, on October 26, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.55 per share of common stock payable on December 2, 2020.
Turning to Slide 7. Let's go through some of the regulatory highlights of the third quarter 2020. We currently have 5 pending rate cases, and I'll cover the more significant development since our last call. Last week, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities approved a settlement between New Jersey American Water, BPU staff and the New Jersey Division of Rate Counsel for new water and wastewater rates. The new rates represent a $39 million annual increase in water and wastewater revenues. In a separate proceeding, the BPU also approved a customer credit associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that will offset the rate increase for the average residential customer through August 31, 2021. While the customer credit will benefit customer bills, it will have no earnings impact in New Jersey American Water as it's offset by lower tax expense during this period. The company's rate case was driven by more than $1 billion in infrastructure investments since the last rate case. 
Last week, Pennsylvania American Water and the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission and Bureau of Investigations and Enforcement entered into a settlement agreement, providing for a total annualized revenue increase of $70.5 million over a 2-year period. The terms of the proposed settlement have been presented for review to the PUC Administrative Law Judge. Until the Administrative Law Judge and Commission are able to review their proposed settlement and render their decisions, it would be premature to discuss the terms of the settlement any further. As you recall, Pennsylvania American Water's general rate case requested $92 million in the first year and $46 million in the second year. Pennsylvania American Water will have invested $1.6 billion in infrastructure upgrades for the 4-year period of 2019 through 2022. 
We also have pending rate cases in Missouri, Iowa, California and Virginia, and those cases are moving along on schedule.
Also, in California, the California Public Utility Commission released the decision in September under its Low-income Ratepayer Assistance Program rulemaking. The decision will require California American Water to file a proposal to alter its Water Revenue Adjustment Mechanism, or WRAM, in its next general rate case filing in 2022, which will become effective in January 2024. California American Water has filed an application for a rehearing of the decision.  
Finally, in September, and after careful consideration, California American Water withdrew a portion of its application at the California Coastal Commission for the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project in an effort to further educate stakeholders on environmental and water supply benefits of the project. The company will be resubmitting its application in the near future, and once submitted, by statute, the California Coastal Commission would have 180 days to process after it deems the application complete.
Lastly, regarding the sale of New York American Water. Last week, the governor announced proposed legislation that would include a PSC study of a public takeover option. We'll review the legislation when a bill is introduced. We still firmly believe the sale of New York American Water to Liberty is in the best interest of our customers, and we'll continue to take the needed steps to close the transaction in early 2021. 
Regarding state legislation. We've seen multiple states take action to help tackle water and wastewater challenges. In Indiana, legislation passed that authorizes recovery for aboveground infrastructure without a full rate case. And separate legislation passed that establishes an appraisal process for non-municipal utilities to establish fair market value and a reasonable purchase price. Iowa amended legislation that gives the Iowa Utilities Board 180 days to approve acquisitions and allows systems to qualify as a distressed system when they don't have a certified operator. Virginia also signed its version of fair market value legislation into law this year, and West Virginia passed a bill that allows for expanded asset valuation, combined water and wastewater ratemaking and expansion of how municipalities can use proceeds from the sale of a water or wastewater system.
Moving on to Slide 8. In addition to legislative action to help communities solve water and wastewater challenges, we believe our commitment to putting customers first is key to growing our regulated footprint. As I mentioned, so far in 2020, we've closed on 20 acquisitions in 9 different states, adding approximately 36,200 new customer connections. We've also added approximately 10,900 customer connections through organic growth through 9 months. We look forward to adding another 19,000 customer connections to currently sign agreements in 7 states. Also, the pipeline of opportunities we've noted are a result of increased conversations we're having across our footprint with communities looking for solutions to water and wastewater challenges. These opportunities are in various stages of development, and as you know, the process can take multiple years. 
We know that many communities are facing unprecedented challenges now, and our mission is to help make those communities better because we're there. This includes our recent acquisitions of the city of Jerseyville water and wastewater system in Illinois and the Long Hill sewer system in New Jersey. According to the city of Jerseyville mayor, William Russell, ""We can trust that our water and wastewater systems are in professional, caring hands."" 
Moving on to Slide 9. Customers remain at the center of every decision we make. This means smart investments, balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. For the 12-month period ending September 30, 2020, our O&M efficiency ratio improved to 34.2% compared to 34.8% for the 12-month period ended September 30, 2019. Our adjusted O&M expenses are just slightly higher today than they were in 2010. Since then, we've added approximately 317,000 customer connections, while expenses only increased at a compound annual growth rate of 0.9%. This is incredible work by our employees. 
Finally, before I turn the call over to Susan, I want to thank all American Water employees for their commitment to safety as we continue to provide essential services during this pandemic. I also want to send a special thanks to our employees in California, who once again, are safely and successfully providing critical water service as that state deals with catastrophic wildfires.
And with that, let me turn it over to Susan."

As Walter mentioned, included in earn",1450,"Thanks, Walter, and good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 11 with a bit more detail on results for the quarter. Third quarter 2020 consolidated earnings were $1.46 per share compared to $1.33 per share in 2019. As Walter mentioned, included in earnings is an estimated $0.06 per share favorable weather impact. The Regulated Business segment results increased $0.14 per share or an increase of 10.8% compared to 2019 earnings. The Market-Based Business results were flat to the prior year, and the parent company decreased $0.01 per share compared to the third quarter of 2019. 
Our 2020 earnings through September 30 were $3.11 per share or a 7.6% increase over the same period last year. Results for the 9-month period include an estimated $0.10 per share increase year-over-year from warmer and drier-than-normal weather in the third quarter of 2020 versus wetter-than-normal conditions in the second quarter of 2019. 
Also, for the year-to-date period, results reflect $0.04 per share for depreciation not recorded as required by assets held for sale accounting and an estimated $0.02 per share unfavorable impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Our Regulated Businesses increased $0.32 per share. Our Market-Based Businesses increased $0.02 per share, and finally, the parent results decreased by $0.12 per share year-over-year, primarily due to higher interest expense to support growth in the regulated business and the sale of a legacy investment in 2019.
Moving to Slide 12. Let me walk through the third quarter results by business. The Regulated Operations increased $0.11 per share before considering the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic for the quarter. We saw a $0.16 per share increase from additional authorized revenue and surcharges to support infrastructure investments, acquisitions and organic growth. As I mentioned previously, results reflect an estimated $0.06 per share increase from favorable weather in various parts of our service territory. O&M expense increased by $0.06 per share and depreciation increased $0.05 per share, net of the $0.01 per share for depreciation not recorded as required by assets held for sale accounting. 
The Market-Based Business third quarter results in 2020 were consistent with 2019, and the parent results decreased $0.01 per share, reflecting higher interest expense. 
And lastly, there was an estimated $0.03 per share favorable net impact from the COVID-19 pandemic as demand revenues in the regulated business improved, primarily in the residential customer class. During the quarter, we saw residential demand increase 13.6%. The increase reflects the impact of weather, normal changes in demand, growth and certainly the impact of more stay-at-home activities. Further, during the quarter, we saw commercial and industrial volumes improve to nearly flat year-over-year, reflective of what we expected, at least, a partial recovery as local communities began to reopen. Recall, we saw commercial volumes down 10.3% through the second quarter. 
In the third quarter, we have seen the impact of the pandemic on the Homeowner Services Group from delays in new partnerships and a launch of new products. And we started to see some recovery with 2 new partnership adds in the third quarter as companies are able to start to prioritize normal operations. And the ability to fully estimate the impact of the pandemic is challenging, as Walter said, but the anecdotal information from our state teams and our Market-Based Business team validates the trends we have seen in the third quarter.
Moving to Slide 13. 9-month EPS increased 7.6% year-over-year. Regulated Operations increased $0.32 per share for the period, and we saw $0.48 per share increase from additional authorized revenue and an estimated $0.10 per share increase from weather year-over-year. O&M expense increased by $0.16 per share and depreciation increased $0.10 per share, net of the $0.04 per share for depreciation not recorded on assets held for sale. The Market-Based Businesses increased $0.04 per share due to Joint Base in San Antonio and the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York going into full operation as of June 1, 2020, for military services as well as price increases and organic growth in Homeowner Services. Parent results decreased $0.12 per share, largely driven by $0.03 per share due to the sale of a legacy investment in 2019, and a $0.05 per share increase in interest expense. 
The estimated net impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is $0.02 per share unfavorable for the year-to-date period. As mentioned, in the regulated business, increased demand in the residential customer class has largely offset decreases in revenue from the commercial and industrial classes to date. Though the second quarter trend was a bit more negative, as we discussed, our initial intuition was that this offset would ultimately be the case. The unknown remains, though, as we -- as to how long and to what degree the pandemic continues. As we continue to watch these rate case-- these case rates increase in many of our territories, it's possible that additional restrictions are put in place that could, again, negatively impact demand for our commercial customers.
Moving on to Slide 14. The continued successful execution of our regulatory strategy is a key element of our ability to consistently deliver financial results. As of October 31, the Regulated Business received $127 million in annualized new revenues in 2020. This includes $57 million from rate cases, including step increases; and $70 million from infrastructure surcharges. Included in this number is the outcome from our most recent rate case in New Jersey, as Walter mentioned, at the start of the call. We have also filed requests and are awaiting final orders on the 5 rate cases previously discussed by Walter and 3 infrastructure surcharge proceedings for a total annualized revenue request of $212 million. 
From a regulatory perspective, we are continuing to work diligently to address the impact of the pandemic in our service territories. As of today, we have commissioned orders, authorizing deferred accounting for COVID-19 financial impacts in 11 of our 14 jurisdictions, with 3 proceedings pending in Kentucky, Tennessee and New York. Essentially, all direct costs and foregone revenues are being captured for future recovery. Currently, the bottom line impact on the regulated business from the pandemic is the estimated variance in demand revenues, as we just discussed, and the minor impact on Homeowner Services.
Moving on to Slide 15. As Walter said, we now expect our 2020 earnings to be in the range of $3.87 per share to $3.93 per share, up from $3.79 to $3.89 per share. This guidance range reflects the favorable benefit of weather year-to-date and assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year. It reflects an estimated $0.06 per share for depreciation not recorded as required by the assets held for sale accounting, and it also reflects an estimated $0.03 to $0.06 per share unfavorable impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. As we've said throughout this call, the full year estimated impact of COVID-19 is highly dependent on the projected impact of a number of unknown factors, which could include the length and severity of any impact on the demand for services and the nature and scope of any regulatory solutions.
Finally, moving on to Slide 16. As Walter noted, the company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share of common stock in October. This reflects the continuation of the 10% increase in the annual dividend declared by the Board on April 29, 2020. We continue to be a top leader in dividend growth. We have grown our dividend at a compound annual growth rate of 10.1% over the last 5 years against the target of the high end of the 7% to 10% range. Also, we continue to target a dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60% of earnings. 
As we've discussed all year, our total company consolidated actual return on equity is 10.6% now for the 12-month period ended September 30, 2020. Regulatory execution, along with the strong results from our Market-Based Businesses, allows us to consistently deliver on our earnings commitment. We continue to believe that delivering on results combined with our strong earnings growth and superior dividend growth expectations provides excellent value for our investors. The decades of investment need continues and drives our planned $20 billion to $22 billion of capital investment over the next 10 years. With the fragmented water and wastewater landscape, and as state and local communities continue to face added challenges from impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe we can provide those states and towns water and wastewater solutions to help mitigate those impacts. We see our business as resilient, and we have built it in a way to endure challenges like we are seeing with the current pandemic.
And with that, let me turn the call back over to Walter for a few additional remarks."

Second, as you all know, Veterans Day is next week. I'd like to take a moment to thank all the men and women who served and protected our country. As you may know, I graduated from West Point, was honored to serve as an army officer for more than 5 years. I'm proud to be a veteran and equally proud that American Water is a culture that reflects the support of our military. This year, we've been recognized by 2 veterans publications, U.S. Veterans Magazine and Military Times, receiving the honor as a top veteran-friendly company for having a top supplier diversity program and being among the top 100 Best for Vets Employers. And most recently, American Water received the highest recognition given by the U.S. government to employers, 2020 Secretary of Defense Employer Support Freedom Award, for exemplary support of National Guard and Reserve employees. We're extremely proud of this recognition, and we'll continue to work with and support those who serve our country. 
With that, we're happy to take your questions."

Our guidance overall, as we indicated, we've changed guidance this quarter, increased it. And included in that guidance range is an assumption of $0.03 to $0.06 unfavorable for the year, and that really, I think, reflects our current trends. We saw a fairly substantial impact through the second quarter, and it's recovered some in the third as we saw the commercial business -- the commercial sector come back a bit, and the residential sector, again, continues to be pretty strong growth there. I think the challenge, of course, is to try to estimate how long this thing lasts and what the sort of new surge of cases may, in fact, do to businesses across our service territory, do they go into some additional phase of shutdown. So again, we've tried to capture some assumptions around that in our guidance range of the $0.03 to $0.06 unfavorable. Just difficult to predict, obviously, as we see this thing continue to unfold. And it is included in that guidance range that we established.
I mentioned on the regulatory front, we now have deferral orders in 11 of the 14 jurisdictions, and that really does cover exposures to bad debt expense increases, direct costs associated with the pandemic, et cetera. So really, the impact that falls through, if you will, is just the demand revenue changes that we might see across the service territory.
