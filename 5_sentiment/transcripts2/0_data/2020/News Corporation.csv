Before we begin the formalities, I would like to express my sincere thanks to our readers, customers and employees in Australia, who combined to respond thoughtfully and meaningfully to the tragic bushfires, which have had profound cons",2016,"Thank you, Mike. 
Before we begin the formalities, I would like to express my sincere thanks to our readers, customers and employees in Australia, who combined to respond thoughtfully and meaningfully to the tragic bushfires, which have had profound consequences for many communities. 
In particular, our reporters and editors and photographers have done an extraordinary job in tracking the fires and highlighting the impact of the tragedy on towns and regions that will take much time to recover. 
We are pleased that the company and its founders have pledged more than $11 million to the cause, and our company has continuing fundraising campaigns that will contribute significantly more over the coming months. 
We also thank the many companies, which have partnered with News Corp to make a positive difference for Australian communities. 
Turning to our results. As we anticipated, the second quarter was somewhat soft for various businesses. However, we expect improvement in the second half as real estate markets in Australia shows signs of gradual recovery, and we continue to progress with [ opcity ] at move, which should benefit the performance of our digital real estate businesses. 
We also expect faster growth in digital revenues at Dow Jones from the previously announced content licensing arrangements, particularly with Facebook, and improvement in book publishing based on the timing of the release schedule. Meanwhile, we are on the cusp of the seasonal selling peak for Foxtel, given that the main Winter sports as soon to launch and Kayo, our streaming service, has already started seeing upturn in new subscribers, even though, we are still in the midst of the low season for sales. 
We took an important step on our path towards simplification with the sale of Unruly, and notable development, which will yield financial benefits for us going forward. And I am pleased to say that following our strategic review of News America marketing, we are engaged in negotiations for a sale of that business. 
These ongoing simplification efforts showing a brighter light on the intrinsic and increasing value of our core assets, which have been [ tightly ] unappreciated and underappreciated for too long. 
For the quarter, the company reported total revenues of approximately $2.5 billion, with total segment EBITDA of $355 million. This represents a decline of 6% in revenues and 4% in profitability versus the prior year. 
Foreign exchange fluctuations affected our results with a $50 million effect on revenues or negative 2%. 
As I mentioned last quarter, we are now seeing the early benefits from our long battle for equitable treatment by the dominant tech platforms. In particular, our deals with Apple and Facebook are beginning to yield financial dividends, and we welcome their respect for the premium journalism produced by the talented professionals in News Corp. 
There are also positive signs that [indiscernible], Google has a thoughtful appreciation for the profound social influence of high-quality journals. 
In digital real estate services, listing volume in Australia remains challenged, but the trend improved somewhat in the quarter, particularly, in Melbourne and Sydney. REA group posted record traffic in October and buyer inquiries were up 37% in Q2 versus the prior year. 
These signs point to a gradual recovery this year in the Australian housing market, which will, obviously, be efficacious for REA's revenues. 
At Move, operator of realtor.com, profit contribution showed a substantial improvement in the quarter. Real estate revenue grew 4% as we transitioned to the referral model, which had a natural impact on the timing of revenues. 
Key indicators for the property market are encouraging, and we expect to see improvements that move in the second half of the year, largely due to the progress at Opcity. 
We also envisage increasing monetization of relevant adjacencies as we further leverage our deep transaction data, which has made significantly more valuable by Opcity's ability to define and refine leads. 
Despite Q2 being a weaker quarter seasonally, we nonetheless saw traffic up 9% year-over-year and a more than 30% increase in page views based on internal metrics. Throughout most of calendar year 2019, realtor.com continued to gain audience share relative to Zillow and Trulia according to comScore. 
We welcome [indiscernible] to move this week as the new CEO. David is [ savvy ] digital commerce leader, comes from eBay and had previously worked at Expedia. His technological vision and marketing prowess will serve realtor.com and News Corp well in the years ahead. 
Tracey Fellows, who ably served as acting new CEO, is now focusing on her role as President of Global Digital Real Estate, and we'll be emphasizing the development of our burgeoning digital real estate assets. 
Speaking of new talent at News Corp, I'm also pleased to note the arrival of [ David Klein ] as News Corp's Chief Technology Officer. David was at Viacom for the past decade, and earlier, at Discovery Communications and is expert at driving innovation -- innovation and efficiency in global content businesses. David will ensure that our global shared services are robust at costs and managed [indiscernible], security integrity has heightened and technological creativity is enhanced. 
The News and Information Services segment showed tangible improvement in the quarter. The segment EBITDA increasing 27% versus the prior year. Dow Jones had another strong quarter, with 17% growth in digital only subscribers, including 13% growth in Wall Street Journal digital subscriptions year-over-year. 
The Journal's total subscriber base continues to set records, with almost 2.7 million subscribers as of the end of the second quarter. And more recently, Dow Jones consumer subscriptions achieved a new record, surpassing 3.5 million, with the Journal crossing the 2 million digital subscriptions mark. 
I would like to highlight the continuing success of risk and compliance, where revenues grew a healthy 21%. In fact, risk and compliance has now seen over 20% revenue growth for 12 straight quarters. 
We believe the intrinsic value of this business is rising validated by recent transactions in the sector, where acquisitions have commanded multiples of 20x to 25x EBITDA. 
Risk and compliance is not only a jewel in the crown at Dow Jones, but is on the way to becoming one of News Corp's most valuable assets. 
Our efforts to leverage the Wall Street Journal's content continue to yield benefits and are clearly seen in the success of The Journal, the podcast produced with Spotify. Since it's September launch, there have been 20 million downloads. We still have work to do in perfecting podcast, but the acquisition of Wireless in the U.K. has given us direct access to a professional pool of broadcast talent. 
And at the WSJ, we have just begun recognizing revenues from our Facebook content licensing agreement, with that contribution meaningfully increasing in the second half of the fiscal year under the terms of our contract. 
Barron's subscribers hit a record at 615,000 in Q2, up 8% over the prior year, and we launched a new show on the Fox Business Network during the quarter, Barron's roundtable, which already has a full roster of sponsors. 
In the U.K., where political stability and leadership have relievedly returned, News U.K. had a strong quarter, reflected in results from The Times, The Sunday Times and The Sun. We saw higher ad revenues at News U.K. Q2, with digital growth outpacing [ print declines ], led by meaningful improvement at The Sun, whose audience grew to approximately 134 million global average monthly unique users in Q2, an increase of 9% on Q1 according to Google Analytics. 
The Times and Sunday Times added digital readers and reached 320,000 subscriptions in Q2, up 19% year-over-year. Speaking of these publications, News U.K. last week announced the creation of Times Radio, a new digital station, which will bring together the expertise of the Times and The Sunday Times and Wireless. 
The Sun also moved to monetize its already substantial American audience by launching a U.S.-based website last month. [ Daily Sun ] strongly suggests that he's tapping into an underserved, growing and potentially [ lucrative ] audience. 
In Australia, where the economy has been a little listless and currency relatively weak, our [indiscernible] expanded to more than 566,000 digital subscriptions as of the end of the quarter, 23% year-over-year growth. That figure is led by the continued digital transformation at the Australia, with 65% of total subscribers now digital-only. 
In the U.S., New York Post revenues rose with digital advertising, again, reaching over 70% of total advertising revenues and achieving more than 20% revenue growth. The post-digital network had an audience of 95.2 million unique visitors in December, up over 30% year-over-year. 
Also in the U.S., just last week, we launched news.com in beta, delivering a uniquely wide range of automated and curated journalism to readers on mobile and [ Zisco ]. News.com offers prominence for providence and aims to bring as much data as possible to publishers, while subscription sites will not be punished in the ranking system. 
By combining sophisticated artificial intelligence with provisional editing, news.com exposes readers to a vast array of news and views, from left to right, from large publishers to small national and regional and from every state in the country. 
In its first week of soft launch, news had 258,000 users according to Google Analytics. I recommend that you all download the News App. If you don't use, you simply don't know. 
Turning to subscription video services. Foxtel subscribers increased by 3% to 2.95 million, benefiting from the launch of Kayo in November 2018. We are in the traditional low season for sports subscriptions, but Kayo had 372,000 subscribers and 350,000 solely paid subscribers as of the quarter's end, up from 42,000 at the same time last year. 
As of February 5, Kayo had over 370,000 paid subscribers, a positive trajectory as we head into the higher season for sports in Australia. Customer reviews are overwhelmingly positive and user interface and experience are world class. In fact, they are peer less. 
Foxtel remains focused on the user experience and strengthening the core foundation of its business, including its powerful entertainment lineup, now featuring 6 new Fox-branded channels, more video on-demand content, a refreshed movie offering and a partnership with Netflix, among various other streaming services. 
Foxtel also completed key content agreements with NBCU and Discovery in the quarter, providing more on-demand content so that it is the go-to provider of programming in Australia. 
Finally, at Foxtel, we are planning our entertainment OTT product, which is built off the Kayo system, and like Kayo, will help maximize the value of existing rights and reach [indiscernible] [ conscious ] consumers outside our traditional [ realm ]. 
In book publishing, we had tough comparisons with the prior year. Though [indiscernible] did see better growth sequentially in digital through the continued expansion of audio books. David Walliams' latest children's book, The Beast of Buckingham Palace, did well in the U.K. We are confident that we should see improvement in the second half, given the timing of the release schedule, the continued popularity of the [indiscernible] and the recent successful release of Profile and Corruption by [ Peter Schweizer ]. 
We also look forward to the overall release of Volume 2 of Joanna Gaines' highly popular Magnolia Table. We have also just released books by Jessica Simpson and [ Carry Underwood ]. And in May, we expect to benefit from the release of the film, Women in the Window, based on the autonomous best seller by A.J. Finn. 
To summarize, the first half was, as expected, [indiscernible] sluggish, but we see progress across many of the segments in the second half. It is increasingly clear that News Corp is harvesting benefits from being a creator of content as markets, societies and the big tech platforms appreciate its commercial value. 
We are simplifying the structure of the company with a view to maximizing its value for investors. As a result, for example, the inherent value of our digital real estate assets and our [indiscernible] will be more obvious to the benefit of all our shareholders. 
And now for more details on the second quarter of financial 2020, I turn to Susan Panuccio."
212741644,651868472,1902336,"News Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 06, 2020",2020-02-06,"Earnings Calls","News Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Robert. Turning to the financials. Fiscal 2020 second quarter total revenues were approximately $2.5 billion, down 6% versus the prior year, and total segment EBITDA was $355 million, down 4% versus the prior year.

Turning to the financials. Fiscal 2020 second quarter total revenues were approximately $2.5 billion, down 6% versus the prior year, and total segment EBITDA was $355 million, down 4% versus the prior year. 
On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, currency fluctuations and the other items in our release, revenues fell 4% and total segment EBITDA decreased 3%, a notable improvement from the prior quarter's EBITDA performance. 
For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $0.14 as compared to $0.16 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.18 in the quarter, flat with the prior year. 
Turning now to the individual operation segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were over $1.2 billion, down 1% versus the prior year. On an adjusted basis, revenues were flat, reflecting a material improvement from the prior quarter. 
Advertising fell 5%, while circulation and subscriptions grew 3%, despite currency headwinds. Digital revenues for Dow Jones and the Newspaper [indiscernible] represented 39% of their combined revenues, up from 35% in the prior year. 
Segment EBITDA for the quarter was $142 million, up 27% from $112 million, benefiting from the growth at News U.K. and Dow Jones. There was a one-time benefit of approximately $22 million due to the settlement of certain warranty-related claims in the U.K. However, even absent that benefit, we saw growth in segment EBITDA. This was driven by the U.K., dow Jones and the narrowing losses at the New York Post, partially offset by lower contributions from News Australia and News America marketing. 
Similar to the first quarter, we reclassified approximately $8 million of costs in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 than the other segment to the News and Information Services segment. These reallocated costs are related to various initiatives, including News IQ, our global programmatic effort, and certain shared technology services that directly benefit the News and Information Services segment as part of our ongoing efforts to leverage our global scale to lower costs. 
Turning now to the segment highlights. At Dow Jones, consumer circulation revenues grew at a healthy 5%, reflecting 17% growth in digital paid subscribers across Dow Jones consumer products. This includes 13% growth in digital-only paid subscribers at the Wall Street Journal. In the aggregate, the Wall Street Journal subscriber base reached approximately 2.6 million. 
Professional Information business revenues accounted for 27% of Dow Jones' revenues this quarter, growing 8% to $115 million, maintaining momentum from the first quarter. As Robert mentioned, the key growth engine continues to be in risk and compliance, which grew a healthy 21% this quarter. This is a highly profitable and scalable business and is on track to approach $160 million of revenue this fiscal year. 
The Newswire product also showed growth benefiting from licensing deals with Bloomberg and success, while [ Factiva ] was stable. 
Advertising at Dow Jones was weaker this quarter, falling about 5% compared to the prior year. Digital accounted for 43% of advertising revenue and digital advertising was lower in the second quarter, primarily due to tough comparatives from the prior year, which saw significant programmatic growth from MarketWatch. 
However, we have seen a strong start so far this quarter, although, visibility remains limited. While it is very early days, we are making progress on monetizing valuable third-party partnerships, which are a key strategic focus as we expand the reach of Dow Jones and the Wall Street Journal across digital platforms and markets. These include deals with Twitter for our WSJ WatchNow videos, our week-day podcast, the Journal with Spotify and our recent content partnerships with Apple and Facebook. 
Overall, Dow Jones posted 4% revenue growth and another quarter of increased segment EBITDA contribution. Elsewhere across our news portfolio, advertising conditions were mixed. News U.K.'s advertising revenues rose 5% on both the reported and local currency basis, representing the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth on a local currency basis led by digital advertising growth at The Sun and moderating print declines. 
Advertising conditions in Australia remained challenging, but improved slightly from the prior quarter rate, with revenues down 11% on a reported basis and down 7% in local currency. 
For circulation revenues, the increase in cover prices and digital subscribers at, both News Australia and News U.K., helped mitigate print volume declines and Australian currency headwinds. 
Finally, at News America marketing, revenues fell 4%, an improvement from quarter 1. 
Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $501 million, down 11% versus $562 million in the prior year, of which $25 million or 5% was due to the negative impact from foreign currency. On an adjusted basis, revenues declined 6%. 
Broadcast subscriber trends were relatively similar to the prior quarter, with the revenue decline driven by a lower broadcast subscriber base and changes to the broadcast subscriber package mix as well as modestly lower pay-per-view revenues. 
Revenue declines were partially offset by expanding OTT revenues. As a reminder, we lapped a price increase from last year, which also impacted the year-over-year comparison. 
Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $70 million, down 17% from the prior year, driven by the revenue decline, partially offset by lower total cost, including programming and transmission costs as the team at Foxtel continues to focus on streamlining business. 
Turning to the KPIs. Foxtel's closing trade subscriber base was approximately 3 million as of December 31, reflecting a 3% growth or 96,000 subscribers versus the prior year driven by the launch of Kayo in November 2018. 
Total paying OTT subscribers reached 684,000, up 73% versus last year. We've seen over the past year that Kayo's paid customers will increase around key exclusive events. With the conclusion of Australia's popular Winter Sports and the Rugby World Cup, the number of paid subscribers in Kayo fell from the prior quarter. Notwithstanding, Kayo viewer engagement continues to be strong, with subscribers watching an average of 5.3 weekly hours, with the average customer watching 7 of the 50 different sports available on Kayo each week. 
We've also been pleased with the increasing brand awareness, the stability of the platform, and more importantly, customer feedback in relation to the user experience. Kayo's solid subscriber base gives us optimism as it enters its second year ahead of the prime Winter Sports selling season. 
The team continues to work on a new OTT entertainment product built on the Kayo technology platform, with the commercial launch anticipated in the fourth quarter. 
In the second quarter, broadcast churn was 16%, which is slightly higher than the 15.6% in the prior year. Foxtel direct-channel churn of 14% was [ 2.5 points ] lower than the prior year, which was the lowest second quarter rate in 4 years. Like last quarter, the main driver behind the higher churn is coming from lower ARPU Telstra wholesale customers on expiring contracts from the past 12 to 24 months. 
Broadcast ARPU declined about 1% to over AUD 77 per month. In November, we completed the refinancing of a significant portion of Foxtel debt, which extended maturities for at least 3 years. More details will be available in the 10-Q filing. 
At Book Publishing, HarperCollins' revenues for the quarter fell 11% to $442 million and segment EBITDA fell 28% to $63 million. As we have previously indicated, the revenue decline this quarter was primarily due to a tough comparison with the prior year, which included [ Homebody ] by Joanna Gaines, [ Bill Offshore Face ] by [ Rachel Hollis ], the [ Hague by N.G. Thomas ] and higher backwards sales from the [ Subtle Art ] by [ Mark Manson ]. 
The declines were partially offset by new releases, which include the [ Pioneer Woman Cooks ], [ The New Frontier ] by [indiscernible] and The Beast of Buckingham Palace by David Walliams. 
We saw a 5% improvement in digital sales compared to the prior year, primarily due to the 17% growth in downloadable audio books. Overall digital sales represented 19% of consumer revenues for the quarter. 
Progress is being made with our non-publishing ventures. We expect the partnerships with [ Elizabeth Gabler's Group ] at [ Sony Pictures ] and [ Bell Media ] to provide a longer-term payoff. These partnerships underscore the value of our intellectual property and should allow us to capitalize on other revenue streams with very modest capital outlay. 
At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues were down 5% to $294 million, of which, foreign currency fluctuations had a negative impact of $8 million or 2%. 
On an adjusted basis, revenues declined 3%. REA Group revenues were down 8% or down 4% in local currency. The decline moderated from last quarter, but the benefit from higher yield and improved product mix in the Residential business were more than offset by a 12% year-over-year decline in the new listing volume during the quarter, although, the rate improved in each month during the quarter. Traffic, page views, app launches all trended higher, and we are seeing key indicators pointing to a gradual property market recovery. 
In the developer market, new project commencements fell 33% in the quarter and the associated revenues have remained challenged. 
Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call that just concluded for additional details and comments on the outlook. 
Move revenues declined 1% to $121 million, although importantly, real estate revenues grew 4%. Revenue trends slowed in the quarter, primarily due to the lapping of the Opcity acquisition in October 2018 and the subsequent transition of leads from the core lead model to the referral model, which has a timing impact as revenue is recognized when the transaction closes. 
The increase in real estate revenues, which represented 82% of total Move revenues was led by growth in audience and high-lead volume, together with an increased penetration of Local Experts, a local branded product. 
Results of Opcity remain encouraging as we saw improvement in the KPIs across the 17 markets we are testing, including and most importantly, close rates. We are very encouraged by the results and continue to anticipate improvements at Move in the second half. 
On [indiscernible] audience, average monthly unique users for the quarter at realtor.com were 59 million, rising 9% versus the prior year, and again, for very strong year-over-year growth in page views and time spent on the site. 
Segment EBITDA fell 2% or $118 million. However, on an adjusted basis, EBITDA rose 2%. Results reflect increased profit contribution at Move is benefiting from phasing of marketing, restructuring changes implemented late last year and the lapping of investment cost of Opcity, offset by lower REA revenues. 
I would now like to talk about some of the themes in the upcoming quarter. 
At News and Information Services, overall advertising trends thus far remain similar to the prior quarter levels, although, visibility remains limited. We expect to see improvements at Dow Jones from increased licensing revenues from previously announced content licensing agreements, notably from Facebook. 
As I noted, we have also seen a pickup in digital advertising at Dow Jones so far this quarter. Overall, we would expect to see improvements compared to the prior year among our news brands, although, News American marketing likely remains challenged. 
In Subscription Video Services, for the third quarter, we expect approximately $10 million of costs related to the accelerated amortization that we previously noted and modestly higher marketing costs in front of the [indiscernible] Winter Sports selling season. However, we expect full year costs to be relatively stable, with the prior year in local currency, given the lower total expenses this quarter, as I mentioned earlier. 
In Book Publishing, as Robert mentioned, we expect the timing and slate of new releases, combined with less-challenging prior year comparisons in the fourth quarter to lead to improvement in Book Publishing in the second half. 
And at Digital Real Estate Services, as noted in their release, REA anticipates more favorable lifting conditions in the second half of financial year '20 to deliver a stronger revenue outcome. Please see their release for more details. 
We also expect improvements in the second half with the ongoing progress at Opcity. 
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

Before we begin the formalities, I would like to express my sincere thanks to our readers, customers and employees in Australia, who combined to respond thoughtfully and meaningfully to the tragic bushfires, which have had profound consequences for many communities. 
In particular, our reporters and editors and photographers have done an extraordinary job in tracking the fires and highlighting the impact of the tragedy on towns and regions that will take much time to recover. 
We are pleased that the company and its founders have pledged more than AUD 11 million to the cause and our company has continuing fundraising campaigns that will contribute significantly more over the coming months. 
We also thank the many companies, which have partnered with News Corp to make a positive difference for Australian communities. 
Turning to our results. As we anticipated, the second quarter was somewhat soft for various businesses. However, we expect improvement in the second half as real estate markets in Australia shows signs of gradual recovery and we continued to progress with Opcity at move, which should benefit the performance of our digital real estate businesses. 
We also expect faster growth in digital revenues at Dow Jones from the previously announced content licensing arrangements, particularly with Facebook, and improvement in book publishing based on the timing of the release schedule. 
Meanwhile, we are on the cusp of the seasonal selling peak for Foxtel, given that the main Winter Sports are soon to launch and Kayo, our streaming service, has already started seeing upturn in new subscribers, even though, we are still in the midst of the low season for sales. 
We took an important step on our path towards simplification with the sale of Unruly, a notable development, which will yield financial benefits for us going forward. And I am pleased to say that following our strategic review of News America marketing, we are engaged in negotiations for a sale of that business. 
These ongoing simplification efforts showing a brighter light on the intrinsic and increasing value of our core assets, which have been patently unappreciated and underappreciated for too long. 
For the quarter, the company reported total revenues of approximately $2.5 billion, with total segment EBITDA of $355 million. This represents a decline of 6% in revenues and 4% in profitability versus the prior year. 
Foreign exchange fluctuations affected our results with a $50 million effect on revenues, or negative 2%. 
As I mentioned last quarter, we are now seeing the early benefits from our long battle for equitable treatment by the dominant tech platforms. In particular, our deals with Apple and Facebook are beginning to yield financial dividends and we welcome their respect for the premium journalism produced by the talented professionals in News Corp. 
There are also positive signs at Sundar Pichai. Google has a thoughtful appreciation for the profound social influence of high-quality journalism. 
In Digital Real Estate Services, listing volume in Australia remains challenged, but the trend improved somewhat in the quarter, particularly, in Melbourne and Sydney. REA group posted record traffic in October and buyer inquiries were up 37% in Q2 versus the prior year.
These signs point to a gradual recovery this year in the Australian housing market, which will, obviously, be efficacious for REA's revenues. 
At Move, operator of realtor.com, profit contribution showed a substantial improvement in the quarter. Real estate revenue grew 4% as we transitioned to the referral model, which had a natural impact on the timing of revenues. 
Key indicators for the property market are encouraging and we expect to see improvements at Move in the second half of the year, largely due to the progress at Opcity. 
We also envisage increasing monetization of relevant adjacencies as we further leverage our deep transaction data, which has made significantly more valuable by Opcity's ability to define and refine leads. 
Despite Q2 being a weaker quarter seasonally, we nonetheless saw traffic up 9% year-over-year and a more than 30% increase in page views based on internal metrics. Throughout most of calendar year 2019, realtor.com continued to gain audience share relative to Zillow and Trulia according to comScore. 
We welcome David Doctorow to move this week as the new CEO. David is savvy digital commerce leader, comes from eBay and had previously worked at Expedia. His technological vision and marketing prowess will serve realtor.com and News Corp well in the years ahead. 
Tracey Fellows, who ably served as acting new CEO, is now focusing on her role as President of Global Digital Real Estate and we'll be emphasizing the development of our burgeoning digital real estate assets. 
Speaking of new talent at News Corp, I'm also pleased to note the arrival of David Kline as News Corp's Chief Technology Officer. David was at Viacom for the past decade, and earlier, at Discovery Communications and is expert at driving innovations  and efficiency in global content businesses. David will ensure that our global shared services are robust at costs and manage institutely, security integrity is heightened and technological creativity is enhanced. 
The News and Information Services segment showed tangible improvement in the quarter. The segment EBITDA increasing 27% versus the prior year. Dow Jones had another strong quarter with 17% growth in digital-only subscribers, including 13% growth in Wall Street Journal digital subscriptions year-over-year.  The Journal's total subscriber base continues to set records, with almost 2.7 million subscribers as of the end of the second quarter. And more recently, Dow Jones consumer subscriptions achieved a new record, surpassing 3.5 million, with the Journal crossing the 2 million digital subscriptions mark. 
I would like to highlight the continuing success of risk and compliance, where revenues grew a healthy 21%. In fact, risk and compliance has now seen over 20% revenue growth for 12 straight quarters. 
We believe the intrinsic value of this business is rising validated by recent transactions in the sector, where acquisitions have commanded multiples of 20x to 25x EBITDA. 
Risk and compliance is not only a jewel in the crown at Dow Jones, but is on the way to becoming one of News Corp's most valuable assets. 
Our efforts to leverage the Wall Street Journal's content continued to yield benefits and are clearly seen in the success of The Journal, the podcast produced with Spotify. Since its September launch, there have been 20 million downloads. We still have work to do in protecting podcast, but the acquisition of Wireless in the U.K. has given us direct access to a professional pool of broadcast talent. 
And at the WSJ, we have just begun recognizing revenues from our Facebook content licensing agreement with that contribution meaningfully increasing in the second half of the fiscal year under the terms of our contract. 
Barron's subscribers hit a record at 615,000 in Q2, up 8% over the prior year and we launched a new show on the Fox Business Network during the quarter, Barron's roundtable, which already has a full roster of sponsors. 
In the U.K., where political stability and leadership have relievedly returned, News U.K. had a strong quarter, reflected in results from The Times, The Sunday Times and The Sun. We saw higher ad revenues at News UK in Q2, with digital growth outpacing print declines, led by meaningful improvement at The Sun, whose audience grew to approximately 134 million global average monthly unique users in Q2, an increase of 9% on Q1 according to Google Analytics. 
The Times and Sunday Times added digital readers and reached 320,000 subscriptions in Q2, up 19% year-over-year. Speaking of these publications, News UK last week announced the creation of Times Radio, a new digital station, which will bring together the expertise of the Times and The Sunday Times and Wireless. 
The Sun also moved to monetize its already substantial American audience by launching a U.S.-based website last month. Early signs strongly suggests that he's tapping into an underserved, growing and potentially lucrative audience. 
In Australia, where the economy has been a little listless and currency relatively weak, our mastheads expanded to more than 566,000 digital subscriptions as of the end of the quarter, 23% year-over-year growth. That figure is led by the continued digital transformation at the Australia, with 65% of total subscribers now digital-only. 
In the U.S., New York Post revenues rose with digital advertising, again, reaching over 70% of total advertising revenues and achieving more than 20% revenue growth. The post-digital network had an audience of 95.2 million unique visitors in December, up over 30% year-over-year. 
Also in the U.S., just last week, we launched news.com in beta, delivering a uniquely wide range of automated and curated journalism to readers on mobile and ZIP Code. News.com offers prominence for prominence and aims to bring as much data as possible to publishers, while subscription sites will not be punished in the ranking system. 
By combining sophisticated artificial intelligence with provisional editing, news.com exposes readers to a vast array of news and views, from left to right, from large publishers to small, national and regional and from every state in the country. 
In its first week of soft launch, news had 258,000 users according to Google Analytics. I recommend that you all download the News App. If you don't use, you simply don't know. 
Turning to Subscription Video Services. Foxtel subscribers increased by 3% to 2.95 million, benefiting from the launch of Kayo in November 2018. We are in the traditional low season for sports subscriptions, but Kayo had 372,000 subscribers and 350,000 solely paid subscribers as of the quarter's end, up from 42,000 at the same time last year. 
As of February 5, Kayo had over 370,000 paid subscribers, a positive trajectory as we head into the higher season for sports in Australia. Customer reviews are overwhelmingly positive and user interface and experience are world-class. In fact, they are peerless. 
Foxtel remains focused on the user experience and strengthening the core foundation of its business, including its powerful entertainment lineup, now featuring 6 new Fox-branded channels, more video-on-demand content, a refreshed movie offering and a partnership with Netflix, among various other streaming services. 
Foxtel also completed key content agreements with NBCU and Discovery in the quarter, providing more on-demand content so that it is the go-to provider of programming in Australia. 
Finally, at Foxtel, we are planning our entertainment OTT product, which is built off the Kayo system, and like Kayo, will help maximize the value of existing rights and reach binge-conscious consumers outside our traditional realm. 
In Book Publishing, we had tough comparisons with the prior year. Though hardcovers did see better growth sequentially in Digital through the continued expansion of audiobooks. 
David Walliams' latest children's book, The Beast of Buckingham Palace, did well in the U.K. We are confident that we should see improvement in the second half given the timing of the release schedule, the continued popularity of The Dutch House by Ann Patchett, and the recent successful release of Profiles in Corruption by Peter Schweizer.
We also look forward to the April release of Volume 2 of Joanna Gaines' highly popular Magnolia Table. We have also just released books by Jessica Simpson and Carrie Underwood. And in May, we expect to benefit from the release of the film, Women in the Window, based on the autonomous best seller by A.J. Finn. 
To summarize, the first half was, as expected, a tad sluggish, but we see progress across many of the segments in the second half. It is increasingly clear that News Corp is harvesting benefits from being a creator of content as markets, societies and the big tech platforms appreciate its commercial value. 
We are simplifying the structure of the company with a view to maximizing its value for investors. As a result, for example, the inherent value of our Digital Real Estate assets and Dow Jones will be more obvious to the benefit of all our shareholders. 
And now for more details on the second quarter of financial 2020, I turn to Susan Panuccio."

Fiscal 2020 second quarter total revenues were approximately $2.5 billion, down 6% versus the prior year, and total segment EBITDA was $355 million, down 4% versus the prior year. 
On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, currency fluctuations and the other items disclosed in our release, revenues fell 4% and total segment EBITDA decreased 3%, a notable improvement from the prior quarter's EBITDA performance. 
For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $0.14 as compared to $0.16 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.18 in the quarter, flat with the prior year. 
Turning now to the individual operation segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were over $1.2 billion, down 1% versus the prior year. On an adjusted basis, revenues were flat, reflecting a material improvement from the prior quarter. 
Advertising fell 5%, while circulation and subscriptions grew 3%, despite currency headwinds. Digital revenues for Dow Jones and the newspaper mastheads represented 39% of their combined revenues, up from 35% in the prior year. 
Segment EBITDA for the quarter was $142 million, up 27% from $112 million, benefiting from the growth at News U.K. and Dow Jones. There was a onetime benefit of approximately $22 million due to the settlement of certain warranty-related claims in the U.K. However, even absent that benefit, we saw growth in segment EBITDA. This was driven by the U.K., Dow Jones and the narrowing losses at the New York Post, partially offset by lower contributions from News Australia and News America marketing. 
Similar to the first quarter, we reclassified approximately $8 million of costs in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 than the other segment to the News and Information Services segment. These reallocated costs are related to various initiatives, including News IQ, our global programmatic effort and certain shared technology services that directly benefit the News and Information Services segment as part of our ongoing efforts to leverage our global scale to lower costs. 
Turning now to the segment highlights. At Dow Jones, consumer circulation revenues grew at a healthy 5%, reflecting 17% growth in digital paid subscribers across Dow Jones consumer products. This includes 13% growth in digital-only paid subscribers at the Wall Street Journal. In the aggregate, the Wall Street Journal subscriber base reached approximately 2.6 million. 
Professional Information business revenues accounted for 27% of Dow Jones' revenues this quarter, growing 8% to $115 million, maintaining momentum from the first quarter. As Robert mentioned, the key growth engine continues to be in risk and compliance, which grew a healthy 21% this quarter. This is a highly profitable and scalable business and is on track to approach $160 million of revenue this fiscal year. 
The NewsWire's product also showed growth benefiting from licensing deals with Bloomberg and Sussex, while Factiva was stable. 
Advertising at Dow Jones was weaker this quarter, falling about 5% compared to the prior year. Digital accounted for 43% of advertising revenues and digital advertising was lower in the second quarter, primarily due to tough comparatives from the prior year, which saw significant programmatic growth from MarketWatch. 
However, we have seen a strong start so far this quarter, although, visibility remains limited. While it is very early days, we are making progress on monetizing valuable third-party partnerships, which are a key strategic focus as we expand the reach of Dow Jones and the Wall Street Journal across digital platforms and markets. These include deals with Twitter for our WSJ Watch Now videos, our week-day podcast, the Journal with Spotify and our recent content partnerships with Apple and Facebook. 
Overall, Dow Jones posted 4% revenue growth and another quarter of increased segment EBITDA contribution. Elsewhere across our news portfolio, advertising conditions were mixed. News UK's advertising revenues rose 5% on both the reported and local currency basis, representing second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth on a local currency basis led by digital advertising growth at The Sun and moderating print declines. 
Advertising conditions in Australia remained challenging, but improved slightly from the prior quarter rate, with revenues down 11% on a reported basis and down 7% in local currency. 
For circulation revenues, the increase in cover prices and digital subscribers at, both News Australia and News UK, helped mitigate print volume declines and Australian currency headwinds. 
Finally, at News America marketing, revenues fell 4%, an improvement from quarter 1. 
Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $501 million, down 11% versus $562 million in the prior year, of which $25 million or 5% was due to the negative impact from foreign currency. On an adjusted basis, revenues declined 6%. 
Broadcast subscriber trends were relatively similar to the prior quarter, with the revenue decline driven by a lower broadcast subscriber base and changes to the broadcast subscriber package mix as well as modestly lower pay-per-view revenues. 
Revenue declines were partially offset by expanding OTT revenues. As a reminder, we lapped the price increase from last year, which also impacted the year-over-year comparison. 
Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $70 million, down 17% from the prior year, driven by the revenue decline, partially offset by lower total cost, including programming and transmission costs as the team at Foxtel continues to focus on streamlining business. 
Turning to the KPIs. Foxtel's closing trade subscriber base was approximately 3 million as of December 31, reflecting a 3% growth or 96,000 subscribers versus the prior year driven by the launch of Kayo in November 2018.
Total paying OTT subscribers reached 684,000, up 73% versus last year. We've seen over the past year that Kayo's paid customers will increase around key exclusive events. With the conclusion of Australia's popular Winter Sports and the Rugby World Cup, the number of paid subscribers in Kayo fell from the prior quarter. Notwithstanding, Kayo viewer engagement continues to be strong with subscribers watching an average of 5.3 weekly hours, with the average customer watching 7 of the 50 different sports available on Kayo each week. 
We've also been pleased with the increasing brand awareness, the stability of the platform, and more importantly, customer feedback in relation to the user experience. Kayo's solid subscriber base gives us optimism as it enters its second year ahead of the prime Winter Sports selling season. 
The team continues to work on a new OTT entertainment product built on the Kayo technology platform with the commercial launch anticipated in the fourth quarter. 
In the second quarter, broadcast churn was 16%, which is slightly higher than the 15.6% in the prior year. Foxtel direct-channel churn of 14% was 2.5 points lower than the prior year, which was the lowest second quarter rate in 4 years. Like last quarter, the main driver behind the higher churn is coming from lower ARPU Telstra wholesale customers on expiring contracts from the past 12 to 24 months. 
Broadcast ARPU declined about 1% to over AUD 77 per month. In November, we completed the refinancing of a significant portion of Foxtel debt, which extended maturities for at least 3 years. More details will be available in the 10-Q filings. 
At Book Publishing, HarperCollins' revenues for the quarter fell 11% to $442 million and segment EBITDA fell 28% to $63 million. As we have previously indicated, the revenue decline this quarter was primarily due to a tough comparison with the prior year, which included Homebody by Joanna Gaines, Girl, Wash Your Face by Rachel Hollis, The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas and higher backwards sales from The Subtle Art by Mark Manson. 
The declines were partially offset by new releases, which include The Pioneer Woman Cooks, The New Frontier by Ree Drummond and The Beast of Buckingham Palace by David Walliams. 
We saw a 5% improvement in digital sales compared to the prior year, primarily due to the 17% growth in downloadable audio books. Overall digital sales represented 19% of consumer revenues for the quarter. 
Progress is being made with our non-publishing ventures. We expect the partnerships with Elizabeth Gabler's group at Sony Pictures and Bell Media provide a longer-term payoff. These partnerships underscore the value of our intellectual property and should allow us to capitalize on other revenue streams with very modest capital outlay. 
At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues were down 5% to $294 million, of which, foreign currency fluctuations had a negative impact of $8 million or 2%. 
On an adjusted basis, revenues declined 3%. REA Group revenues were down 8% or down 4% in local currency. The decline moderated from last quarter, but the benefit from higher yield and improved product mix in the Residential business were more than offset by a 12% year-over-year decline in the new listing volume during the quarter, although, the rate improved in each month during the quarter. Traffic, page views, app launches all trended higher, and we are seeing key indicators pointing to a gradual property market recovery. 
In the developer market, new project commencements fell 33% in the quarter and the associated revenues have remained challenged. 
Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call that just concluded for additional details and comments on their outlook. 
Move revenues declined 1% to $121 million, although importantly, real estate revenues grew 4%. Revenue trends slowed in the quarter, primarily due to the lapping of the Opcity acquisition in October 2018 and the subsequent transition of leads from the core lead model to the referral model, which has a tiny impact as revenues recognized when the transaction closes. 
The increase in real estate revenues, which represented 82% of total Move revenues was led by growth in audience and high-lead volume, together with an increased penetration of Local Experts, a local branded product. 
Results at Opcity remain encouraging as we saw improvement in the KPIs across the 17 markets we are testing, including and most importantly, close rates. We are very encouraged by the results and continue to anticipate improvements at Move in the second half. 
On 
[Audio Gap] 
audience, average monthly unique users for the quarter at realtor.com were 59 million, rising 9% versus the prior year, and again, for very strong year-over-year growth in page views and time spent on the site. 
Segment EBITDA fell 2% or $118 million. However, on an adjusted basis, EBITDA rose 2%. Results reflect increased profit contribution at Move is benefiting from phasing of marketing, restructuring changes implemented late last year and the lapping of investment costs at Opcity, offset by lower REA revenues. 
I would now like to talk about some of the themes in the upcoming quarter. 
At News and Information Services, overall advertising trends thus far remain similar to the prior quarter levels, although, visibility remains limited. We expect to see improvements at Dow Jones from increased licensing revenues from previously announced content licensing agreements, notably from Facebook.
As I noted, we have also seen a pickup in digital advertising at Dow Jones so far this quarter. Overall, we would expect to see improvements compared to the prior year among our news brands, although, News American marketing likely remains challenged. 
In Subscription Video Services, for the third quarter, we expect approximately $10 million of costs related to the accelerated amortization that we previously noted and modestly higher marketing costs in front of the change Winter Sports selling season. However, we expect full year costs to be relatively stable with the prior year in local currency given the lower total expenses this quarter, as I mentioned earlier. 
In Book Publishing, as Robert mentioned, we expect the timing and slate of new releases, combined with less-challenging prior year comparisons in the fourth quarter to lead to improvement in Book Publishing in the second half. 
And at Digital Real Estate Services, as noted in their release, REA anticipates more favorable lifting conditions in the second half of financial year '20 to deliver a stronger revenue outcome. Please see their release for more details. 
We also expect improvements in the second half with the ongoing progress at Opcity. 
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

We're engaged in active negotiations for the sale of the company and I'm happy to report that those discussions are well advanced.

As for HBO-related questions, you really should pose those to HBO. What I would say is that we have an unparalleled collection of programming at Foxtel, where unlike U.S. cable companies in the outsweep ranges across a real range of providers.

Before we begin the formalities, I would like to express my sincere thanks to our readers, customers and employees in Australia, who've combined to respond thoughtfully and meaningfully to the tragic bushfires, which have had profound consequences for many communities. In particular, our reporters and editors and photographers have done an extraordinary job in tracking the fires and highlighting the impact of the tragedy on towns and regions that will take much time to recover. 
We are pleased that the company and its founders have pledged more than AUD 11 million to the cause, and our company has continuing fundraising campaigns that will contribute significantly more over the coming months. We also thank the many companies which have partnered with News Corp to make a positive difference for Australian communities. 
Turning to our results. As we anticipated, the second quarter was somewhat soft for various businesses. However, we expect improvement in the second half as real estate markets in Australia show signs of gradual recovery, and we continued to progress with Opcity at Move, which should benefit the performance of our Digital Real Estate businesses. We also expect faster growth in digital revenues at Dow Jones from the previously announced content licensing arrangements, particularly with Facebook, and improvement in Book Publishing based on the timing of the release schedule. 
Meanwhile, we are on the cusp of the seasonal selling peak for Foxtel, given that the main Winter Sports are soon to launch, and Kayo, our streaming service, has already started seeing upturn in new subscribers even though we are still in the midst of the low season for sales. 
We took an important step on our path towards simplification with the sale of Unruly, a notable development which will yield financial benefits for us going forward. And I am pleased to say that following our strategic review of News America Marketing, we are engaged in negotiations for a sale of that business. These ongoing simplification efforts shine a brighter light on the intrinsic and increasing value of our core assets, which have been patently unappreciated and underappreciated for too long. 
For the quarter, the company reported total revenues of approximately $2.5 billion with total segment EBITDA of $355 million. This represents a decline of 6% in revenues and 4% in profitability versus the prior year. Foreign exchange fluctuations affected our results with a $50 million effect on revenues or negative 2%. 
As I mentioned last quarter, we are now seeing the early benefits from our long battle for equitable treatment by the dominant tech platforms. In particular, our deals with Apple and Facebook are beginning to yield financial dividends, and we welcome their respect for the premium journalism produced by the talented professionals in News Corp. There are also positive signs that Sundar Pichai at Google has a thoughtful appreciation for the profound social influence of high-quality journalism. 
In Digital Real Estate Services, listing volume in Australia remains challenged, but the trend improved somewhat in the quarter, particularly in Melbourne and Sydney. REA Group posted record traffic in October, and buyer inquiries were up 37% in Q2 versus the prior year. These signs point to a gradual recovery this year in the Australian housing market, which will obviously be efficacious for REA's revenues. 
At Move, operator of realtor.com, profit contribution showed a substantial improvement in the quarter. Real estate revenue grew 4% as we transition to the referral model, which had a natural impact on the timing of revenues. Key indicators for the property market are encouraging, and we expect to see improvements at Move in the second half of the year, largely due to the progress at Opcity. We also envisage increasing monetization of relevant adjacencies as we further leverage our deep transaction data, which is made significantly more valuable by Opcity's ability to define and refine leads. 
Despite Q2 being a weaker quarter seasonally, we nonetheless saw traffic up 9% year-over-year and a more than 30% increase in page views based on internal metrics. Throughout most of calendar year 2019, realtor.com continued to gain audience share relative to Zillow and Trulia, according to comScore. 
We welcomed David Doctorow to Move this week as the new CEO. David, a savvy digital commerce leader, comes from eBay and had previously worked at Expedia. His technological vision and marketing prowess will serve realtor.com and News Corp well in the years ahead. Tracey Fellows, who ably served as acting Move CEO, is now focusing on her role as President of Global Digital Real Estate and will be emphasizing the development of our burgeoning digital real estate assets. 
Speaking of new talent at News Corp, I'm also pleased to note the arrival of David Kline as News Corp's Chief Technology Officer. David was at Viacom for the past decade and earlier at Discovery Communications and is expert at driving innovations and efficiency in global content businesses. David will ensure that our global shared services are robust, that costs are managed astutely, security integrity is heightened and technological creativity is enhanced. 
The News and Information Services segment showed tangible improvement in the quarter. The segment EBITDA increasing 27% versus the prior year. Dow Jones had another strong quarter with 17% growth in digital-only subscribers, including 13% growth in Wall Street Journal digital subscriptions year-over-year. The Journal's total subscriber base continues to set records with almost 2.7 million subscribers as of the end of the second quarter. And more recently, Dow Jones consumer subscriptions achieved a new record, surpassing 3.5 million, with the Journal crossing the 2 million digital subscriptions mark. 
I would like to highlight the continuing success of Risk and Compliance, where revenues grew a healthy 21%. In fact, Risk and Compliance has now seen over 20% revenue growth for 12 straight quarters. We believe the intrinsic value of this business is rising, validated by recent transactions in the sector where acquisitions have commanded multiples of 20 to 25x EBITDA. Risk and Compliance is not only a jewel in the crown at Dow Jones, but is on the way to becoming one of News Corp's most valuable assets. 
Our efforts to leverage The Wall Street Journal's content continue to yield benefits and are clearly seen in the success of The Journal, the podcast produced with Spotify. Since its September launch, there have been 20 million downloads. We still have work to do in perfecting podcast, but the acquisition of Wireless in the U.K. has given us direct access to a professional pool of broadcast talent. 
And at the WSJ, we have just begun recognizing revenues from our Facebook content licensing agreement, with that contribution meaningfully increasing in the second half of the fiscal year under the terms of our contract. Barron's subscribers hit a record at 615,000 in Q2, up 8% over the prior year. And we launched a new show on the Fox Business Network during the quarter, Barron's Roundtable, which already has a full roster of sponsors. 
In the U.K., where political stability and leadership have relievedly returned, News UK had a strong quarter, reflected in results from The Times, The Sunday Times and The Sun. We saw higher ad revenues at News UK in Q2 with digital growth outpacing print declines, led by meaningful improvement at The Sun, whose audience grew to approximately 134 million global average monthly unique users in Q2, an increase of 9% on Q1 according to Google Analytics. 
The Times and Sunday Times added digital readers and reached 320,000 subscriptions in Q2, up 19% year-over-year. Speaking of these publications, News UK last week announced the creation of Times Radio, a new digital station, which will bring together the expertise of The Times and The Sunday Times and Wireless. The Sun also moved to monetize its already substantial American audience by launching a U.S.-based website last month. Early signs strongly suggest that it's tapping into an underserved, growing and potentially lucrative audience. 
In Australia, where the economy has been a little listless and currency relatively weak, our mastheads expanded to more than 566,000 digital subscriptions as of the end of the quarter, 23% year-over-year growth. That figure is led by the continued digital transformation at The Australian with 65% of total subscribers now digital-only. 
In the U.S., New York Post revenues rose with digital advertising, again, reaching over 70% of total advertising revenues and achieving more than 20% revenue growth. The Post Digital Network had an audience of 95.2 million unique visitors in December, up over 30% year-over-year. 
Also in the U.S., just last week, we launched Knewz.com in beta, delivering a uniquely wide range of automated and curated journalism to readers on mobile and desktop. Knewz.com offers prominence for providence and aims to bring as much data as possible to publishers, while subscription sites will not be punished in the ranking system.
By combining sophisticated artificial intelligence with its professional editing, Knewz.com exposes readers to a vast array of news and views, from left to right, from large publishers to small, national and regional and from every state in the country. In its first week of soft launch, Knewz had 258,000 users according to Google Analytics. I recommend that you all download the Knewz app. If you don't Knewz, you simply don't know. 
Turning to Subscription Video Services. Foxtel subscribers increased by 3% to 2.95 million, benefiting from the launch of Kayo in November 2018. We are in the traditional low season for sports subscriptions, but Kayo had 372,000 subscribers and 350,000 fully paid subscribers as of the quarter's end, up from 42,000 at the same time last year. As of February 5, Kayo had over 370,000 paid subscribers, a positive trajectory as we head into the higher season for sports in Australia. Customer reviews are overwhelmingly positive, and user interface and experience are world-class, in fact, they are peerless. 
Foxtel remains focused on the user experience and strengthening the core foundation of its business, including its powerful entertainment lineup, now featuring 6 new Fox-branded channels, more video-on-demand content, a refreshed movie offering and a partnership with Netflix, among various other streaming services. Foxtel also completed key content agreements with NBCU and Discovery in the quarter, providing more on-demand content so that it is the go-to provider of programming in Australia. Finally, at Foxtel, we are planning our entertainment OTT product, which is built off the Kayo system and, like Kayo, will help maximize the value of existing rights and reach binge-conscious consumers outside our traditional realm. 
In Book Publishing, we had tough comparisons with the prior year, though HarperCollins did see better growth sequentially in digital through the continued expansion of audiobooks. David Walliams' latest children's book, The Beast of Buckingham Palace, did well in the U.K. We are confident that we should see improvement in the second half given the timing of the release schedule, the continued popularity of The Dutch House by Ann Patchett and the recent successful release of Profiles in Corruption by Peter Schweizer.
We also look forward to the April release of Volume 2 of Joanna Gaines' highly popular Magnolia Table. We have also just released books by Jessica Simpson and Carrie Underwood. And in May, we expect to benefit from the release of the film, Woman in the Window, based on the autonomous best seller by A.J. Finn. 
To summarize, the first half was, as expected, a tad sluggish, but we see progress across many of the segments in the second half. It is increasingly clear that News Corp is harvesting benefits from being a creator of content as markets, societies and the big tech platforms appreciate its commercial value. We are simplifying the structure of the company with a view to maximizing its value for investors. As a result, for example, the inherent value of our Digital Real Estate assets and Dow Jones will be more obvious to the benefit of all our shareholders. 
And now for more details on the second quarter of financial 2020, I turn to Susan Panuccio."

Turning to the financials. Fiscal 2020 second quarter total revenues were approximately $2.5 billion, down 6% versus the prior year. And total segment EBITDA was $355 million, down 4% versus the prior year. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, currency fluctuations and the other items disclosed in our release, revenues fell 4% and total segment EBITDA decreased 3%, a notable improvement from the prior quarter's EBITDA performance. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $0.14 as compared to $0.16 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.18 in the quarter, flat with the prior year. 
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were over $1.2 billion, down 1% versus the prior year. On an adjusted basis, revenues were flat, reflecting a material improvement from the prior quarter. Advertising fell 5%, while circulation and subscriptions grew 3% despite currency headwinds.
Digital revenues for Dow Jones and the newspaper mastheads represented 39% of their combined revenues, up from 35% in the prior year. Segment EBITDA for the quarter was $142 million, up 27% from $112 million, benefiting from the growth at News UK and Dow Jones. There was a onetime benefit of approximately $22 million due to the settlement of certain warranty-related claims in the U.K. However, even absent that benefit, we saw growth in segment EBITDA. This was driven by the U.K., Dow Jones and the narrowing losses at the New York Post, partially offset by lower contributions from News Australia and News America marketing. 
Similar to the first quarter, we reclassified approximately $8 million of costs in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 from the other segment to the News and Information Services segment. These reallocated costs are related to various initiatives, including News IQ, our global programmatic effort, and certain shared technology services that directly benefit the News and Information Services segment as part of our ongoing efforts to leverage our global scale to lower costs. 
Turning now to the segment highlights. At Dow Jones, consumer circulation revenues grew at a healthy 5%, reflecting 17% growth in digital paid subscribers across Dow Jones consumer products. This includes 13% growth in digital-only paid subscribers at The Wall Street Journal. In the aggregate, The Wall Street Journal subscriber base reached approximately 2.6 million. 
Professional Information Business revenues accounted for 27% of Dow Jones revenues this quarter, growing 8% to $115 million, maintaining momentum from the first quarter. As Robert mentioned, the key growth engine continues to be in Risk and Compliance, which grew a healthy 21% this quarter. This is a highly profitable and scalable business and is on track to approach $160 million of revenues this fiscal year. The Newswires product also showed growth benefiting from licensing deals with Bloomberg and FactSet, while Factiva was stable. 
Advertising at Dow Jones was weaker this quarter, falling about 5% compared to the prior year. Digital accounted for 43% of advertising revenues. Digital advertising was lower in the second quarter, primarily due to tough comparatives from the prior year, which saw significant programmatic growth from MarketWatch. However, we have seen a strong start so far this quarter, although visibility remains limited.
While it is very early days, we are making progress on monetizing valuable third-party partnerships, which is our key strategic focus as we expand the reach of Dow Jones and The Wall Street Journal across digital platforms and markets. These include deals with Twitter for our WSJ Watch Now videos, our weekday podcast, The Journal with Spotify and our recent content partnerships with Apple and Facebook. Overall, Dow Jones posted 4% revenue growth and another quarter of increased segment EBITDA contribution. 
Elsewhere across our news portfolio, advertising conditions were mixed. News UK's advertising revenues rose 5% on both a reported and local currency basis, representing second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth on a local currency basis, led by digital advertising growth at The Sun and moderating print declines. Advertising conditions in Australia remained challenging, but improved slightly from the prior quarter rate with revenues down 11% on a reported basis and down 7% in local currency.
For circulation revenues, the increase in cover prices and digital subscribers at both News Australia and News UK helped mitigate print volume declines and Australian currency headwinds. Finally, at News America Marketing, revenues fell 4%, an improvement from quarter 1. 
Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $501 million, down 11% versus $562 million in the prior year, of which $25 million or 5% was due to the negative impact from foreign currency. On an adjusted basis, revenues declined 6%. 
Broadcast subscriber trends were relatively similar to the prior quarter, with the revenue decline driven by a lower broadcast subscriber base and changes to the broadcast subscriber package mix as well as modestly lower pay-per-view revenues. Revenue declines were partially offset by expanding OTT revenues. As a reminder, we lapped the price increase from last year, which also impacted the year-over-year comparison. 
Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $70 million, down 17% from the prior year, driven by the revenue decline, partially offset by lower total cost, including programming and transmission costs, as the team at Foxtel continues to focus on streamlining business. 
Turning to the KPIs. Foxtel's closing paid subscriber base was approximately 3 million as of December 31, reflecting a 3% growth or 96,000 subscribers versus the prior year, driven by the launch of Kayo in November 2018. Total paying OTT subscribers reached 684,000, up 73% versus last year. We have seen over the past year that Kayo's paid customers will increase around key exclusive events. With the conclusion of Australia's popular Winter Sports and the Rugby World Cup, the number of paid subscribers in Kayo fell from the prior quarter. Notwithstanding, Kayo viewer engagement continues to be strong with subscribers watching an average of 5.3 weekly hours, with the average customer watching 7 of the 50 different sports available on Kayo each week. 
We have also been pleased with the increasing brand awareness, the stability of the platform and, more importantly, customer feedback in relation to the user experience. Kayo's solid subscriber base gives us optimism as it enters its second year ahead of the prime Winter Sports selling season.The team continues to work on a new OTT entertainment product built on the Kayo technology platform with the commercial launch anticipated in the fourth quarter. 
In the second quarter, broadcast churn was 16%, which is slightly higher than the 15.6% in the prior year. Foxtel direct channel churn of 14% was 2.5 points lower than the prior year, which was the lowest second quarter rate in 4 years. Like last quarter, the main driver behind the higher churn is coming from the lower ARPU Telstra wholesale customers on expiring contracts from the past 12 to 24 months. Broadcast ARPU declined about 1% to over AUD 77 per month. In November, we completed the refinancing of a significant portion of Foxtel debt, which extended maturities for at least 3 years. More details will be available in the 10-Q filing. 
At Book Publishing, HarperCollins revenues for the quarter fell 11% to $442 million, and segment EBITDA fell 28% to $63 million. As we have previously indicated, the revenue decline this quarter was primarily due to a tough comparison with the prior year, which included Homebody by Joanna Gaines; Girl, Wash Your Face by Rachel Hollis; The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas; and higher backwards sales from The Subtle Art by Mark Manson. The declines were partially offset by new releases, which include The Pioneer Woman Cooks: The New Frontier by Ree Drummond and The Beast of Buckingham Palace by David Walliams. 
We saw a 5% improvement in digital sales compared to the prior year, primarily due to the 17% growth in downloadable audio books. Overall digital sales represented 19% of consumer revenues for the quarter. Progress is being made with our non-publishing ventures. We expect the partnerships with Elizabeth Gabler's group at Sony Pictures and Bell Media to provide a longer-term payoff. These partnerships underscore the value of our intellectual property and should allow us to capitalize on other revenue streams with very modest capital outlay. 
At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues were down 5% to $294 million, of which foreign currency fluctuations had a negative impact of $8 million or 2%. On an adjusted basis, revenues declined 3%. REA Group revenues were down 8% or down 4% in local currency. The decline moderated from last quarter, but the benefit from higher yield and improved product mix in the residential business were more than offset by a 12% year-over-year decline in the new listing volume during the quarter, although the rate improved in each month during the quarter. Traffic, page views, app launches all trended higher, and we are seeing key indicators pointing to a gradual property market recovery. 
In the developer market, new project commencements fell 33% in the quarter, and the associated revenues have remained challenged. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call that just concluded for additional details and comments on their outlook. 
Move revenues declined 1% to $121 million, although importantly, real estate revenues grew 4%. Revenue trends slowed in the quarter, primarily due to the lapping of the Opcity acquisition in October 2018 and the subsequent transition of leads from the core lead model to the referral model, which has a tiny impact as revenue is recognized when a transaction closes. 
The increase in real estate revenues, which represented 82% of total Move revenues, was led by growth in audience and high-lead volume, together with an increased penetration of Local Experts, a local branded product. Results at Opcity remain encouraging as we saw improvement in the KPIs across the 17 markets we are testing, including and most importantly, close rates. We are very encouraged by the results and continue to anticipate improvements at Move in the second half. 
On audience, average monthly unique users for the quarter at realtor.com were 59 million, rising 9% versus the prior year and a gain from very strong year-over-year growth in page views and time spent on the site. Segment EBITDA fell 2% to $118 million. However, on an adjusted basis, EBITDA rose 2%. Results reflect increased profit contribution at Move benefiting from phasing of marketing, restructuring changes implemented late last year and the lapping of investment cost at Opcity, offset by lower REA revenues. 
I would now like to talk about some of the themes in the upcoming quarter. At News and Information Services, overall advertising trends thus far remain similar to the prior quarter levels, although visibility remains limited. We expect to see improvements at Dow Jones from increased licensing revenues from previously announced content licensing agreements, notably from Facebook. As I noted, we have also seen a pickup in digital advertising at Dow Jones so far this quarter. Overall, we would expect to see improvements compared to the prior year among our news brands, although News America Marketing likely remains challenged. 
In Subscription Video Services, for the third quarter, we expect approximately USD 10 million of costs related to the accelerated amortization that we previously noted and modestly higher marketing costs in front of the key Winter Sports selling season. However, we expect full year costs to be relatively stable with the prior year in local currency given the lower total expenses this quarter, as I mentioned earlier. 
In Book Publishing, as Robert mentioned, we expect the timing and slate of new releases, combined with less challenging prior year comparisons in the fourth quarter, to lead to improvement in Book Publishing in the second half. And at Digital Real Estate Services, as noted in their release, REA anticipates more favorable listing conditions in the second half of financial year '20 to deliver a stronger revenue outcome. Please see their release for more details. We also expect improvements in the second half with the ongoing progress at Opcity. 
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

I won't comment on the use of the funds. 
As for HBO-related questions, you really should pose those to HBO. What I would say is that we have an unparalleled collection of programming at Foxtel, where unlike U.S. cable companies in that our suite ranges across a real range of providers.

But the Winter Sports in Australia are about congregation and audience aggregation, and we're on the cusp of that selling season. 
Look, there's no doubt that Kayo is an absolutely world-class OTT offering. Also, no doubt that it has a hell of a runway.

Before we begin the formalities, I would like to express my sincere thanks to our readers, customers and employees in Australia, who've combined to respond thoughtfully and meaningfully to the tragic bushfires, which have had profound consequences for many communities. In particular, our reporters and editors and photographers have done an extraordinary job in tracking the fires and highlighting the impact of the tragedy on towns and regions that will take much time to recover. 
We are pleased that the company and its founders have pledged more than AUD 11 million to the cause, and our company has continuing fundraising campaigns that will contribute significantly more over the coming months. We also thank the many companies which have partnered with News Corp to make a positive difference for Australian communities. 
Turning to our results. As we anticipated, the second quarter was somewhat soft for various businesses. However, we expect improvement in the second half as real estate markets in Australia show signs of gradual recovery, and we continued to progress with Opcity at Move, which should benefit the performance of our Digital Real Estate businesses. We also expect faster growth in digital revenues at Dow Jones from the previously announced content licensing arrangements, particularly with Facebook, and improvement in Book Publishing based on the timing of the release schedule. 
Meanwhile, we are on the cusp of the seasonal selling peak for Foxtel, given that the main Winter Sports are soon to launch, and Kayo, our streaming service, has already started seeing upturn in new subscribers even though we are still in the midst of the low season for sales. 
We took an important step on our path towards simplification with the sale of Unruly, a notable development which will yield financial benefits for us going forward. And I am pleased to say that following our strategic review of News America Marketing, we are engaged in negotiations for a sale of that business. These ongoing simplification efforts shine a brighter light on the intrinsic and increasing value of our core assets, which have been patently unappreciated and underappreciated for too long. 
For the quarter, the company reported total revenues of approximately $2.5 billion with total segment EBITDA of $355 million. This represents a decline of 6% in revenues and 4% in profitability versus the prior year. Foreign exchange fluctuations affected our results with a $50 million effect on revenues or negative 2%. 
As I mentioned last quarter, we are now seeing the early benefits from our long battle for equitable treatment by the dominant tech platforms. In particular, our deals with Apple and Facebook are beginning to yield financial dividends, and we welcome their respect for the premium journalism produced by the talented professionals in News Corp. There are also positive signs that Sundar Pichai at Google has a thoughtful appreciation for the profound social influence of high-quality journalism. 
In Digital Real Estate Services, listing volume in Australia remains challenged, but the trend improved somewhat in the quarter, particularly in Melbourne and Sydney. REA Group posted record traffic in October, and buyer inquiries were up 37% in Q2 versus the prior year. These signs point to a gradual recovery this year in the Australian housing market, which will obviously be efficacious for REA's revenues. 
At Move, operator of realtor.com, profit contribution showed a substantial improvement in the quarter. Real estate revenue grew 4% as we transition to the referral model, which had a natural impact on the timing of revenues. Key indicators for the property market are encouraging, and we expect to see improvements at Move in the second half of the year, largely due to the progress at Opcity. We also envisage increasing monetization of relevant adjacencies as we further leverage our deep transaction data, which is made significantly more valuable by Opcity's ability to define and refine leads. 
Despite Q2 being a weaker quarter seasonally, we nonetheless saw traffic up 9% year-over-year and a more than 30% increase in page views based on internal metrics. Throughout most of calendar year 2019, realtor.com continued to gain audience share relative to Zillow and Trulia, according to comScore. 
We welcomed David Doctorow to Move this week as the new CEO. David, a savvy digital commerce leader, comes from eBay and had previously worked at Expedia. His technological vision and marketing prowess will serve realtor.com and News Corp well in the years ahead. Tracey Fellows, who ably served as acting Move CEO, is now focusing on her role as President of Global Digital Real Estate and will be emphasizing the development of our burgeoning digital real estate assets. 
Speaking of new talent at News Corp, I'm also pleased to note the arrival of David Kline as News Corp's Chief Technology Officer. David was at Viacom for the past decade and earlier at Discovery Communications and is expert at driving innovations and efficiency in global content businesses. David will ensure that our global shared services are robust, that costs are managed astutely, security integrity is heightened and technological creativity is enhanced. 
The News and Information Services segment showed tangible improvement in the quarter. The segment EBITDA increasing 27% versus the prior year. Dow Jones had another strong quarter with 17% growth in digital-only subscribers, including 13% growth in Wall Street Journal digital subscriptions year-over-year. The Journal's total subscriber base continues to set records with almost 2.7 million subscribers as of the end of the second quarter. And more recently, Dow Jones consumer subscriptions achieved a new record, surpassing 3.5 million, with the Journal crossing the 2 million digital subscriptions mark. 
I would like to highlight the continuing success of Risk and Compliance, where revenues grew a healthy 21%. In fact, Risk and Compliance has now seen over 20% revenue growth for 12 straight quarters. We believe the intrinsic value of this business is rising, validated by recent transactions in the sector where acquisitions have commanded multiples of 20 to 25x EBITDA. Risk and Compliance is not only a jewel in the crown at Dow Jones, but is on the way to becoming one of News Corp's most valuable assets. 
Our efforts to leverage The Wall Street Journal's content continue to yield benefits and are clearly seen in the success of The Journal, the podcast produced with Spotify. Since its September launch, there have been 20 million downloads. We still have work to do in perfecting podcast, but the acquisition of Wireless in the U.K. has given us direct access to a professional pool of broadcast talent. 
And at the WSJ, we have just begun recognizing revenues from our Facebook content licensing agreement, with that contribution meaningfully increasing in the second half of the fiscal year under the terms of our contract. Barron's subscribers hit a record at 615,000 in Q2, up 8% over the prior year. And we launched a new show on the Fox Business Network during the quarter, Barron's Roundtable, which already has a full roster of sponsors. 
In the U.K., where political stability and leadership have relievedly returned, News UK had a strong quarter, reflected in results from The Times, The Sunday Times and The Sun. We saw higher ad revenues at News UK in Q2 with digital growth outpacing print declines, led by meaningful improvement at The Sun, whose audience grew to approximately 134 million global average monthly unique users in Q2, an increase of 9% on Q1 according to Google Analytics. 
The Times and Sunday Times added digital readers and reached 320,000 subscriptions in Q2, up 19% year-over-year. Speaking of these publications, News UK last week announced the creation of Times Radio, a new digital station, which will bring together the expertise of The Times and The Sunday Times and Wireless. The Sun also moved to monetize its already substantial American audience by launching a U.S.-based website last month. Early signs strongly suggest that it's tapping into an underserved, growing and potentially lucrative audience. 
In Australia, where the economy has been a little listless and currency relatively weak, our mastheads expanded to more than 566,000 digital subscriptions as of the end of the quarter, 23% year-over-year growth. That figure is led by the continued digital transformation at The Australian with 65% of total subscribers now digital-only. 
In the U.S., New York Post revenues rose with digital advertising, again, reaching over 70% of total advertising revenues and achieving more than 20% revenue growth. The Post Digital Network had an audience of 95.2 million unique visitors in December, up over 30% year-over-year. 
Also in the U.S., just last week, we launched Knewz.com in beta, delivering a uniquely wide range of automated and curated journalism to readers on mobile and desktop. Knewz.com offers prominence for providence and aims to bring as much data as possible to publishers, while subscription sites will not be punished in the ranking system.
By combining sophisticated artificial intelligence with its professional editing, Knewz.com exposes readers to a vast array of news and views, from left to right, from large publishers to small, national and regional and from every state in the country. In its first week of soft launch, Knewz had 258,000 users according to Google Analytics. I recommend that you all download the Knewz app. If you don't Knewz, you simply don't know. 
Turning to Subscription Video Services. Foxtel subscribers increased by 3% to 2.95 million, benefiting from the launch of Kayo in November 2018. We are in the traditional low season for sports subscriptions, but Kayo had 372,000 subscribers and 350,000 fully paid subscribers as of the quarter's end, up from 42,000 at the same time last year. As of February 5, Kayo had over 370,000 paid subscribers, a positive trajectory as we head into the higher season for sports in Australia. Customer reviews are overwhelmingly positive, and user interface and experience are world-class, in fact, they are peerless. 
Foxtel remains focused on the user experience and strengthening the core foundation of its business, including its powerful entertainment lineup, now featuring 6 new Fox-branded channels, more video-on-demand content, a refreshed movie offering and a partnership with Netflix, among various other streaming services. Foxtel also completed key content agreements with NBCU and Discovery in the quarter, providing more on-demand content so that it is the go-to provider of programming in Australia. Finally, at Foxtel, we are planning our entertainment OTT product, which is built off the Kayo system and, like Kayo, will help maximize the value of existing rights and reach binge-conscious consumers outside our traditional realm. 
In Book Publishing, we had tough comparisons with the prior year, though HarperCollins did see better growth sequentially in digital through the continued expansion of audiobooks. David Walliams' latest children's book, The Beast of Buckingham Palace, did well in the U.K. We are confident that we should see improvement in the second half given the timing of the release schedule, the continued popularity of The Dutch House by Ann Patchett and the recent successful release of Profiles in Corruption by Peter Schweizer.
We also look forward to the April release of Volume 2 of Joanna Gaines' highly popular Magnolia Table. We have also just released books by Jessica Simpson and Carrie Underwood. And in May, we expect to benefit from the release of the film, Woman in the Window, based on the autonomous best seller by A.J. Finn. 
To summarize, the first half was, as expected, a tad sluggish, but we see progress across many of the segments in the second half. It is increasingly clear that News Corp is harvesting benefits from being a creator of content as markets, societies and the big tech platforms appreciate its commercial value. We are simplifying the structure of the company with a view to maximizing its value for investors. As a result, for example, the inherent value of our Digital Real Estate assets and Dow Jones will be more obvious to the benefit of all our shareholders. 
And now for more details on the second quarter of financial 2020, I turn to Susan Panuccio."

Turning to the financials. Fiscal 2020 second quarter total revenues were approximately $2.5 billion, down 6% versus the prior year. And total segment EBITDA was $355 million, down 4% versus the prior year. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, currency fluctuations and the other items disclosed in our release, revenues fell 4% and total segment EBITDA decreased 3%, a notable improvement from the prior quarter's EBITDA performance. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $0.14 as compared to $0.16 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.18 in the quarter, flat with the prior year. 
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were over $1.2 billion, down 1% versus the prior year. On an adjusted basis, revenues were flat, reflecting a material improvement from the prior quarter. Advertising fell 5%, while circulation and subscriptions grew 3% despite currency headwinds.
Digital revenues for Dow Jones and the newspaper mastheads represented 39% of their combined revenues, up from 35% in the prior year. Segment EBITDA for the quarter was $142 million, up 27% from $112 million, benefiting from the growth at News UK and Dow Jones. There was a onetime benefit of approximately $22 million due to the settlement of certain warranty-related claims in the U.K. However, even absent that benefit, we saw growth in segment EBITDA. This was driven by the U.K., Dow Jones and the narrowing losses at the New York Post, partially offset by lower contributions from News Australia and News America marketing. 
Similar to the first quarter, we reclassified approximately $8 million of costs in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 from the other segment to the News and Information Services segment. These reallocated costs are related to various initiatives, including News IQ, our global programmatic effort, and certain shared technology services that directly benefit the News and Information Services segment as part of our ongoing efforts to leverage our global scale to lower costs. 
Turning now to the segment highlights. At Dow Jones, consumer circulation revenues grew at a healthy 5%, reflecting 17% growth in digital paid subscribers across Dow Jones consumer products. This includes 13% growth in digital-only paid subscribers at The Wall Street Journal. In the aggregate, The Wall Street Journal subscriber base reached approximately 2.6 million. 
Professional Information Business revenues accounted for 27% of Dow Jones revenues this quarter, growing 8% to $115 million, maintaining momentum from the first quarter. As Robert mentioned, the key growth engine continues to be in Risk and Compliance, which grew a healthy 21% this quarter. This is a highly profitable and scalable business and is on track to approach $160 million of revenues this fiscal year. The Newswires product also showed growth benefiting from licensing deals with Bloomberg and FactSet, while Factiva was stable. 
Advertising at Dow Jones was weaker this quarter, falling about 5% compared to the prior year. Digital accounted for 43% of advertising revenues. Digital advertising was lower in the second quarter, primarily due to tough comparatives from the prior year, which saw significant programmatic growth from MarketWatch. However, we have seen a strong start so far this quarter, although visibility remains limited.
While it is very early days, we are making progress on monetizing valuable third-party partnerships, which is our key strategic focus as we expand the reach of Dow Jones and The Wall Street Journal across digital platforms and markets. These include deals with Twitter for our WSJ Watch Now videos, our weekday podcast, The Journal with Spotify and our recent content partnerships with Apple and Facebook. Overall, Dow Jones posted 4% revenue growth and another quarter of increased segment EBITDA contribution. 
Elsewhere across our news portfolio, advertising conditions were mixed. News UK's advertising revenues rose 5% on both a reported and local currency basis, representing second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth on a local currency basis, led by digital advertising growth at The Sun and moderating print declines. Advertising conditions in Australia remained challenging, but improved slightly from the prior quarter rate with revenues down 11% on a reported basis and down 7% in local currency.
For circulation revenues, the increase in cover prices and digital subscribers at both News Australia and News UK helped mitigate print volume declines and Australian currency headwinds. Finally, at News America Marketing, revenues fell 4%, an improvement from quarter 1. 
Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $501 million, down 11% versus $562 million in the prior year, of which $25 million or 5% was due to the negative impact from foreign currency. On an adjusted basis, revenues declined 6%. 
Broadcast subscriber trends were relatively similar to the prior quarter, with the revenue decline driven by a lower broadcast subscriber base and changes to the broadcast subscriber package mix as well as modestly lower pay-per-view revenues. Revenue declines were partially offset by expanding OTT revenues. As a reminder, we lapped the price increase from last year, which also impacted the year-over-year comparison. 
Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $70 million, down 17% from the prior year, driven by the revenue decline, partially offset by lower total cost, including programming and transmission costs, as the team at Foxtel continues to focus on streamlining business. 
Turning to the KPIs. Foxtel's closing paid subscriber base was approximately 3 million as of December 31, reflecting a 3% growth or 96,000 subscribers versus the prior year, driven by the launch of Kayo in November 2018. Total paying OTT subscribers reached 684,000, up 73% versus last year. We have seen over the past year that Kayo's paid customers will increase around key exclusive events. With the conclusion of Australia's popular Winter Sports and the Rugby World Cup, the number of paid subscribers in Kayo fell from the prior quarter. Notwithstanding, Kayo viewer engagement continues to be strong with subscribers watching an average of 5.3 weekly hours, with the average customer watching 7 of the 50 different sports available on Kayo each week. 
We have also been pleased with the increasing brand awareness, the stability of the platform and, more importantly, customer feedback in relation to the user experience. Kayo's solid subscriber base gives us optimism as it enters its second year ahead of the prime Winter Sports selling season.The team continues to work on a new OTT entertainment product built on the Kayo technology platform with the commercial launch anticipated in the fourth quarter. 
In the second quarter, broadcast churn was 16%, which is slightly higher than the 15.6% in the prior year. Foxtel direct channel churn of 14% was 2.5 points lower than the prior year, which was the lowest second quarter rate in 4 years. Like last quarter, the main driver behind the higher churn is coming from the lower ARPU Telstra wholesale customers on expiring contracts from the past 12 to 24 months. Broadcast ARPU declined about 1% to over AUD 77 per month. In November, we completed the refinancing of a significant portion of Foxtel debt, which extended maturities for at least 3 years. More details will be available in the 10-Q filing. 
At Book Publishing, HarperCollins revenues for the quarter fell 11% to $442 million, and segment EBITDA fell 28% to $63 million. As we have previously indicated, the revenue decline this quarter was primarily due to a tough comparison with the prior year, which included Homebody by Joanna Gaines; Girl, Wash Your Face by Rachel Hollis; The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas; and higher backwards sales from The Subtle Art by Mark Manson. The declines were partially offset by new releases, which include The Pioneer Woman Cooks: The New Frontier by Ree Drummond and The Beast of Buckingham Palace by David Walliams. 
We saw a 5% improvement in digital sales compared to the prior year, primarily due to the 17% growth in downloadable audiobooks. Overall digital sales represented 19% of consumer revenues for the quarter. Progress is being made with our non-publishing ventures. We expect the partnerships with Elizabeth Gabler's group at Sony Pictures and Bell Media to provide a longer-term payoff. These partnerships underscore the value of our intellectual property and should allow us to capitalize on other revenue streams with very modest capital outlay. 
At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues were down 5% to $294 million, of which foreign currency fluctuations had a negative impact of $8 million or 2%. On an adjusted basis, revenues declined 3%. REA Group revenues were down 8% or down 4% in local currency. The decline moderated from last quarter, but the benefit from higher yield and improved product mix in the residential business were more than offset by a 12% year-over-year decline in the new listing volume during the quarter, although the rate improved in each month during the quarter. Traffic, page views, app launches all trended higher, and we are seeing key indicators pointing to a gradual property market recovery. 
In the developer market, new project commencements fell 33% in the quarter, and the associated revenues have remained challenged. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call that just concluded for additional details and comments on their outlook. 
Move revenues declined 1% to $121 million, although importantly, real estate revenues grew 4%. Revenue trends slowed in the quarter, primarily due to the lapping of the Opcity acquisition in October 2018 and the subsequent transition of leads from the core lead model to the referral model, which has a tiny impact as revenue is recognized when a transaction closes. 
The increase in real estate revenues, which represented 82% of total Move revenues, was led by growth in audience and high-lead volume, together with an increased penetration of Local Experts, a local branded product. Results at Opcity remain encouraging as we saw improvement in the KPIs across the 17 markets we are testing, including and most importantly, close rates. We are very encouraged by the results and continue to anticipate improvements at Move in the second half. 
On audience, average monthly unique users for the quarter at realtor.com were 59 million, rising 9% versus the prior year and a gain from very strong year-over-year growth in page views and time spent on the site. Segment EBITDA fell 2% to $118 million. However, on an adjusted basis, EBITDA rose 2%. Results reflect increased profit contribution at Move benefiting from phasing of marketing, restructuring changes implemented late last year and the lapping of investment cost at Opcity, offset by lower REA revenues. 
I would now like to talk about some of the themes in the upcoming quarter. At News and Information Services, overall advertising trends thus far remain similar to the prior quarter levels, although visibility remains limited. We expect to see improvements at Dow Jones from increased licensing revenues from previously announced content licensing agreements, notably from Facebook. As I noted, we have also seen a pickup in digital advertising at Dow Jones so far this quarter. Overall, we would expect to see improvements compared to the prior year among our news brands, although News America Marketing likely remains challenged. 
In Subscription Video Services, for the third quarter, we expect approximately USD 10 million of costs related to the accelerated amortization that we previously noted and modestly higher marketing costs in front of the key Winter Sports selling season. However, we expect full year costs to be relatively stable with the prior year in local currency given the lower total expenses this quarter, as I mentioned earlier. 
In Book Publishing, as Robert mentioned, we expect the timing and slate of new releases, combined with less challenging prior year comparisons in the fourth quarter, to lead to improvement in Book Publishing in the second half. And at Digital Real Estate Services, as noted in their release, REA anticipates more favorable listing conditions in the second half of financial year '20 to deliver a stronger revenue outcome. Please see their release for more details. We also expect improvements in the second half with the ongoing progress at Opcity.

We're engaged in active negotiations for the sale of the company, and I'm happy to report that those discussions are well advanced.

I won't comment on the use of the funds. 
As for HBO-related questions, you really should pose those to HBO. What I would say is that we have an unparalleled collection of programming at Foxtel, where unlike U.S. cable companies in that our suite ranges across a real range of providers. And there's no doubt, for example, with recent renewals of Fox, NBCU, Sony, Discovery, BBC, we still have 2 more years of HBO that we're in very good shape."

But the Winter Sports in Australia are about congregation and audience aggregation, and we're on the cusp of that selling season.

We are operating in a different difficult time, so this will be a rather different distant experience. Before the business of the day, I sincerely hope that all on this call, each of our investors, our business partners and their families are safe during this exacting era.
Every business and family is facing challenges, and our thoughts, in particular, are for those who are suffering under the curse of COVID-19 and have had to deal with complications from this dreaded disease. For our company, the safety of our employees has obviously been paramount. And many of our journalists have displayed much courage in recent months, including according from Wuhan, during the intense first phase of what has become a pandemic.
I would also like to Honor Anthony who passed at a relatively young age. By which time he had already become a legendary sports photographer for the New York post.
As noted in our 8-K filing with the SEC last month, we expected a broad impact on our business from the pandemic inevitable economic consequences. We were affected somewhat in Q3, and those effects will like to be significantly more pronounced in the fourth quarter. As we expect this impact to continue in the near term, significant cost reductions have been implemented across the company and additional steps will be taken in coming months. These cuts are designed to deal with the short-term exigencies and to reposition the company for long-term growth. There will obviously be an impact on executive compensation. 
For many senior executives bonuses are the largest component of their cash compensation, and this will be reduced by at least 20%. The cuts will be led by our Executive Chairman, Rupert Murdoch, who is voluntarily foregoing his entire cash bonus for the current fiscal year. And as Chief Executive, I will forgo 75% of my annual cash bonus. In addition, our Board of Directors have decided to reduce their cash compensation.
These significant cost reductions of all kinds across the company will clearly have a positive impact on our total segment EBITDA and our cash position and help mitigate some of the effects of the pandemic. We obviously leave open the possibility of further compensation cuts next fiscal year depending on the ongoing impact of the crisis.
Turning now to the third quarter results for fiscal year 2020. Our revenues declined 8% to $2.3 billion, including a $78 million or 3% impact from adverse currency movements. Total segment EBITDA was down, although only 2% to $242 million.
It is worth highlighting that operationally, adjusting for currencies, acquisitions and disposals and other items, mentioned in our release, our adjusted revenues were down 4%, but our adjusted total segment EBITDA rose 1%. Reported results also include a $1.1 billion noncash write down, mostly attributable to Foxtel.
At the News and Information Services segment, the sale of News America Marketing has formally closed. This is a significant step in terms of enhancing shareholder value and part of the continuing simplification of our company. A thorough reevaluation of our assets continues and a strategic review of our community and regional original newspapers in Australia is at an advanced stage. We are also reviewing ways to improve transparency in our segment disclosure, which will enable investors to better appreciate the inherent value in and the growth potential of Dow Jones, which we believe is the best business news and analysis brand in the world. We are working towards making that company's potential more obvious and to highlighting its various strengths. Certainly relative to other business brands and, for example, to the New York Times.
Speaking of demand for premium content. As you know, we have entered into valuable partnerships with Apple and Facebook for use of our world-class journalism. Clearly, there are harbingers of positive change with Google, where the CEOs -- has shown a more enlightened socially empathetic attitude to journalism. In the past, some in Silicon Valley sought to create a system of petty patronage through philanthropic handouts and contentious SOPS. Seemingly designed to institutionalize a media. Enlightened executives at Google patently seek more meaningful changes to a dysfunctional ecosystem. The terms of trade in the digital world are certainly changing. The regulatory pressure is also intensifying as 2 weeks ago, the Australian government announced the introduction of a mandatory code that would require the larger digital companies to pay for content, and to adjust their algorithms to give additional weight to original news. It is absolutely crucial that more be understood about the character, the power and the potential manipulation of algorithms and data.
A recent Wall Street Journal report on Amazon's business practices showed the potential danger of companies having a dominant horizon marketplace and selling their own products in segment verticals. In essence, exploring proprietary marketplace data and competing with and potentially undermining their clients.
In the third quarter, News and information services improved in profitability for the second straight quarter with 15% growth in segment EBITDA. Dow Jones recorded a particularly strong performance. Our digital paid subscriptions rose 20% year-on-year to more than 2.5 million average daily subs at quarter end. The Wall Street Journal's digital paid subs were up 15% and to more than 2 million, also a record.
In recent days, the journal has shown further acceleration, with total subscriptions reaching approximately 3 million for the first time, including 2.2 million digital-only. Overall, at the end of April, digital subscriptions rose over 20% year-on-year.
Digital advertising at Dow Jones rose 25% year-over-year despite the challenges we faced with ad sales later in March. This is in strikingly marked contrast to the performance of the New York Times, where digital ad revenue actually declined 8%. I should repeat those figures for the purpose of clarity. Digital advertising rose 25% at Dow Jones, and it fell 8% at the New Times. Dow Jones profit contribution improved and was a significant contributor to segment EBITDA growth, while EBITDA slumped 15% at the New York Times.
We announced earlier this week that the Head of the Barrons Group, Elmar Latur will replace Will Lewis as CEO from the middle of this month.  Will certainly leave Dow Jones in fine fetal and with enormous capacity for future growth. Speaking of Barren, subscriptions rose 14% year-over-year. And over the past 4 years, under Elmar's leadership, the digital audience at Barrens Group Brands has quadrupled.
During the quarter, the Wall Street digital network broke records and hit 196 million unique users in March, up 155% versus the prior year. Traffic was particularly strong at Marketwatch in March, where users more than tripled to 90 million compared to the prior year. The professional information business reported a 5% increase in revenues with risk and compliance, once again demonstrating strength, rising 18% year-over-year.
Elsewhere in the segment, newspaper digital subscriptions at News Corp Australia were up 24% year-over-year, rising to more than 613,000 a quarter. And with 2/3 of subscriptions at the Australian now are digital-only. At News U.K., The Sun reached 164 million global unique visitors in March, representing a 17% increase over December, according to Google Analytics. While at The Times and Sunday Times, digital subscriptions grew 21% year-over-year to 345,000, and now account for nearly 60% of the base.
Meanwhile, the New York Post Advertising revenues in the quarter rose 19% and the post digital network had 169 million average monthly unique visitors, according to Google Analytics, up from 107 million in Q2.
Turning now to book publishing. Revenue declines moderated half of Collins in the quarter compared to the first half, while segment EBITDA grew year-over-year despite very difficult comparisons. As more people have move to work and study from home, we've seen a revival in e-book sales. We are particularly pleased with early sales for gains Magnolia table volume 2, which already sits atop the U.S. seller lists.
Digital real estate, we're showing solid progress through January and February, but began experiencing pandemic-related declines in March. Business at REA and realtor.com will depend on the reopening of the Australian and U.S. economies, but traffic to both sites remains encouraging and realtor.com is outperforming the traffic trends of its house flipping competitor, according to the March ComScore data. In the Subscription Video Services segment,  Kayo subscriptions rose to 444,000 in Q3, including Trialist, which was more than double the prior year, and Kayo also showed strong growth over the prior quarter. That figure has obviously been adversely affected in recent weeks by the suspension of sports in Australia, as we disclosed in the earnings release.
We are in serious negotiations with for major sports over a fundamental reset of rights costs. Susan will discuss the possible account at shortly. 
In coming weeks, we plan to launch our entertainment streaming product and expect that there will be strong demand, given the power of our media portfolio's marketing platform and the nascent demand in Australia. We're also very excited by the multiyear deal with Warner Media announced this week. That means Foxtel will be the exclusive home in Australia for HBO, this soon to launch HBO Max and other Warner Media hits. 
Let me now turn to the lingering impact of COVID-19, which began to have an effect towards the quarter's end, but clearly will be a major factor in our Q4 results, as we signaled in our 8-K filing last month. I would first like to commend our leaders and our employees around the globe as we rapidly and successfully moved approximately 90% of our workforce, around 25,000 people into a work from in-home environment. Looking at the longer term, we have clear plans for addressing the immediate challenges we face and for emerging vigorously on the other side of this crisis. This will not be done by random cost-cutting but by strategic decisions about the business we need to fashion for a profitable future. That strategy is informed by a candid, assessment of our capabilities and deficiencies and a clear sense that the business environment will be very different when the world finally returns to the new abnormal.
It is worth noting at this crucial time, that News Corp continues to have a strong balance sheet. As of March 31, we have $1.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents. And in addition, we have access to a $750 million corporate revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn. That bad rock of financial stability will help us weather the category 5 storm, as will the power of our brands and the energy and the creativity of our people. 
The headwinds will buffer the company in the short term, but I'm extremely positive about our prospects for delivering long-term growth and increasing shareholder value. 
Now for more particulars on our results in this quarter, I turn to Susan Panuccio."

Turning to the financials. Fiscal 2020 third quarter total revenues were approximately $2.3 billion, down 8% versus the prior year, and total segment EBITDA was $242 million, down 2% versus the prior year.
Currency headwinds negatively impacted revenues and total segment EBITDA by 3% and 6%, respectively. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and currency fluctuations, the other items disclosed in our release, revenues fell 4%, and total segment EBITDA increased 1%. For the quarter, we reported losses per share of $1.24 as compared to earnings per share of $0.02 in the prior year. The loss includes $1.1 billion of noncash impairment charges primarily related to a write-down of goodwill intangible assets at Foxtel and the reclassification of News America Marketing to assets held for sale.
Adjusted earnings per share were $0.03 in the quarter compared to $0.04 the prior year. Before going into the quarterly detail, I will add to Robert's comments on the COVID-19 pandemic, which is expected to have a significant impact on near-term operating results. Immediate cost actions are underway. Variable costs have obviously been reduced with a heightened focus on the reduction of discretionary spend and nonessential CapEx, together with a thorough review of all headcount requirements. We are accelerating plans to reduce costs across the business in the medium term, particularly at our News and Information Services segment. These initiatives include, but are not limited, global shared services to centralize our back-office functions, a thorough review of our property and office footprint and reviewing our printing operations around the globe, whereby we have already announced the printing suspension of 60 community newspapers in Australia.
Finally, in relation to company-wide liquidity, it is important to note the only debt exposures we have are at our non-100%-owned subsidiaries, Foxtel and REA, and these are non recalls to News Corp. We are not anticipating any covenant issues at Foxtel over the next 12 months, and we have no plans to provide any additional shareholder funding. 
With that as a backdrop, I will now discuss the quarterly results for the individual operating segments. News and information services, revenues for the quarter were over $1.1 billion, down 8% versus the prior year. On an adjusted basis, revenues declined 5%. Advertising revenues fell 14% with declines most notably at News America Marketing and in News Australia, while circulation and subscription revenue grew 1%. Currency negatively impacted segment revenues by 2%. Results were also impacted by $14 million from the outbreak of COVID-19.
Digital revenues for Dow Jones and the newspaper mastheads represented 42% of their combined revenues, up from 36% in the prior year. Segment EBITDA for the quarter was $75 million, up 15% from $65 million in the prior year, benefiting from increased contributions at Dow Jones, improvements at the New York post and the absence of losses from unruly, partially offset by lower contribution from NAM.
At Dow Jones, consumer circulation revenues grew a healthy 4%, reflecting a 20% growth in digital paid subscribers across our Dow Jones consumer products, including a 15% growth in digital-only paid subscribers at the Wall Street Journal. Total Wall Street Journal subscribers exceeded 2.8 million in the quarter, an 8% increase from the prior year, which is an acceleration from the second quarter's growth rate.
Professional information business revenues accounted for 29% of Dow Jones revenues this quarter, growing 5% to $114 million, reflecting an 18% growth in risk and compliance revenues.
Advertising renews at Dow Jones fell 2% this quarter. But as Robert mentioned, we saw a sharp acceleration in digital advertising revenues, posting 25% year-over-year growth. Digital advertising represented 47% of Dow Jones advertising revenues. Overall, Dow Jones had revenue growth of 5% and another quarter of positive contribution to segment EBITDA growth.
Elsewhere, advertising revenues at NIS UK fell 10% on a reported basis and 8% in local currency, weaker than the past 2 quarters despite strength in digital. Trends at News Australia have remained very challenging, with advertising revenues down 20% on a reported basis and 30% down in local currency. Finally, at News America Marketing, revenues fell 16%. 
Turning to the subscription video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $462 million, down 14% versus $539 million in the prior year or down 7% in local currency. The revenue decline was primarily driven by lower broadcast subscribers. Broadcast subscriber trends were relatively similar to the prior quarter with COVID-19 restrictions in Australia coming into place in the last week of the quarter. Foxtel also faced lower advertising revenues, reflective of the overall TV marketplace. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $68 million, down 31% from the prior year, driven by the revenue decline, partially offset by renegotiated license fees and the timing of sports rights and the production costs due to COVID-19 related suspensions. Overall costs were down 11% on a reported basis.
Foxtel's closing paid subscriber base was approximately 2.93 million as of March 31, reflecting a 1% year-over-year growth driven by Kayo subscribers. Through quarter end, Kayo's total subscriber base, which including Trialists, increased 444,000, up from 199,000 last year. In fact, we reached over 470,000 total Kayo subscribers by March 22, the start of the winter sports season. However, subscribers have declined in recent weeks with the suspension of the NRL and AFL seasons as well as Rugby, motor sports and other international sporting codes, like the NBA. Kayo viewers remained highly engaged during the quarter, and we expect an uptick in subscribers that will clearly depend on the quality and quantity of NRL and AFL games once they have presumed. As of May 2, there were more than 272,000 paying Kayo subscribers. 
We have been beta testing Fox Hell's new drama and entertainment streaming service, and we expect to launch commercially in the coming weeks, and we're very pleased to announce the Warner media deal to support the launch. 
In the third quarter, broadcast churn improved for the first time in almost 2 years to 17.5%, which was 20 basis points lower versus the prior year. Broadcast ARPU remained relatively stable at AUD [ 79 ]. At Book Publishing, HarperCollins had a strong quarter with revenues down 2% to $412 million and segment EBITDA up 4% to $55 million, despite a very tough comparison against the prior year, which had segment EBITDA growth of 29%. We saw improvement performance in general books, children's and in the U.K. digital sales grew 3% year-over-year to 23% of consumer revenue, which included improvements in downloadable audio books. 
At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues decreased 4% to $261 million due to the negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. On an adjusted basis, revenues were flat. Segment EBITDA rose 1% to $74 million or 9% on an adjusted basis. REA Group revenues fell 5%. However, without the $12 million foreign currency impact, REA grew modestly in local currency. This is an improvement from the first half performance benefiting from renewed growth in financial services. Australian listing volume declines moderated to down 7%, which reflects mid single-digit growth in Metro Melbourne and Sydney. REA also saw strong traffic metrics achieving record levels in visits and audience during the quarter. 
However, COVID-19-related government policies and restrictions, including bans on open home inspections and in person auctions have led to reduced listing volumes in recent weeks. In response to the impacts from the pandemic, REA has implemented a number of relief packages to support its customers, including short-term pricing concessions and changes to listing products to provide greater flexibility for customers. Please refer to REA's earnings release and the conference call immediately following this call for more details. 
Move revenues declined 2% to $118 million, with real estate revenues relatively flat. Traffic remains strong with unique users in the quarter, up 6% to $68 million. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Move was on a solid growth trajectory in January and February, with improved growth in traffic and leads and was on pace to deliver strong second half revenue. However, by mid-March, seller to REA and other digital real estate portals, those trends reversed.
In response to the pandemic, real top institution billing relief initiative in late March for its customers, which was subsequently extended into May with solidification to the offer. The initiative, together with other COVID-19-related impacts reduced third quarter revenues by an estimated $6 million.
I would now like to talk about some of the themes in the upcoming quarter. Forecasting has been challenging, so I will discuss what we have seen in April and frame the relevant risks. At News and information services, we expect advertising and single copy sale revenues in the segment to be adversely affected as a result of widespread business closures and social distancing measures. For a framework, advertising revenues, excluding News America marketing, represented approximately 34% of segment revenues in the third quarter. In April, advertising revenues at Dow Jones was down more than 20% with digital down modestly. Advertising revenues at Australia and the U.K. were down more than 45% on a reported basis or around 40% in local currency. 
As I mentioned earlier, we are taking aggressive cost action to mitigate these revenue declines within the segment. At the same time, we have also continued to see strong growth in digital subscribers across the key properties in April, including over 20% year-on-year growth in digital-only subscribers of the Wall Street Journal. In the third quarter, approximately 75% of Dow Jones revenues were subscription-based, providing much more stability and stability. Digital revenues accounted for 68% of Dow Jones revenues and digital paid subscribers accounted for 73% of the Wall Street General subscriber base. 
In subscription video services, we anticipate an increase in broadcast churn with the suspension of the NRL and AFL seasons. For April, broadcast churn has been fairly stable, although we have seen lower sports tier and Kayo subscribers, as you would expect. Closures of pubs and clubs and lower occupancy at hotels throughout Australia are also expected to adversely impact commercial subscription revenues, together with the downturn in advertising revenue.
The team at Foxtel has implemented several initiatives, including opening up additional entertainment content to all subscribers and providing Foxtel broadband customers with unlimited data allowances for streaming. As for sports rights accounting, Foxtel amortizes event-based sports like Formula One, which have no dedicated channels upon the occurrence of the events. Consequently, the third quarter included about USD 9 million of costs, that were deferred due to events canceled or postponed. Channel based sports rights, such as the AFL, NRL and domestic crickets are expensed on a straight-line basis over the year. The third quarter included a full amount of rights fees for all 3 of those sports. In the event that the NRL and AFL do not do this season in the fourth quarter, we would plan to defer those costs until the sports regime. All the sports based contracts have different terms and conditions, and we are currently in discussions with the leagues around the best way to move forward and to value the season that remains. 
As a framework, the quarterly cost between the AFL and NRL prior to the suspensions were AUD 95 million or approximately USD 60 million. In addition, we also expect an approximately $10 million impact from the accelerated entertainment amortization in the fourth quarter. 
In Book Publishing, as the retail market adjusted to stay at home restrictions by closing a number of bricks-and-mortar stores, Hub Collin saw strong growth in online sales with e-books returning to growth. Our release slate is largely intact, and as Robert mentioned, one of our top books for the year, Joanna Gains Magnolia table Volume 2 is selling very well.
At Digital Real estate services, as noted in their release, REA anticipates a challenging listing environment given the government social distancing measures with April, new buy listings falling 33%. REALTOR is facing lower real estate transactions, but encouragingly, lead volume and unique users have shown improvements in recent weeks. Both companies have taken proactive relief measures to extend credit to their respective customers with discounts or other similar measures, which will have an adverse impact on revenues. 
CapEx for the year is expected to come down significantly to around $435 million compared to $572 million last year, which includes a 35% to 40% decline at Foxtel. An update on our initial guidance of approximately 20% year-on-year reduction. 
Finally, a word about our tax rate. From a P&L perspective, we expect an unusually high tax rate for the full year due to certain operating losses in foreign jurisdictions that we are unable to take deductions against. This is a P&L impact, not a cash impact. 
As I mentioned, these are unique times, but we believe with our strong liquidity position, market-leading brands, our emphasis on digital transformation as well as a more aggressive focus on cost measures, News Corp is well positioned to weather the current prices. 
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

Look, in terms of the subscribers are, obviously, we have had strong growth in U.S. subscriptions.

And so we particularly seeing growth, for example, in subscriptions coming from MarketWatch to the journal and from MarketWatch to Barron's and as well as that from The Journal to Barron's. And then for the more specialist, Wall Street Journal subscribers, there's an opportunity to sell them -- to upsell them to our premium business products, which obviously have a higher yield. In terms of advertising, clearly, traffic has been particularly strong. There had been, as you may well be aware, some concerns early in COVID crisis about blocking of adds related to COVID crisis coverage. Gradually, that problem has diminished. And so we are noticing that the amount of advertising we're getting is matching, not quite, but to some extent, the significant increases in traffic we've had across the Street Journal and MarketWatch. We noticed that tech advertising has increased. Custom advertising is also on the rise. And to a certain extent, programmatic. But I think for our business, quite frankly, it's an extraordinary opportunity because big clients are coming straight to the Wall Street Journal. And to our other publishing houses around the world. 
And they want to deal directly with us rather than necessarily through an advertising agency. And while this is at the moment, a short term phenomenon, there are indications that this may very well become a long-term trend."

We are operating in a different difficult time, so this will be a rather different distant experience. Before the business of the day, I sincerely hope that all on this call, each of our investors, our business partners and their families are safe during this exacting era.
Every business and family is facing challenges, and our thoughts, in particular, are for those who are suffering under the curse of COVID-19 and have had to deal with complications from this dreaded disease. For our company, the safety of our employees has obviously been paramount. And many of our journalists have displayed much courage in recent months, including reporting from Wuhan, during the intense first phase of what has become a pandemic.
I would also like to honor Anthony Causi who passed at a relatively young age, by which time he had already become a legendary sports photographer for the New York post.
As noted in our 8-K filing with the SEC last month, we expected a broad impact on our business from the pandemic's inevitable economic consequences. We were affected somewhat in Q3, and those effects were likely to be significantly more pronounced in the fourth quarter. As we expect this impact to continue in the near term, significant cost reductions have been implemented across the company and additional steps will be taken in coming months. These cuts are designed to deal with the short-term exigencies and to reposition the company for long-term growth. There will obviously be an impact on executive compensation. 
For many senior executives, bonuses are the largest component of their cash compensation, and this will be reduced by at least 20%. The cuts will be led by our Executive Chairman, Rupert Murdoch, who is voluntarily foregoing his entire cash bonus for the current fiscal year. And as Chief Executive, I will forgo 75% of my annual cash bonus. In addition, our Board of Directors have decided to reduce their cash compensation.
These significant cost reductions of all kinds across the company will clearly have a positive impact on our total segment EBITDA and our cash position and help mitigate some of the effects of the pandemic. We obviously leave open the possibility of further compensation cuts next fiscal year depending on the ongoing impact of the crisis.
Turning now to the third quarter results for fiscal year 2020. Our revenues declined 8% to $2.3 billion, including a $78 million or 3% impact from adverse currency movements. Total segment EBITDA was down, although only 2% to $242 million.
It is worth highlighting that operationally, adjusting for currencies, acquisitions and disposals and other items, mentioned in our release, our adjusted revenues were down 4%, but our adjusted total segment EBITDA rose 1%. Reported results also include a $1.1 billion noncash write-down, mostly attributable to Foxtel.
At the News and Information Services segment, the sale of News America Marketing has formally closed. This is a significant step in terms of enhancing shareholder value and part of the continuing simplification of our company. A thorough reevaluation of our assets continues and a strategic review of our community and regional original newspapers in Australia is at an advanced stage. We are also reviewing ways to improve transparency in our segment disclosure, which will enable investors to better appreciate the inherent value in and the growth potential of Dow Jones, which we believe is the best business news and analysis brand in the world. We are working towards making that company's potential more obvious and to highlighting its various strengths, certainly relative to other business brands and, for example, to the New York Times.
Speaking of demand for premium content. As you know, we have entered into valuable partnerships with Apple and Facebook for use of our world-class journalism. Clearly, there are harbingers of positive change with Google, where the CEO, Sundar Pichai has shown a more enlightened socially empathetic attitude to journalism. 
In the past, some in Silicon Valley sought to create a system of petty patronage through philanthropic handouts and contentious SOPs. Seemingly designed to institutionalize a medicant media. Enlightened executives at Google patently seek more meaningful changes to a dysfunctional ecosystem. The terms of trade in the digital world are certainly changing. The regulatory pressure is also intensifying as 2 weeks ago, the Australian government announced the introduction of a mandatory code that would require the larger digital companies to pay for content, and to adjust their algorithms to give additional weight to original news. It is absolutely crucial that more be understood about the character, the power and the potential manipulation of algorithms and data.
A recent Wall Street Journal report on Amazon's business practices showed the potential danger of companies having a dominant horizontal marketplace and selling their own products in segment verticals. In essence, exploiting proprietary marketplace data and competing with and potentially undermining their clients.
In the third quarter, News and Information Services improved in profitability for the second straight quarter with 15% growth in segment EBITDA. Dow Jones recorded a particularly strong performance. Our digital paid subscriptions rose 20% year-on-year to more than 2.5 million average daily subs at quarter end. The Wall Street Journal's digital paid subs were up 15% to more than 2 million, also a record.
In recent days, The Journal has shown further acceleration, with total subscriptions reaching approximately 3 million for the first time, including 2.2 million digital-only. Overall, at the end of April, digital subscriptions rose over 20% year-on-year.
Digital advertising at Dow Jones rose 25% year-over-year despite the challenges we faced with ad sales later in March. This is in strikingly marked contrast to the performance of the New York Times, where digital ad revenue actually declined 8%. I should repeat those figures for the purpose of clarity. Digital advertising rose 25% at Dow Jones, and it fell 8% at the New York Times. Dow Jones profit contribution improved and was a significant contributor to segment EBITDA growth, while EBITDA slumped 15% at the New York Times.
We announced earlier this week that the Head of the Barron's Group, Almar Latur, will replace, Will Lewis, as CEO from the middle of this month. We will certainly leave Dow Jones in fine fettle and with enormous capacity for future growth. 
Speaking of Barron, subscriptions rose 14% year-over-year. And over the past 4 years, under Almar's leadership, the digital audience at Barron's Group Brands has quadrupled.
During the quarter, the Wall Street digital network broke records and hit 196 million unique users in March, up 155% versus the prior year. Traffic was particularly strong at MarketWatch in March, where users more than tripled to 90 million compared to the prior year. The professional information business reported a 5% increase in revenues with risk and compliance, once again demonstrating strength, rising 18% year-over-year.
Elsewhere in the segment, newspaper digital subscriptions at News Corp Australia were up 24% year-over-year, rising to more than 613,000 a quarter. And with 2/3 of subscriptions at the Australian now are digital-only. At News UK, The Sun reached 164 million global unique visitors in March, representing a 17% increase over December, according to Google Analytics. While at The Times and Sunday Times, digital subscriptions grew 21% year-over-year to 345,000, and now account for nearly 60% of the base.
Meanwhile, the New York Post advertising revenues in the quarter rose 19% and the post digital network had 169 million average monthly unique visitors, according to Google Analytics, up from 107 million in Q2.
Turning now to book publishing. Revenue declines moderate at HarperCollins in the quarter compared to the first half, while segment EBITDA grew year-over-year despite very difficult comparisons. As more people have move to work and study from home, we've seen a revival in e-book sales. We are particularly pleased with early sales for Joanna Gaines, Magnolia Table, Volume 2, which already sits atop the U.S. bestseller lists.
Digital real estate were showing solid progress through January and February, but began experiencing pandemic-related declines in March. Business at REA and realtor.com will depend on the reopening of the Australian and U.S. economies, but traffic to both sites remains encouraging. And realtor.com is outperforming the traffic trends of its house flipping competitor, according to the March ComScore data. 
In the Subscription Video Services segment, Kayo subscriptions rose to 444,000 in Q3, including trialist, which was more than double the prior year, and Kayo also showed strong growth over the prior quarter. That figure has obviously been adversely affected in recent weeks by the suspension of sports in Australia, as we disclosed in the earnings release.
We are in serious negotiations with the major sports over a fundamental reset of rights costs. Susan will discuss the possible accounting impacts shortly. 
In coming weeks, we plan to launch our entertainment streaming product and expect that there will be strong demand, given the power of our media portfolio's marketing platform and the nascent demand in Australia. We're also very excited by the multiyear deal with WarnerMedia announced this week. That means Foxtel will be the exclusive home in Australia for HBO, this is soon to launch HBO Max and other WarnerMedia hits. 
Let me now turn to the lingering impact of COVID-19, which began to have an effect towards the third quarter's end, but clearly will be a major factor in our Q4 results, as we signaled in our 8-K filing last month. I would first like to commend our leaders and our employees around the globe as we rapidly and successfully moved approximately 90% of our workforce, around 25,000 people into a work from in-home environment. Looking at the longer term, we have clear plans for addressing the immediate challenges we face and for emerging vigorously on the other side of this crisis. This will not be done by random cost-cutting but by strategic decisions about the business we need to fashion for a profitable future. That strategy is informed by a candid, assessment of our capabilities and deficiencies and a clear sense that the business environment will be very different when the world finally returns to the new abnormal.
It is worth noting at this crucial time, that News Corp continues to have a strong balance sheet. As of March 31, we have $1.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents. And in addition, we have access to a $750 million corporate revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn. That bedrock of financial stability will help us weather the category-5 storm, as will the power of our brands and the energy and the creativity of our people. 
The headwinds will buffer the company in the short term, but I'm extremely positive about our prospects for delivering long-term growth and increasing shareholder value. 
Now for more particulars on our results in this quarter, I turn to Susan Panuccio."

Fiscal 2020 third quarter total revenues were approximately $2.3 billion, down 8% versus the prior year, and total segment EBITDA was $242 million, down 2% versus the prior year.Currency headwinds negatively",2164,"Thank you, Robert. Turning to the financials. Fiscal 2020 third quarter total revenues were approximately $2.3 billion, down 8% versus the prior year, and total segment EBITDA was $242 million, down 2% versus the prior year.
Currency headwinds negatively impacted revenues and total segment EBITDA by 3% and 6%, respectively. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and currency fluctuations and the other items disclosed in our release, revenues fell 4%, and total segment EBITDA increased 1%. 
For the quarter, we reported losses per share of $1.24 as compared to earnings per share of $0.02 in the prior year. The loss includes $1.1 billion of noncash impairment charges primarily related to a write-down of goodwill intangible assets of Foxtel and the reclassification of News America Marketing to assets held for sale.  Adjusted earnings per share were $0.03 in the quarter compared to $0.04 in the prior year. Before 
going into the quarterly detail, I will add to Robert's comments on the COVID-19 pandemic, which is expected to have a significant impact on near-term operating results. Immediate cost actions are underway. Variable costs have obviously been reduced with a heightened focus on the reduction of discretionary spend and nonessential CapEx, together with a thorough review of all headcount requirements. We are accelerating plans to reduce costs across the business in the medium term, particularly at our News and Information Services segment. These initiatives include, but are not limited, global shared services to centralize our back-office functions, a thorough review of our property and office footprint and reviewing our printing operations around the globe, whereby we have already announced the printing suspension of 60 community newspapers in Australia.
Finally, in relation to company-wide liquidity, it is important to note the only debt exposures we have are at our non-100%-owned subsidiaries, Foxtel and REA, and these are non recalls to News Corp. We are not anticipating any covenant issues at Foxtel over the next 12 months, and we have no plans to provide any additional shareholder funding. 
With that as a backdrop, I will now discuss the quarterly results for the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were over $1.1 billion, down 8% versus the prior year. On an adjusted basis, revenues declined 5%. Advertising revenues fell 14% with declines most notably at News America Marketing and in News Australia, while circulation and subscription revenue grew 1%. Currency negatively impacted segment revenues by 2%. Results were also impacted by $14 million from the outbreak of COVID-19.
Digital revenues for Dow Jones and the newspaper mastheads represented 42% of their combined revenues, up from 36% in the prior year. Segment EBITDA for the quarter was $75 million, up 15% from $65 million in the prior year, benefiting from increased contributions at Dow Jones, improvements at the New York post and the absence of losses from unruly, partially offset by lower contribution from NAM.
At Dow Jones, consumer circulation revenues grew a healthy 4%, reflecting a 20% growth in digital paid subscribers across Dow Jones consumer products, including a 15% growth in digital-only paid subscribers at the Wall Street Journal. Total Wall Street Journal subscribers exceeded 2.8 million in the quarter, an 8% increase from the prior year, which is an acceleration from the second quarter's growth rate.
Professional information business revenues accounted for 29% of Dow Jones revenues this quarter, growing 5% to $114 million, reflecting an 18% growth in risk and compliance revenues.
Advertising renews at Dow Jones fell 2% this quarter. But as Robert mentioned, we saw a sharp acceleration in digital advertising revenues, posting 25% year-over-year growth. Digital advertising represented 47% of Dow Jones advertising revenues. Overall, Dow Jones had revenue growth of 5% and another quarter of positive contribution to segment EBITDA growth.
Elsewhere, advertising revenues at News UK fell 10% on a reported basis and 8% in local currency, weaker than the past 2 quarters despite strength in digital. Trends at News Australia have remained very challenging, with advertising revenues down 20% on a reported basis and 30% down in local currency. Finally, at News America Marketing, revenues fell 16%. 
Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $462 million, down 14% versus $539 million in the prior year or down 7% in local currency. The revenue decline was primarily driven by lower broadcast subscribers. Broadcast subscriber trends were relatively similar to the prior quarter with COVID-19 restrictions in Australia coming into place in the last week of the quarter. Foxtel also faced lower advertising revenues, reflective of the overall TV marketplace. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $68 million, down 31% from the prior year, driven by the revenue decline, partially offset by renegotiated license fees and the timing of sports rights and the production costs due to COVID-19-related suspensions. Overall costs were down 11% on a reported basis.
Foxtel's closing paid subscriber base was approximately 2.93 million as of March 31, reflecting a 1% year-over-year growth driven by Kayo subscribers. Through quarter end, Kayo's total subscriber base, including trialists, increased 444,000, up from 199,000 last year. In fact, we reached over 470,000 total Kayo subscribers by March 22, the start of the Winter Sports season. However, subscribers have declined in recent weeks with the suspension of the NRL and AFL seasons as well as Rugby, motor sports and other international sporting codes, like the [indiscernible]. Kayo viewers remained highly engaged during the quarter, and we expect an uptick in subscribers that will clearly depend on the quality and quantity of NRL and AFL games once they have resumed. As of May 2, there were more than 272,000 paying Kayo subscribers. 
We have been beta testing Foxtel's new drama and entertainment streaming service, and we expect to launch commercially in the coming weeks, and we're very pleased to announce the WarnerMedia deal to support the launch. 
In the third quarter, broadcast churn improved for the first time in almost 2 years to 17.5%, which was 20 basis points lower versus the prior year. Broadcast ARPU remained relatively stable at AUD 79. 
At Book Publishing, HarperCollins had a strong quarter with revenues down 2% to $412 million and segment EBITDA up 4% to $55 million, despite a very tough comparison against the prior year, which had segment EBITDA growth of 29%. We saw improvement performance in general books, children's and in the U.K. Digital sales grew 3% year-over-year to 23% of consumer revenue, which included improvements in downloadable audio books. 
At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues decreased 4% to $261 million due to the negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. On an adjusted basis, revenues were flat. Segment EBITDA rose 1% to $74 million or 9% on an adjusted basis. REA Group revenues fell 5%. However, without the $12 million foreign currency impact, REA grew modestly in local currency. This is an improvement from the first half performance benefiting from renewed growth in financial services. Australian listing volume declines moderated to down 7%, which reflects mid single-digit growth in metro Melbourne and Sydney. REA also saw strong traffic metrics achieving record levels in visits and audience during the quarter. 
However, COVID-19-related government policies and restrictions, including bans on open home inspections and in person auctions have led to reduced listing volumes in recent weeks. In response to the impacts from the pandemic, REA has implemented a number of relief packages to support its customers, including short-term pricing concessions and changes to listing products to provide greater flexibility for customers. Please refer to REA's earnings release and the conference call immediately following this call for more details. 
Move revenues declined 2% to $118 million, with real estate revenues relatively flat. Traffic remains strong with unique users in the quarter, up 6% to $68 million. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Move was on a solid growth trajectory in January and February, with improved growth in traffic and leads and was on pace to deliver strong second half revenue. However, by mid-March, seller to REA and other digital real estate portals, both trends reversed.
In response to the pandemic, REALTOR instituted billing relief initiative in late March for its customers, which was subsequently extended into May with some modification to the offer. The initiative, together with other COVID-19-related impacts reduced third quarter revenues by an estimated $6 million.
I would now like to talk about some of the themes in the upcoming quarter. Forecasting has been challenging, so I will discuss what we have seen in April and frame the relevant risks. At News and Information Services, we expect advertising and single copy sale revenues in the segment to be adversely affected as a result of widespread business closures and social distancing measures. For a framework, advertising revenues, excluding News America Marketing, represented approximately 34% of segment revenues in the third quarter. In April, advertising revenues at Dow Jones was down more than 20% with digital down modestly. Advertising revenues at Australia and the U.K. were down more than 45% on a reported basis or around 40% in local currency. 
As I mentioned earlier, we are taking aggressive cost action to mitigate these revenue declines within the segment. At the same time, we have also continued to see strong growth in digital subscribers across the key properties in April, including over 20% year-on-year growth in digital-only subscribers of the Wall Street Journal. In the third quarter, approximately 75% of Dow Jones revenues were subscription-based, providing much more visibility and stability. Digital revenues accounted for 68% of Dow Jones revenues and digital paid subscribers accounted for 73% of the Wall Street General subscriber base. 
In Subscription Video Services, we anticipate an increase in broadcast churn with the suspension of the NRL and AFL seasons. For April, broadcast churn has been fairly stable, although we have seen lower sports tier and Kayo subscribers, as you would expect. Closures of pubs and clubs and lower occupancy at hotels throughout Australia are also expected to adversely impact commercial subscription revenues, together with the downturn in advertising revenue.
The team at Foxtel has implemented several initiatives, including opening up additional entertainment content to all subscribers and providing Foxtel broadband customers with unlimited data allowances for streaming. As for sports rights accounting, Foxtel amortizes event-based sports like Formula 1, which have no dedicated channels upon the occurrence of the events. Consequently, the third quarter included about USD 9 million of costs, that were deferred due to events canceled or postponed. Channel based sports rights, such as the AFL, NRL and domestic crickets are expensed on a straight-line basis over the year. The third quarter included a full amount of rights fees for all 3 of those sports. In the event that the NRL and AFL do not resume this season in the fourth quarter, we would plan to defer those costs until the sports regime. All the sports-based contracts have different terms and conditions, and we are currently in discussions with the leagues around the best way to move forward and to value the season that remains. 
As a framework, the quarterly cost between the AFL and NRL prior to the suspensions were AUD 95 million or approximately USD 60 million. In addition, we also expect an approximately $10 million impact from the accelerated entertainment amortization in the fourth quarter. 
In Book Publishing, as the retail market adjusted to stay-at-home restrictions by closing a number of bricks-and-mortar stores, HarperCollins saw strong growth in online sales with e-books returning to growth. Our release slate is largely intact, and as Robert mentioned, one of our top books for the year, Joanna Gaines, Magnolia Table, Volume 2 is selling very well.
At Digital Real Estate Services, as noted in their release, REA anticipates a challenging listing environment given the government social distancing measures with April, new buy listings falling 33%. REALTOR is facing lower real estate transactions, but encouragingly, lead volume and unique users have shown improvements in recent weeks. Both companies have taken proactive relief measures to extend credit to their respective customers with discounts or other similar measures, which will have an adverse impact on revenues. 
CapEx for the year is expected to come down significantly to around $435 million compared to $572 million last year, which includes a 35% to 40% decline at Foxtel. An update on our initial guidance of approximately 20% year-on-year reduction. 
Finally, a word about our tax rate. From a P&L perspective, we expect an unusually high tax rate for the full year due to certain operating losses in foreign jurisdictions that we are unable to take deductions against. This is a P&L impact, not a cash impact. 
As I mentioned, these are unique times, but we believe with our strong liquidity position, market-leading brands, our emphasis on digital transformation as well as a more aggressive focus on cost measures, News Corp is well positioned to weather the current crisis. 
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

It sounded like in April, it softened a little bit, but still seems like it's coming in probably better than what we're seeing in the industry. I'm wondering if it was specific to certain verticals that continue to be strength in your product mix. And then just a follow-up on the makeup of the strong growth in digital subscribers also at The Journal. Is it international, domestic? Anything different, maybe younger? Or is it pretty much just more of everything that you've been seeing for a while?"

Look, in terms of the subscribers are, obviously, we have had strong growth in U.S. subscriptions. And I think the thing to remember about Wall Street Journal subscriptions, is it -- once you have a subscriber, you also have an opportunity to upsell. And so we're particularly seeing growth, for example, in subscriptions coming from MarketWatch to The Journal and from MarketWatch to Barron's and as well as that from The Journal to Barron's. And then for the more specialist, Wall Street Journal subscribers, there's an opportunity to sell them -- to upsell them to our premium business products, which obviously have a higher yield. 
In terms of advertising, clearly, traffic has been particularly strong. There had been, as you may well be aware, some concerns early in the COVID crisis about blocking of ads related to COVID crisis coverage. Gradually, that problem has diminished. And so we are noticing that the amount of advertising we're getting is matching, not quite, but to some extent, the significant increases in traffic we've had across the Wall Street Journal and MarketWatch. We noticed that tech advertising has increased. Custom advertising is also on the rise. And to a certain extent, programmatic. But I think for our business, quite frankly, it's an extraordinary opportunity because big clients are coming straight to the Wall Street Journal. And to our other publishing houses around the world. 
And they want to deal directly with us rather than necessarily through an advertising agency. And while this is at the moment, a short term phenomenon, there are indications that this may very well become a long-term trend."

But we do believe that across all our businesses on a global scale, particularly when we think about our back-office functions, that we do have some significant opportunities that we can unlock. We have been actively working on those measures over the course of the last 12 months, particularly looking at PEC. But we do believe that there's a lot more opportunities we can do as we broaden the scope of that as we move forward."

But to a certain extent, you may well be correct in that various things have been expedited during this period of crisis. What I would like to say specifically around simplification is that clearly, we're pleased that the NAM transaction has progressed. Actually, we had full fit the Charlesbank who have pre-existing specialist expertise in that area, we'll be able to make a significant success of the business. And you can tell from the tenor of our content -- comments about Australia that there is obviously a strategic review of our print holdings well underway. So our simplification process is far from finished. And part of that is that we're very keen to highlight the value inherent in, for example, Dow Jones, which we reported vastly superior numbers to those of the New York Times, but whose figures are not fully obvious in the current News and Information Services segment.
Now if you think of the journey in recent years, the sale of Amplify, the early sale of the local media group at Dow Jones, the NAM sale. And on the other side of the ledger, the acquisition of REALTOR, the purchase of Harlequin, we are a rather different, more specialized company than we were a few years ago."

We are operating in a different difficult time, so this will be a rather different distant experience. Before the business of the day, I sincerely hope that all on this call, each of our investors, our business partners and their families are safe during this exacting era.
Every business and family is facing challenges, and our thoughts, in particular, are for those who are suffering under the curse of COVID-19 and have had to deal with complications from this dreaded disease. For our company, the safety of our employees has obviously been paramount. And many of our journalists have displayed much courage in recent months, including reporting from Wuhan, during the intense first phase of what has become a pandemic.
I would also like to honor Anthony Causi who passed at a relatively young age, by which time he had already become a legendary sports photographer for the New York Post.
As noted in our 8-K filing with the SEC last month, we expected a broad impact on our business from the pandemic's inevitable economic consequences. We were affected somewhat in Q3, and those effects will likely be significantly more pronounced in the fourth quarter. As we expect this impact to continue in the near term, significant cost reductions have been implemented across the company and additional steps will be taken in coming months. These cuts are designed to deal with the short-term exigencies and to reposition the company for long-term growth. There will obviously be an impact on executive compensation. 
For many senior executives, bonuses are the largest component of their cash compensation, and this will be reduced by at least 20%. The cuts will be led by our Executive Chairman, Rupert Murdoch, who is voluntarily foregoing his entire cash bonus for the current fiscal year. And as Chief Executive, I will forgo 75% of my annual cash bonus. In addition, our Board of Directors have decided to reduce their cash compensation.
These significant cost reductions of all kinds across the company will clearly have a positive impact on our total segment EBITDA and our cash position and help mitigate some of the effects of the pandemic. We obviously leave open the possibility of further compensation cuts next fiscal year depending on the ongoing impact of the crisis.
Turning now to the third quarter results for fiscal year 2020. Our revenues declined 8% to $2.3 billion, including a $78 million or 3% impact from adverse currency movements. Total segment EBITDA was down, although only 2% to $242 million.
It is worth highlighting that operationally, adjusting for currencies, acquisitions and disposals and other items, mentioned in our release, our adjusted revenues were down 4%, but our adjusted total segment EBITDA rose 1%. Reported results also include a $1.1 billion noncash write-down, mostly attributable to Foxtel.
At the News and Information Services segment, the sale of News America Marketing has formally closed. This is a significant step in terms of enhancing shareholder value and part of the continuing simplification of our company. A thorough reevaluation of our assets continues and a strategic review of our community and regional -- original newspapers in Australia is at an advanced stage. We are also reviewing ways to improve transparency in our segment disclosure, which will enable investors to better appreciate the inherent value in and the growth potential of Dow Jones, which we believe is the best business news and analysis brand in the world. We are working towards making that company's potential more obvious and to highlighting its various strengths, are certainly relative to other business brands and, for example, to the New York Times.
Speaking of demand for premium content. As you know, we have entered into valuable partnerships with Apple and Facebook for use of our world-class journalism. Clearly, there are harbingers of positive change with Google, where the CEO, Sundar Pichai has shown a more enlightened socially empathetic attitude to journalism. 
In the past, some in Silicon Valley sought to create a system of petty patronage through faux philanthropic handouts and sententious sops, seemingly designed to institutionalize a mendicant media. Enlightened executives at Google patently seek more meaningful changes to a dysfunctional ecosystem. The terms of trade in the digital world are certainly changing. The regulatory pressure is also intensifying as 2 weeks ago, the Australian government announced the introduction of a mandatory code that would require the larger digital companies to pay for content, and to adjust their algorithms to give additional weight to original news. It is absolutely crucial that more be understood about the character, the power and the potential manipulation of algorithms in data.
A recent Wall Street Journal report on Amazon's business practices showed the potential danger of companies having a dominant horizontal marketplace and selling their own products in segment verticals. In essence, exploiting proprietary marketplace data and competing with and potentially undermining their clients.
In the third quarter, News and Information Services improved in profitability for the second straight quarter with 15% growth in segment EBITDA. Dow Jones recorded a particularly strong performance as digital paid subscriptions rose 20% year-on-year to more than 2.5 million average daily subs at quarter end. The Wall Street Journal's digital paid subs were up 15% to more than 2 million, also a record.
In recent days, The Journal has shown further acceleration, with total subscriptions reaching approximately 3 million for the first time, including 2.2 million digital-only. Overall, at the end of April, digital subscriptions rose over 20% year-on-year.
Digital advertising at Dow Jones rose 25% year-over-year despite the challenges we faced with ad sales later in March. This is in strikingly marked contrast to the performance of the New York Times, where digital ad revenue actually declined 8%. I should repeat those figures for the purpose of clarity. Digital advertising rose 25% at Dow Jones, and it fell 8% at the New York Times. Dow Jones profit contribution improved and was a significant contributor to segment EBITDA growth, while EBITDA slumped 15% at the New York Times.
We announced earlier this week that the Head of the Barron's Group, Almar Latur, will replace Will Lewis, as CEO from the middle of this month. Will certainly leaves Dow Jones in fine fettle and with enormous capacity for future growth. 
Speaking of Barron's, subscriptions rose 14% year-over-year. And over the past 4 years, under Almar's leadership, the digital audience at Barron's Group Brands has quadrupled.
During the quarter, the Wall Street digital network broke records and hit 196 million unique users in March, up 155% versus the prior year. Traffic was particularly strong at MarketWatch in March, where users more than tripled to 90 million compared to the prior year. The professional information business reported a 5% increase in revenues with risk and compliance, once again demonstrating strength, rising 18% year-over-year.
Elsewhere in the segment, newspaper digital subscriptions at News Corp Australia were up 24% year-over-year, rising to more than 613,000 a quarter. And with 2/3 of subscriptions at The Australian now are digital-only. At News UK, The Sun reached 164 million global unique visitors in March, representing a 17% increase over December, according to Google Analytics. While at The Times and Sunday Times, digital subscriptions grew 21% year-over-year to 345,000, and now account for nearly 60% of the base.
Meanwhile, the New York Post's advertising revenues in the quarter rose 19% and the post digital network had 169 million average monthly unique visitors, according to Google Analytics, up from 107 million in Q2.
Turning now to Book Publishing. Revenue declines moderate at HarperCollins in the quarter compared to the first half, while segment EBITDA grew year-over-year despite very difficult comparisons. As more people have moved to work and study from home, we've seen a revival in e-book sales. We are particularly pleased with early sales for Joanna Gaines' Magnolia Table, Volume 2, which already sits atop the U.S. bestseller lists.
Digital real estate were showing solid progress through January and February, but began experiencing pandemic-related declines in March. Business at REA and realtor.com will depend on the reopening of the Australian and U.S. economies, but traffic to both sites remains encouraging. And realtor.com is outperforming the traffic trends of its house-flipping competitor, according to the March comScore data. 
In the Subscription Video Services segment, Kayo subscriptions rose to 444,000 in Q3, including trialist, which was more than double the prior year, and Kayo also showed strong growth over the prior quarter. That figure has obviously been adversely affected in recent weeks by the suspension of sports in Australia, as we disclosed in the earnings release.
We are in serious negotiations with the major sports over a fundamental reset of rights costs. Susan will discuss the possible accounting impacts shortly. 
In coming weeks, we plan to launch our entertainment streaming product and expect that there will be strong demand, given the power of our media portfolio's marketing platform and the nascent demand in Australia. We're also very excited by the multiyear deal with WarnerMedia announced this week. That means Foxtel will be the exclusive home in Australia for HBO, the soon to launch HBO Max and other WarnerMedia hits. 
Let me now turn to the lingering impact of COVID-19, which began to have an effect towards the third quarter's end, but clearly will be a major factor in our Q4 results, as we signaled in our 8-K filing last month. I would first like to commend our leaders and our employees around the globe as we rapidly and successfully moved approximately 90% of our workforce, around 25,000 people, into a work-from-at-home environment. Looking at the longer term, we have clear plans for addressing the immediate challenges we face and for emerging vigorously on the other side of this crisis. This will not be done by random cost-cutting but by strategic decisions about the business we need to fashion for a profitable future. That strategy is informed by a candid assessment of our capabilities and deficiencies and a clear sense that the business environment will be very different when the world finally returns to the new abnormal.
It is worth noting at this crucial time, that News Corp continues to have a strong balance sheet. As of March 31, we have $1.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents. And in addition, we have access to a $750 million corporate revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn. That bedrock of financial stability will help us weather the category-5 storm, as will the power of our brands and the energy and the creativity of our people. 
The headwinds will buffer the company in the short term, but I'm extremely positive about our prospects for delivering long-term growth and increasing shareholder value. 
Now for more particulars on our results in this quarter, I turn to Susan Panuccio."

Turning to the financials. Fiscal 2020 third quarter total revenues were approximately $2.3 billion, down 8% versus the prior year, and total segment EBITDA was $242 million, down 2% versus the prior year.
Currency headwinds negatively impacted revenues and total segment EBITDA by 3% and 6%, respectively. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and currency fluctuations and the other items disclosed in our release, revenues fell 4%, and total segment EBITDA increased 1%. 
For the quarter, we reported losses per share of $1.24 as compared to earnings per share of $0.02 in the prior year. The loss includes $1.1 billion of noncash impairment charges primarily related to a write-down of goodwill intangible assets of Foxtel and the reclassification of News America Marketing to assets held for sale.  Adjusted earnings per share were $0.03 in the quarter compared to $0.04 in the prior year. Before going into the quarterly detail, I will add to Robert's comments on the COVID-19 pandemic, which is expected to have a significant impact on near-term operating results. Immediate cost actions are underway. Variable costs have obviously been reduced with a heightened focus on the reduction of discretionary spend and nonessential CapEx, together with a thorough review of all headcount requirements. We are accelerating plans to reduce costs across the business in the medium term, particularly at our News and Information Services segment. These initiatives include, but are not limited to global shared services to centralize our back-office functions, a thorough review of our property and office footprints and reviewing our printing operations around the globe, whereby we have already announced the printing suspension of 60 community newspapers in Australia.
Finally, in relation to company-wide liquidity, it is important to note the only debt exposures we have are at our non-100%-owned subsidiaries, Foxtel and REA, and these are non recalls to News Corp. We are not anticipating any covenant issues at Foxtel over the next 12 months, and we have no plans to provide any additional shareholder funding. 
With that as a backdrop, I will now discuss the quarterly results for the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were over $1.1 billion, down 8% versus the prior year. On an adjusted basis, revenues declined 5%. Advertising revenues fell 14% with declines most notably at News America Marketing and in News Australia, while circulation and subscription revenue grew 1%. Currency negatively impacted segment revenues by 2%. Results were also impacted by $14 million from the outbreak of COVID-19.
Digital revenues for Dow Jones and the newspaper mastheads represented 42% of their combined revenues, up from 36% in the prior year. Segment EBITDA for the quarter was $75 million, up 15% from $65 million in the prior year, benefiting from increased contributions at Dow Jones, improvements at The New York Post and the absence of losses from Unruly, partially offset by lower contribution from NAM.
At Dow Jones, consumer circulation revenues grew a healthy 4%, reflecting a 20% growth in digital paid subscribers across Dow Jones' consumer products, including a 15% growth in digital-only paid subscribers at The Wall Street Journal. Total Wall Street Journal subscribers exceeded 2.8 million in the quarter, an 8% increase from the prior year, which is an acceleration from the second quarter's growth rate.
Professional Information Business revenues accounted for 29% of Dow Jones' revenues this quarter, growing 5% to $114 million, reflecting an 18% growth in Risk and Compliance revenues.
Advertising renews at Dow Jones fell 2% this quarter. But as Robert mentioned, we saw [indiscernible] a sharp acceleration in digital advertising revenues, posting 25% year-over-year growth. Digital advertising represented 47% of Dow Jones' advertising revenues. Overall, Dow Jones had revenue growth of 5% and another quarter of positive contribution to segment EBITDA growth.
Elsewhere, advertising revenues at News UK fell 10% on a reported basis and 8% in local currency, weaker than the past 2 quarters despite strength in digital. Trends at News Australia have remained very challenging, with advertising revenues down 20% on a reported basis and 30% down in local currency. Finally, at News America Marketing, revenues fell 16%. 
Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $462 million, down 14% versus $539 million in the prior year or down 7% in local currency. The revenue decline was primarily driven by lower broadcast subscribers. Broadcast subscriber trends were relatively similar to the prior quarter with COVID-19 restrictions in Australia coming into place in the last week of the quarter. Foxtel also faced lower advertising revenues, reflective of the overall TV marketplace. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $68 million, down 31% from the prior year, driven by the revenue decline, partially offset by renegotiated license fees and the timing of sports rights and the production costs due to COVID-19-related suspensions. Overall costs were down 11% on a reported basis.
Foxtel's closing paid subscriber base was approximately 2.93 million as of March 31, reflecting a 1% year-over-year growth driven by Kayo subscribers. Through quarter end, Kayo's total subscriber base, which, including trialists, increased 444,000, up from 199,000 last year. In fact, we reached over 470,000 total Kayo subscribers by March 22, the start of the Winter Sports season. However, subscribers have declined in recent weeks with the suspension of the NRL and AFL seasons as well as Rugby, motor sports and other international sporting codes, like the NBA. Kayo viewers remained highly engaged during the quarter, and we expect an uptick in subscribers that will clearly depend on the quality and quantity of NRL and AFL games once they have resumed. As of May 2, there were more than 272,000 paying Kayo subscribers. 
We have been beta testing Foxtel's new drama and entertainment streaming service, and we expect to launch commercially in the coming weeks, and we're very pleased to announce the WarnerMedia deal to support the launch. 
In the third quarter, broadcast churn improved for the first time in almost 2 years to 17.5%, which was 20 basis points lower versus the prior year. Broadcast ARPU remained relatively stable at AUD 79. 
At Book Publishing, HarperCollins had a strong quarter with revenues down 2% to $412 million and segment EBITDA up 4% to $55 million, despite a very tough comparison against the prior year, which had segment EBITDA growth of 29%. We saw improvement performance in General Books, children's and in the U.K. Digital sales grew 3% year-over-year to 23% of consumer revenue, which included improvements in downloadable audio books. 
At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues decreased 4% to $261 million due to the negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. On an adjusted basis, revenues were flat. Segment EBITDA rose 1% to $74 million or 9% on an adjusted basis. REA Group revenues fell 5%. However, without the $12 million foreign currency impact, REA grew modestly in local currency. This is an improvement from the first half performance benefiting from renewed growth in financial services. Australian listing volume declines moderated to down 7%, which reflects mid single-digit growth in metro Melbourne and Sydney. REA also saw strong traffic metrics achieving record levels in visits and audience during the quarter. 
However, COVID-19-related government policies and restrictions, including bans on open-home inspections and in-person auctions have led to reduced listing volumes in recent weeks. In response to the impacts from the pandemic, REA has implemented a number of relief packages to support its customers, including short-term pricing concessions and changes to listing products to provide greater flexibility for customers. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call immediately following this call for more details. 
Move revenues declined 2% to $118 million, with real estate revenues relatively flat. Traffic remained strong with unique users in the quarter, up 6% to $68 million. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Move was on a solid growth trajectory in January and February, with improved growth in traffic and leads and was on pace to deliver strong second half revenue. However, by mid-March, seller to REA and other digital real estate portals, both trends reversed.
In response to the pandemic, REALTOR instituted billing relief initiative in late March for its customers, which was subsequently extended into May with some modification to the offer. The initiative, together with other COVID-19-related impacts reduced third quarter revenues by an estimated $6 million.
I would now like to talk about some of the themes in the upcoming quarter. Forecasting has been challenging, so I will discuss what we have seen in April and frame the relevant risks. At News and Information Services, we expect advertising and single-copy sale revenues in the segment to be adversely affected as a result of widespread business closures and social distancing measures. For a framework, advertising revenues, excluding News America Marketing, represented approximately 34% of segment revenues in the third quarter. In April, advertising revenues at Dow Jones was down more than 20% with digital down modestly. Advertising revenues at Australia and the U.K. were down more than 45% on a reported basis or around 40% in local currency. 
As I mentioned earlier, we are taking aggressive cost action to mitigate these revenue declines within the segment. At the same time, we have also continued to see strong growth in digital subscribers across the key properties in April, including over 20% year-on-year growth in digital-only subscribers of The Wall Street Journal. In the third quarter, approximately 75% of Dow Jones' revenues were subscription-based, providing much more visibility and stability. Digital revenues accounted for 68% of Dow Jones revenues and digital paid subscribers accounted for 73% of The Wall Street General subscriber base. 
In Subscription Video Services, we anticipate an increase in broadcast churn with the suspension of the NRL and AFL seasons. For April, broadcast churn has been fairly stable, although we have seen lower sports tier and Kayo subscribers, as you would expect. Closures of pubs and clubs and lower occupancy at hotels throughout Australia are also expected to adversely impact commercial subscription revenues, together with a downturn in advertising revenue.
The team at Foxtel has implemented several initiatives, including opening up additional entertainment content to all subscribers and providing Foxtel broadband customers with unlimited data allowances for streaming. As for sports rights accounting, Foxtel amortizes event-based sports like Formula 1, which have no dedicated channels upon the occurrence of the events. Consequently, the third quarter included about USD 9 million of costs that were deferred due to events canceled or postponed. Channel-based sports rights, such as the AFL, NRL and domestic cricket are expensed on a straight-line basis over the year. The third quarter included a full amount of rights fees for all 3 of those sports. In the event that the NRL and AFL do not resume this season in the fourth quarter, we would plan to defer those costs until the sports resume. All the sports-based contracts have different terms and conditions, and we are currently in discussions with the leagues around the best way to move forward and to value the season that remains. 
As a framework, the quarterly cost between the AFL and NRL prior to the suspensions were AUD 95 million or approximately USD 60 million. In addition, we also expect an approximately $10 million impact from the accelerated entertainment amortization in the fourth quarter. 
In Book Publishing, as the retail market adjusted to stay-at-home restrictions by closing a number of bricks-and-mortar stores, HarperCollins saw strong growth in online sales with e-books returning to growth. Our release slate is largely intact, and as Robert mentioned, one of our top books for the year, Joanna Gaines' Magnolia Table, Volume 2, is selling very well.
At Digital Real Estate Services, as noted in their release, REA anticipates a challenging listing environment given the government social distancing measures, with April new buy listings falling 33%. REALTOR is facing lower real estate transactions, but encouragingly, lead volume and unique users have shown improvements in recent weeks. Both companies have taken proactive relief measures to extend credit to their respective customers with discounts or other similar measures, which will have an adverse impact on revenues. 
CapEx for the year is expected to come down significantly to around $435 million compared to $572 million last year, which includes a 35% to 40% decline at Foxtel, an update on our initial guidance of approximately 20% year-on-year reduction. 
Finally, a word about our tax rate. From a P&L perspective, we expect an unusually high tax rate for the full year due to certain operating losses in foreign jurisdictions that we are unable to take deductions against. This is a P&L impact, not a cash impact. 
As I mentioned, these are unique times, but we believe with our strong liquidity position, market-leading brands, our emphasis on digital transformation as well as a more aggressive focus on cost measures, News Corp is well positioned to weather the current crisis. 
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

It sounded like in April, it softened a little bit, but it still seems like it's coming in probably better than what we're seeing in the industry and I'm wondering if it was specific to certain verticals that continue to be strength in your product mix. And then just a follow-up on the makeup of the strong growth in digital subscribers also at The Journal. Is it international, domestic? Anything different, maybe younger?

Look, in terms of who the subscribers are, obviously, we have had strong growth in U.S. subscriptions. And I think the thing to remember about Wall Street Journal subscriptions, is it -- once you have a subscriber, you also have an opportunity to upsell. And so we're particularly seeing growth, for example, in subscriptions coming from MarketWatch to The Journal and from MarketWatch to Barron's and as well as that from The Journal to Barron's. And then for the more specialist Wall Street Journal subscribers, there's an opportunity to sell them -- to upsell them to our premium business products, which obviously have a higher yield. 
In terms of advertising, clearly, traffic has been particularly strong. There had been, as you may well be aware, some concerns early in the COVID crisis about blocking of ads related to COVID crisis coverage. Gradually, that problem has diminished. And so we are noticing that the amount of advertising we're getting is matching, not quite, but to some extent, the significant increases in traffic we've had across The Wall Street Journal and MarketWatch. We noticed that tech advertising has increased. Custom advertising is also on the rise. And to a certain extent, programmatic. But I think for our business, quite frankly, it's an extraordinary opportunity because big clients are coming straight to The Wall Street Journal and to our other publishing houses around the world. 
And they want to deal directly with us rather than necessarily through an advertising agency. And while this is, at the moment, a short-term phenomenon, there are indications that this may very well become a long-term trend."

And you can tell from the tenor of our content -- comments about Australia that there is obviously a strategic review of our print holdings well underway. So our simplification process is far from finished. And part of that is that we're very keen to highlight the value inherent in, for example, Dow Jones, which we reported vastly superior numbers to those of the New York Times, but whose figures are not fully obvious in the current News and Information Services segment.
Now if you think of the journey in recent years, the sale of Amplify, the early sale of the local media group at Dow Jones, the NAM sale. And on the other side of the ledger, the acquisition of REALTOR, the purchase of Harlequin, we are a rather different, more specialized company than we were a few years ago."

We are operating in a different difficult time, so this will be a rather different distant experience. Before the business of the day, I sincerely hope that all on this call, each of our investors, our business partners and their families are safe during this exacting era.
 
Every business and family is facing challenges, and our thoughts, in particular, are for those who are suffering under the curse of COVID-19 and have had to deal with complications from this dreaded disease. For our company, the safety of our employees has obviously been paramount. And many of our journalists have displayed much courage in recent months, including reporting from Wuhan, during the intense first phase of what has become a pandemic.
 
I would also like to honor Anthony Causi who passed at a relatively young age, by which time he had already become a legendary sports photographer for the New York Post.
 
As noted in our 8-K filing with the SEC last month, we expected a broad impact on our business from the pandemic's inevitable economic consequences. We were affected somewhat in Q3, and those effects will likely be significantly more pronounced in the fourth quarter. As we expect this impact to continue in the near term, significant cost reductions have been implemented across the company and additional steps will be taken in coming months. These cuts are designed to deal with the short-term exigencies and to reposition the company for long-term growth. There will obviously be an impact on executive compensation. 
 
For many senior executives, bonuses are the largest component of their cash compensation, and this will be reduced by at least 20%. The cuts will be led by our Executive Chairman, Rupert Murdoch, who is voluntarily foregoing his entire cash bonus for the current fiscal year. And as Chief Executive, I will forgo 75% of my annual cash bonus. In addition, our Board of Directors have decided to reduce their cash compensation.
 
These significant cost reductions of all kinds across the company will clearly have a positive impact on our total segment EBITDA and our cash position and help mitigate some of the effects of the pandemic. We obviously leave open the possibility of further compensation cuts next fiscal year depending on the ongoing impact of the crisis.
 
Turning now to the third quarter results for fiscal year 2020. Our revenues declined 8% to $2.3 billion, including a $78 million or 3% impact from adverse currency movements. Total segment EBITDA was down, although only 2% to $242 million.
 
It is worth highlighting that operationally, adjusting for currencies, acquisitions and disposals and other items, mentioned in our release, our adjusted revenues were down 4%, but our adjusted total segment EBITDA rose 1%. Reported results also include a $1.1 billion noncash write-down, mostly attributable to Foxtel.
 
At the News and Information Services segment, the sale of News America Marketing has formally closed. This is a significant step in terms of enhancing shareholder value and part of the continuing simplification of our company. A thorough reevaluation of our assets continues and a strategic review of our community and regional -- original newspapers in Australia is at an advanced stage. We are also reviewing ways to improve transparency in our segment disclosure, which will enable investors to better appreciate the inherent value in and the growth potential of Dow Jones, which we believe is the best business news and analysis brand in the world. We are working towards making that company's potential more obvious and to highlighting its various strengths, are certainly relative to other business brands and, for example, to the New York Times.
 
Speaking of demand for premium content. As you know, we have entered into valuable partnerships with Apple and Facebook for use of our world-class journalism. Clearly, there are harbingers of positive change with Google, where the CEO, Sundar Pichai has shown a more enlightened socially empathetic attitude to journalism. 
 
In the past, some in Silicon Valley sought to create a system of petty patronage through faux philanthropic handouts and sententious sops, seemingly designed to institutionalize a mendicant media. Enlightened executives at Google patently seek more meaningful changes to a dysfunctional ecosystem. The terms of trade in the digital world are certainly changing. The regulatory pressure is also intensifying as 2 weeks ago, the Australian government announced the introduction of a mandatory code that would require the larger digital companies to pay for content, and to adjust their algorithms to give additional weight to original news. It is absolutely crucial that more be understood about the character, the power and the potential manipulation of algorithms in data.
 
A recent Wall Street Journal report on Amazon's business practices showed the potential danger of companies having a dominant horizontal marketplace and selling their own products in segment verticals. In essence, exploiting proprietary marketplace data and competing with and potentially undermining their clients.
 
In the third quarter, News and Information Services improved in profitability for the second straight quarter with 15% growth in segment EBITDA. Dow Jones recorded a particularly strong performance as digital paid subscriptions rose 20% year-on-year to more than 2.5 million average daily subs at quarter end. The Wall Street Journal's digital paid subs were up 15% to more than 2 million, also a record.
 
In recent days, The Journal has shown further acceleration, with total subscriptions reaching approximately 3 million for the first time, including 2.2 million digital-only. Overall, at the end of April, digital subscriptions rose over 20% year-on-year.
 
Digital advertising at Dow Jones rose 25% year-over-year despite the challenges we faced with ad sales later in March. This is in strikingly marked contrast to the performance of the New York Times, where digital ad revenue actually declined 8%. I should repeat those figures for the purpose of clarity. Digital advertising rose 25% at Dow Jones, and it fell 8% at the New York Times. Dow Jones profit contribution improved and was a significant contributor to segment EBITDA growth, while EBITDA slumped 15% at the New York Times.
 
We announced earlier this week that the Head of the Barron's Group, Almar Latur, will replace Will Lewis, as CEO from the middle of this month. Will certainly leaves Dow Jones in fine fettle and with enormous capacity for future growth. 
 
Speaking of Barron's, subscriptions rose 14% year-over-year. And over the past 4 years, under Almar's leadership, the digital audience at Barron's Group Brands has quadrupled.
 
During the quarter, the Wall Street digital network broke records and hit 196 million unique users in March, up 155% versus the prior year. Traffic was particularly strong at MarketWatch in March, where users more than tripled to 90 million compared to the prior year. The professional information business reported a 5% increase in revenues with risk and compliance, once again demonstrating strength, rising 18% year-over-year.
 
Elsewhere in the segment, newspaper digital subscriptions at News Corp Australia were up 24% year-over-year, rising to more than 613,000 a quarter. And with 2/3 of subscriptions at The Australian now are digital-only. At News UK, The Sun reached 164 million global unique visitors in March, representing a 17% increase over December, according to Google Analytics. While at The Times and Sunday Times, digital subscriptions grew 21% year-over-year to 345,000, and now account for nearly 60% of the base.
 
Meanwhile, the New York Post's advertising revenues in the quarter rose 19% and the post digital network had 169 million average monthly unique visitors, according to Google Analytics, up from 107 million in Q2.
 
Turning now to Book Publishing. Revenue declines moderate at HarperCollins in the quarter compared to the first half, while segment EBITDA grew year-over-year despite very difficult comparisons. As more people have moved to work and study from home, we've seen a revival in e-book sales. We are particularly pleased with early sales for Joanna Gaines' Magnolia Table, Volume 2, which already sits atop the U.S. bestseller lists.
 
Digital real estate were showing solid progress through January and February, but began experiencing pandemic-related declines in March. Business at REA and realtor.com will depend on the reopening of the Australian and U.S. economies, but traffic to both sites remains encouraging. And realtor.com is outperforming the traffic trends of its house-flipping competitor, according to the March comScore data. 
 
In the Subscription Video Services segment, Kayo subscriptions rose to 444,000 in Q3, including trialist, which was more than double the prior year, and Kayo also showed strong growth over the prior quarter. That figure has obviously been adversely affected in recent weeks by the suspension of sports in Australia, as we disclosed in the earnings release.
 
We are in serious negotiations with the major sports over a fundamental reset of rights costs. Susan will discuss the possible accounting impacts shortly. 
 
In coming weeks, we plan to launch our entertainment streaming product and expect that there will be strong demand, given the power of our media portfolio's marketing platform and the nascent demand in Australia. We're also very excited by the multiyear deal with WarnerMedia announced this week. That means Foxtel will be the exclusive home in Australia for HBO, the soon to launch HBO Max and other WarnerMedia hits. 
 
Let me now turn to the lingering impact of COVID-19, which began to have an effect towards the third quarter's end, but clearly will be a major factor in our Q4 results, as we signaled in our 8-K filing last month. I would first like to commend our leaders and our employees around the globe as we rapidly and successfully moved approximately 90% of our workforce, around 25,000 people, into a work-from-at-home environment. Looking at the longer term, we have clear plans for addressing the immediate challenges we face and for emerging vigorously on the other side of this crisis. This will not be done by random cost-cutting but by strategic decisions about the business we need to fashion for a profitable future. That strategy is informed by a candid assessment of our capabilities and deficiencies and a clear sense that the business environment will be very different when the world finally returns to the new abnormal.
 
It is worth noting at this crucial time, that News Corp continues to have a strong balance sheet. As of March 31, we have $1.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents. And in addition, we have access to a $750 million corporate revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn. That bedrock of financial stability will help us weather the category-5 storm, as will the power of our brands and the energy and the creativity of our people. 
 
The headwinds will buffer the company in the short term, but I'm extremely positive about our prospects for delivering long-term growth and increasing shareholder value. 
 
Now for more particulars on our results in this quarter, I turn to Susan Panuccio."

On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and currency fluctuations and the other items disclosed in our release, revenues fell 4%, and total segment EBITDA increased 1%. 
 
For the quarter, we reported losses per share of $1.24 as compared to earnings per share of $0.02 in the prior year. The loss includes $1.1 billion of noncash impairment charges primarily related to a write-down of goodwill intangible assets of Foxtel and the reclassification of News America Marketing to assets held for sale.  Adjusted earnings per share were $0.03 in the quarter compared to $0.04 in the prior year. Before going into the quarterly detail, I will add to Robert's comments on the COVID-19 pandemic, which is expected to have a significant impact on near-term operating results. Immediate cost actions are underway. Variable costs have obviously been reduced with a heightened focus on the reduction of discretionary spend and nonessential CapEx, together with a thorough review of all head count requirements. We are accelerating plans to reduce costs across the business in the medium term, particularly at our News and Information Services segment. These initiatives include, but are not limited to global shared services to centralize our back-office functions, a thorough review of our property and office footprints and reviewing our printing operations around the globe, whereby we have already announced the printing suspension of 60 community newspapers in Australia.
 
Finally, in relation to company-wide liquidity, it is important to note the only debt exposures we have are at our non-100%-owned subsidiaries, Foxtel and REA, and these are non-recalls to News Corp. We are not anticipating any covenant issues at Foxtel over the next 12 months, and we have no plans to provide any additional shareholder funding. 
 
With that as a backdrop, I will now discuss the quarterly results for the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were over $1.1 billion, down 8% versus the prior year. On an adjusted basis, revenues declined 5%. Advertising revenues fell 14% with declines most notably at News America Marketing and in News Australia, while circulation and subscription revenue grew 1%. Currency negatively impacted segment revenues by 2%. Results were also impacted by $14 million from the outbreak of COVID-19.
 
Digital revenues for Dow Jones and the newspaper mastheads represented 42% of their combined revenues, up from 36% in the prior year. Segment EBITDA for the quarter was $75 million, up 15% from $65 million in the prior year, benefiting from increased contributions at Dow Jones, improvements at The New York Post and the absence of losses from Unruly, partially offset by lower contribution from NAM.
 
At Dow Jones, consumer circulation revenues grew a healthy 4%, reflecting a 20% growth in digital paid subscribers across Dow Jones' consumer products, including a 15% growth in digital-only paid subscribers at The Wall Street Journal. Total Wall Street Journal subscribers exceeded 2.8 million in the quarter, an 8% increase from the prior year, which is an acceleration from the second quarter's growth rate.
 
Professional Information Business revenues accounted for 29% of Dow Jones' revenues this quarter, growing 5% to $114 million, reflecting an 18% growth in Risk and Compliance revenues.
 
Advertising revenues at Dow Jones fell 2% this quarter. But as Robert mentioned, we saw a sharp acceleration in digital advertising revenues, posting 25% year-over-year growth. Digital advertising represented 47% of Dow Jones' advertising revenues. Overall, Dow Jones had revenue growth of 5% and another quarter of positive contribution to segment EBITDA growth.
 
Elsewhere, advertising revenues at News UK fell 10% on a reported basis and 8% in local currency, weaker than the past 2 quarters despite strength in digital. Trends at News Australia have remained very challenging, with advertising revenues down 20% on a reported basis and 30% down in local currency. Finally, at News America Marketing, revenues fell 16%. 
 
Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $462 million, down 14% versus $539 million in the prior year or down 7% in local currency. The revenue decline was primarily driven by lower broadcast subscribers. Broadcast subscriber trends were relatively similar to the prior quarter with COVID-19 restrictions in Australia coming into place in the last week of the quarter. Foxtel also faced lower advertising revenues, reflective of the overall TV marketplace. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $68 million, down 31% from the prior year, driven by the revenue decline, partially offset by renegotiated license fees and the timing of sports rights and the production costs due to COVID-19-related suspensions. Overall costs were down 11% on a reported basis.
 
Foxtel's closing paid subscriber base was approximately 2.93 million as of March 31, reflecting a 1% year-over-year growth driven by Kayo subscribers. Through quarter end, Kayo's total subscriber base, which, including trialists, increased 444,000, up from 199,000 last year. In fact, we reached over 470,000 total Kayo subscribers by March 22, the start of the Winter Sports season. However, subscribers have declined in recent weeks with the suspension of the NRL and AFL seasons as well as Rugby, motor sports and other international sporting codes, like the NBA. Kayo viewers remained highly engaged during the quarter, and we expect an uptick in subscribers that will clearly depend on the quality and quantity of NRL and AFL games once they have resumed. As of May 2, there were more than 272,000 paying Kayo subscribers. 
 
We have been beta testing Foxtel's new drama and entertainment streaming service, and we expect to launch commercially in the coming weeks, and we're very pleased to announce the WarnerMedia deal to support the launch. 
 
In the third quarter, broadcast churn improved for the first time in almost 2 years to 17.5%, which was 20 basis points lower versus the prior year. Broadcast ARPU remained relatively stable at AUD 79. 
 
At Book Publishing, HarperCollins had a strong quarter with revenues down 2% to $412 million and segment EBITDA up 4% to $55 million, despite a very tough comparison against the prior year, which had segment EBITDA growth of 29%. We saw improvement performance in General Books, children's and in the U.K. Digital sales grew 3% year-over-year to 23% of consumer revenue, which included improvements in downloadable audio books. 
 
At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues decreased 4% to $261 million due to the negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. On an adjusted basis, revenues were flat. Segment EBITDA rose 1% to $74 million or 9% on an adjusted basis. REA Group revenues fell 5%. However, without the $12 million foreign currency impact, REA grew modestly in local currency. This is an improvement from the first half performance benefiting from renewed growth in financial services. Australian listing volume declines moderated to down 7%, which reflects mid single-digit growth in metro Melbourne and Sydney. REA also saw strong traffic metrics achieving record levels in visits and audience during the quarter. 
 
However, COVID-19-related government policies and restrictions, including bans on open-home inspections and in-person auctions have led to reduced listing volumes in recent weeks. In response to the impacts from the pandemic, REA has implemented a number of relief packages to support its customers, including short-term pricing concessions and changes to listing products to provide greater flexibility for customers. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call immediately following this call for more details. 
 
Move revenues declined 2% to $118 million, with real estate revenues relatively flat. Traffic remained strong with unique users in the quarter, up 6% to $68 million. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Move was on a solid growth trajectory in January and February, with improved growth in traffic and leads and was on pace to deliver strong second half revenue. However, by mid-March, seller to REA and other digital real estate portals, both trends reversed.
 
In response to the pandemic, REALTOR instituted billing relief initiative in late March for its customers, which was subsequently extended into May with some modification to the offer. The initiative, together with other COVID-19-related impacts reduced third quarter revenues by an estimated $6 million.
 
I would now like to talk about some of the themes in the upcoming quarter. Forecasting has been challenging, so I will discuss what we have seen in April and frame the relevant risks. At News and Information Services, we expect advertising and single-copy sale revenues in the segment to be adversely affected as a result of widespread business closures and social distancing measures. For a framework, advertising revenues, excluding News America Marketing, represented approximately 34% of segment revenues in the third quarter. In April, advertising revenues at Dow Jones was down more than 20% with digital down modestly. Advertising revenues at Australia and the U.K. were down more than 45% on a reported basis or around 40% in local currency. 
 
As I mentioned earlier, we are taking aggressive cost action to mitigate these revenue declines within the segment. At the same time, we have also continued to see strong growth in digital subscribers across the key properties in April, including over 20% year-on-year growth in digital-only subscribers of The Wall Street Journal. In the third quarter, approximately 75% of Dow Jones' revenues were subscription-based, providing much more visibility and stability. Digital revenues accounted for 68% of Dow Jones revenues and digital paid subscribers accounted for 73% of The Wall Street General subscriber base. 
 
In Subscription Video Services, we anticipate an increase in broadcast churn with the suspension of the NRL and AFL seasons. For April, broadcast churn has been fairly stable, although we have seen lower sports tier and Kayo subscribers, as you would expect. Closures of pubs and clubs and lower occupancy at hotels throughout Australia are also expected to adversely impact commercial subscription revenues, together with a downturn in advertising revenue.
 
The team at Foxtel has implemented several initiatives, including opening up additional entertainment content to all subscribers and providing Foxtel broadband customers with unlimited data allowances for streaming. As for sports rights accounting, Foxtel amortizes event-based sports like Formula 1, which have no dedicated channels upon the occurrence of the events. Consequently, the third quarter included about USD 9 million of costs that were deferred due to events canceled or postponed. Channel-based sports rights, such as the AFL, NRL and domestic cricket are expensed on a straight-line basis over the year. The third quarter included a full amount of rights fees for all 3 of those sports. In the event that the NRL and AFL do not resume this season in the fourth quarter, we would plan to defer those costs until the sports resume. All the sports-based contracts have different terms and conditions, and we are currently in discussions with the leagues around the best way to move forward and to value the season that remains. 
 
As a framework, the quarterly cost between the AFL and NRL prior to the suspensions were AUD 95 million or approximately USD 60 million. In addition, we also expect an approximately $10 million impact from the accelerated entertainment amortization in the fourth quarter. 
 
In Book Publishing, as the retail market adjusted to stay-at-home restrictions by closing a number of bricks-and-mortar stores, HarperCollins saw strong growth in online sales with e-books returning to growth. Our release slate is largely intact, and as Robert mentioned, one of our top books for the year, Joanna Gaines' Magnolia Table, Volume 2, is selling very well.
 
At Digital Real Estate Services, as noted in their release, REA anticipates a challenging listing environment given the government social distancing measures, with April new buy listings falling 33%. REALTOR is facing lower real estate transactions, but encouragingly, lead volume and unique users have shown improvements in recent weeks. Both companies have taken proactive relief measures to extend credit to their respective customers with discounts or other similar measures, which will have an adverse impact on revenues. 
 
CapEx for the year is expected to come down significantly to around $435 million compared to $572 million last year, which includes a 35% to 40% decline at Foxtel, an update on our initial guidance of approximately 20% year-on-year reduction. 
 
Finally, a word about our tax rate. From a P&L perspective, we expect an unusually high tax rate for the full year due to certain operating losses in foreign jurisdictions that we are unable to take deductions against. This is a P&L impact, not a cash impact. 
 
As I mentioned, these are unique times, but we believe with our strong liquidity position, market-leading brands, our emphasis on digital transformation as well as a more aggressive focus on cost measures, News Corp is well positioned to weather the current crisis. 
 
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

Look, in terms of who the subscribers are, obviously, we have had strong growth in U.S. subscriptions. And I think the thing to remember about Wall Street Journal subscriptions, is it -- once you have a subscriber, you also have an opportunity to upsell. And so we're particularly seeing growth, for example, in subscriptions coming from MarketWatch to The Journal and from MarketWatch to Barron's and as well as that from The Journal to Barron's. And then for the more specialist Wall Street Journal subscribers, there's an opportunity to sell them -- to upsell them to our premium business products, which obviously have a higher yield. 
 
In terms of advertising, clearly, traffic has been particularly strong. There had been, as you may well be aware, some concerns early in the COVID crisis about blocking of ads related to COVID crisis coverage. Gradually, that problem has diminished. And so we are noticing that the amount of advertising we're getting is matching, not quite, but to some extent, the significant increases in traffic we've had across The Wall Street Journal and MarketWatch. We noticed that tech advertising has increased. Custom advertising is also on the rise. And to a certain extent, programmatic. But I think for our business, quite frankly, it's an extraordinary opportunity because big clients are coming straight to The Wall Street Journal and to our other publishing houses around the world. 
 
And they want to deal directly with us rather than necessarily through an advertising agency. And while this is, at the moment, a short-term phenomenon, there are indications that this may very well become a long-term trend."

We issued our earnings press release about an hour ago, and it's now posted on our website at newscorp.com. 
On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We'll open with some prepared remarks, and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community. 
This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information. 
Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in our earnings release.

Let me say initially that I trust all on the call and your families are faring well. These are certainly complex times, and there are a few who have not been touched in some manner.

These are certainly complex times, and there are a few who have not been touched in some manner. The coronavirus has irrevocably changed businesses and our businesses in expediting pre-existing digital trends, in challenging established practices and in prompting necessary introspection about work habits and the workplace itself. There has been much agility and adaptation at News Corp the vast majority of our employees across the world have been working at home, and the resilience of the company's culture has been a core component in continuity. Without doubt, digitization has accelerated. And without doubt, all of our businesses have been affected and responded with customary ingenuity. I would like to express my sincere thanks to each of our employees and their families for having responded so promptly, so intelligently and so thoughtfully to these testing circumstances. 
Evidence of that response was seen in the fourth quarter, when virtually all of our businesses prudently reduce costs, sometimes painfully to ensure that they were robust enough to cope with volatility and disruption. Preserving cash was a priority, and it is worth noting that our cash balance increased in the last quarter by $129 million to over $1.5 billion as of June 30. Revenue comparisons are obviously made complex by the sale of News America Marketing and Unruly, plus the consequences of COVID. But our adjusted revenue for the quarter declined by 13%. Obviously, the net income and EPS were affected by noncash impairments, primarily at our U.K. and Australian businesses. And Susan will be able to provide more details momentarily. However, our adjusted total segment EBITDA declined by a modest 10%. 
This is particularly significant and somewhat historic earnings call. Regular listeners will recall that we had pledged to simplify the company and make the results more transparent. The sale of News America Marketing and Unruly certainly simplified the structure. And in the quest for transparency, beginning this quarter, we are presenting Dow Jones as a separate segment. This will highlight what we believe are 2 incontrovertible facts: the substantial and growing value of that company and its superior profit profile and prospects to those in the New York times. In what has been a difficult year for many media companies, Dow Jones reported a 13% increase in segment EBITDA based on the strength of its professional information business and the preeminence of the Wall Street Journal. Our other global mastheads and digital information properties are gathered in the News Media segment, which will include our Australian titles, many of which are now digital-only: The Times, The Sun and Sunday Times as well as Talksport and Virgin Radio. It may be called News Media, but obviously, the segment is increasingly digital in personality, and virtually all of our mastheads had record audiences during the year. Our journalists have performed admirably in providing crucial insights to readers during the COVID crisis, delivering accurate information and analysis and providing an antidote to conspiracy theories and noxious nonsense proliferating elsewhere on the web. 
We are continuing to focus on acquiring digital subscribers and audience while rightsizing our businesses to be digital-first, which is necessarily resulting in significant cost reductions. The closure in Australia of many of our storied print editions and the emphasis on digital was further evidence of our willingness to be decisive at a epochal moment. We are very proud of our traditions, and we will always invest in the very best journalism. But the format is less important than the function. And we firmly believe that the digital reincarnation of these titles will ensure a profitable future and a continuing role in their community. We are also constantly restlessly reviewing our portfolio with a view to ensuring that we have the optimum asset mix. All of our executives understand that these are testing times and many of our executives around our businesses internationally have volunteered hefty cuts to their bonuses, which form a large part of their compensation. The Executive Chairman has forsaken 100% of his bonus, and Susan Panuccio and David Pitofsky, our General Counsel, who are with me on this call have also voluntarily given up a meaningful chunk of their bonus. All understand the importance of a stringent cost strategy, so we have launched a genuinely meaningful shared service program that we believe will transform the company by centralizing many of our functions. The mission is being led by 2 of our most talented executives, Damian Hills from Australia and Jane Viner from the U.K., in tandem with our CTO, the Global Head of HR, and CFO, in other words, Susan. The early indications are that the shared service program should be able to appreciably reduce our costs and we expect it to have a materially positive impact on our bottom line. 
We will always emphasize integrity and creativity, but our ability to prioritize imperative projects will be enhanced by the program. We expect our technology platforms to be the best-in-class at the lowest available price. And the overall level of cooperation coordination among our businesses will certainly be enhanced. This is not an ephemeral project, but one that we believe will have a fundamental impact on the way we do business and on our earnings. 
One other trend is already having an appreciable impact on our earnings, the change in terms of trade with the digital platforms. Those of you who watched the congressional testimony last week by the tech titans would have noticed overall that the political understanding of the issues has vastly improved. There is also true in Brussels, London and Australia, where the ACCC has just introduced a draft mandatory code of contact. I recommend that anyone seeking enlightenment, Google the name Rod Sims and read a few of his recent interviews. Mr. Sims chairs the ACCC. 
It is fair to say, without revealing details that we are deep in discussion with these companies and that the ecosystem has absolutely begun to evolve. For this call, which has been pursuing this issue for well over a decade, this favorable and profitability was up 13%, as I've mentioned. At $236 million, Dow Jones full segment -- full year segment EBITDA was the highest in separation, as were margins. Digital revenue surpassed $1 billion in fiscal '20 for the first time and represented 66% of total revenues, rising to 70% for the fourth quarter. We saw strong circulation volume growth, with digital-only subscriptions increasing 23% year-over-year for the Wall Street Journal in Q4 and 51% for the Barron's Group. MarketWatch, our finance website reported the highest annual revenue numbers in the brand's history, making the third year in a row of record-breaking results. Equally impressive, unique users more than doubled to $62 million in the month of June. 
In contrast to most COVID affected media sites, digital advertising was down only 7% in the quarter and the general shift towards digital as a source of revenue continues, with that segment representing 54% of advertising revenues in the quarter. We expect that digital will continue to outpace print, given we are seeing robust digital advertising despite the social and commercial volatility that has prompted many companies to be cautious in marketing spend. Even with the pandemic impact, digital advertising at Dow Jones was 4% higher for the year. 
Full year revenues for the professional information business rose 7% year-over-year, driven by risk and compliance, which surged 20%. We remain particularly excited by the prospects for our risk and compliance business, given the intensification of regulatory scrutiny around the world. As we have noted on this call in the past, who among you does not want to minimize risk and maximize compliance? We are expanding our risk-related product lines, enhancing our software and ensuring that the increased flow of actionable intelligence is complemented by thoughtful analysis and compelling news feeds for our growing audience of clients. We contend that the all digital risk and compliance business is a highly undervalued part of a highly undervalued company, given the revenue trajectory, the still expanding market and the necessity for companies and the individuals to have an audit trial of compliance. 
The creation of the Dow Jones segment allows us to make a direct comparison with The New York Times, and on most important measures, the Wall Street Journal and the Board of Dow Jones performed far better. The Journal is both the most trusted general newspaper in the U.S. according to Reuters Institute and the world's leading business use provider. And a vast, well-healed, well-informed audience provides an opportunity to upsell value-added lucrative business products to serve a specialist need. 
Here are a few metrics comparing the 2 companies for the quarter. Dow Jones segment EBITDA of $60 million was higher than in New York Times, having benefited from the stability of our vibrant professional information business. While Dow Jones segment EBITDA expanded by 13% year-over-year, New York Times declined by 6%. Dow Jones EBITDA margins were 15.7%, about 3 percentage points higher than the New York Times. In this time of COVID, Dow Jones revenue decline moderated at a higher rate than the New York times at 4% versus down over 7% for The Times. Dow Jones COVID-affected advertising revenue declined at a much lower rate than The Times, thanks largely to significant outperformance in digital advertising which was down just 7% at Dow Jones versus down 32% at The New York Times. In fact, Dow Jones generated more total ad dollars than The New York Times. 
We feel strongly that we should explain the virtues of Dow Jones to shareholders and potential shareholders so we will have an Investor Day in mid-September at which Dow Jones Chief Executive, Almar Lotour, and other Dow Jones Executive and myself, will give you a more granular explanation of the company's extraordinary potential and an opportunity for you to interrogate. 
The News Media segment, of course, had a challenging year, and we took prompt measures to confront those challenges. These included the aforementioned sales of NAM and Unruly as well as immediate cost reductions and the launch of strategic shared service project. In Australia, apart from migrating publications to digital only, we also sold our investment in the Australian associated press newswire and unfortunately, implemented hundreds of redundancies. The end of the relationship with AAP was both necessary and historic as the service was founded in 1935 by Sir Keith Murdoch. 
Digital subscriptions across News Corp Australia rose 25% to nearly 650,000 by the end of the fiscal year. Meanwhile, at News U.K., The Times and The Sunday Times paid subscribers rose to 336,000, an increase of 11% year-over-year and benefited from a focus on attracting premium subscribers with a concomitant improvement in retention rates. The Sun's online audience expanded markedly during the year, including with the launch of a U.S. edition. In total, The Sun reported 133 million unique users globally in June for 1 month, which also reflects our expansion in the U.S. Importantly, The Sun remains as the leading news brand in the U.K. according to Pamco. 
The sheer scale of our collective reach should not be underestimated. In the U.S., The New York Post digital network reached 177 million monthly unique users during the fourth quarter. It has long been known that The Post has been loss-making, but those losses have fallen dramatically in the past 18 months as we increased cover prices and benefited from ad revenue for our expanding digital readership and reduce the cost base. We can now see a clear path of profitability for The Post. 
In book publishing, despite the viral vicissitudes, which included the near shutdown of U.S. physical stores, profitability was up in Q4. This is a testament to the resourcefulness of the team at HarperCollins, which moved quickly to bolster supply chains and emphasize e-books and online sales. These actions allowed us to make the most of changes in reading behavior during the pandemic. 
As we have indicated on previous calls, the second half of the fiscal year at HarperCollins was more propitious than the first half, with segment EBITDA improvement in both Q3 and Q4. Among the titles that performed well with the latest installment of Joanna Gain, highly successful Magnolia Table series, Dutch House by Ann Patchard, The One and Only Bob by Katherine Applegate and World's Worst Parent by David Williams. 
Looking ahead to fiscal '21, we're already eagerly anticipating the release of Tiger Woods: An Autobiography, and expect strong results from the upcoming launch of Jenna Bush Hager's Everything Beautiful in Its Time. We're certainly pleased by the early performance of Daniel Silver's The Order and Ben Shapiro's How to Destroy America in 3 Easy Steps, and we expect much from Lebron James' first children's book, I Promise, scheduled for release next Tuesday. 
In digital real estate services, REA's traffic and lead volume have rebounded in the wake of the shutdown in Australia, with record audiences in June and a dramatic increase in users potentially interested in a house move. There is simply no doubt that the COVID crisis has prompted many families to consider their housing circumstances, and that ultra-low interest rates have made a move more possible. We noted similar trends in the U.S. at realtor.com, and we saw a significant improvement in profitability at Move, which runs the realtor.com site in the fourth quarter and for the year as a whole. 
The new leadership team at Move is working closely with the Dow Jones' executive team as the combined audience and lucrative demographic of the 2 sites in the U.S. is a hefty $124 million based on comScore statistics as of June. We are confident that the Dow Jones sites will provide a flow of potential buyers for realtor.com and that realtor.com will provide a flow of potential subscriptions for the WSJ and Barron's. 
Also in Australia, at Foxtel, our emphasis on streaming has brought a leap in new customers for both Kayo, the sports streaming service, and Binge, our entertainment offering, which has just launched. As of August 4, Kayo, showing great resilience, had 590,000 subscribers, including 48,000 trialists, while Binge had 217,000 subscribers, which includes 185,000 paying, just a short time after its formal launch. Both services are making the most of our existing rights without incurring extra content expenses and are certainly expanding the reach of Foxtel, which has now approached a new record number of total subscribers following an acceleration in July. Just this week, we crossed the 1 million OTT paying subscriber mark, setting a new record, thanks to our expanded streaming strategy. 
While there is certainly seasonality to Kayo, given the scheduling of the popular winter sports, we are reassured that so many subscribers have returned to the service so promptly and particularly encouraged by the early rush of subscribers at Binge. Our past acquisition of cricket rights means that we are well positioned when the Indian cricket teams arrive in Australia later this year. 
On our last call, you will recall that I insisted that there would be a reset of sports prices. And in the midst of this year's shortened season, that has absolutely come to pass. While negotiations with some sports continue, deals already completed will reduce the cost of sports rights at Foxtel by at least AUD 180 million over the next 3 years as compared to the prior contracted value. This reset will have a positive long-term impact on Foxtel's profitability. 
No doubt, the events of the first half of calendar year 2020 will remain resonant in our memories. I am particularly proud of the performance of all those who work at News Corp for showing professionalism, passion and compassion throughout these most difficult of times. Our reporters and opinion writers around the world have provided a profoundly important service, and many of our employees have contributed to their communities through philanthropic service in recent months. 
And now for more granular detail and customary insight, Susan."

Before talking through our fiscal 20 results, I would like to recap on the actions we've taken this past year to better position News Corp for long-term success with a focus on increasing shareholder value and transparency. Firstly, the",2851,"Thank you, Robert. Before talking through our fiscal 20 results, I would like to recap on the actions we've taken this past year to better position News Corp for long-term success with a focus on increasing shareholder value and transparency. Firstly, the company has taken significant action on our cost base. Our publishing business in Australia has been significantly restructured with 112 of our regional and community markets transitioning to digital or closed. The cost base at Foxtel has been restructured with savings across programming and support functions. With increasing OTT scale and a lower cost base, Foxtel is better positioned for success, and I would like to reiterate that we have no plans to provide additional funding. 
Our digital real estate businesses have also been proactive in reducing headcount to confront the challenges of COVID-19. In addition, we took quick and decisive action to reduce OpEx and CapEx in the fourth quarter with CapEx reducing by 1/3 year-on-year and total costs decreasing 21% year-on-year, partially due to divestments in FX, but primarily due to active cost management. We are also close to finalizing our savings opportunities for global shared services across the company as we look to leverage our global scale and reduce duplication. These collective actions resulted in a 7% reduction in headcount this year across the businesses, excluding the NAM and Unruly sales. Secondly, Dow Jones results are now reported as a separate segment, which better highlights its performance and provides a more complete comparison with its peers. The business saw record subscriptions and achieved growth in both revenue and EBITDA for the year. Thirdly, we are taking tangible steps to stabilize our newly formed News Media segment through digital subscriber growth, cover price increases and aggressive cost targets, which will be further enhanced by our global shared service initiative. 
In relation to liquidity, the only debt exposures we have are at our non 100% owned subsidiaries, Foxtel and REA, and these are nonrecourse to News Corp. Finally, as part of our simplification efforts, we continue to reshape News Corp's portfolio this year with the divestments of News America Marketing and Unruly. With that as a backdrop, I will now discuss our latest financial results. 
Fiscal 2020 fourth quarter total revenues were approximately $1.9 billion, down 22% versus the prior year, reflecting the impacts of COVID-19 and the divestment of News America Marketing in early May. Total segment EBITDA was $195 million, down 28% versus the prior year. Excluding the divestment of NAM, acquisitions, currency fluctuations and the other items disclosed in our release, adjusted revenues fell 13% and adjusted total segment EBITDA decreased 10% as growth in segment EBITDA at the Dow Jones, book Publishing and subscription video services segments were outweighed by the negative impact of COVID-19. Our best estimate for the revenue impact of COVID-19 for the quarter was negative $330 million or 13%, together with a negative impact on total segment EBITDA estimated to be between $40 million to $55 million or 15% to 20%. For the quarter, we reported a net loss per share of $0.67 as compared to a net loss per share of $0.09 in the prior year. The loss includes $292 million of noncash impairment charges primarily related to fixed assets in the U.K. and Australia. Adjusted earnings per share were negative $0.03 in the quarter compared to positive $0.07 in the prior year. 
Moving on to the quarterly results for the individual reporting segments, starting with Dow Jones. Revenues for the quarter were $381 million, down 4% compared to the prior year, with digital revenues accounting for a record 71% of total revenues this quarter. Circulation revenues rose 2% due to robust growth in digital circulation revenues, partially offset by lower print circulation revenues, which were impacted by the decline in newsstand sales and fewer amenity copies primarily related to COVID-19. As Robert mentioned, Dow Jones again achieved record subscriptions in the quarter and saw an acceleration in year-over-year growth compared to the prior quarter. Dow Jones average subscriptions for the quarter were almost 3.8 million, up 15% from the prior year. And of that, digital-only subscriptions were 2.8 million, up 28% year-over-year. For the Wall Street Journal, there were approximately 3 million total subscriptions for the quarter, up 15% from the prior year, with digital-only subscriptions growing 23% to more than 2.2 million, improving from the 15% year-over-year growth rate in the prior quarter. To frame the improvement, we added 203,000 Wall Street Journal digital-only subscriptions this quarter compared to 112,000 in the third quarter and 43,000 in the prior year. 
Revenues from Dow Jones Professional Information business grew 6% year-over-year, slightly higher than the third quarter rate, driven by 14% revenue growth at Risk and Compliance. Consistent with our expectations, Risk and Compliance revenues reached approximately $160 million for fiscal 2020. As we mentioned last quarter, advertising revenues, which accounted for only 19% of revenues this quarter were impacted by COVID-19 and declined 28% to $71 million. For the first time, digital advertising revenue was greater than print, accounting for 54% of total advertising revenues for the quarter. 
Digital advertising revenues fell 7%, helped by strong growth in programmatic while print advertising was down 43%, which included the impact from the cancellation of live events. Total unique visitors across our Dow Jones Digital platforms more than doubled in the quarter versus the prior year. 
Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter rose 13% to $60 million. 
Turning to our other new segment, News Media, which primarily includes News Australia, News U.K. and the New York Post and the News America Marketing and Unruly companies prior to their disposal. Revenues for the quarter were $490 million, down 41% versus the prior year, of which the impact from the divestment of News America Marketing accounted for over half of the total revenue decline. On an adjusted basis, which excludes NAM, Unruly and the other items mentioned in our release, revenues declined 22%. And advertising revenue fell 58% on a reported basis, of which $179 million or 36% of the decline was from the sale of News America Marketing, and the rest of the decline was driven by the negative impact from COVID-19, weaknesses in the print advertising market and a $20 million or 4% negative impact related to the suspension of certain community titles in Australia. Advertising revenues at News U.K. fell 46% on a reported basis and 45% in local currency, relatively consistent with our April commentary, with lower print trends, partially offset by strong digital advertising growth at The Sun. Performance was similar in Australia, with advertising down 46% on a reported basis and 42% in local currency, which includes the negative impact related to the suspension of certain community titles. Circulation and subscription revenues declined 9%, impacted by lower news stand sales related to COVID-19, partially offset by strong digital paid subscriber growth and cover price increases in Australia. Segment EBITDA for the quarter was a loss of $44 million, down $95 million from the prior year. The divestment of News America Marketing accounted for $43 million of the year-over-year decline. Also included in the results are approximately $8 million of the cost related to the decommissioning of print operations in Australia. 
It is important to note that we do not expect this to be the new normal, and we are taking significant and decisive steps to improve the trajectory of the segment, including better monetizing our growing and global audience and further cost reductions. These include leveraging existing content to source incremental licensing revenues. We believe that we are very well positioned to benefit from incremental licensing revenues as early as this fiscal year, which should have a meaningful impact on EBITDA. Our biggest source of revenues in the News Media segment is now circulation and subscription. We expect continued growth in our digital subscriptions, and we will be looking at cover and subscription prices to help offset print advertising declines. Our global shared service initiative, which we expect to centralize many of our back-office functions and remove duplication. We'll also continue to work on newsroom transformation and the ongoing view of our printing sites and office space. We have reduced our total headcount within the segment by 12% in fiscal 2020, which will lower our cost base going forward, and we expect additional reductions in fiscal 2021. The  impact of COVID-19 remains uncertain, and we do expect continued advertising challenges. However, we will continue to focus on the digital transformation of this segment, new ways to monetize our content and continue to take aggressive cost measures as we look to provide a more stable outlook. 
At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues decreased 16% to [ $288 million ], primarily due to a decline in listings in Australia and the U.S. related to COVID-19 and associated customer support measures. On an adjusted basis, revenues declined 13%. Segment EBITDA fell 10% to $71 million or 5% on an adjusted basis. 
REA Group revenues fell 21%, primarily reflecting FX, lower developer revenue and a 14% decline in residential listing volumes for the quarter. REA saw improvements in listings as the quarter progressed, with 11% listing volume growth in June, combined with record traffic. The volume growth was partly related to easier year-on-year comparisons which included the impact from the federal election in the prior year. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call immediately following this call for more details. 
Move revenues declined 10% to $111 million, with real estate revenues down 5%. However, the decline in real estate revenues was almost entirely due to an estimated $13 million impact related to the customer bill relief initiative. Move is also still being impacted by the transition to the referral model, given the longer time period by which revenues are recognized. Despite the transition, we remain very confident in the long-term growth potential of the referral model, including upside through incremental ancillary services. 
Similar to REA, we are also seeing record traffic at REALTOR with June achieving 86 million monthly unique users, up 18% year-over-year, combined with a greater than 50% year-on-year increase in core real estate lead volumes in June. Despite the revenue impact from COVID-19 for both the quarter and the full year, Move increased its contribution to segment EBITDA year-on-year, benefiting from the restructuring of the organization, including the integration of the teams at REALTOR and Opcity. 
Turning to the subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $407 million, down 24% versus $536 million in the prior year, which included a negative 5% impact from FX. The revenue decline was driven by fewer residential subscribers, a reduction in commercial subscribers related to the suspension of billings due to the closing of licensed venues and a decline in advertising revenue. Approximately half of the year-over-year revenue decline in the quarter was due to commercial and advertising revenues, which we believe was mostly a function of the impact from COVID-19. 
Foxtel's closing paid subscriber base was approximately 2.8 million as of June 30, down 12%, which reflects the decline in commercial subscribers, which fell to 86,000 from 264,000 in the prior year, primarily associated with COVID-19 restrictions. We expect improvements as license commercial venues begin to reopen, although timing is still uncertain given the recent spikes in infections in Victoria. 
Foxtel Now subscribers were also impacted by a difficult year ago comparison as the prior year benefited from the final season of Game of Thrones, but the number was stable sequentially. Pleasingly, we saw a significant decline in broadcast churn down to 13.2% compared to 14.7% in the prior year, which was the lowest in 7 quarters. The improvement was supported by the implementation of several COVID-19 mitigation measures, including opening up content tiers for extensions and favorable impacts from a slowdown in Telstra's NBN migration activity. Broadcast ARPU was relatively stable at AUD 78. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $104 million, up 24% from the prior year, driven by lower costs. 
Overall expenses declined about $145 million, which includes approximately $70 million of lower sports rights costs, primarily related to the suspension of live sports. Results include 1 month of expense related to the NRL and AFL, and the majority of the deferred sports costs will be recognized in fiscal 2021. I will discuss this further in the outlook commentary. 
Foxtel also benefited from lower entertainment costs from renegotiated affiliate and output deals, lower transmission costs and lower overheads due to staff reductions. 
As Robert mentioned, we are pleased with the resilience of Kayo and the early progress and level of engagement for Binge, Foxtel's new entertainment streaming service. We look forward to building on Foxtel's expanding OTT subscriber base in the year ahead. During the quarter, Foxtel also accelerated its cost transformation plan for the business, reducing its headcount by approximately 17%. This action, together with other operational efficiencies and content renegotiations will help put Foxtel in a better position longer term.  
At book publishing, HarperCollins had a strong quarter with revenues down only 3% to $407 million and segment EBITDA up 9% to $47 million despite significant bricks-and-mortar store closures, which was a far better performance than we had anticipated. We saw the strongest digital growth in recent years with total digital sales up 26% to represent 29% of consumer revenues. With the shelter in place orders related to COVID-19, e-book sales returned to robust growth, increasing 31% year-over-year with down&mutable audio books also growing at a healthy 17%, and despite an initial dip due to the falling individuals committing to work. 
As Robert noted, HarperCollins benefited from a strong release slate, which included Joanna Gaine's Magnolia Table Volume 2 and a great performance from our Children's division. 
I would now like to talk about some themes in the upcoming quarter. Forecasting remains challenging, so I will discuss the trends we have seen in July. At Digital Real Estate services, as noted in their release, July new buy listings at REA were up 16%. However, residential revenue growth is expected to be offset by reduction in development projects, listing declines in Commercial and Asia businesses and the recent government restrictions in Victoria. Please refer to REA's press release for more detail. 
REALTOR is facing lower industry-wide real estate transactions, but encouragingly, lead volume and unique users remained strong, similar to June. In Subscription Video Services, advertising in July improved modestly with the return of live sports. We expect gradual recovery of commercial subscribers but timing will largely be dictated by government restrictions and the broader impact from COVID-19. Broadcast churn is modestly higher versus the prior year and the fourth quarter. On sports costs, assuming no further disruption of play, we will recognize approximately $55 million or AUD 78 million of additional sports programming rights costs, the majority of which is related to the NRL and AFL rights loss that were deferred from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021 due to the temporary sport suspension. However, we expect at least $100 million or AUD 160 million of overall savings, net of the increase in sports cost for the full year in fiscal 2021 as a result of the cost-out initiatives taken during fiscal 2020. 
At Dow Jones, subscription trends in July continued to be strong with over 25% growth in digital-only subscriptions at The Wall Street Journal. Advertising trends improved modestly in July, but with digital up very strongly. In book publishing, similar to the fourth quarter, HarperCollins continued to see strong growth in online sales in July. Retail stores are slowly reopening, albeit likely at a reduced foot traffic and continued risk from any recurrence of COVID. 
At News Media, we continue to expect advertising and single copy sales revenues to be adversely affected due to COVID-19. And advertising revenues in July at the newspaper Masters in the segment declined 25% to 30% in total compared to prior year. As a reminder, advertising revenues in the prior year included the results from News America Marketing. Overall decline in circulation volumes for July improved from the lows experienced early in the fourth quarter, particularly for the leading papers. Pleasingly, we have continued to see strong digital subscriber growth at The Australian [indiscernible] and at The Times and Sunday Times, and we will continue to focus on cost transformation to mitigate the revenue headwinds. 
CapEx for the year is expected to be approximately $400 million compared to $434 million in fiscal 2020, subject to foreign currency fluctuations. We will be monitoring this number very closely throughout the year and will take necessary actions to reduce this amount as needed. 
And as a reminder, we have a strong balance sheet with over $1.5 billion of cash and access to a $750 million revolving credit facility.

But I can assure you that not only regulators but media companies in the world and the digital platforms are watching Australia closely. Now we've obviously been fighting this fight for well over a decade. And the News Corp Board has supported the quest because it was absolutely crucial to the future of journalism. Newspapers delivered in whatever format are vital to well-informed society. And what's obvious is the collective understanding of the issues is past the point of no return, the point of no action, shall we say. But there are obviously regulatory changes to come in Australia. And the commercial landscape is not yet fully formed, but it will be a landscape far more hospitable to journalism and to News Media and to News Corp. 
Now as for your a question about the licensing of content. Clearly, we're always looking for opportunities to monetize that content. But in a digital context, we have a unique comparative advantage with global properties, which often write about similar subjects. So not only in-licensing in a traditional subscription sense, but see a little bit about the segmentation of digital products, products around sport, products around lifestyle, around food, around puzzles even. So it's a real opportunity for us to divide up our content in a different way monetize that content and provide compelling digital opportunities for potential subscribers at different price points for different content sets."

So the bulk of that reduction between reported and adjusted was due to NAM and FX. The COVID impact we're predicting in about $270 million -- or $280 odd million in order to get you to that EBITDA impact. We were expecting costs to increase slightly for the quarter because we did have increased revenue at Dow Jones and HarperCollins and some of our businesses. And what I would say in relation to COVID impact cost is, clearly, there's a lot that are related to volume, so particularly on our mastheads around the globe. And we would expect to see those scale obviously, as those businesses scale back up. But we have also reduced headcount by 7% across the business, excluding NAM and Unruly, and that savings that we would certainly expect to continue into the next year. We've made significant cuts on marketing. We clearly will have a look at what we think is an appropriate level for marketing going forward, and it may never be back to the level that we had pre COVID. Likewise, with most companies, we've got a lot of cost cuts coming through on TNE and other discretionary spend, which, again, when we think forward, we will review exactly what we think we need as a business in order to continue spending within that area. We've clearly got compensation cost reductions as well as a result of lower bonuses. And outside of the OpEx impact, we've got the cuts that came through in CapEx. I think I mentioned that we cut that by third year-on-year. So clearly, as we move forward into next year, it's difficult to predict exactly that cost base going to look like because it will depend on the revenue trends. But we are confident that there's a significant amount of reoccurring costs that will go into next year from a cost reduction perspective. And we do actually believe that we can continue to take costs, as we've mentioned."

These are certainly complex times, and there are few who have not been touched in some manner. The coronavirus has irrevocably changed businesses and our businesses in expediting pre-existing digital trends, in challenging established practices and in prompting necessary introspection about work habits and the workplace itself. There has been much agility and adaptation at News Corp. The vast majority of our employees across the world have been working at home, and the resilience of the company's culture has been a core component in continuity. Without doubt, digitization has accelerated. And without doubt, all of our businesses have been affected and responded with customary ingenuity. I would like to express my sincere thanks to each of our employees and their families for having responded so promptly, so intelligently and so thoughtfully to these testing circumstances. 
Evidence of that response was seen in the fourth quarter, when virtually all of our businesses prudently reduced costs, sometimes painfully to ensure that they were robust enough to cope with volatility and disruption. Preserving cash was a priority, and it is worth noting that our cash balance increased in the last quarter by $129 million to over $1.5 billion as of June 30. Revenue comparisons are obviously made complex by the sale of News America Marketing and Unruly, plus the consequences of COVID. But our adjusted revenue for the quarter declined by 13%. Obviously, the net income and EPS were affected by noncash impairments, primarily at our U.K. and Australian businesses. And Susan will be able to provide more details momentarily. However, our adjusted total segment EBITDA declined by a modest 10%. 
This is particularly significant and a somewhat historic earnings call. Regular listeners will recall that we had pledged to simplify the company and make the results more transparent. The sale of News America Marketing and Unruly certainly simplified the structure. And in the quest for transparency, beginning this quarter, we are presenting Dow Jones as a separate segment. This will highlight what we believe are 2 incontrovertible facts: the substantial and growing value of that company and its superior profit profile and prospects to those in the New York Times. In what has been a difficult year for many media companies, Dow Jones reported a 13% increase in segment EBITDA based on the strength of its professional information business and the preeminence of the Wall Street Journal. Our other global mastheads and digital information properties are gathered in the News Media segment, which will include our Australian titles, many of which are now digital-only: The Times, The Sun and Sunday Times as well as Talksport and Virgin Radio. It may be called News Media, but obviously, the segment is increasingly digital in personality, and virtually all of our mastheads had record audiences during the year. Our journalists have performed admirably in providing crucial insights to readers during the COVID crisis, delivering accurate information and analysis and providing an antidote to conspiracy theories and noxious nonsense proliferating elsewhere on the web. 
We are continuing to focus on acquiring digital subscribers and audience while rightsizing our businesses to be digital-first, which is necessarily resulting in significant cost reductions. The closure in Australia of many of our storied print editions and the emphasis on digital was further evidence of our willingness to be decisive at an epochal moment. We are very proud of our traditions, and we will always invest in the very best journalism. But the format is less important than the function. And we firmly believe that the digital reincarnation of these titles will ensure a profitable future and a continuing role in their community. We are also constantly restlessly reviewing our portfolio with a view to ensuring that we have the optimum asset mix. All of our executives understand that these are testing times and many of our executives around our businesses internationally have volunteered hefty cuts to their bonuses, which form a large part of their compensation. The Executive Chairman has forsaken 100% of his bonus, and Susan Panuccio and David Pitofsky, our General Counsel, who are with me on this call have also voluntarily given up a meaningful chunk of their bonus. All understand the importance of a stringent cost strategy, so we have launched a genuinely meaningful shared service program that we believe will transform the company by centralizing many of our functions. The mission is being led by 2 of our most talented executives, Damian Eales from Australia and Jane Viner from the U.K., in tandem with our CTO, the Global Head of HR, and CFO, in other words, Susan. The early indications are that the shared service program should be able to appreciably reduce our costs and we expect it to have a materially positive impact on our bottom line. 
We will always emphasize integrity and creativity, but our ability to prioritize imperative projects will be enhanced by the program. We expect our technology platforms to be the best-in-class at the lowest available price. And the overall level of cooperation coordination among our businesses will certainly be enhanced. This is not an ephemeral project, but one that we believe will have a fundamental impact on the way we do business and on our earnings. 
One other trend is already having an appreciable impact on our earnings, the change in terms of trade with the digital platforms. Those of you who watched the congressional testimony last week by the tech titans would have noticed overall that the political understanding of the issues has vastly improved. That is also true in Brussels, London and Australia, where the ACCC has just introduced a draft mandatory code of contact. I recommend that anyone seeking enlightenment, Google the name Rod Sims and read a few of his recent interviews. Mr. Sims chairs the ACCC. 
It is fair to say, without revealing details that we are deep in discussion with these companies and that the ecosystem has absolutely begun to evolve. For News Corp, which has been pursuing this issue for well over a decade, this favorable outcome would simply not have been possible without the leadership of Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch and the support of a board which backed advocacy even when News Corp often stood alone in pursuit of the principle of a premium for premium content. 
Now for the numbers. At the new Dow Jones segment, revenues improved in fiscal year 2020 and profitability was up 13%, as I've mentioned. At $236 million, Dow Jones full segment -- full year segment EBITDA was the highest in separation, as were margins. Digital revenue surpassed $1 billion in fiscal '20 for the first time and represented 66% of total revenues, rising to 70% for the fourth quarter. We saw strong circulation volume growth, with digital-only subscriptions increasing 23% year-over-year for the Wall Street Journal in Q4 and 51% for the Barron's Group. MarketWatch, our finance website reported the highest annual revenue numbers in the brand's history, making it the third year in a row of record-breaking results. Equally impressive, unique users more than doubled to $62 million in the month of June. 
In contrast to most COVID affected media sites, digital advertising was down only 7% in the quarter and the general shift towards digital as a source of revenue continues, with that segment representing 54% of advertising revenues in the quarter. We expect that digital will continue to outpace print, given we are seeing robust digital advertising despite the social and commercial volatility that has prompted many companies to be cautious in marketing spend. Even with the pandemic impact, digital advertising at Dow Jones was 4% higher for the year. 
Full year revenues for the professional information business rose 7% year-over-year, driven by Risk & Compliance, which surged 20%. We remain particularly excited by the prospects for our Risk & Compliance business, given the intensification of regulatory scrutiny around the world. As we have noted on this call in the past, who among you does not want to minimize risk and maximize compliance? We are expanding our risk-related product lines, enhancing our software and ensuring that the increased flow of actionable intelligence is complemented by thoughtful analysis and compelling news feeds for our growing audience of clients. We contend that the all digital Risk & Compliance business is a highly undervalued part of a highly undervalued company, given the revenue trajectory, the still expanding market and the necessity for companies and individuals to have an audit trial of compliance. 
The creation of the Dow Jones segment allows us to make a direct comparison with The New York Times, and on most important measures, the Wall Street Journal and the Board of Dow Jones performed far better. The Journal is both the most trusted general newspaper in the U.S. according to Reuters Institute and the world's leading business use provider. And a vast, well-healed, well-informed audience provides an opportunity to upsell value-added lucrative business products to serve a specialist need. 
Here are a few metrics comparing the 2 companies for the quarter. Dow Jones segment EBITDA of $60 million was higher than in New York Times, having benefited from the stability of our vibrant professional information business. While Dow Jones segment EBITDA expanded by 13% year-over-year, New York Times declined by 6%. Dow Jones EBITDA margins were 15.7%, about 3 percentage points higher than the New York Times. In this time of COVID, Dow Jones revenue decline moderated at a higher rate than the New York times at 4% versus down over 7% for The Times. Dow Jones COVID-affected advertising revenue declined at a much lower rate than The Times, thanks largely to significant outperformance in digital advertising which was down just 7% at Dow Jones versus down 32% at The New York Times. In fact, Dow Jones generated more total ad dollars than The New York Times. 
We feel strongly that we should explain the virtues of Dow Jones to shareholders and potential shareholders so we will have an Investor Day in mid-September at which Dow Jones Chief Executive, Almar Latour, and other Dow Jones Executives and myself, will give you a more granular explanation of the company's extraordinary potential and an opportunity for you to interrogate. 
The News Media segment, of course, had a challenging year, and we took prompt measures to confront those challenges. These included the aforementioned sales of NAM and Unruly as well as immediate cost reductions and the launch of strategic shared service project. In Australia, apart from migrating publications to digital only, we also sold our investment in the Australian associated press newswire and unfortunately, implemented hundreds of redundancies. The end of the relationship with AAP was both necessary and historic as the service was founded in 1935 by Sir Keith Murdoch. 
Digital subscriptions across News Corp Australia rose 25% to nearly 650,000 by the end of the fiscal year. Meanwhile, at News U.K., The Times and The Sunday Times paid subscribers rose to 336,000, an increase of 11% year-over-year and benefited from a focus on attracting premium subscribers with a concomitant improvement in retention rates. The Sun's online audience expanded markedly during the year, including with the launch of a U.S. edition. In toto, The Sun reported 133 million unique users globally in June for 1 month, which also reflects our expansion in the U.S. Importantly, The Sun remains as the leading news brand in the U.K. according to Pamco. 
The sheer scale of our collective reach should not be underestimated. In the U.S., The New York Post digital network reached 177 million monthly unique users during the fourth quarter. It has long been known that The Post has been loss-making, but those losses have fallen dramatically in the past 18 months as we increased cover prices and benefited from ad revenue for our expanding digital readership and reduced the cost base. We can now see a clear path to profitability for The Post. 
In book publishing, despite the viral vicissitudes, which included the near shutdown of U.S. physical stores, profitability was up in Q4. This is a testament to the resourcefulness of the team at HarperCollins, which moved quickly to bolster supply chains and emphasize e-books and online sales. These actions allowed us to make the most of changes in reading behavior during the pandemic. 
As we had indicated on previous calls, the second half of the fiscal year at HarperCollins was more propitious than the first half, with segment EBITDA improvement in both Q3 and Q4. Among the titles that performed well were the latest installment of Joanna Gaines' highly successful Magnolia Table series, Dutch House by Ann Patchett, The One and Only Bob by Katherine Applegate and World's Worst Parents by David Williams. 
Looking ahead to fiscal '21, we're already eagerly anticipating the release of Tiger Woods' autobiography, and expect strong results from the upcoming launch of Jenna Bush Hager's, Everything Beautiful in Its Time. We're certainly pleased by the early performance of Daniel Silver's, The Order and Ben Shapiro's, How to Destroy America in 3 Easy Steps, and we expect much from Lebron James' first children's book, I Promise, scheduled for release next Tuesday. 
In digital real estate services, REA's traffic and lead volume have rebounded in the wake of the shutdown in Australia, with record audiences in June and a dramatic increase in users potentially interested in a house move. There is simply no doubt that the COVID crisis has prompted many families to consider their housing circumstances, and that ultra-low interest rates have made a move more possible. We noted similar trends in the U.S. at realtor.com, and we saw a significant improvement in profitability at Move, which runs the realtor.com site in the fourth quarter and for the year as a whole. 
The new leadership team at Move is working closely with the Dow Jones' executive team as the combined audience and lucrative demographic of the 2 sites in the U.S. is a hefty $124 million based on comScore statistics as of June. We are confident that the Dow Jones sites will provide a flow of potential buyers for realtor.com and that realtor.com will provide a flow of potential subscriptions for the WSJ and Barron's. 
Also in Australia, at Foxtel, our emphasis on streaming has brought a leap in new customers for both Kayo, the sports streaming service, and Binge, our entertainment offering, which has just launched. As of August 4, Kayo, showing great resilience, had 590,000 subscribers, including 48,000 trialists, while Binge had 217,000 subscribers, which includes 185,000 paying, just a short time after its formal launch. Both services are making the most of our existing rights without incurring extra content expenses and are certainly expanding the reach of Foxtel, which has now approached a new record number of total subscribers following an acceleration in July. Just this week, we crossed the 1 million OTT paying subscriber mark, setting a new record, thanks to our expanded streaming strategy. 
While there is certainly seasonality to Kayo, given the scheduling of the popular winter sports, we are reassured that so many subscribers have returned to the service so promptly and particularly encouraged by the early rush of subscribers at Binge. Our past acquisition of cricket rights means that we are well positioned when the Indian cricket teams arrive in Australia later this year. 
On our last call, you will recall that I insisted that there would be a reset of sports prices. And in the midst of this year's shortened season, that has absolutely come to pass. While negotiations with some sports continue, deals already completed will reduce the cost of sports rights at Foxtel by at least AUD 180 million over the next 3 years as compared to the prior contracted value. This reset will have a positive long-term impact on Foxtel's profitability. 
No doubt, the events of the first half of calendar year 2020 will remain resonant in our memories. I am particularly proud of the performance of all those who work at News Corp for showing professionalism, passion and compassion throughout these most difficult of times. Our reporters and opinion writers around the world have provided a profoundly important service, and many of our employees have contributed to their communities through philanthropic service in recent months. 
And now for more granular detail and customary insight, Susan."

Before talking through our fiscal 20 results, I would like to recap on the actions we've taken this past year to better position News Corp for long-term success with a focus on increasing shareholder value and transparency. Firstly, the",2850,"Thank you, Robert. Before talking through our fiscal 20 results, I would like to recap on the actions we've taken this past year to better position News Corp for long-term success with a focus on increasing shareholder value and transparency. Firstly, the company has taken significant action on our cost base. Our publishing business in Australia has been significantly restructured with 112 of our regional and community markets transitioning to digital or closed. The cost base at Foxtel has been restructured with savings across programming and support functions. With increasing OTT scale and a lower cost base, Foxtel is better positioned for success, and I would like to reiterate that we have no plans to provide additional funding. 
Our digital real estate businesses have also been proactive in reducing headcount to confront the challenges of COVID-19. In addition, we took quick and decisive action to reduce OpEx and CapEx in the fourth quarter with CapEx reducing by 1/3 year-on-year and total costs decreasing 21% year-on-year, partially due to divestments in FX, but primarily due to active cost management. We are also close to finalizing our savings opportunities for global shared services across the company as we look to leverage our global scale and reduce duplication. These collective actions resulted in a 7% reduction in headcount this year across the businesses, excluding the NAM and Unruly sales. Secondly, Dow Jones results are now reported as a separate segment, which better highlights its performance and provides a more complete comparison with its peers. The business saw record subscriptions and achieved growth in both revenue and EBITDA for the year. Thirdly, we are taking tangible steps to stabilize our newly formed News Media segment through digital subscriber growth, cover price increases and aggressive cost targets, which will be further enhanced by our global shared service initiative. 
In relation to liquidity, the only debt exposures we have are at our non 100% owned subsidiaries, Foxtel and REA, and these are nonrecourse to News Corp. Finally, as part of our simplification efforts, we continue to reshape News Corp's portfolio this year with the divestments of News America Marketing and Unruly. With that as a backdrop, I will now discuss our latest financial results. 
Fiscal 2020 fourth quarter total revenues were approximately $1.9 billion, down 22% versus the prior year, reflecting the impacts of COVID-19 and the divestment of News America Marketing in early May. Total segment EBITDA was $195 million, down 28% versus the prior year. Excluding the divestment of NAM, acquisitions, currency fluctuations and the other items disclosed in our release, adjusted revenues fell 13% and adjusted total segment EBITDA decreased 10% as growth in segment EBITDA at the Dow Jones, book Publishing and subscription video services segments were outweighed by the negative impact of COVID-19. Our best estimate for the revenue impact of COVID-19 for the quarter was negative $330 million or 13%, together with a negative impact on total segment EBITDA estimated to be between $40 million to $55 million or 15% to 20%. For the quarter, we reported a net loss per share of $0.67 as compared to a net loss per share of $0.09 in the prior year. The loss includes $292 million of noncash impairment charges primarily related to fixed assets in the U.K. and Australia. Adjusted earnings per share were negative $0.03 in the quarter compared to positive $0.07 in the prior year. 
Moving on to the quarterly results for the individual reporting segments, starting with Dow Jones. Revenues for the quarter were $381 million, down 4% compared to the prior year, with digital revenues accounting for a record 71% of total revenues this quarter. Circulation revenues rose 2% due to robust growth in digital circulation revenues, partially offset by lower print circulation revenues, which were impacted by the decline in newsstand sales and fewer amenity copies primarily related to COVID-19. As Robert mentioned, Dow Jones again achieved record subscriptions in the quarter and saw an acceleration in year-over-year growth compared to the prior quarter. Dow Jones average subscriptions for the quarter were almost 3.8 million, up 15% from the prior year. And of that, digital-only subscriptions were 2.8 million, up 28% year-over-year. For the Wall Street Journal, there were approximately 3 million total subscriptions for the quarter, up 15% from the prior year, with digital-only subscriptions growing 23% to more than 2.2 million, improving from the 15% year-over-year growth rate in the prior quarter. To frame the improvement, we added 203,000 Wall Street Journal digital-only subscriptions this quarter compared to 112,000 in the third quarter and 43,000 in the prior year. 
Revenues from Dow Jones Professional Information business rose 6% year-over-year, slightly higher than the third quarter rate, driven by 14% revenue growth at Risk & Compliance. Consistent with our expectations, Risk & Compliance revenues reached approximately $160 million for fiscal 2020. As we mentioned last quarter, advertising revenues, which accounted for only 19% of revenues this quarter were impacted by COVID-19 and declined 28% to $71 million. For the first time, digital advertising revenue was greater than print, accounting for 54% of total advertising revenues for the quarter. 
Digital advertising revenues fell 7%, helped by strong growth in programmatic while print advertising was down 43%, which included the impact from the cancellation of live events. Total unique visitors across our Dow Jones Digital platforms more than doubled in the quarter versus the prior year. 
Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter rose 13% to $60 million. 
Turning to our other news segment, News Media, which primarily includes News Australia, News U.K. and the New York Post and the News America Marketing and Unruly companies prior to their disposal. Revenues for the quarter were $490 million, down 41% versus the prior year, of which the impact from the divestment of News America Marketing accounted for over half of the total revenue decline. On an adjusted basis, which excludes NAM, Unruly and the other items mentioned in our release, revenues declined 22%. Advertising revenue fell 58% on a reported basis, of which $179 million or 36% of the decline was from the sale of News America Marketing, and the rest of the decline was driven by the negative impact from COVID-19, weaknesses in the print advertising market and a $20 million or 4% negative impact related to the suspension of certain community titles in Australia. Advertising revenues at News U.K. fell 46% on a reported basis and 45% in local currency, relatively consistent with our April commentary, with lower print trends, partially offset by strong digital advertising growth at The Sun. Performance was similar in Australia, with advertising down 46% on a reported basis and 42% in local currency, which includes the negative impact related to the suspension of certain community titles. Circulation and subscription revenues declined 9%, impacted by lower news stand sales related to COVID-19, partially offset by strong digital paid subscriber growth and cover price increases in Australia. Segment EBITDA for the quarter was a loss of $44 million, down $95 million from the prior year. The divestment of News America Marketing accounted for $43 million of the year-over-year decline. Also included in the results are approximately $8 million of additional cost related to the decommissioning of print operations in Australia. 
It is important to note that we do not expect this to be the new normal, and we are taking significant and decisive steps to improve the trajectory of the segment, including better monetizing our growing and global audience and further cost reductions. These include leveraging existing content to source incremental licensing revenues. We believe that we are very well positioned to benefit from incremental licensing revenues as early as this fiscal year, which should have a meaningful impact on EBITDA. Our biggest source of revenues in the News Media segment is now circulation and subscription. We expect continued growth in our digital subscriptions, and we will be looking at cover and subscription prices to help offset print advertising declines. Our global shared service initiative, which we expect to centralize many of our back-office functions and remove duplication. We'll also continue to work on newsroom transformation and the ongoing review of our printing sites and office space. We have reduced our total headcount within the segment by 12% in fiscal 2020, which will lower our cost base going forward, and we expect additional reductions in fiscal 2021. The impact of COVID-19 remains uncertain, and we do expect continued advertising challenges. However, we will continue to focus on the digital transformation of this segment, new ways to monetize our content and continue to take aggressive cost measures as we look to provide a more stable outlook. 
At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues decreased 16% to $238 million, primarily due to a decline in listings in Australia and the U.S. related to COVID-19 and associated customer support measures. On an adjusted basis, revenues declined 13%. Segment EBITDA fell 10% to $71 million or 5% on an adjusted basis. 
REA Group revenues fell 21%, primarily reflecting FX, lower developer revenues and a 14% decline in residential listing volumes for the quarter. REA saw improvements in listings as the quarter progressed, with 11% listing volume growth in June, combined with record traffic. The volume growth was partly related to easier year-on-year comparisons which included the impact from the federal election in the prior year. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call immediately following this call for more details. 
Move revenues declined 10% to $111 million, with real estate revenues down 5%. However, the decline in real estate revenues was almost entirely due to an estimated $13 million impact related to the customer billing relief initiative. Move is also still being impacted by the transition to the referral model, given the longer time period by which revenues are recognized. Despite the transition, we remain very confident in the long-term growth potential of the referral model, including upside through incremental ancillary services. 
Similar to REA, we are also seeing record traffic at REALTOR with June achieving 86 million monthly unique users, up 18% year-over-year, combined with a greater than 50% year-on-year increase in core real estate lead volumes in June. Despite the revenue impact from COVID-19 for both the quarter and the full year, Move increased its contribution to segment EBITDA year-on-year, benefiting from the restructuring of the organization, including the integration of the teams at REALTOR and Opcity. 
Turning to the subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $407 million, down 24% versus $536 million in the prior year, which included a negative 5% impact from FX. The revenue decline was driven by fewer residential subscribers, a reduction in commercial subscribers related to the suspension of billings due to the closing of licensed venues and a decline in advertising revenues. Approximately half of the year-over-year revenue decline in the quarter was due to commercial and advertising revenues, which we believe was mostly a function of the impact from COVID-19. 
Foxtel's closing paid subscriber base was approximately 2.8 million as of June 30, down 12%, which reflects the decline in commercial subscribers, which fell to 86,000 from 264,000 in the prior year, primarily associated with COVID-19 restrictions. We expect improvements as licensed commercial venues begin to reopen, although timing is still uncertain given the recent spikes in infections in Victoria. 
Foxtel Now subscribers were also impacted by a difficult year ago comparison as the prior year benefited from the final season of Game of Thrones, but the number was stable sequentially. Pleasingly, we saw a significant decline in broadcast churn down to 13.2% compared to 14.7% in the prior year, which was the lowest in 7 quarters. The improvement was supported by the implementation of several COVID-19 mitigation measures, including opening up content tiers and offer extensions and favorable impacts from a slowdown in Telstra's NBN migration activity. Broadcast ARPU was relatively stable at AUD 78. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $104 million, up 24% from the prior year, driven by lower costs. 
Overall expenses declined about $145 million, which includes approximately $70 million of lower sports rights costs, primarily related to the suspension of live sports. Results include 1 month of expense related to the NRL and AFL, and the majority of the deferred sports costs will be recognized in fiscal 2021. I will discuss this further in the outlook commentary. 
Foxtel also benefited from lower entertainment costs from renegotiated affiliate and output deals, lower transmission costs and lower overheads due to staff reductions. 
As Robert mentioned, we are pleased with the resilience of Kayo and the early progress and level of engagement for Binge, Foxtel's new entertainment streaming service. We look forward to building on Foxtel's expanding OTT subscriber base in the year ahead. During the quarter, Foxtel also accelerated its cost transformation plan for the business, reducing its headcount by approximately 17%. This action, together with other operational efficiencies and content renegotiations will help put Foxtel in a better position longer term.  
At book publishing, HarperCollins had a strong quarter with revenues down only 3% to $407 million and segment EBITDA up 9% to $47 million despite significant bricks-and-mortar store closures, which was a far better performance than we had anticipated. We saw the strongest digital growth in recent years with total digital sales up 26% to represent 29% of consumer revenues. With the shelter in place orders related to COVID-19, e-book sales returned to robust growth, increasing 31% year-over-year with downloadable audio books also growing at a healthy 17%, despite an initial dip due to the falling individuals commuting to work. 
As Robert noted, HarperCollins benefited from a strong release slate, which included Joanna Gaines' Magnolia Table Volume 2 and a great performance from our Children's division. 
I would now like to talk about some themes in the upcoming quarter. Forecasting remains challenging, so I will discuss the trends we have seen in July. At Digital Real Estate services, as noted in their release, July new buy listings at REA were up 16%. However, residential revenue growth is expected to be offset by a reduction in development projects, listing declines in Commercial and Asia businesses and the recent government restrictions in Victoria. Please refer to REA's press release for more details. 
REALTOR is facing lower industry-wide real estate transactions, but encouragingly, lead volume and unique users remained strong, similar to June. In Subscription Video Services, advertising in July improved modestly with the return of live sports. We expect gradual recovery of commercial subscribers but timing will largely be dictated by government restrictions and the broader impact from COVID-19. Broadcast churn is modestly higher versus the prior year and the fourth quarter. On sports costs, assuming no further disruption of play, we will recognize approximately $55 million or AUD 78 million of additional sports programming rights costs, the majority of which is related to the NRL and AFL rights costs that were deferred from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021 due to the temporary sport suspension. However, we expect at least $100 million or AUD 160 million of overall savings, net of the increase in sports cost for the full year in fiscal 2021 as a result of the cost-out initiatives taken during fiscal 2020. 
At Dow Jones, subscription trends in July continued to be strong with over 25% growth in digital-only subscriptions at The Wall Street Journal. Advertising trends improved modestly in July, but with digital up very strongly. In book publishing, similar to the fourth quarter, HarperCollins continued to see strong growth in online sales in July. Retail stores are slowly reopening, albeit likely at a reduced foot traffic and continued risk from any recurrence of COVID. 
At News Media, we continue to expect advertising and single copy sales revenues to be adversely affected due to COVID-19. Advertising revenues in July at the newspaper mastheads in the segment declined 25% to 30% in total compared to the prior year. As a reminder, advertising revenues in the prior year included the results from News America Marketing. Overall decline in circulation volumes for July improved from the lows experienced early in the fourth quarter, particularly for the weekend papers. Pleasingly, we have continued to see strong digital subscriber growth at the Australian mastheads and at The Times and The Sunday Times, and we will continue to focus on cost transformation to mitigate the revenue headwinds. 
CapEx for the year is expected to be approximately $400 million compared to $434 million in fiscal 2020, subject to foreign currency fluctuations. We will be monitoring this number very closely throughout the year and will take necessary actions to reduce this amount as needed. 
And as a reminder, we have a strong balance sheet with over $1.5 billion of cash and access to a $750 million revolving credit facility. The COVID-19 crisis has presented challenges across all of our businesses, and we are very pleased with the actions that our businesses have taken to ensure they are well positioned to withstand the ongoing volatility as we move through the next 12 months. 
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

And then just secondly, advertising trends over the course of the quarter seem to get slightly worse at Dow Jones. I mean, obviously, very strong performance in the segment as a whole.

Or is there a broader sort of mandate or avenues that you think you can license from the news media content. Any thoughts would be helpful on that one. And the third one, Susan, just sorry to come back to it, but just on the COVID impacts on the quarter, if I wrote it down correctly, you're saying $330 million revenues and $40 million to $50 million of EBITDA. And obviously, a large chunk of the cost impacts of COVID are the sporting rights. So I was wondering if you could give us some color on what else is in the cost offsets for the period and how we should think about outside of sports, which you've obviously discussed, what's sustainable? Or what sort of bounces back into the cost base in '21?"

It's important in 2 ways. One, for what it defines in terms of remedies and in particular, for what it defines in terms as an industry. But",430,"I'll talk about the Australian regulations or the draft mandatory code of conduct, which is particularly important. It's important in 2 ways. One, for what it defines in terms of remedies and in particular, for what it defines in terms as an industry. But it's also part of a global discussion, whether it be the consideration in Brussels, the hearings here last week in Congress with the big 4 digital heads giving testimony, and in London. And so what you're seeing, and this is crucial, is the increase in content consciousness among regulators around the world. These are no longer mystifying issues. The issues have been clearly defined. And you saw that in Congress last week. And you see that in the ACCC Report, the original digital report, and now the draft mandatory code of conduct, which I think is quite a moment of itself, a real Internet inflection point. 
And this -- essentially, we are talking about carriage fees or retrans payments for premium journalism. And there are obviously more deals to come. Now some of those deals will be outside Australia. But I suspect, in some ways, influenced by Australian regulatory thinking. But I can assure you that not only regulators but media companies around the world and the digital platforms are watching Australia closely. Now we've obviously been fighting this fight for well over a decade. And the News Corp Board has supported the quest because it was absolutely crucial to the future of journalism. Newspapers delivered in whatever format are vital to a well-informed society. And what's obvious is the collective understanding of issues is past the point of no return, the point of no action, shall we say. But there are obviously regulatory changes to come in Australia. And the commercial landscape is not yet fully formed, but it will be a landscape far more hospitable to journalism and to News Media and to News Corp. 
Now as for your a question about the licensing of content. Clearly, we're always looking for opportunities to monetize our content. But in a digital context, we have a unique comparative advantage with global properties, which often write about similar subjects. So not only in licensing in a traditional subscription sense, but think a little bit about the segmentation of digital products, products around sport, products around lifestyle, around food, around puzzles even. So it's a real opportunity for us to divide up our content in a different way, monetize that content and provide compelling digital opportunities for potential subscribers at different price points for different content sets."

So the bulk of that reduction between reported and adjusted was due to NAM and FX. The COVID impact we're predicting in about $270 million odd, $280 odd million in order to get you to that EBITDA impact. We were expecting costs to increase slightly for the quarter because we did have increased revenue at Dow Jones and HarperCollins and some of our businesses. And what I would say in relation to the COVID impact cost is, clearly, there's a lot that are related to volume, so particularly on our mastheads around the globe. And we would expect to see those scale obviously, as those businesses scale back up. But we have also reduced headcount by 7% across the business, excluding NAM and Unruly, and that's savings that we would certainly expect to continue into the next year. We've made significant cuts on marketing. We clearly will have a look at what we think is an appropriate level for marketing going forward, and it may never be back to the level that we had pre COVID. Likewise, with most companies, we've got a lot of cost cuts coming through on TNE and other discretionary spend, which, again, when we think forward, we will review exactly what we think we need as a business in order to continue spending within that area. We've clearly got compensation cost reductions as well as a result of lower bonuses. And outside of the OpEx impact, we've got the cuts that came through in CapEx. I think I mentioned that we've cut that by third year-on-year. So clearly, as we move forward into next year, it's difficult to predict exactly that cost base is going to look like because it will all depend on the revenue trends. But we are confident that there's a significant amount of reoccurring costs that will go into next year from a cost reduction perspective. And we do actually believe that we can continue to take costs out, as we've mentioned."

These are certainly complex times, and there are few who have not been touched in some manner. The coronavirus has irrevocably changed businesses and our businesses in expediting pre-existing digital trends, in challenging established practices and in prompting necessary introspection about work habits and the workplace itself. There has been much agility and adaptation at News Corp. The vast majority of our employees across the world have been working at home, and the resilience of the company's culture has been a core component in continuity. Without doubt, digitization has accelerated. And without doubt, all of our businesses have been affected and responded with customary ingenuity. I would like to express my sincere thanks to each of our employees and their families for having responded so promptly, so intelligently and so thoughtfully to these testing circumstances. 
Evidence of that response was seen in the fourth quarter, when virtually all of our businesses prudently reduced costs, sometimes painfully to ensure that they were robust enough to cope with volatility and disruption. Preserving cash was a priority, and it is worth noting that our cash balance increased in the last quarter by $129 million to over $1.5 billion as of June 30. Revenue comparisons are obviously made complex by the sale of News America Marketing and Unruly, plus the consequences of COVID. But our adjusted revenue for the quarter declined by 13%. Obviously, the net income and EPS were affected by noncash impairments, primarily at our U.K. and Australian businesses. And Susan will be able to provide more details momentarily. However, our adjusted total segment EBITDA declined by a modest 10%. 
This is particularly significant and a somewhat historic earnings call. Regular listeners will recall that we had pledged to simplify the company and make the results more transparent. The sale of News America Marketing and Unruly certainly simplified the structure. And in the quest for transparency, beginning this quarter, we are presenting Dow Jones as a separate segment. This will highlight what we believe are 2 incontrovertible facts: the substantial and growing value of that company and its superior profit profile and prospects to those in the New York Times. In what has been a difficult year for many media companies, Dow Jones reported a 13% increase in segment EBITDA based on the strength of its professional information business and the preeminence of the Wall Street Journal. Our other global mastheads and digital information properties are gathered in the News Media segment, which will include our Australian titles, many of which are now digital-only: The Times, The Sun and Sunday Times as well as Talksport and Virgin Radio. It may be called News Media, but obviously, the segment is increasingly digital in personality, and virtually all of our mastheads had record audiences during the year. Our journalists have performed admirably in providing crucial insights to readers during the COVID crisis, delivering accurate information and analysis and providing an antidote to conspiracy theories and noxious nonsense proliferating elsewhere on the web. 
We are continuing to focus on acquiring digital subscribers and audience while rightsizing our businesses to be digital-first, which is necessarily resulting in significant cost reductions. The closure in Australia of many of our storied print editions and the emphasis on digital was further evidence of our willingness to be decisive at an epochal moment. We are very proud of our traditions, and we will always invest in the very best journalism. But the format is less important than the function. And we firmly believe that the digital reincarnation of these titles will ensure a profitable future and a continuing role in their community. We are also constantly restlessly reviewing our portfolio with a view to ensuring that we have the optimum asset mix. All of our executives understand that these are testing times and many of our executives around our businesses internationally have volunteered hefty cuts to their bonuses, which form a large part of their compensation. The Executive Chairman has forsaken 100% of his bonus, and Susan Panuccio and David Pitofsky, our General Counsel, who are with me on this call have also voluntarily given up a meaningful chunk of their bonus. All understand the importance of a stringent cost strategy, so we have launched a genuinely meaningful shared service program that we believe will transform the company by centralizing many of our functions. The mission is being led by 2 of our most talented executives, Damian Eales from Australia and Jane Viner from the U.K., in tandem with our CTO, the Global Head of HR, and CFO, in other words, Susan. The early indications are that the shared service program should be able to appreciably reduce our costs and we expect it to have a materially positive impact on our bottom line. 
We will always emphasize integrity and creativity, but our ability to prioritize imperative projects will be enhanced by the program. We expect our technology platforms to be the best-in-class at the lowest available price. And the overall level of cooperation coordination among our businesses will certainly be enhanced. This is not an ephemeral project, but one that we believe will have a fundamental impact on the way we do business and on our earnings. 
One other trend is already having an appreciable impact on our earnings, the change in terms of trade with the digital platforms. Those of you who watched the congressional testimony last week by the tech titans would have noticed overall that the political understanding of the issues has vastly improved. That is also true in Brussels, London and Australia, where the ACCC has just introduced a draft mandatory code of contact. I recommend that anyone seeking enlightenment, Google the name Rod Sims and read a few of his recent interviews. Mr. Sims chairs the ACCC. 
It is fair to say, without revealing details that we are deep in discussion with these companies and that the ecosystem has absolutely begun to evolve. For News Corp, which has been pursuing this issue for well over a decade, this favorable outcome would simply not have been possible without the leadership of Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch and the support of a board which backed advocacy even when News Corp often stood alone in pursuit of the principle of a premium for premium content. 
Now for the numbers. At the new Dow Jones segment, revenues improved in fiscal year 2020 and profitability was up 13%, as I've mentioned. At $236 million, Dow Jones full segment -- full year segment EBITDA was the highest in separation, as were margins. Digital revenue surpassed $1 billion in fiscal '20 for the first time and represented 66% of total revenues, rising to 70% for the fourth quarter. We saw strong circulation volume growth, with digital-only subscriptions increasing 23% year-over-year for the Wall Street Journal in Q4 and 51% for the Barron's Group. MarketWatch, our finance website reported the highest annual revenue numbers in the brand's history, making it the third year in a row of record-breaking results. Equally impressive, unique users more than doubled to $62 million in the month of June. 
In contrast to most COVID affected media sites, digital advertising was down only 7% in the quarter and the general shift towards digital as a source of revenue continues, with that segment representing 54% of advertising revenues in the quarter. We expect that digital will continue to outpace print, given we are seeing robust digital advertising despite the social and commercial volatility that has prompted many companies to be cautious in marketing spend. Even with the pandemic impact, digital advertising at Dow Jones was 4% higher for the year. 
Full year revenues for the professional information business rose 7% year-over-year, driven by Risk & Compliance, which surged 20%. We remain particularly excited by the prospects for our Risk & Compliance business, given the intensification of regulatory scrutiny around the world. As we have noted on this call in the past, who among you does not want to minimize risk and maximize compliance? We are expanding our risk-related product lines, enhancing our software and ensuring that the increased flow of actionable intelligence is complemented by thoughtful analysis and compelling news feeds for our growing audience of clients. We contend that the all digital Risk & Compliance business is a highly undervalued part of a highly undervalued company, given the revenue trajectory, the still expanding market and the necessity for companies and individuals to have an audit trial of compliance. 
The creation of the Dow Jones segment allows us to make a direct comparison with The New York Times, and on most important measures, the Wall Street Journal and the Board of Dow Jones performed far better. The Journal is both the most trusted general newspaper in the U.S. according to Reuters Institute and the world's leading business use provider. And a vast, well-healed, well-informed audience provides an opportunity to upsell value-added lucrative business products to serve a specialist need. 
Here are a few metrics comparing the 2 companies for the quarter. Dow Jones segment EBITDA of $60 million was higher than in New York Times, having benefited from the stability of our vibrant professional information business. While Dow Jones segment EBITDA expanded by 13% year-over-year, New York Times declined by 6%. Dow Jones EBITDA margins were 15.7%, about 3 percentage points higher than the New York Times. In this time of COVID, Dow Jones revenue decline moderated at a higher rate than the New York times at 4% versus down over 7% for The Times. Dow Jones COVID-affected advertising revenue declined at a much lower rate than The Times, thanks largely to significant outperformance in digital advertising which was down just 7% at Dow Jones versus down 32% at The New York Times. In fact, Dow Jones generated more total ad dollars than The New York Times. 
We feel strongly that we should explain the virtues of Dow Jones to shareholders and potential shareholders so we will have an Investor Day in mid-September at which Dow Jones Chief Executive, Almar Latour, and other Dow Jones Executives and myself, will give you a more granular explanation of the company's extraordinary potential and an opportunity for you to interrogate. 
The News Media segment, of course, had a challenging year, and we took prompt measures to confront those challenges. These included the aforementioned sales of NAM and Unruly as well as immediate cost reductions and the launch of strategic shared service project. In Australia, apart from migrating publications to digital only, we also sold our investment in the Australian associated press newswire and unfortunately, implemented hundreds of redundancies. The end of the relationship with AAP was both necessary and historic as the service was founded in 1935 by Sir Keith Murdoch. 
Digital subscriptions across News Corp Australia rose 25% to nearly 650,000 by the end of the fiscal year. Meanwhile, at News U.K., The Times and The Sunday Times paid subscribers rose to 336,000, an increase of 11% year-over-year and benefited from a focus on attracting premium subscribers with a concomitant improvement in retention rates. The Sun's online audience expanded markedly during the year, including with the launch of a U.S. edition. In toto, The Sun reported 133 million unique users globally in June for 1 month, which also reflects our expansion in the U.S. Importantly, The Sun remains as the leading news brand in the U.K. according to Pamco. 
The sheer scale of our collective reach should not be underestimated. In the U.S., The New York Post digital network reached 177 million monthly unique users during the fourth quarter. It has long been known that The Post has been loss-making, but those losses have fallen dramatically in the past 18 months as we increased cover prices and benefited from ad revenue for our expanding digital readership and reduced the cost base. We can now see a clear path to profitability for The Post. 
In book publishing, despite the viral vicissitudes, which included the near shutdown of U.S. physical stores, profitability was up in Q4. This is a testament to the resourcefulness of the team at HarperCollins, which moved quickly to bolster supply chains and emphasize e-books and online sales. These actions allowed us to make the most of changes in reading behavior during the pandemic. 
As we had indicated on previous calls, the second half of the fiscal year at HarperCollins was more propitious than the first half, with segment EBITDA improvement in both Q3 and Q4. Among the titles that performed well were the latest installment of Joanna Gaines' highly successful Magnolia Table series, Dutch House by Ann Patchett, The One and Only Bob by Katherine Applegate and World's Worst Parents by David Williams. 
Looking ahead to fiscal '21, we're already eagerly anticipating the release of Tiger Woods' autobiography, and expect strong results from the upcoming launch of Jenna Bush Hager's, Everything Beautiful in Its Time. We're certainly pleased by the early performance of Daniel Silver's, The Order and Ben Shapiro's, How to Destroy America in 3 Easy Steps, and we expect much from Lebron James' first children's book, I Promise, scheduled for release next Tuesday. 
In digital real estate services, REA's traffic and lead volume have rebounded in the wake of the shutdown in Australia, with record audiences in June and a dramatic increase in users potentially interested in a house move. There is simply no doubt that the COVID crisis has prompted many families to consider their housing circumstances, and that ultra-low interest rates have made a move more possible. We noted similar trends in the U.S. at realtor.com, and we saw a significant improvement in profitability at Move, which runs the realtor.com site in the fourth quarter and for the year as a whole. 
The new leadership team at Move is working closely with the Dow Jones' executive team as the combined audience and lucrative demographic of the 2 sites in the U.S. is a hefty $124 million based on comScore statistics as of June. We are confident that the Dow Jones sites will provide a flow of potential buyers for realtor.com and that realtor.com will provide a flow of potential subscriptions for the WSJ and Barron's. 
Also in Australia, at Foxtel, our emphasis on streaming has brought a leap in new customers for both Kayo, the sports streaming service, and Binge, our entertainment offering, which has just launched. As of August 4, Kayo, showing great resilience, had 590,000 subscribers, including 48,000 trialists, while Binge had 217,000 subscribers, which includes 185,000 paying, just a short time after its formal launch. Both services are making the most of our existing rights without incurring extra content expenses and are certainly expanding the reach of Foxtel, which has now approached a new record number of total subscribers following an acceleration in July. Just this week, we crossed the 1 million OTT paying subscriber mark, setting a new record, thanks to our expanded streaming strategy. 
While there is certainly seasonality to Kayo, given the scheduling of the popular winter sports, we are reassured that so many subscribers have returned to the service so promptly and particularly encouraged by the early rush of subscribers at Binge. Our past acquisition of cricket rights means that we are well positioned when the Indian cricket teams arrive in Australia later this year. 
On our last call, you will recall that I insisted that there would be a reset of sports prices. And in the midst of this year's shortened season, that has absolutely come to pass. While negotiations with some sports continue, deals already completed will reduce the cost of sports rights at Foxtel by at least AUD 180 million over the next 3 years as compared to the prior contracted value. This reset will have a positive long-term impact on Foxtel's profitability. 
No doubt, the events of the first half of calendar year 2020 will remain resonant in our memories. I am particularly proud of the performance of all those who work at News Corp for showing professionalism, passion and compassion throughout these most difficult of times. Our reporters and opinion writers around the world have provided a profoundly important service, and many of our employees have contributed to their communities through philanthropic service in recent months. 
And now for more granular detail and customary insight, Susan."

Before talking through our fiscal 20 results, I would like to recap on the actions we've taken this past year to better position News Corp for long-term success with a focus on increasing shareholder value and transparency. Firstly, the",2850,"Thank you, Robert. Before talking through our fiscal 20 results, I would like to recap on the actions we've taken this past year to better position News Corp for long-term success with a focus on increasing shareholder value and transparency. Firstly, the company has taken significant action on our cost base. Our publishing business in Australia has been significantly restructured with 112 of our regional and community markets transitioning to digital or closed. The cost base at Foxtel has been restructured with savings across programming and support functions. With increasing OTT scale and a lower cost base, Foxtel is better positioned for success, and I would like to reiterate that we have no plans to provide additional funding. 
Our digital real estate businesses have also been proactive in reducing headcount to confront the challenges of COVID-19. In addition, we took quick and decisive action to reduce OpEx and CapEx in the fourth quarter with CapEx reducing by 1/3 year-on-year and total costs decreasing 21% year-on-year, partially due to divestments in FX, but primarily due to active cost management. We are also close to finalizing our savings opportunities for global shared services across the company as we look to leverage our global scale and reduce duplication. These collective actions resulted in a 7% reduction in headcount this year across the businesses, excluding the NAM and Unruly sales. Secondly, Dow Jones results are now reported as a separate segment, which better highlights its performance and provides a more complete comparison with its peers. The business saw record subscriptions and achieved growth in both revenue and EBITDA for the year. Thirdly, we are taking tangible steps to stabilize our newly formed News Media segment through digital subscriber growth, cover price increases and aggressive cost targets, which will be further enhanced by our global shared service initiative. 
In relation to liquidity, the only debt exposures we have are at our non 100% owned subsidiaries, Foxtel and REA, and these are nonrecourse to News Corp. Finally, as part of our simplification efforts, we continue to reshape News Corp's portfolio this year with the divestments of News America Marketing and Unruly. With that as a backdrop, I will now discuss our latest financial results. 
Fiscal 2020 fourth quarter total revenues were approximately $1.9 billion, down 22% versus the prior year, reflecting the impacts of COVID-19 and the divestment of News America Marketing in early May. Total segment EBITDA was $195 million, down 28% versus the prior year. Excluding the divestment of NAM, acquisitions, currency fluctuations and the other items disclosed in our release, adjusted revenues fell 13% and adjusted total segment EBITDA decreased 10% as growth in segment EBITDA at the Dow Jones, book Publishing and subscription video services segments were outweighed by the negative impact of COVID-19. Our best estimate for the revenue impact of COVID-19 for the quarter was negative $330 million or 13%, together with a negative impact on total segment EBITDA estimated to be between $40 million to $55 million or 15% to 20%. For the quarter, we reported a net loss per share of $0.67 as compared to a net loss per share of $0.09 in the prior year. The loss includes $292 million of noncash impairment charges primarily related to fixed assets in the U.K. and Australia. Adjusted earnings per share were negative $0.03 in the quarter compared to positive $0.07 in the prior year. 
Moving on to the quarterly results for the individual reporting segments, starting with Dow Jones. Revenues for the quarter were $381 million, down 4% compared to the prior year, with digital revenues accounting for a record 71% of total revenues this quarter. Circulation revenues rose 2% due to robust growth in digital circulation revenues, partially offset by lower print circulation revenues, which were impacted by the decline in newsstand sales and fewer amenity copies primarily related to COVID-19. As Robert mentioned, Dow Jones again achieved record subscriptions in the quarter and saw an acceleration in year-over-year growth compared to the prior quarter. Dow Jones average subscriptions for the quarter were almost 3.8 million, up 15% from the prior year. And of that, digital-only subscriptions were 2.8 million, up 28% year-over-year. For the Wall Street Journal, there were approximately 3 million total subscriptions for the quarter, up 15% from the prior year, with digital-only subscriptions growing 23% to more than 2.2 million, improving from the 15% year-over-year growth rate in the prior quarter. To frame the improvement, we added 203,000 Wall Street Journal digital-only subscriptions this quarter compared to 112,000 in the third quarter and 43,000 in the prior year. 
Revenues from Dow Jones Professional Information business rose 6% year-over-year, slightly higher than the third quarter rate, driven by 14% revenue growth at Risk & Compliance. Consistent with our expectations, Risk & Compliance revenues reached approximately $160 million for fiscal 2020. As we mentioned last quarter, advertising revenues, which accounted for only 19% of revenues this quarter were impacted by COVID-19 and declined 28% to $71 million. For the first time, digital advertising revenue was greater than print, accounting for 54% of total advertising revenues for the quarter. 
Digital advertising revenues fell 7%, helped by strong growth in programmatic while print advertising was down 43%, which included the impact from the cancellation of live events. Total unique visitors across our Dow Jones Digital platforms more than doubled in the quarter versus the prior year. 
Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter rose 13% to $60 million. 
Turning to our other news segment, News Media, which primarily includes News Australia, News U.K. and the New York Post and the News America Marketing and Unruly companies prior to their disposal. Revenues for the quarter were $490 million, down 41% versus the prior year, of which the impact from the divestment of News America Marketing accounted for over half of the total revenue decline. On an adjusted basis, which excludes NAM, Unruly and the other items mentioned in our release, revenues declined 22%. Advertising revenue fell 58% on a reported basis, of which $179 million or 36% of the decline was from the sale of News America Marketing, and the rest of the decline was driven by the negative impact from COVID-19, weaknesses in the print advertising market and a $20 million or 4% negative impact related to the suspension of certain community titles in Australia. Advertising revenues at News U.K. fell 46% on a reported basis and 45% in local currency, relatively consistent with our April commentary, with lower print trends, partially offset by strong digital advertising growth at The Sun. Performance was similar in Australia, with advertising down 46% on a reported basis and 42% in local currency, which includes the negative impact related to the suspension of certain community titles. Circulation and subscription revenues declined 9%, impacted by lower news stand sales related to COVID-19, partially offset by strong digital paid subscriber growth and cover price increases in Australia. Segment EBITDA for the quarter was a loss of $44 million, down $95 million from the prior year. The divestment of News America Marketing accounted for $43 million of the year-over-year decline. Also included in the results are approximately $8 million of additional cost related to the decommissioning of print operations in Australia. 
It is important to note that we do not expect this to be the new normal, and we are taking significant and decisive steps to improve the trajectory of the segment, including better monetizing our growing and global audience and further cost reductions. These include leveraging existing content to source incremental licensing revenues. We believe that we are very well positioned to benefit from incremental licensing revenues as early as this fiscal year, which should have a meaningful impact on EBITDA. Our biggest source of revenues in the News Media segment is now circulation and subscription. We expect continued growth in our digital subscriptions, and we will be looking at cover and subscription prices to help offset print advertising declines. Our global shared service initiative, which we expect to centralize many of our back-office functions and remove duplication. We'll also continue to work on newsroom transformation and the ongoing review of our printing sites and office space. We have reduced our total headcount within the segment by 12% in fiscal 2020, which will lower our cost base going forward, and we expect additional reductions in fiscal 2021. The impact of COVID-19 remains uncertain, and we do expect continued advertising challenges. However, we will continue to focus on the digital transformation of this segment, new ways to monetize our content and continue to take aggressive cost measures as we look to provide a more stable outlook. 
At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues decreased 16% to $238 million, primarily due to a decline in listings in Australia and the U.S. related to COVID-19 and associated customer support measures. On an adjusted basis, revenues declined 13%. Segment EBITDA fell 10% to $71 million or 5% on an adjusted basis. 
REA Group revenues fell 21%, primarily reflecting FX, lower developer revenues and a 14% decline in residential listing volumes for the quarter. REA saw improvements in listings as the quarter progressed, with 11% listing volume growth in June, combined with record traffic. The volume growth was partly related to easier year-on-year comparisons which included the impact from the federal election in the prior year. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call immediately following this call for more details. 
Move revenues declined 10% to $111 million, with real estate revenues down 5%. However, the decline in real estate revenues was almost entirely due to an estimated $13 million impact related to the customer billing relief initiative. Move is also still being impacted by the transition to the referral model, given the longer time period by which revenues are recognized. Despite the transition, we remain very confident in the long-term growth potential of the referral model, including upside through incremental ancillary services. 
Similar to REA, we are also seeing record traffic at REALTOR with June achieving 86 million monthly unique users, up 18% year-over-year, combined with a greater than 50% year-on-year increase in core real estate lead volumes in June. Despite the revenue impact from COVID-19 for both the quarter and the full year, Move increased its contribution to segment EBITDA year-on-year, benefiting from the restructuring of the organization, including the integration of the teams at REALTOR and Opcity. 
Turning to the subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $407 million, down 24% versus $536 million in the prior year, which included a negative 5% impact from FX. The revenue decline was driven by fewer residential subscribers, a reduction in commercial subscribers related to the suspension of billings due to the closing of licensed venues and a decline in advertising revenues. Approximately half of the year-over-year revenue decline in the quarter was due to commercial and advertising revenues, which we believe was mostly a function of the impact from COVID-19. 
Foxtel's closing paid subscriber base was approximately 2.8 million as of June 30, down 12%, which reflects the decline in commercial subscribers, which fell to 86,000 from 264,000 in the prior year, primarily associated with COVID-19 restrictions. We expect improvements as licensed commercial venues begin to reopen, although timing is still uncertain given the recent spikes in infections in Victoria. 
Foxtel Now subscribers were also impacted by a difficult year ago comparison as the prior year benefited from the final season of Game of Thrones, but the number was stable sequentially. Pleasingly, we saw a significant decline in broadcast churn down to 13.2% compared to 14.7% in the prior year, which was the lowest in 7 quarters. The improvement was supported by the implementation of several COVID-19 mitigation measures, including opening up content tiers and offer extensions and favorable impacts from a slowdown in Telstra's NBN migration activity. Broadcast ARPU was relatively stable at AUD 78. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $104 million, up 24% from the prior year, driven by lower costs. 
Overall expenses declined about $145 million, which includes approximately $70 million of lower sports rights costs, primarily related to the suspension of live sports. Results include 1 month of expense related to the NRL and AFL, and the majority of the deferred sports costs will be recognized in fiscal 2021. I will discuss this further in the outlook commentary. 
Foxtel also benefited from lower entertainment costs from renegotiated affiliate and output deals, lower transmission costs and lower overheads due to staff reductions. 
As Robert mentioned, we are pleased with the resilience of Kayo and the early progress and level of engagement for Binge, Foxtel's new entertainment streaming service. We look forward to building on Foxtel's expanding OTT subscriber base in the year ahead. During the quarter, Foxtel also accelerated its cost transformation plan for the business, reducing its headcount by approximately 17%. This action, together with other operational efficiencies and content renegotiations will help put Foxtel in a better position longer term.  
At book publishing, HarperCollins had a strong quarter with revenues down only 3% to $407 million and segment EBITDA up 9% to $47 million despite significant bricks-and-mortar store closures, which was a far better performance than we had anticipated. We saw the strongest digital growth in recent years with total digital sales up 26% to represent 29% of consumer revenues. With the shelter in place orders related to COVID-19, e-book sales returned to robust growth, increasing 31% year-over-year with downloadable audio books also growing at a healthy 17%, despite an initial dip due to the falling individuals commuting to work. 
As Robert noted, HarperCollins benefited from a strong release slate, which included Joanna Gaines' Magnolia Table Volume 2 and a great performance from our Children's division. 
I would now like to talk about some themes in the upcoming quarter. Forecasting remains challenging, so I will discuss the trends we have seen in July. At Digital Real Estate services, as noted in their release, July new buy listings at REA were up 16%. However, residential revenue growth is expected to be offset by a reduction in development projects, listing declines in Commercial and Asia businesses and the recent government restrictions in Victoria. Please refer to REA's press release for more details. 
REALTOR is facing lower industry-wide real estate transactions, but encouragingly, lead volume and unique users remained strong, similar to June. In Subscription Video Services, advertising in July improved modestly with the return of live sports. We expect gradual recovery of commercial subscribers but timing will largely be dictated by government restrictions and the broader impact from COVID-19. Broadcast churn is modestly higher versus the prior year and the fourth quarter. On sports costs, assuming no further disruption of play, we will recognize approximately $55 million or AUD 78 million of additional sports programming rights costs, the majority of which is related to the NRL and AFL rights costs that were deferred from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021 due to the temporary sport suspension. However, we expect at least $100 million or AUD 160 million of overall savings, net of the increase in sports cost for the full year in fiscal 2021 as a result of the cost-out initiatives taken during fiscal 2020. 
At Dow Jones, subscription trends in July continued to be strong with over 25% growth in digital-only subscriptions at The Wall Street Journal. Advertising trends improved modestly in July, but with digital up very strongly. In book publishing, similar to the fourth quarter, HarperCollins continued to see strong growth in online sales in July. Retail stores are slowly reopening, albeit likely at a reduced foot traffic and continued risk from any recurrence of COVID. 
At News Media, we continue to expect advertising and single copy sales revenues to be adversely affected due to COVID-19. Advertising revenues in July at the newspaper mastheads in the segment declined 25% to 30% in total compared to the prior year. As a reminder, advertising revenues in the prior year included the results from News America Marketing. Overall decline in circulation volumes for July improved from the lows experienced early in the fourth quarter, particularly for the weekend papers. Pleasingly, we have continued to see strong digital subscriber growth at the Australian mastheads and at The Times and The Sunday Times, and we will continue to focus on cost transformation to mitigate the revenue headwinds. 
CapEx for the year is expected to be approximately $400 million compared to $434 million in fiscal 2020, subject to foreign currency fluctuations. We will be monitoring this number very closely throughout the year and will take necessary actions to reduce this amount as needed. 
And as a reminder, we have a strong balance sheet with over $1.5 billion of cash and access to a $750 million revolving credit facility. The COVID-19 crisis has presented challenges across all of our businesses, and we are very pleased with the actions that our businesses have taken to ensure they are well positioned to withstand the ongoing volatility as we move through the next 12 months. 
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

And then just secondly, advertising trends over the course of the quarter seem to get slightly worse at Dow Jones. I mean, obviously, very strong performance in the segment as a whole.

And the third one, Susan, just sorry to come back to it, but just on the COVID impacts on the quarter, if I wrote it down correctly, you're saying $330 million revenues and $40 million to $50 million of EBITDA. And obviously, a large chunk of the cost impacts of COVID are the sporting rights. So I was wondering if you could give us some color on what else is in the cost offsets for the period and how we should think about outside of sports, which you've obviously discussed, what's sustainable? Or what sort of bounces back into the cost base in '21?"

But",430,"I'll talk about the Australian regulations or the draft mandatory code of conduct, which is particularly important. It's important in 2 ways. One, for what it defines in terms of remedies and in particular, for what it defines in terms as an industry. But it's also part of a global discussion, whether it be the consideration in Brussels, the hearings here last week in Congress with the big 4 digital heads giving testimony, and in London. And so what you're seeing, and this is crucial, is the increase in content consciousness among regulators around the world. These are no longer mystifying issues. The issues have been clearly defined. And you saw that in Congress last week. And you see that in the ACCC Report, the original digital report, and now the draft mandatory code of conduct, which I think is quite a moment of itself, a real Internet inflection point. 
And this -- essentially, we are talking about carriage fees or retrans payments for premium journalism. And there are obviously more deals to come. Now some of those deals will be outside Australia. But I suspect, in some ways, influenced by Australian regulatory thinking. But I can assure you that not only regulators but media companies around the world and the digital platforms are watching Australia closely. Now we've obviously been fighting this fight for well over a decade. And the News Corp Board has supported the quest because it was absolutely crucial to the future of journalism. Newspapers delivered in whatever format are vital to a well-informed society. And what's obvious is the collective understanding of issues is past the point of no return, the point of no action, shall we say. But there are obviously regulatory changes to come in Australia. And the commercial landscape is not yet fully formed, but it will be a landscape far more hospitable to journalism and to News Media and to News Corp. 
Now as for your a question about the licensing of content. Clearly, we're always looking for opportunities to monetize our content. But in a digital context, we have a unique comparative advantage with global properties, which often write about similar subjects. So not only in licensing in a traditional subscription sense, but think a little bit about the segmentation of digital products, products around sport, products around lifestyle, around food, around puzzles even. So it's a real opportunity for us to divide up our content in a different way, monetize that content and provide compelling digital opportunities for potential subscribers at different price points for different content sets."

So the bulk of that reduction between reported and adjusted was due to NAM and FX. The COVID impact we're predicting in about $270 million odd, $280 odd million in order to get you to that EBITDA impact. We were expecting costs to increase slightly for the quarter because we did have increased revenue at Dow Jones and HarperCollins and some of our businesses. And what I would say in relation to the COVID impact cost is, clearly, there's a lot that are related to volume, so particularly on our mastheads around the globe. And we would expect to see those scale obviously, as those businesses scale back up. But we have also reduced headcount by 7% across the business, excluding NAM and Unruly, and that's savings that we would certainly expect to continue into the next year. We've made significant cuts on marketing. We clearly will have a look at what we think is an appropriate level for marketing going forward, and it may never be back to the level that we had pre COVID. Likewise, with most companies, we've got a lot of cost cuts coming through on TNE and other discretionary spend, which again, when we think forward, we will review exactly what we think we need as a business in order to continue spending within that area. We've clearly got compensation cost reductions as well as a result of lower bonuses. And outside of the OpEx impact, we've got the cuts that came through in CapEx. I think I mentioned that we've cut that by third year-on-year. So clearly, as we move forward into next year, it's difficult to predict exactly that cost base is going to look like because it will all depend on the revenue trends. But we are confident that there's a significant amount of reoccurring costs that will go into next year from a cost reduction perspective. And we do actually believe that we can continue to take costs out, as we've mentioned."

These are certainly complex times, and there are few who have not been touched in some manner. The coronavirus has irrevocably changed businesses and our businesses in expediting pre-existing digital trends, in challenging established practices and in prompting necessary introspection about work habits and the workplace itself. There has been much agility and adaptation at News Corp. The vast majority of our employees across the world have been working at home, and the resilience of the company's culture has been a core component in continuity. Without doubt, digitization has accelerated. And without doubt, all of our businesses have been affected and responded with customary ingenuity. I would like to express my sincere thanks to each of our employees and their families for having responded so promptly, so intelligently and so thoughtfully to these testing circumstances. 
Evidence of that response was seen in the fourth quarter, when virtually all of our businesses prudently reduced costs, sometimes painfully to ensure that they were robust enough to cope with volatility and disruption. Preserving cash was a priority, and it is worth noting that our cash balance increased in the last quarter by $129 million to over $1.5 billion as of June 30. Revenue comparisons are obviously made complex by the sale of News America Marketing and Unruly, plus the consequences of COVID. But our adjusted revenue for the quarter declined by 13%. Obviously, the net income and EPS were affected by noncash impairments, primarily at our U.K. and Australian businesses. And Susan will be able to provide more details momentarily. However, our adjusted total segment EBITDA declined by a modest 10%. 
This is particularly significant and a somewhat historic earnings call. Regular listeners will recall that we had pledged to simplify the company and make the results more transparent. The sale of News America Marketing and Unruly certainly simplified the structure. And in the quest for transparency, beginning this quarter, we are presenting Dow Jones as a separate segment. This will highlight what we believe are 2 incontrovertible facts: the substantial and growing value of that company and its superior profit profile and prospects to those in the New York Times. In what has been a difficult year for many media companies, Dow Jones reported a 13% increase in segment EBITDA based on the strength of its professional information business and the preeminence of the Wall Street Journal. Our other global mastheads and digital information properties are gathered in the News Media segment, which will include our Australian titles, many of which are now digital-only: The Times, The Sun and Sunday Times as well as Talksport and Virgin Radio. It may be called News Media, but obviously, the segment is increasingly digital in personality, and virtually all of our mastheads had record audiences during the year. Our journalists have performed admirably in providing crucial insights to readers during the COVID crisis, delivering accurate information and analysis and providing an antidote to conspiracy theories and noxious nonsense proliferating elsewhere on the web. 
We are continuing to focus on acquiring digital subscribers and audience while rightsizing our businesses to be digital-first, which is necessarily resulting in significant cost reductions. The closure in Australia of many of our storied print editions and the emphasis on digital was further evidence of our willingness to be decisive at an epochal moment. We are very proud of our traditions, and we will always invest in the very best journalism. But the format is less important than the function. And we firmly believe that the digital reincarnation of these titles will ensure a profitable future and a continuing role in their community. We are also constantly restlessly reviewing our portfolio with a view to ensuring that we have the optimum asset mix. All of our executives understand that these are testing times and many of our executives around our businesses internationally have volunteered hefty cuts to their bonuses, which form a large part of their compensation. The Executive Chairman has forsaken 100% of his bonus, and Susan Panuccio and David Pitofsky, our General Counsel, who are with me on this call have also voluntarily given up a meaningful chunk of their bonus. All understand the importance of a stringent cost strategy, so we have launched a genuinely meaningful shared service program that we believe will transform the company by centralizing many of our functions. The mission is being led by 2 of our most talented executives, Damian Eales from Australia and Jane Viner from the U.K., in tandem with our CTO, the Global Head of HR, and CFO, in other words, Susan. The early indications are that the shared service program should be able to appreciably reduce our costs and we expect it to have a materially positive impact on our bottom line. 
We will always emphasize integrity and creativity, but our ability to prioritize imperative projects will be enhanced by the program. We expect our technology platforms to be the best-in-class at the lowest available price. And the overall level of cooperation coordination among our businesses will certainly be enhanced. This is not an ephemeral project, but one that we believe will have a fundamental impact on the way we do business and on our earnings. 
One other trend is already having an appreciable impact on our earnings, the change in terms of trade with the digital platforms. Those of you who watched the congressional testimony last week by the tech titans would have noticed overall that the political understanding of the issues has vastly improved. That is also true in Brussels, London and Australia, where the ACCC has just introduced a draft mandatory code of contact. I recommend that anyone seeking enlightenment, Google the name Rod Sims and read a few of his recent interviews. Mr. Sims chairs the ACCC. 
It is fair to say, without revealing details that we are deep in discussion with these companies and that the ecosystem has absolutely begun to evolve. For News Corp, which has been pursuing this issue for well over a decade, this favorable outcome would simply not have been possible without the leadership of Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch and the support of a board which backed advocacy even when News Corp often stood alone in pursuit of the principle of a premium for premium content. 
Now for the numbers. At the new Dow Jones segment, revenues improved in fiscal year 2020 and profitability was up 13%, as I've mentioned. At $236 million, Dow Jones full segment -- full year segment EBITDA was the highest in separation, as were margins. Digital revenue surpassed $1 billion in fiscal '20 for the first time and represented 66% of total revenues, rising to 70% for the fourth quarter. We saw strong circulation volume growth, with digital-only subscriptions increasing 23% year-over-year for the Wall Street Journal in Q4 and 51% for the Barron's Group. MarketWatch, our finance website reported the highest annual revenue numbers in the brand's history, making it the third year in a row of record-breaking results. Equally impressive, unique users more than doubled to $62 million in the month of June. 
In contrast to most COVID affected media sites, digital advertising was down only 7% in the quarter and the general shift towards digital as a source of revenue continues, with that segment representing 54% of advertising revenues in the quarter. We expect that digital will continue to outpace print, given we are seeing robust digital advertising despite the social and commercial volatility that has prompted many companies to be cautious in marketing spend. Even with the pandemic impact, digital advertising at Dow Jones was 4% higher for the year. 
Full year revenues for the professional information business rose 7% year-over-year, driven by Risk & Compliance, which surged 20%. We remain particularly excited by the prospects for our Risk & Compliance business, given the intensification of regulatory scrutiny around the world. As we have noted on this call in the past, who among you does not want to minimize risk and maximize compliance? We are expanding our risk-related product lines, enhancing our software and ensuring that the increased flow of actionable intelligence is complemented by thoughtful analysis and compelling news feeds for our growing audience of clients. We contend that the all digital Risk & Compliance business is a highly undervalued part of a highly undervalued company, given the revenue trajectory, the still expanding market and the necessity for companies and individuals to have an audit trial of compliance. 
The creation of the Dow Jones segment allows us to make a direct comparison with The New York Times, and on most important measures, the Wall Street Journal and the Board of Dow Jones performed far better. The Journal is both the most trusted general newspaper in the U.S. according to Reuters Institute and the world's leading business use provider. And a vast, well-healed, well-informed audience provides an opportunity to upsell value-added lucrative business products to serve a specialist need. 
Here are a few metrics comparing the 2 companies for the quarter. Dow Jones segment EBITDA of $60 million was higher than in New York Times, having benefited from the stability of our vibrant professional information business. While Dow Jones segment EBITDA expanded by 13% year-over-year, New York Times declined by 6%. Dow Jones EBITDA margins were 15.7%, about 3 percentage points higher than the New York Times. In this time of COVID, Dow Jones revenue decline moderated at a higher rate than the New York times at 4% versus down over 7% for The Times. Dow Jones COVID-affected advertising revenue declined at a much lower rate than The Times, thanks largely to significant outperformance in digital advertising which was down just 7% at Dow Jones versus down 32% at The New York Times. In fact, Dow Jones generated more total ad dollars than The New York Times. 
We feel strongly that we should explain the virtues of Dow Jones to shareholders and potential shareholders so we will have an Investor Day in mid-September at which Dow Jones Chief Executive, Almar Latour, and other Dow Jones Executives and myself, will give you a more granular explanation of the company's extraordinary potential and an opportunity for you to interrogate. 
The News Media segment, of course, had a challenging year, and we took prompt measures to confront those challenges. These included the aforementioned sales of NAM and Unruly as well as immediate cost reductions and the launch of strategic shared service project. In Australia, apart from migrating publications to digital only, we also sold our investment in the Australian associated press newswire and unfortunately, implemented hundreds of redundancies. The end of the relationship with AAP was both necessary and historic as the service was founded in 1935 by Sir Keith Murdoch. 
Digital subscriptions across News Corp Australia rose 25% to nearly 650,000 by the end of the fiscal year. Meanwhile, at News U.K., The Times and The Sunday Times paid subscribers rose to 336,000, an increase of 11% year-over-year and benefited from a focus on attracting premium subscribers with a concomitant improvement in retention rates. The Sun's online audience expanded markedly during the year, including with the launch of a U.S. edition. In total, The Sun reported 133 million unique users globally in June for 1 month, which also reflects our expansion in the U.S. Importantly, The Sun remains as the leading news brand in the U.K. according to Pamco. 
The sheer scale of our collective reach should not be underestimated. In the U.S., The New York Post digital network reached 177 million monthly unique users during the fourth quarter. It has long been known that The Post has been loss-making, but those losses have fallen dramatically in the past 18 months as we increased cover prices and benefited from ad revenue for our expanding digital readership and reduced the cost base. We can now see a clear path to profitability for The Post. 
In book publishing, despite the viral vicissitudes, which included the near shutdown of U.S. physical stores, profitability was up in Q4. This is a testament to the resourcefulness of the team at HarperCollins, which moved quickly to bolster supply chains and emphasize e-books and online sales. These actions allowed us to make the most of changes in reading behavior during the pandemic. 
As we had indicated on previous calls, the second half of the fiscal year at HarperCollins was more propitious than the first half, with segment EBITDA improvement in both Q3 and Q4. Among the titles that performed well were the latest installment of Joanna Gaines' highly successful Magnolia Table series, Dutch House by Ann Patchett, The One and Only Bob by Katherine Applegate and World's Worst Parents by David Williams. 
Looking ahead to fiscal '21, we're already eagerly anticipating the release of Tiger Woods' autobiography, and expect strong results from the upcoming launch of Jenna Bush Hager's, Everything Beautiful in Its Time. We're certainly pleased by the early performance of Daniel Silver's, The Order and Ben Shapiro's, How to Destroy America in 3 Easy Steps, and we expect much from Lebron James' first children's book, I Promise, scheduled for release next Tuesday. 
In digital real estate services, REA's traffic and lead volume have rebounded in the wake of the shutdown in Australia, with record audiences in June and a dramatic increase in users potentially interested in a house move. There is simply no doubt that the COVID crisis has prompted many families to consider their housing circumstances, and that ultra-low interest rates have made a move more possible. We noted similar trends in the U.S. at realtor.com, and we saw a significant improvement in profitability at Move, which runs the realtor.com site in the fourth quarter and for the year as a whole. 
The new leadership team at Move is working closely with the Dow Jones' executive team as the combined audience and lucrative demographic of the 2 sites in the U.S. is a hefty $124 million based on comScore statistics as of June. We are confident that the Dow Jones sites will provide a flow of potential buyers for realtor.com and that realtor.com will provide a flow of potential subscriptions for the WSJ and Barron's. 
Also in Australia, at Foxtel, our emphasis on streaming has brought a leap in new customers for both Kayo, the sports streaming service, and Binge, our entertainment offering, which has just launched. As of August 4, Kayo, showing great resilience, had 590,000 subscribers, including 48,000 trialists, while Binge had 217,000 subscribers, which includes 185,000 paying, just a short time after its formal launch. Both services are making the most of our existing rights without incurring extra content expenses and are certainly expanding the reach of Foxtel, which has now approached a new record number of total subscribers following an acceleration in July. Just this week, we crossed the 1 million OTT paying subscriber mark, setting a new record, thanks to our expanded streaming strategy. 
While there is certainly seasonality to Kayo, given the scheduling of the popular winter sports, we are reassured that so many subscribers have returned to the service so promptly and particularly encouraged by the early rush of subscribers at Binge. Our past acquisition of cricket rights means that we are well positioned when the Indian cricket teams arrive in Australia later this year. 
On our last call, you will recall that I insisted that there would be a reset of sports prices. And in the midst of this year's shortened season, that has absolutely come to pass. While negotiations with some sports continue, deals already completed will reduce the cost of sports rights at Foxtel by at least AUD 180 million over the next 3 years as compared to the prior contracted value. This reset will have a positive long-term impact on Foxtel's profitability. 
No doubt, the events of the first half of calendar year 2020 will remain resonant in our memories. I am particularly proud of the performance of all those who work at News Corp for showing professionalism, passion and compassion throughout these most difficult of times. Our reporters and opinion writers around the world have provided a profoundly important service, and many of our employees have contributed to their communities through philanthropic service in recent months. 
And now for more granular detail and customary insight, Susan."

Before talking through our fiscal 20 results, I would like to recap on the actions we've taken this past year to better position News Corp for long-term success with a focus on increasing shareholder value and transparency. Firstly, the",2849,"Thank you, Robert. Before talking through our fiscal 20 results, I would like to recap on the actions we've taken this past year to better position News Corp for long-term success with a focus on increasing shareholder value and transparency. Firstly, the company has taken significant action on our cost base. Our publishing business in Australia has been significantly restructured with 112 of our regional and community markets transitioning to digital or closed. The cost base at Foxtel has been restructured with savings across programming and support functions. With increasing OTT scale and a lower cost base, Foxtel is better positioned for success, and I would like to reiterate that we have no plans to provide additional funding. 
Our digital real estate businesses have also been proactive in reducing headcount to confront the challenges of COVID-19. In addition, we took quick and decisive action to reduce OpEx and CapEx in the fourth quarter with CapEx reducing by 1/3 year-on-year and total costs decreasing 21% year-on-year, partially due to divestments in FX, but primarily due to active cost management. We are also close to finalizing our savings opportunities for global shared services across the company as we look to leverage our global scale and reduce duplication. These collective actions resulted in a 7% reduction in headcount this year across the businesses, excluding the NAM and Unruly sales. Secondly, Dow Jones results are now reported as a separate segment, which better highlights its performance and provides a more complete comparison with its peers. The business saw record subscriptions and achieved growth in both revenue and EBITDA for the year. Thirdly, we are taking tangible steps to stabilize our newly formed News Media segment through digital subscriber growth, cover price increases and aggressive cost targets, which will be further enhanced by our global shared service initiative. 
In relation to liquidity, the only debt exposures we have are at our non 100% owned subsidiaries, Foxtel and REA, and these are nonrecourse to News Corp. Finally, as part of our simplification efforts, we continue to reshape News Corp's portfolio this year with the divestments of News America Marketing and Unruly. With that as a backdrop, I will now discuss our latest financial results. 
Fiscal 2020 fourth quarter total revenues were approximately $1.9 billion, down 22% versus the prior year, reflecting the impacts of COVID-19 and the divestment of News America Marketing in early May. Total segment EBITDA was $195 million, down 28% versus the prior year. Excluding the divestment of NAM, acquisitions, currency fluctuations and the other items disclosed in our release, adjusted revenues fell 13% and adjusted total segment EBITDA decreased 10% as growth in segment EBITDA at the Dow Jones, book Publishing and subscription video services segments were outweighed by the negative impact of COVID-19. Our best estimate for the revenue impact of COVID-19 for the quarter was negative $330 million or 13%, together with a negative impact on total segment EBITDA estimated to be between $40 million to $55 million or 15% to 20%. For the quarter, we reported a net loss per share of $0.67 as compared to a net loss per share of $0.09 in the prior year. The loss includes $292 million of noncash impairment charges primarily related to fixed assets in the U.K. and Australia. Adjusted earnings per share were negative $0.03 in the quarter compared to positive $0.07 in the prior year. 
Moving on to the quarterly results for the individual reporting segments, starting with Dow Jones. Revenues for the quarter were $381 million, down 4% compared to the prior year, with digital revenues accounting for a record 71% of total revenues this quarter. Circulation revenues rose 2% due to robust growth in digital circulation revenues, partially offset by lower print circulation revenues, which were impacted by the decline in newsstand sales and fewer amenity copies primarily related to COVID-19. As Robert mentioned, Dow Jones again achieved record subscriptions in the quarter and saw an acceleration in year-over-year growth compared to the prior quarter. Dow Jones average subscriptions for the quarter were almost 3.8 million, up 15% from the prior year. And of that, digital-only subscriptions were 2.8 million, up 28% year-over-year. For the Wall Street Journal, there were approximately 3 million total subscriptions for the quarter, up 15% from the prior year, with digital-only subscriptions growing 23% to more than 2.2 million, improving from the 15% year-over-year growth rate in the prior quarter. To frame the improvement, we added 203,000 Wall Street Journal digital-only subscriptions this quarter compared to 112,000 in the third quarter and 43,000 in the prior year. 
Revenues from Dow Jones Professional Information business rose 6% year-over-year, slightly higher than the third quarter rate, driven by 14% revenue growth at Risk & Compliance. Consistent with our expectations, Risk & Compliance revenues reached approximately $160 million for fiscal 2020. As we mentioned last quarter, advertising revenues, which accounted for only 19% of revenues this quarter were impacted by COVID-19 and declined 28% to $71 million. For the first time, digital advertising revenue was greater than print, accounting for 54% of total advertising revenues for the quarter. 
Digital advertising revenues fell 7%, helped by strong growth in programmatic while print advertising was down 43%, which included the impact from the cancellation of live events. Total unique visitors across our Dow Jones Digital platforms more than doubled in the quarter versus the prior year. 
Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter rose 13% to $60 million. 
Turning to our other news segment, News Media, which primarily includes News Australia, News U.K. and the New York Post and the News America Marketing and Unruly companies prior to their disposal. Revenues for the quarter were $490 million, down 41% versus the prior year, of which the impact from the divestment of News America Marketing accounted for over half of the total revenue decline. On an adjusted basis, which excludes NAM, Unruly and the other items mentioned in our release, revenues declined 22%. Advertising revenue fell 58% on a reported basis, of which $179 million or 36% of the decline was from the sale of News America Marketing, and the rest of the decline was driven by the negative impact from COVID-19, weaknesses in the print advertising market and a $20 million or 4% negative impact related to the suspension of certain community titles in Australia. Advertising revenues at News U.K. fell 46% on a reported basis and 45% in local currency, relatively consistent with our April commentary, with lower print trends, partially offset by strong digital advertising growth at The Sun. Performance was similar in Australia, with advertising down 46% on a reported basis and 42% in local currency, which includes the negative impact related to the suspension of certain community titles. Circulation and subscription revenues declined 9%, impacted by lower newsstand sales related to COVID-19, partially offset by strong digital paid subscriber growth and cover price increases in Australia. Segment EBITDA for the quarter was a loss of $44 million, down $95 million from the prior year. The divestment of News America Marketing accounted for $43 million of the year-over-year decline. Also included in the results are approximately $8 million of additional cost related to the decommissioning of print operations in Australia. 
It is important to note that we do not expect this to be the new normal, and we are taking significant and decisive steps to improve the trajectory of the segment, including better monetizing our growing and global audience and further cost reductions. These include leveraging existing content to source incremental licensing revenues. We believe that we are very well positioned to benefit from incremental licensing revenues as early as this fiscal year, which should have a meaningful impact on EBITDA. Our biggest source of revenues in the News Media segment is now circulation and subscription. We expect continued growth in our digital subscriptions, and we will be looking at cover and subscription prices to help offset print advertising declines. Our global shared service initiative, which we expect to centralize many of our back-office functions and remove duplication. We'll also continue to work on newsroom transformation and the ongoing review of our printing sites and office space. We have reduced our total headcount within the segment by 12% in fiscal 2020, which will lower our cost base going forward, and we expect additional reductions in fiscal 2021. The impact of COVID-19 remains uncertain, and we do expect continued advertising challenges. However, we will continue to focus on the digital transformation of this segment, new ways to monetize our content and continue to take aggressive cost measures as we look to provide a more stable outlook. 
At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues decreased 16% to $238 million, primarily due to a decline in listings in Australia and the U.S. related to COVID-19 and associated customer support measures. On an adjusted basis, revenues declined 13%. Segment EBITDA fell 10% to $71 million or 5% on an adjusted basis. 
REA Group revenues fell 21%, primarily reflecting FX, lower developer revenues and a 14% decline in residential listing volumes for the quarter. REA saw improvements in listings as the quarter progressed, with 11% listing volume growth in June, combined with record traffic. The volume growth was partly related to easier year-on-year comparisons which included the impact from the federal election in the prior year. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call immediately following this call for more details. 
Move revenues declined 10% to $111 million, with real estate revenues down 5%. However, the decline in real estate revenues was almost entirely due to an estimated $13 million impact related to the customer billing relief initiative. Move is also still being impacted by the transition to the referral model, given the longer time period by which revenues are recognized. Despite the transition, we remain very confident in the long-term growth potential of the referral model, including upside through incremental ancillary services. 
Similar to REA, we are also seeing record traffic at REALTOR with June achieving 86 million monthly unique users, up 18% year-over-year, combined with a greater than 50% year-on-year increase in core real estate lead volumes in June. Despite the revenue impact from COVID-19 for both the quarter and the full year, Move increased its contribution to segment EBITDA year-on-year, benefiting from the restructuring of the organization, including the integration of the teams at REALTOR and Opcity. 
Turning to the subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $407 million, down 24% versus $536 million in the prior year, which included a negative 5% impact from FX. The revenue decline was driven by fewer residential subscribers, a reduction in commercial subscribers related to the suspension of billings due to the closing of licensed venues and a decline in advertising revenues. Approximately half of the year-over-year revenue decline in the quarter was due to commercial and advertising revenues, which we believe was mostly a function of the impact from COVID-19. 
Foxtel's closing paid subscriber base was approximately 2.8 million as of June 30, down 12%, which reflects the decline in commercial subscribers, which fell to 86,000 from 264,000 in the prior year, primarily associated with COVID-19 restrictions. We expect improvements as licensed commercial venues begin to reopen, although timing is still uncertain given the recent spikes in infections in Victoria. 
Foxtel Now subscribers were also impacted by a difficult year ago comparison as the prior year benefited from the final season of Game of Thrones, but the number was stable sequentially. Pleasingly, we saw a significant decline in broadcast churn down to 13.2% compared to 14.7% in the prior year, which was the lowest in 7 quarters. The improvement was supported by the implementation of several COVID-19 mitigation measures, including opening up content tiers and offer extensions and favorable impacts from a slowdown in Telstra's NBN migration activity. Broadcast ARPU was relatively stable at AUD 78. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $104 million, up 24% from the prior year, driven by lower costs. 
Overall expenses declined about $145 million, which includes approximately $70 million of lower sports rights costs, primarily related to the suspension of live sports. Results include 1 month of expense related to the NRL and AFL, and the majority of the deferred sports costs will be recognized in fiscal 2021. I will discuss this further in the outlook commentary. 
Foxtel also benefited from lower entertainment costs from renegotiated affiliate and output deals, lower transmission costs and lower overheads due to staff reductions. 
As Robert mentioned, we are pleased with the resilience of Kayo and the early progress and level of engagement for Binge, Foxtel's new entertainment streaming service. We look forward to building on Foxtel's expanding OTT subscriber base in the year ahead. During the quarter, Foxtel also accelerated its cost transformation plan for the business, reducing its headcount by approximately 17%. This action, together with other operational efficiencies and content renegotiations will help put Foxtel in a better position longer term.  
At book publishing, HarperCollins had a strong quarter with revenues down only 3% to $407 million and segment EBITDA up 9% to $47 million despite significant bricks-and-mortar store closures, which was a far better performance than we had anticipated. We saw the strongest digital growth in recent years with total digital sales up 26% to represent 29% of consumer revenues. With the shelter in place orders related to COVID-19, e-book sales returned to robust growth, increasing 31% year-over-year with downloadable audio books also growing at a healthy 17%, despite an initial dip due to the falling individuals commuting to work. 
As Robert noted, HarperCollins benefited from a strong release slate, which included Joanna Gaines' Magnolia Table Volume 2 and a great performance from our Children's division. 
I would now like to talk about some themes in the upcoming quarter. Forecasting remains challenging, so I will discuss the trends we have seen in July. At Digital Real Estate services, as noted in their release, July new buy listings at REA were up 16%. However, residential revenue growth is expected to be offset by a reduction in development projects, listing declines in Commercial and Asia businesses and the recent government restrictions in Victoria. Please refer to REA's press release for more details. 
REALTOR is facing lower industry-wide real estate transactions, but encouragingly, lead volume and unique users remained strong, similar to June. In Subscription Video Services, advertising in July improved modestly with the return of live sports. We expect gradual recovery of commercial subscribers but timing will largely be dictated by government restrictions and the broader impact from COVID-19. Broadcast churn is modestly higher versus the prior year and the fourth quarter. On sports costs, assuming no further disruption of play, we will recognize approximately $55 million or AUD 78 million of additional sports programming rights costs, the majority of which is related to the NRL and AFL rights costs that were deferred from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021 due to the temporary sport suspension. However, we expect at least $100 million or AUD 160 million of overall savings, net of the increase in sports cost for the full year in fiscal 2021 as a result of the cost-out initiatives taken during fiscal 2020. 
At Dow Jones, subscription trends in July continued to be strong with over 25% growth in digital-only subscriptions at The Wall Street Journal. Advertising trends improved modestly in July, but with digital up very strongly. In book publishing, similar to the fourth quarter, HarperCollins continued to see strong growth in online sales in July. Retail stores are slowly reopening, albeit likely at a reduced foot traffic and continued risk from any recurrence of COVID. 
At News Media, we continue to expect advertising and single copy sales revenues to be adversely affected due to COVID-19. Advertising revenues in July at the newspaper mastheads in the segment declined 25% to 30% in total compared to the prior year. As a reminder, advertising revenues in the prior year included the results from News America Marketing. Overall decline in circulation volumes for July improved from the lows experienced early in the fourth quarter, particularly for the weekend papers. Pleasingly, we have continued to see strong digital subscriber growth at the Australian mastheads and at The Times and The Sunday Times, and we will continue to focus on cost transformation to mitigate the revenue headwinds. 
CapEx for the year is expected to be approximately $400 million compared to $434 million in fiscal 2020, subject to foreign currency fluctuations. We will be monitoring this number very closely throughout the year and will take necessary actions to reduce this amount as needed. 
And as a reminder, we have a strong balance sheet with over $1.5 billion of cash and access to a $750 million revolving credit facility. The COVID-19 crisis has presented challenges across all of our businesses, and we are very pleased with the actions that our businesses have taken to ensure they are well positioned to withstand the ongoing volatility as we move through the next 12 months. 
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

And then just secondly, advertising trends over the course of the quarter seem to get slightly worse at Dow Jones. I mean, obviously, very strong performance in the segment as a whole.

Or what sort of bounces back into the cost base in '21?"

But",430,"I'll talk about the Australian regulations or the draft mandatory code of conduct, which is particularly important. It's important in 2 ways. One, for what it defines in terms of remedies and in particular, for what it defines in terms as an industry. But it's also part of a global discussion, whether it be the consideration in Brussels, the hearings here last week in Congress with the big 4 digital heads giving testimony, and in London. And so what you're seeing, and this is crucial, is the increase in content consciousness among regulators around the world. These are no longer mystifying issues. The issues have been clearly defined. And you saw that in Congress last week. And you see that in the ACCC Report, the original digital report, and now the draft mandatory code of conduct, which I think is quite a moment of itself, a real Internet inflection point. 
And this -- essentially, we are talking about carriage fees or retrans payments for premium journalism. And there are obviously more deals to come. Now some of those deals will be outside Australia. But I suspect, in some ways, influenced by Australian regulatory thinking. But I can assure you that not only regulators but media companies around the world and the digital platforms are watching Australia closely. Now we've obviously been fighting this fight for well over a decade. And the News Corp Board has supported the quest because it was absolutely crucial to the future of journalism. Newspapers delivered in whatever format are vital to a well-informed society. And what's obvious is the collective understanding of issues is past the point of no return, the point of no action, shall we say. But there are obviously regulatory changes to come in Australia. And the commercial landscape is not yet fully formed, but it will be a landscape far more hospitable to journalism and to News Media and to News Corp. 
Now as for your a question about the licensing of content. Clearly, we're always looking for opportunities to monetize our content. But in a digital context, we have a unique comparative advantage with global properties, which often write about similar subjects. So not only in licensing in a traditional subscription sense, but think a little bit about the segmentation of digital products, products around sport, products around lifestyle, around food, around puzzles even. So it's a real opportunity for us to divide up our content in a different way, monetize that content and provide compelling digital opportunities for potential subscribers at different price points for different content sets."

So the bulk of that reduction between reported and adjusted was due to NAM and FX. The COVID impact we're predicting in about $270 million odd, $280 odd million in order to get you to that EBITDA impact. We were expecting costs to increase slightly for the quarter because we did have increased revenue at Dow Jones and HarperCollins and some of our businesses. And what I would say in relation to the COVID impact cost is, clearly, there's a lot that are related to volume, so particularly on our mastheads around the globe. And we would expect to see those scale obviously, as those businesses scale back up. But we have also reduced headcount by 7% across the business, excluding NAM and Unruly, and that's savings that we would certainly expect to continue into the next year. We've made significant cuts on marketing. We clearly will have a look at what we think is an appropriate level for marketing going forward, and it may never be back to the level that we had pre COVID. Likewise, with most companies, we've got a lot of cost cuts coming through on TNE and other discretionary spend, which again, when we think forward, we will review exactly what we think we need as a business in order to continue spending within that area. We've clearly got compensation cost reductions as well as a result of lower bonuses. And outside of the OpEx impact, we've got the cuts that came through in CapEx. I think I mentioned that we've cut that by third year-on-year. So clearly, as we move forward into next year, it's difficult to predict exactly that cost base is going to look like because it will all depend on the revenue trends. But we are confident that there's a significant amount of reoccurring costs that will go into next year from a cost reduction perspective. And we do actually believe that we can continue to take costs out, as we've mentioned."

We are certainly in the midst of a political uncertainty in the U.S., and continuity is a blessing in these polarized and polarizing moments. Please continue to stay both safe And sage. 
I would, in particular, like to express my gratitude to all our employees who've traversed this difficult terrain with courage and commitment and have played an important empathetic role in their communities during these stressful months. Despite the harsh conditions and the inevitable COVID-caused disruptions, I am pleased to report that News Corp had a particularly robust first quarter, with resounding year-on-year growth in our profitability and revenue expansion in several key segments. 
Three vital pillars of our company: Dow Jones, Book Publishing and Digital Real Estate Services had notable EBITDA growth and higher revenue in Q1. The consolidated revenues were over $2.1 billion. And while that was down 10% year-over-year, adjusted revenues, which exclude News America Marketing, Unruly and other items noted in the press release were only 3% lower. 
Consequentially, in Q1, News Corp's total segment EBITDA was $268 million, an increase of 21% year-over-year, evidence of the strength of our core businesses and the growth potential of those sectors in which we have made significant acquisitions, in particular, digital real estate and book publishing. 
We are also benefiting from our strategy to simplify the company, allowing us to focus on the segments that have the greatest growth potential as well as ensuring that we are resolutely reducing shared costs around the company. We are determined to provide greater transparency for investors, and the presentation of Dow Jones as a separate segment was integral to that continuing process. 
Turning now to the details. Digital real estate services flourished this quarter. Despite limits on home inspections and other COVID-related disruption, revenues increased 7% year-over-year, while segment EBITDA surged 45% year-over-year, led by particularly strong results at Move, operator of realtor.com, which had record revenues in the quarter of $138 million. 
Both REA and realtor.com reported record traffic during the quarter, with the latter having reached a high 92 million monthly unique visitors in August, while traffic was up 26% for the quarter. Based on ComScore data, REALTOR has outpaced Zillow in audience growth for 16 of the past 18 months. This success comes as realtor.com continues to focus on transforming its business towards a data-rich referral model. We are convinced there's a substantial opportunity for REALTOR to expand its market from a still deep pool of real estate marketing dollars to provide value-added services at premium prices in mortgages, titles and other adjacent categories. 
I would note, realtor.com's new partnership with Rocket Mortgage as one example of the company's growth potential and our efforts to expand the addressable market. realtor.com also recently launched the Sellers Marketplace to provide listings for our buyers, without the anti-delusion approach of our main competitor, which has been doubling down on its house flipping business. We are a genuinely nimble, agile digital company and will leave bricks-and-mortar to the specialists. 
Realtor.com is also constantly focused on improving transparency and choice for those buying and selling homes, including higher-quality estimates and salient information about everything from flood risk to neighborhood noise levels. We have been introducing features while still being cost-conscious, and that plan of creativity and discipline is behind the burdening of the business. 
At REA, while listing volumes have pertinently been affected by government-imposed COVID restrictions, the business still posted a higher profit contribution. What we are seeing at both companies is that the pandemic has been a catalyst for many families to reconsider their current housing and environment, prompting an increasing number to seek less dense areas and larger properties. As the restrictions on movement ease, we believe that trend is likely to gather momentum, particularly at a time of record low interest rates. 
As we noted earlier, Dow Jones is now reported as a separate segment, which is a part of our efforts to increase transparency and highlight in an inherent value. As you can see from the company's resounding results, there is much to save about the business and its prospects. As we noted in our Investor Day presentation, Dow Jones aims to double its subscribers, given an incremental pool of 12 million prospective Dow Jones premium customers in the U.S. alone. And as the world's leading provider of business news and analysis, Dow Jones and the Wall Street Journal have maintained premium pricing, and we are increasing our efforts to upsell our customers' high-value specialist products. 
Revenue benefited from accelerating digital circulation and digital advertising growth and continued expansion of risk and compliance. These compensated for not unexpected decline in print advertising. 
Note, the total ad decline was not as marked as that of other publishers. As a result, Dow Jones segment EBITDA grew 47% year-over-year. 
A few metrics to note behind that admiral result at a turbulent time. Risk and compliance revenues rose 16% year-over-year, representing the 21st consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. The Wall Street Journal reported 27% growth in digital-only subscriptions. And total Dow Jones subscriptions increased 18% in the quarter, reaching approximately $3.9 million. 
MarketWatch also had a buoyant quarter, with the highest first quarter revenue results in its history as traffic surged to 52 million average monthly uniques. In recent days, we have moved to further monetize that fast-expanding audience by introducing subscriptions and enhancing the news flow for loyal readers. The early results are rather positive for both MarketWatch and Barron's. 
To gain the sense of the size of the Dow Jones universe, which like the actual universe, is still expanding, traffic across the digital network rose 54% year-over-year in Q1, averaging 127 million unique users per month, according to Adobe Analytics. And we firmly believe we are still at a relatively early stage of our potential audience and revenue growth. 
Meanwhile, in book publishing, HarperCollins also reported a strong quarter, with revenues increasing 13% and segment EBITDA up 45%. Again, those results reflected a mix of the creativity of the commissioning, along with disciplined, diligent cost control. Reopened Bookstore restocked their shelves with compelling Harpercollins tones, and overall, digital sales in Q1 were up 20% compared to the prior year, continuing a trend that was evident in Q4 of fiscal '20. 
Direct-to-consumer revenues rose almost 38% year-over-year. And the I Can Read Book Club for children nearly quadrupled its metric since February to more than 95,000 monthly active users as of quarter end. 
Best-selling authors included Daniel Silva, Jenna Bush Hager, Lucy Foley, Ben Shapiro and Lebron James. And looking ahead, we have high hopes for Frontier Follies by Ree Drummond, The Greatest Secret by Rhonda Byrne, Concrete Rose by Angie Thomas and Code Named Bananas by David Williams, which is being released today. 
At Foxtel, there was marked improvement in the growth of the OTT business, which saw total closing paid subscriptions reached new record high, with nearly 3.3 million subscribers. This includes over 1.2 million paying customers of Kayo, Foxtel Now and the recently launched Binge. In total, there was a 67% year-over-year growth in the OTT base. 
To be specific, as of September 30, Kayo had 644,000 paid subscribers and 691,000 total subscribers. Foxtel Now had 298,000 paid subscribers and 310,000 total subscribers. And the burgeoning Binge had 290,000 paid subscribers and 321,000 total subscribers. 
One other note about Binge, the active subscriber is watching for 7.5 hours a week. So we are clearly pleased with how they're binging on Binge. 
In the News Media segment, the rate of year-over-year revenue decline moderated compared to Q4. Obviously, the direct year-on-year comparisons are complicated by the sale of both NAM and Unruly. Cost consciousness continue to be raised with one recent announcement of note. In September, we did our plans to shift the printing of the Wall Street Journal, the New York post and Barron's to the New York Times Blood in Queens, and we are actively exploring options for the Bronx Print plant site, for which there has been considerable interest. 
This decision involved much agonizing as the Bronx plant and its talented, committed staff, have played an important role in the history of the company and the U.S. newspaper industry. Their sterling efforts will resonate for many decades to come as the mastheads continue their migration to digital in a rapidly changing media environment. 
A measure of that evolution is that the New York Post digital network traffic grew 35% in September year-over-year to 144 million unique users. Digital advertising in the quarter climbed over 20% and nearly 90% of advertising revenues at the post and now digital. 
The transformation of News Corp Australia continue to pace, with the transition of most of our community in regional mastheads to digital-only. All told, our Australian titles saw strong digital subscription growth, up 26% year-over-year to $685,000. In the U.K., the Times and Sunday Times digital subscribers expanded 8% to 337,000 and also saw strong ARPU growth. Also in the U.K., Times Radio, launched last quarter, has already exceeded over 100,000 listeners each week, clearly benefiting from our leveraging of the strong Times brand and talent. Of course, it is also a powerful marketing platform for all of our U.K. titles and businesses. 
Finally, it should be clear to all the digital landscape is changing dramatically, and we are at the forefront of that change. It could even be argued that much of that change would not have happened without News Corp's advocacy over the past decade. The drive towards achieving a premium for premium content has gathered momentum, and we are pleased that negotiations with the large platforms are ongoing. This is certainly at the end of the issue, but without being too Churchillean, it is the end of the beginning. 
Now more than ever, we believe it is evident that News Corp has value above and beyond the sum of our parts. So that mathematical fact is yet to be fully realized for our investors. That value should be more visible now that we have broken out the Dow Jones results, which also increases the scrutiny of our Others news businesses, which are themselves in the midst of a successful transition. We plan to continue simplifying the business, and are open to making structural changes to maximize value and will continue to address the cost base. Unlike most media companies, we have the option of optionality, having [indiscernible], mastered our cash reserves, which have improved since the pandemic began. 
I believe our continuing concerted initiatives are making us a more focused and more digital company, which will generate enhanced returns for our investors in the months, the quarters and the years to come. And now for further financial and enlightenment, we turn to Susan Panuccio."

As Robert mentioned, we are pleased with the start to the new fiscal year, particularly in an environment which has clearly been marked by unpredictability and uncertainty. Our businesses have responded well to the challenges as evidenced by these results. Fiscal 2021 first quarter total revenues were $2.1 billion, down 10% versus the prior year, while total segment EBITDA was $268 million, up 21% year-over-year, led by very strong growth at the Digital Real Estate services, Dow Jones and Book Publishing segments. 
On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact from acquisitions and divestitures, most notably the sale of News America marketing in the fourth quarter of last fiscal year as well as currency fluctuations and other items disclosed in our release, revenues were down by only 3%, while total segment EBITDA increased by 23%. 
Net income for the quarter was $47 million compared to a net loss of $211 million in the prior year, reflecting the absence of impairment charges and higher total segment EBITDA, partially offset by higher tax expense. The prior year figure reflected $273 million of noncash impairment charges, primarily in News America marketing. 
For the quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.06 as compared to a loss of $0.39 in the prior year. Adjusted EPS were $0.08 in the quarter versus $0.04 in the prior year. 
Turning now to the operating segments. At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues increased 7% to $290 million, a big improvement from the fourth quarter, primarily due to the strength of Move. On an adjusted basis, revenues increased 4%. 
Segment EBITDA rose 45% to $119 million or 40% on an adjusted basis, primarily driven by a meaningful increase in profit contribution from Move due to a combination of higher revenues and cost reduction. Measures the results at Move accounted for over 80% of segment revenue growth and over 70% of segment EBITDA growth this quarter. 
REA revenues rose 2%, reflecting a $6 million or 4% benefit from currency fluctuations. National residential listing volumes declined 2% for the quarter impacted by Stage 4 government restrictions in Melbourne, which include a ban on physical inspections. To put that in perspective, Metro Melbourne listings in the quarter declined 44% versus the prior year, while the listings in Metro Sydney grew 23%. 
REA's results benefited from positive FX movements as well as modest residential revenue and financial services growth, driven by higher refinancing activity, but the growth was mostly offset by declines in commercial developer and Asia. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for more details. 
At Move, we are extremely pleased with our progress during the first quarter. Move revenues rose 12% to $138 million, representing an all-time high, with real estate revenues rising 13%. As Robert mentioned, traffic reached record levels with, an average of 90 million unique users for the first quarter, an increase of 26% year-over-year. Monthly average lead volume for the quarter grew at an even faster rate at over 40%. 
We saw material growth in the performance-based referral model, which accounted for approximately 30% of total Move revenues in the quarter, benefiting from the growth in lead volume, higher home prices and real estate transaction closes. As I've mentioned in the past, there is a delay in recognizing the revenue from the referral model due to the timing of transaction closes, which, in addition to natural real estate seasonal patterns can lead to some volatility quarter-to-quarter as we shift more leads to that model. These results are very encouraging as we further progress towards increasing our addressable market through the integration of key ancillary services like our rocket mortgage partnership. While we continue to transition to the referral model, the combination of strong lead volume and price increases for our more traditional lead generation business resulted in a more stable revenue performance this quarter than the prior quarters. 
Move increased its profit contribution by $28 million versus the prior year, driven by the scaling of the referral model, cost efficiencies resulting from the restructuring of the organization last quarter, including completing the integration of REALTOR and Opcity and the deferral of marketing spend. 
Turning to the subscription video services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $496 million, down 4% versus the prior year and included a $20 million or 3% positive impact from foreign currency fluctuations. The revenue decline moderated from the prior quarter as strong growth at Kayo, driven by the return of live sports as well as the expansion of Binge partially offset the declines in residential and commercial subscriptions. Foxtel's closing paid subscriber base reached a record high at nearly $3.3 million as of September 30, up 7% year-over-year, led by meaningful growth of paying OTT subscriptions, which reached over $1.2 million at quarter end. 
Broadcast subscribers declined about 10% to $1.85 million. Commercial subscribers declined 23% to 205,000, but marked a big improvement from the fourth quarter due to the reopening of licensed venues in most parts of the country. Foxtel is continuing to work with impacted customers in the pubs, clubs and accommodation sectors, particularly in Victoria and New South Wales. Broadcast churn was relatively stable at 14.6% versus 14.4% in the prior year, partly impacted by the roll-off of some of the churn mitigation initiatives, but were still below the financial year '19 and financial year '20 averages. Broadcast ARPU increased 1% from the prior year to AUD 79, which was also modestly higher than the fourth quarter. 
Segment EBITDA declined 4% to $78 million and declined 9% on an adjusted basis. Total cost declined approximately 3% or $15 million, with a $16 million or 4% adverse impact due to currency fluctuations. Underlying savings were $31 million or AUD 50 million. These savings came despite an increasing sports rights and production costs, partly due to the $36 million or AUD 51 million impact from the timing of some sporting events deferred from the fourth quarter. Foxtel also benefited in the quarter from lower entertainment programming costs as well as declines in transmission and overhead expenses as we see the flow-through from the cost actions taken last year. 
Moving on to Dow Jones. Revenues for the quarter $386 million, up 1% compared to the prior year, with digital revenues accounting for a record 73% of total revenues this quarter, up 8 percentage points from the prior year. Circulation revenues rose 7% due to robust growth in digital circulation revenues, partially offset by lower single copy and amenity print volume and marks a meaningful improvement from the fourth quarter rate of 2%. 
As Robert mentioned, Dow Jones again achieved record subscriptions in the quarter, with the year-over-year growth rate slightly higher than the fourth quarter. Dow Jones average subscriptions to its consumer product for the quarter were nearly $3.9 million, up 18% from the prior year. And of that, digital-only subscriptions were $2.9 million, up 29% year-over-year. 
For the Wall Street Journal, there were 3.1 million average subscriptions for the quarter, up nearly 19% from the prior year, with digital-only subscriptions growing 27% to more than $2.3 million. Revenues from Dow Jones Professional Information business rose 2% year-over-year, which included 16% growth in risk and compliance. As mentioned at the Dow Jones Investor Day, long-term contracts are 95% of risk and compliance revenues, providing us with a more predictable and reoccurring revenue base. 
Advertising revenues, which accounted for only 18% of revenues this quarter, declined 17% to $70 million, an improvement from a 28% decline last quarter. Digital advertising revenues again exceeded print advertising revenues, accounting for 57% of total advertising and increased 14%, benefiting from growth in direct display, programmatic and sponsored link revenues. Interestingly, we saw digital revenue growth in every industry category. Print and other advertising fell 39%, a more modest improvement from the fourth quarter rate. 
Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter rose 47% to $72 million, with margins expanding to almost 19% and up almost 6 percentage points versus the prior year. Overall costs for the segment declined approximately 6%, which combined with the top line growth, led to the material margin expansion this quarter. 
At Book Publishing, HarperCollins had a very strong quarter, building on the momentum from the fourth quarter, with revenues up 13% year-over-year to $458 million and segment EBITDA up 45% to $71 million. Revenue growth was driven by general trade and the children's books as well as modest revenue contribution from the Egmont acquisition in the U.K. Adjusted revenues and adjusted segment EBITDA grew 10% and 41%, respectively. 
We saw strong digital growth with digital sales up 20% year-over-year to represent 23% of consumer revenues, up from 22%. E-book sales increased 18% year-over-year, with gains in all genres while downloadable audio books increased 26% year-over-year. As Robert noted, HarperCollins benefited from a strong release slate, which included Daniel Silva's The Order, Lucy Foley's The Guest List, Ben Shapiro's How To Destroy America in Three Easy Steps. Jenna Bush Hager's Everything Beautiful in Its Time. As well as Lebron James' I Promise in children's books. 
The backlist contributed 61% of sales this quarter, down from 64% last year, which due to the larger mix of frontlist titles this quarter. 
Turning to News Media, we saw moderation in revenue declines this quarter compared to the fourth quarter. Revenues for the quarter were $487 million, down 37% versus the prior year, of which the impact from the divestment of News America marketing accounted for the majority of the decline. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact from the divestment of NAM and Unruly and the other items mentioned in our release, revenues declined 16%, which is an improvement from the 22% decline in the fourth quarter. The decline also reflects a $35 million or 5% negative impact from the closure or transition to digital of certain regional and community newspapers in Australia. 
Circulation and subscription revenues were flat as a $10 million or 4% benefit from currency fluctuations, strong digital paid subscriber growth and cover price increases in the U.K. offset lower news stand sales related to COVID-19. We have seen print volumes beginning to improve, particularly at the weekend papers. 
Advertising revenue fell $262 million or 59% on a reported basis, of which $200 million or 45% was from the sale of News America marketing. $29 million or a 7% negative impact related to the closure or transition to digital of certain regional and community titles in Australia, with the rest of the decline relating to the overall weakness in the print advertising market. Advertising revenues at News U.K. fell 21% or 24% in local currency, while News Australia declined 35% or 38% in local currency, which includes the $29 million negative impact or 20% related to the regional and community titles. Advertising revenues at the New York post increased 6%, which includes 22% digital advertising growth. 
Segment EBITDA for the quarter was a loss of $22 million compared to a positive $7 million in the prior year, or a decline of $29 million. The results reflect lower revenues and the absence of a net $12 million contribution from News America marketing and Unruly, partially offset by higher cost savings across the businesses. 
I would now like to talk about some of the themes in the upcoming quarter. Needless to say, forecasting continues to remain challenging. At Digital Real Estate services, as REA noted, National Residential Listings in Australia for October were down 1% to the prior year with increases in Melbourne and Sydney. REA has also agreed to take a controlling interest in India's Alara Technologies. And as a result, we expect to fully consolidate their results, assuming completion on November 30. Please refer to REA's press release for more details. 
At REALTOR, we remain very encouraged by traffic and lead volumes. We are planning higher reinvestment spending than Q1 given our focus on expanding into adjacencies and growing the addressable market. In subscription video services, with the conclusion of Australia's 2 Tier 1 winter football seasons, the AFL and NRL, we expect to see seasonality in Kayo's subscriber numbers as we transition to the summer sports, most notably cricket. For Q2, we expect about $18 million or AUD 26 million of sports rights that were deferred due to COVID-19, but expect offsetting savings due to the ongoing benefit of the cost reduction measures taken in Q4 last year and the continued cost focus within the business. 
At Dow Jones, overall, year-over-year trends thus far are similar, including strong digital advertising growth. As we look to the rest of the year, we expect modest reinvestment in the business as we focus on driving revenue growth through subscriptions and in risk and compliance. 
In Book Publishing, as Robert mentioned, the key titles in the second quarter include Ree Drummond's Frontier Follies and Rhonda Byrne's The Greatest Secret. We have continued to see higher online sales. 
At News Media, overall year-over-year revenue and cost trends remained similar to the prior quarter absent currency, although visibility remains limited. As a reminder, the prior year included a $22 million onetime benefit to segment EBITDA from the settlement of certain warranty claims at [indiscernible] printing business. We also expect some investment as we ramp our global shared service initiative over the course of the year. 
The COVID-19 crisis has presented challenges at all of our businesses, and they have responded in a balanced and measured way. They will continue to focus on finding the right balance between permanent cost reduction and investment in growth opportunities while keeping a close eye on the macroeconomic conditions and government responses to the virus within their own markets. We believe we are well positioned as we move forward with a greater focus on digital across the company and a more disciplined approach to costs. 
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

I remember there was skeptics at the time of acquisition, the naysayers, who wondered whether we could transform a company that frankly had seen better days. Well, the best days are now clearly ahead. 
We've used our editorial expertise and reached the power of our media platforms and a relentless focus on the need of customers to improve user experience, and that's showing up in the returns. For us, the challenge, as you indicated, to get the blend rides between continuing expansion and contemporary returns. I mean, obviously, due to the savvy leadership of David Doctor and Tracey Fellows, we have had a massive increase in margin. And we have elasticity there. But we believe that we're at the early stage of the expansion of that business. 
And to be honest, it will also be a beneficiary of our advocacy to change the digital landscape, whether it be through digital ad yields or [indiscernible] transparency. And so it will be eminently efficacious for REALTOR, for REA, for our businesses in Asia and for our operations in India. 
Now as for structure, the most important way of maximizing our real estate properties value is to ensure that they are the fastest-growing, most lucrative, most innovative sites in the world, truly digital in orientation. And shall I say not weighed down by bricks and water and unsold inventory or the need to renovate a kitchen or add a bidet in the bathroom. The benefits of that creative committed approach to potential vendors, to potential buyers and to real realtors is patently obvious in the results last quarter. 
Now we have Tracey Fellows overseeing our global real estate operations. And we have Justin [indiscernible] our India operations through REA. So there is a shape structure emerging. And more than that, there is a sense of purpose and of profitability. We are, by many measures, the world's largest real estate company, and that business has more than withstood the stress tests of recent months. In fact, the recent months showed the extraordinary potential of that business."

So we would expect to see that scale up as we go throughout the year, obviously, depending on audience and revenue growth. And we also will have some reinvestment in product innovation as we look to scale out the platforms. So without sort of giving guidance, that's sort of how we're thinking about it."

But as we mentioned last time, there will be a net impact of the deferral of sports costs, AUD 78 million for the year, both programming and then production costs included in that number. But the underlying savings will be significantly higher than that. 
In relation to the commercial revenue impact of about $14 million this year, quarter-on-quarter, you'll see from the subs numbers that we quoted that we have picked up a considerable amount in Q4. We're hoping actually, with the opening up of Victoria, that we'll actually start to pick that number up again as we move forward.

In relation to the other cost savings, the team actually did a really good job in Q4 of looking at that cost base and getting heads out of the business, which sort of continued into the first month of this quarter. So the actual underlying cost savings that they delivered in Q4 in relation to the heads and a lot of the overhead costs, we expect that are in play now, and they'll continue throughout the year."

I would, in particular, like to express my gratitude to all our employees who've traversed this difficult terrain with courage and commitment and have played an important empathetic role in their communities during these stressful months. Despite the harsh conditions and the inevitable COVID-caused disruptions, I am pleased to report that News Corp had a particularly robust first quarter, with resounding year-on-year growth in our profitability and revenue expansion in several key segments.
Three vital pillars of our company: Dow Jones, Book Publishing and Digital Real Estate Services had notable EBITDA growth and higher revenue in Q1. Consolidated revenues were over $2.1 billion. And while that was down 10% year-over-year, adjusted revenues, which exclude News America Marketing, Unruly and other items noted in the press release were only 3% lower. Consequentially, in Q1, News Corp's total segment EBITDA was $268 million, an increase of 21% year-over-year, evidence of the strength of our core businesses and the growth potential of those sectors in which we have made significant acquisitions, in particular, Digital Real Estate and Book Publishing.
We are also benefiting from our strategy to simplify the company, allowing us to focus on the segments that have the greatest growth potential as well as ensuring that we are resolutely reducing shared costs around the company. We are determined to provide greater transparency for investors, and the presentation of Dow Jones as a separate segment was integral to that continuing process.
Turning now to the details. Digital Real Estate Services flourished this quarter. Despite limits on home inspections and other COVID-related disruption, revenues increased 7% year-over-year, while segment EBITDA surged 45% year-over-year, led by particularly strong results at Move, operator of realtor.com, which had record revenues in the quarter of $138 million.
Both REA and realtor.com reported record traffic during the quarter, with the latter having reached a high 92 million monthly unique visitors in August, while traffic was up 26% for the quarter. Based on comScore data, REALTOR has outpaced Zillow in audience growth for 16 of the past 18 months. This success comes as realtor.com continues to focus on transforming its business towards a data-rich referral model. We are convinced there's a substantial opportunity for REALTOR to expand its market from a still deep pool of real estate marketing dollars to provide value-added services at premium prices in mortgages, titles and other adjacent categories.
I would note, realtor.com's new partnership with Rocket Mortgage as one example of the company's growth potential and our efforts to expand the addressable market. realtor.com also recently launched the Seller's Marketplace to provide listings for our buyers, without the antediluvian approach of our main competitor, which has been doubling down on its house flipping business. We are a genuinely nimble, agile digital company and will leave bricks-and-mortar to the specialists.
realtor.com is also constantly focused on improving transparency and choice for those buying and selling homes, including higher-quality estimates and salient information about everything from flood risk to neighborhood noise levels. We have been introducing features while still being cost-conscious, and that flense of creativity and discipline is behind the burgeoning of the business.
At REA, while listing volumes have patently been affected by government-imposed COVID restrictions, the business still posted a higher profit contribution. What we are seeing at both companies is that the pandemic has been a catalyst for many families to reconsider their current housing and environment, prompting an increasing number to seek less dense areas and larger properties. As the restrictions on movement ease, we believe that trend is likely to gather momentum, particularly at a time of record low interest rates.
As we noted earlier, Dow Jones is now reported as a separate segment, which is innate part of our efforts to increase transparency and highlight an inherent value. As you can see from the company's resounding results, there is much to savor about the business and its prospects. As we noted in our Investor Day presentation, Dow Jones aims to double its subscribers, given an incremental pool of 12 million prospective Dow Jones premium customers in the U.S. alone. And as the world's leading provider of business news and analysis, Dow Jones and The Wall Street Journal have maintained premium pricing, and we are increasing our efforts to upsell our customers' high-value specialist products.
Revenue benefited from accelerating digital circulation and digital advertising growth and continued expansion of risk and compliance. These compensated for not unexpected decline in print advertising. Know the total ad decline was not as marked as that of other publishers. As a result, Dow Jones segment EBITDA grew 47% year-over-year.
A few metrics to note behind that admiral result at a turbulent time. Risk and compliance revenues rose 16% year-over-year, representing the 21st consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. The Wall Street Journal reported 27% growth in digital-only subscriptions. And total Dow Jones subscriptions increased 18% in the quarter, reaching approximately 3.9 million.
MarketWatch also had a buoyant quarter, with the highest first quarter revenue results in its history as traffic surged to 52 million average monthly uniques. In recent days, we have moved to further monetize that fast-expanding audience by introducing subscriptions and enhancing the news flow for loyal readers. The early results are rather positive for both MarketWatch and Barron's.
To gain the sense of the size of the Dow Jones universe, which like the actual universe, is still expanding, traffic across the digital network rose 54% year-over-year in Q1, averaging 127 million unique users per month, according to Adobe Analytics. And we firmly believe we are still at a relatively early stage of our potential audience and revenue growth.
Meanwhile, in Book Publishing, HarperCollins also reported a strong quarter, with revenues increasing 13% and segment EBITDA up 45%. Again, those results reflected a mix of the creativity of the commissioning, along with disciplined, diligent cost control. Reopened bookstores restocked their shelves with compelling HarperCollins tones, and overall, digital sales in Q1 were up 20% compared to the prior year, continuing a trend that was evident in Q4 of fiscal '20.
Direct-to-consumer revenues rose almost 38% year-over-year. And the I Can Read! Book Club for children nearly quadrupled its membership since February to more than 95,000 monthly active users as of quarter end.
Best-selling authors included Daniel Silva, Jenna Bush Hager, Lucy Foley, Ben Shapiro and LeBron James. And looking ahead, we have high hopes for Frontier Follies by Ree Drummond, The Greatest Secret by Rhonda Byrne, Concrete Rose by Angie Thomas and Code Name Bananas by David Walliams, which is being released today.
At Foxtel, there was marked improvement in the growth of the OTT business, which saw total closing paid subscriptions reached a new record high, with nearly 3.3 million subscribers. This includes over 1.2 million paying customers of Kayo, Foxtel Now and the recently launched Binge. In total, there was a 67% year-over-year growth in the OTT base.
To be specific, as of September 30, Kayo had 644,000 paid subscribers and 691,000 total subscribers. Foxtel Now had 298,000 paid subscribers and 310,000 total subscribers. And the burgeoning Binge had 290,000 paid subscribers and 321,000 total subscribers. One other note about Binge, the active subscriber is watching for 7.5 hours a week. So we are clearly pleased with how they're binging on Binge.
In the News Media segment, the rate of year-over-year revenue decline moderated compared to Q4. Obviously, the direct year-on-year comparisons are complicated by the sale of both NAM and Unruly. Cost consciousness continue to be raised with one recent announcement of note. In September, we did our plans to shift the printing of The Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and Barron's to the New York Times plant in Queens, and we are actively exploring options for the Bronx Print Plant site, for which there has been considerable interest. This decision involved much agonizing as the Bronx plant and its talented, committed staff have played an important role in the history of the company and the U.S. newspaper industry. Their sterling efforts will resonate for many decades to come as the mastheads continue their migration to digital in a rapidly changing media environment.
A measure of that evolution is that the New York Post digital network traffic grew 35% in September year-over-year to 144 million unique users. Digital advertising in the quarter climbed over 20% and nearly 90% of advertising revenues at the Post are now digital.
The transformation of News Corp Australia continue to pace, with the transition of most of our community in regional mastheads to digital-only. All told, our Australian titles saw strong digital subscription growth, up 26% year-over-year to 685,000. In the U.K., The Times and Sunday Times digital subscribers expanded 8% to 337,000 and also saw strong ARPU growth. Also in the U.K., Times Radio, launched last quarter, has already exceeded over 100,000 listeners each week, clearly benefiting from our leveraging of the strong Times brand and talent. Of course, it is also a powerful marketing platform for all of our U.K. titles and businesses.
Finally, it should be clear to all that the digital landscape is changing dramatically, and we are at the forefront of that change. It could even be argued that much of that change would not have happened without News Corp's advocacy over the past decade. The drive towards achieving a premium for premium content has gathered momentum, and we are pleased that negotiations with the large platforms are ongoing. This is certainly not the end of the issue, but without being too Churchillian, it is the end of the beginning.
Now more than ever, we believe it is evident that News Corp has value above and beyond the sum of our parts. So that mathematical fact is yet to be fully realized for our investors. That value should be more visible now that we have broken out the Dow Jones results, which also increases the scrutiny of our other news businesses, which are themselves in the midst of a successful transition. We plan to continue simplifying the business, and are open to making structural changes to maximize value and will continue to address the cost base. Unlike most media companies, we have the option of optionality, having carefully mastered our cash reserves, which have improved since the pandemic began. I believe our continuing concerted initiatives are making us a more focused and more digital company, which will generate enhanced returns for our investors in the months, the quarters and the years to come.
And now for further financial enlightenment, we turn to Susan Panuccio."

As Robert mentioned, we are pleased with the start to the new fiscal year, particularly in an environment which has clearly been marked by unpredictability and uncertainty. Our businesses have responded well to the challenges as evidenced by these results. Fiscal 2021 first quarter total revenues were over $2.1 billion, down 10% versus the prior year, while total segment EBITDA was $268 million, up 21% year-over-year, led by very strong growth at the Digital Real Estate Services, Dow Jones and Book Publishing segments.
On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact from acquisitions and divestitures, most notably the sale of News America Marketing in the fourth quarter of last fiscal year as well as currency fluctuations and other items disclosed in our release, revenues were down by only 3%, while total segment EBITDA increased by 23%.
Net income for the quarter was $47 million compared to a net loss of $211 million in the prior year, reflecting the absence of impairment charges and higher total segment EBITDA, partially offset by higher tax expense. The prior year figure reflected $273 million of noncash impairment charges, primarily at News America Marketing.
For the quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.06 as compared to a loss of $0.39 in the prior year. Adjusted EPS were $0.08 in the quarter versus $0.04 in the prior year.
Turning now to the operating segments. At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues increased 7% to $290 million, a big improvement from the fourth quarter, primarily due to the strength of Move. On an adjusted basis, revenues increased 4%.  Segment EBITDA rose 45% to $119 million or 40% on an adjusted basis, primarily driven by a meaningful increase in profit contribution from Move due to a combination of higher revenues and cost reduction measures. The results at Move accounted for over 80% of segment revenue growth and over 70% of segment EBITDA growth this quarter.
REA group revenues rose 2%, reflecting a $6 million or 4% benefit from currency fluctuations. National residential listing volumes declined 2% for the quarter impacted by stage 4 government restrictions in Melbourne, which included a ban on physical inspections. To put that in perspective, Metro Melbourne listings in the quarter declined 44% versus the prior year, while the listings in Metro Sydney grew 23%. REA's results benefited from positive FX movements as well as modest residential revenue and financial services growth driven by higher refinancing activity, but the growth was mostly offset by declines in commercial developer and Asia. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for more details.
At Move, we are extremely pleased with our progress during the first quarter. Move revenues rose 12% to $138 million, representing an all-time high, with real estate revenues rising 13%. As Robert mentioned, traffic reached record levels with an average of 90 million unique users for the first quarter, an increase of 26% year-over-year. Monthly average lead volume for the quarter grew at an even faster rate at over 40%.
We saw material growth in the performance-based referral model, which accounted for approximately 30% of total Move revenues in the quarter, benefiting from the growth in lead volume, higher home prices and real estate transaction closes. As I've mentioned in the past, there is a delay in recognizing the revenue from the referral model due to the timing of transaction closes, which, in addition to natural real estate seasonal patterns can lead to some volatility quarter-to-quarter as we shift more leads to that model.
These results are very encouraging as we further progress towards increasing our addressable market through the integration of key ancillary services like our Rocket Mortgage partnership. While we continue to transition to the referral model, the combination of strong lead volume and price increases for our more traditional lead generation business resulted in a more stable revenue performance this quarter than the prior quarters.
Move increased its profit contribution by $28 million versus the prior year, driven by the scaling of the referral model, cost efficiencies resulting from the restructuring of the organization last quarter, including completing the integration of REALTOR and Opcity and the deferral of marketing spend.
Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $496 million, down 4% versus the prior year and included a $20 million or 3% positive impact from foreign currency fluctuations. The revenue decline moderated from the prior quarter a strong growth at Kayo, driven by the return of live sports as well as the expansion of Binge partially offset the declines in residential and commercial subscriptions. Foxtel's closing paid subscriber base reached a record high at nearly 3.3 million as of September 30, up 7% year-over-year, led by meaningful growth of paying OTT subscriptions, which reached over 1.2 million at quarter end.
Broadcast subscribers declined about 10% to 1.85 million. Commercial subscribers declined 23% to 205,000, but marked a big improvement from the fourth quarter due to the reopening of licensed venues in most parts of the country. Foxtel is continuing to work with impacted customers in the pubs, clubs and accommodation sectors, particularly in Victoria and New South Wales.
Broadcast churn was relatively stable at 14.6% versus 14.4% in the prior year, partly impacted by the roll-off of some of the churn mitigation initiatives, but were still below the financial year '19 and financial year '20 averages. Broadcast ARPU increased 1% from the prior year to AUD 79, which was also modestly higher than the fourth quarter.
Segment EBITDA declined 4% to $78 million and declined 9% on an adjusted basis. Total cost declined approximately 3% or $15 million, with a $16 million or 4% adverse impact due to currency fluctuations. Underlying savings were $31 million or AUD 50 million. These savings came despite an increasing sports rights and production costs, partly due to the $36 million or AUD 51 million impact from the timing of some sporting events deferred from the fourth quarter. Foxtel also benefited in the quarter from lower entertainment programming costs as well as declines in transmission and overhead expenses as we see the flow-through from the cost actions taken last year.
Moving on to Dow Jones. Revenues for the quarter were $386 million, up 1% compared to the prior year, with digital revenues accounting for a record 73% of total revenues this quarter, up 8 percentage points from the prior year. Circulation revenues rose 7% due to robust growth in digital circulation revenues partially offset by lower single copy and amenity print volume and marks a meaningful improvement from the fourth quarter rate of 2%.
As Robert mentioned, Dow Jones again achieved record subscriptions in the quarter, with the year-over-year growth rate slightly higher than the fourth quarter. Dow Jones average subscriptions to its consumer product for the quarter were nearly 3.9 million, up 18% from the prior year. And of that, digital-only subscriptions were 2.9 million, up 29% year-over-year.
For The Wall Street Journal, there were 3.1 million average subscriptions for the quarter, up nearly 19% from the prior year, with digital-only subscriptions growing 27% to more than 2.3 million. Revenues from Dow Jones Professional Information business rose 2% year-over-year, which included 16% growth in risk and compliance. As mentioned at the Dow Jones Investor Day, long-term contracts are 95% of risk and compliance revenues, providing us with a more predictable and reoccurring revenue base.
Advertising revenues, which accounted for only 18% of revenues this quarter, declined 17% to $70 million, an improvement from a 28% decline last quarter. Digital advertising revenues again exceeded print advertising revenues, accounting for 57% of total advertising and increased 14%, benefiting from growth in direct display, programmatic and sponsored link revenues. Interestingly, we saw digital revenue growth in every industry category. Print and other advertising fell 39%, a more modest improvement from the fourth quarter rate.
Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter rose 47% to $72 million, with margins expanding to almost 19% and up almost 6 percentage points versus the prior year. Overall costs for the segment declined approximately 6%, which combined with the top line growth, led to the material margin expansion this quarter.
At Book Publishing, HarperCollins had a very strong quarter, building on the momentum from the fourth quarter, with revenues up 13% year-over-year to $458 million and segment EBITDA up 45% to $71 million. Revenue growth was driven by general trade and the children's books as well as modest revenue contribution from the Egmont acquisition in the U.K. Adjusted revenues and adjusted segment EBITDA grew 10% and 41%, respectively.
We saw strong digital growth with digital sales up 20% year-over-year to represent 23% of consumer revenues, up from 22%. E-book sales increased 18% year-over-year, with gains in all genres while downloadable audio books increased 26% year-over-year. As Robert noted, HarperCollins benefited from a strong release slate, which included Daniel Silva's The Order, Lucy Foley's The Guest List, Ben Shapiro's How to Destroy America in Three Easy Steps, Jenna Bush Hager's Everything Beautiful in Its Time, as well as LeBron James' I Promise in children's books. The backlist contributed 61% of sales this quarter, down from 64% last year, which was due to the larger mix of frontlist titles this quarter.
Turning to News Media. We saw moderation in revenue declines this quarter compared to the fourth quarter. Revenues for the quarter were $487 million, down 37% versus the prior year, of which the impact from the divestment of News America Marketing accounted for the majority of the decline. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact from the divestment of NAM and Unruly and the other items mentioned in our release, revenues declined 16%, which is an improvement from the 22% decline in the fourth quarter. The decline also reflects a $35 million or 5% negative impact from the closure or transition to digital of certain regional and community newspapers in Australia.
Circulation and subscription revenues were flat as a $10 million or 4% benefit from currency fluctuations, strong digital paid subscriber growth and cover price increases in the U.K. offset lower news stand sales related to COVID-19. We have seen print volumes beginning to improve, particularly at the weekend papers.
Advertising revenue fell $262 million or 59% on a reported basis, of which $200 million or 45% was from the sale of News America Marketing, $29 million or a 7% negative impact related to the closure or transition to digital of certain regional and community titles in Australia, with the rest of the decline relating to the overall weakness in the print advertising market. Advertising revenues at News U.K. fell 21% or 24% in local currency, while News Australia declined 35% or 38% in local currency, which includes the $29 million negative impact or 20% related to the regional and community titles. Advertising revenues at the New York Post increased 6%, which includes 22% digital advertising growth.
Segment EBITDA for the quarter was a loss of $22 million compared to a positive $7 million in the prior year, or a decline of $29 million. The results reflect lower revenues and the absence of a net $12 million contribution from News America Marketing and Unruly, partially offset by higher cost savings across the businesses.
I would now like to talk about some of the themes in the upcoming quarter. Needless to say, forecasting continues to remain challenging. At Digital Real Estate Services, as REA noted, national residential listings in Australia for October were down 1% to the prior year with increases in Melbourne and Sydney. REA has also agreed to take a controlling interest in India's Elara Technologies. And as a result, we expect to fully consolidate their results, assuming completion on November 30. Please refer to REA's press release for more details.
At REALTOR, we remain very encouraged by traffic and lead volumes. We are planning higher reinvestment spending in Q1 given our focus on expanding into adjacencies and growing the addressable market. In Subscription Video Services, with the conclusion of Australia's 2 Tier 1 winter football seasons, the AFL and NRL, we expect to see seasonality in Kayo's subscriber numbers as we transition to the summer sports, most notably Cricket. For Q2, we expect about $18 million or AUD 26 million of sports rights that were deferred due to COVID-19, but expect offsetting savings due to the ongoing benefit of the cost reduction measures taken in Q4 last year and the continued cost focus within the business.
At Dow Jones, overall, year-over-year trends thus far are similar, including strong digital advertising growth. As we look to the rest of the year, we expect modest reinvestment in the business as we focus on driving revenue growth through subscriptions and in risk and compliance.
In Book Publishing, as Robert mentioned, the key titles in the second quarter include Ree Drummond's Frontier Follies and Rhonda Byrne's The Greatest Secret. We have continued to see higher online sales.
At News Media, overall year-over-year revenue and cost trends remained similar to the prior quarter absent currency, although visibility remains limited. As a reminder, the prior year included a $22 million onetime benefit to segment EBITDA from the settlement of certain warranty claims at News U.K.'s printing business. We also expect some investment as we ramp our global shared service initiative over the course of the year.
The COVID-19 crisis has presented challenges across all of our businesses, and they have responded in a balanced and measured way. They will continue to focus on finding the right balance between permanent cost reduction and investment in growth opportunities, while keeping a close eye on the macroeconomic conditions and government responses to the virus within their own markets. We believe we are well positioned as we move forward with a greater focus on digital across the company and a more disciplined approach to costs.
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

I remember there was skeptics at the time of the acquisition, the naysayers, who wondered whether we could transform a company that frankly had seen better days. Well, the best days are now clearly ahead.
We've used our editorial expertise and reached the power of our media platforms and a relentless focus on the need of customers to improve user experience, and that's showing up in the returns. For us, the challenge, as you indicated, to get the blend rides between continuing expansion and contemporary returns. I mean obviously, due to the savvy leadership of David Doctorow and Tracey Fellows, we have had a massive increase in margin. And we have elasticity there. But we believe that we're at the early stage of the exponential expansion of that business. And to be honest, it will also be a beneficiary of our advocacy to change the digital landscape, whether it be through digital ad yields or algorithm transparency. And so it will be eminently efficacious for REALTOR, for REA, for our businesses in Asia and for our operations in India.
Now as for structure, the most important way of maximizing our real estate properties value is to ensure that they are the fastest-growing, most lucrative, most innovative sites in the world, truly digital in orientation. And shall I say not weighed down by bricks-and-mortar and unsold inventory or the need to renovate a kitchen or add a bidet in the bathroom. The benefits of that creative committed approach to potential vendors, to potential buyers and to real realtors is patently obvious in the results last quarter.
Now we have Tracey Fellows overseeing our global real estate operations, and we have just consolidated our India operations through REA. So there is a shape, a structure emerging. And more than that, there is a sense of purpose and of profitability. We are, by many measures, the world's largest real estate company, and that business has more than withstood the stress tests of recent months. In fact, the recent months showed the extraordinary potential of that business."

So we would expect to see that scale up as we go throughout the year, obviously, depending on audience and revenue growth. And we also will have some reinvestment in product innovation as we look to scale out the platforms. So without sort of giving guidance, that's sort of broadly speaking how we're thinking about it."

I'm particularly conscious, given the implied value ex REA is now at very much historically low levels, by my calcs, REA is now more than 90% of market value. So there's clear -- there seems to be a clear disconnect. So is there some scope for a spinout?
And secondly, on Dow Jones costs. Interesting, the extent to which you can hold on to the cost reductions, which have been achieved in the quarter, whether they're largely temporary and really achieved as a result of COVID."
