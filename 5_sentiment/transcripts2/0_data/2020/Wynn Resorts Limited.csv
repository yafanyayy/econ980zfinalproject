To kick it off, I'd like to start in Macau. So we are currently focused almost solely on the health and safety of our employees, our customers and the Macau community at la",718,"Thanks, Craig, and welcome, everyone, to our fourth quarter conference call today. To kick it off, I'd like to start in Macau. So we are currently focused almost solely on the health and safety of our employees, our customers and the Macau community at large right now in Macau. I'd like to commend the government of Macau and China, in fact, for the quick and decisive action that they take and continue to take to contain the coronavirus. We're in daily conversations with the government, has been extremely transparent and we -- they have been terrific partners with us as we focus on the safety of everyone in Macau. 
In fact, on February 5 at midnight, we work closely with the government of Macau and all of the operators in Macau to cease our casino operations at midnight on February 5. It was a controlled and organized closure of the casino. We do still have our hotel and a couple of restaurants opened for the few remaining guests that are in Macau. But during this time, while the casino is closed, our operating expense burn rate is roughly $2.4 million to $2.6 million a day, and that's largely comprised of payroll to our 12,200 employees. 
Looking back at the fourth quarter, we generated $347.7 million of EBITDA. And like the past quarters, we experienced quick growth in core mass, coupled with compression in the VIP segment. As we reported on the third quarter, October was actually quite strong, generating EBITDA of a little over $4 million a day. But we began to see deceleration, leading up to the 20th year celebration handover of Macau back to China in mid -- on December 20, just like the entire market. However, while it's a short period of time, we did notice that beginning on December 23 through January 10 in a somewhat normal operating environment, our business jumped right back to $4 million a day in EBITDA between the 2 properties on a normalized basis. Las Vegas, we made $80 million in EBITDA, with a $20 million negative hold impact during the quarter. On a full year, just to put it in perspective, in 2019, our volumes were down roughly 30% in 2019 compared to all of 2018, and that contributed to more than a $50 million decline in EBITDA year-over-year. 
Our domestic business continues to be up in the casino and in non gaming. RevPAR was up over 3%, in the fourth quarter, and our retail revenues were up double digits. We're excited about 2020 in Las Vegas. We have a 430,000 square foot convention center that's opening in weeks to great fanfare. We have 3 new restaurants that will be more social dining focused and high energy that will be opening throughout 2020, and we'll begin the remodel of Wynn Las Vegas, the 2,700 rooms here in the summer of this year and completing before the end of 2020. So we have a lot going on in Las Vegas, and we feel really good about all of the segments of our business as we continue to monitor the Far East segment as it relates to Las Vegas. 
Looking at Encore Boston Harbor. We doubled our EBITDA from the third quarter to the fourth quarter to $15 million. Our Table Games business remains healthy. We opened and Table Games is healthy, and it continues to grow and to be quite strong, actually. And all of the programs that we're putting in place for our slot win, we launched the Wind Rewards program, which is a first for us in North America, which is a tiered card program, we're starting to see those things work in at Encore Boston Harbor. In fact, our win per unit on the slot was up a little over 14% compared to the third quarter, and we're continuing to see incremental growth on the floor. In 2020, we're focused on continuing to match our food and beverage concepts with our customers. So destination dining for the overnight visitors as we're ramping our hotel business there and providing more quick-serve options for the daily visitors. So we feel good about the progress that we're making at Encore Boston Harbor as we continue to ramp that property throughout 2020. With that, I'll turn it over to Craig."

As noted in our release, our Macau operations delivered adjusted EBITDA of $347.7 million on $1.1 billion of operating revenues.

As noted in our release, our Macau operations delivered adjusted EBITDA of $347.7 million on $1.1 billion of operating revenues. The quarter was characterized by strength in mass with combined property win in the mass segment, up 6% year-over-year. Our results in Macau were positively impacted by higher than normal direct VIP hold percentage, which increased EBITDA by approximately $17.5 million from a normalized level with the hold impact weighted more heavily to Wynn Macau at approximately $12.5 million. The team in Macau has done a great job of controlling costs at both properties. At Wynn Palace, our operating expenses, excluding taxes, were down both year-over-year and sequentially, which drove a 40 basis point increase in normalized EBITDA margin compared to Q3 despite the top line pressure experienced market wide. At Wynn Macau, OpEx was flat year-over-year and sequentially, despite incremental payroll expense incurred to up the Lakeside casino. We are well prepared to drive strong operating leverage when the market returns to normal. Our Las Vegas operations produced adjusted EBITDA of $80.1 million in the third quarter on operating revenue of $368.8 million. Our results were negatively impacted by lower table in both baccarat and domestic tables, costing us about $20 million of EBITDA, as Matt mentioned. While baccarat was soft year-over-year on a tough comp, we saw 4% growth in non-baccarat table drop and slot handle. On the hotel side, RevPAR increased approximately 3% year-over-year to $288, driving $120.3 million of hotel revenue. Bad debt expense in Las Vegas was $4.1 million compared to $1 million in the prior year quarter, costing us $3 million in comparable EBITDA. The team in Las Vegas also did an excellent job controlling costs in the face of upward pressure on payroll, with operating expenses, excluding tax and bad debt, down slightly year-over-year. We spent approximately $49 million in project costs in the group space at Wynn Las Vegas in Q4 '19, taking our spend to date to roughly $351 million. Construction is complete and the expansion is slated to open in a few weeks. Encore Boston Harbor produced $15.3 million in EBITDA and $169.3 million in operating revenue. Table Games hold was in the normal range. As Matt mentioned, we have a number of initiatives in play in Boston designed to drive revenue growth, and we expect those initiatives will bear fruit over the course of 2020. We have also carefully managed our expense base there and operating expenses, excluding gaming tax in Boston were down approximately 11% quarter-over-quarter. We anticipate making additional investments in the property throughout the year, particularly in food and beverage. But we are not yet ready to quantify the budget for those initiatives, we expect they will be relatively modest. 
Turning to the balance sheet. During the quarter, we successfully completed a $1 billion 10-year senior notes offering in Macau with strong support from Asia-based long-term investors. We intend to use the proceeds from the notes offering to repay a portion of our term loans in Macau. As a result, this will reduce our senior secured debt and related leverage ratio, while extending our maturity profile at an attractive rate. We ended the quarter with total debt at $10.4 billion, inclusive of the $1 billion of recently issued Macao We also had total cash and investments of $2.36 billion, including approximately $1.8 billion at Wynn Macau, and total company-wide revolver capacity of $1.25 billion. Our liquidity position, particularly in Macau is very strong. Finally, during the quarter, we returned over $100 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend payment. 
With that, we will now open up the call to Q&A. Operator?"

In terms of Macau, in general, I think the way we look at it is there's been so much investment in the region and all the new infrastructure that was just coming to fruition with the high-speed rail coming into Macau the light rail launching, and it was really set up for a quite extraordinary 2020. We were quite excited about it. So I'm not -- I don't want to predict when operations will be back to normal. They will be eventually. We're not exactly sure when. But Macau is set up for a really great rebound. Tourism was 1 of the first things that rebound in events like this because people want to get out and move around and get back to normal.

To your question on covenants, the vast majority of our debt stack is comprised of long-dated unsecured bonds with no maintenance covenants. The 2 bank facilities do have maintenance covenants. The U.S. facility has more than ample covenant headroom to sustain a very prolonged period of suppressed business volumes in Macau. And the Macau facility does have a maintenance covenant that is sensitive to Macau EBITDA, and as I expect several concessionaires do, we've already have a game plan in place to manage that to the extent that the shutdown is extended, but it would have to be quite extended.

Right now, in Macau, the roughly $1.8 million to $1.9 million a day of payroll, we are not looking at cutting that at all. Now at the time when you invest in your people, you don't do something to our term that will hurt the culture or cause any distraction. So we're investing in the community right now. Because we know this will be temporary, and we think that it's the right long-term investment. For Encore Boston Harbor, when we laid out the program when we opened to Analyst Day, we talked about a 2-year ramp period. Admittedly, it has launched softer than we thought, in particular on the slot side. And so we're doing a lot of work. What we realized was we didn't have quite the right food and beverage program, in particular, around quick serve. For the daytime slot customer. It's actually the same thing that we went through at Wynn Palace. And when we opened, we realized we needed more quick-serve restaurants in Wynn Palace. We immediately closed third of the casino. We built We've built 5 new restaurants in the meantime. And so we're going through that process in a very fast way at Encore Boston Harbor. Because when we see a problem, we fix it. So I think we're still in that 2-year ramp-up mode."

To kick it off, I'd like to start in Macau.

To kick it off, I'd like to start in Macau. So we are currently focused almost solely on the health and safety of our employees, our customers and the Macau community at large right now in Macau. 
I'd like to commend the government of Macau and China, in fact, for the quick and decisive action that they take and continue to take to contain the coronavirus. We're in daily conversations with the government, has been extremely transparent and we -- they have been terrific partners with us as we focus on the safety of everyone in Macau. 
In fact, on February 5 at midnight, we worked closely with the government of Macau and all of the operators in Macau to cease our casino operations at midnight on February 5. It was a controlled and organized closure of the casino. We do still have our hotel and a couple of restaurants opened for the few remaining guests that are in Macau. But during this time, while the casino is closed, our operating expense burn rate is roughly $2.4 million to $2.6 million a day, and that's largely comprised of payroll to our 12,200 employees. 
Looking back at the fourth quarter, we generated $347.7 million of EBITDA. And like the past quarters, we experienced quick growth in core mass, coupled with compression in the VIP segment. As we reported on the third quarter, October was actually quite strong, generating EBITDA of a little over $4 million a day. But we began to see deceleration, leading up to the 20th year celebration handover of Macau back to China in mid -- on December 20, just like the entire market. However, while it's a short period of time, we did notice that beginning on December 23 through January 10 in a somewhat normal operating environment, our business jumped right back to $4 million a day in EBITDA between the 2 properties on a normalized basis. 
Moving to Las Vegas, we made $80 million in EBITDA, with a $20 million negative hold impact during the quarter. On a full year, just to put it in perspective, in 2019, our baccarat volumes were down roughly 30% in 2019 compared to all of 2018, and that contributed to more than a $50 million decline in EBITDA year-over-year. 
Our domestic business continues to be up in the casino and in non-gaming. RevPAR was up over 3%, in the fourth quarter, and our retail revenues were up double digits. 
We're excited about 2020 in Las Vegas. We have a 430,000 square foot convention center that's opening in weeks to great fanfare. We have 3 new restaurants that will be more social dining focused and high energy that will be opening throughout 2020, and we'll begin the remodel of Wynn Las Vegas, the 2,700 rooms here in the summer of this year and completing before the end of 2020. So we have a lot going on in Las Vegas, and we feel really good about all of the segments of our business as we continue to monitor the Far East segment as it relates to Las Vegas. 
Looking at Encore Boston Harbor. We doubled our EBITDA from the third quarter to the fourth quarter to $15 million. Our Table Games business remains healthy. We opened -- and Table Games is healthy, and it continues to grow and to be quite strong, actually. And all the programs that we're putting in place for our slot win, we launched the Wynn rewards program, which is a first for us in North America, which is a tiered card program, we're starting to see those things work in at Encore Boston Harbor. In fact, our win per unit on the slot was up a little over 14% compared to the third quarter, and we're continuing to see incremental growth on the slot floor. 
In 2020, we're focused on continuing to match our food and beverage concepts with our customers. So destination dining for the overnight visitors as we're ramping our hotel business there and providing more quick-serve options for the daily visitors. So we feel good about the progress that we're making at Encore Boston Harbor as we continue to ramp that property throughout 2020. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Craig."

As noted in our release, our Macau operations delivered adjusted EBITDA of $347.7 million on $1.1 billion of operating revenues.

As noted in our release, our Macau operations delivered adjusted EBITDA of $347.7 million on $1.1 billion of operating revenues. The quarter was characterized by strength in mass with combined property win in the mass segment, up 6% year-over-year. 
Our results in Macau were positively impacted by higher than normal direct VIP hold percentage, which increased EBITDA by approximately $17.5 million from a normalized level with the hold impact weighted more heavily to Wynn Macau at approximately $12.5 million. 
The team in Macau has done a great job of controlling costs at both properties. At Wynn Palace, our operating expenses, excluding taxes, were down both year-over-year and sequentially, which drove a 40 basis point increase in normalized EBITDA margin compared to Q3 despite the top line pressure experienced market wide. 
At Wynn Macau, OpEx was flat year-over-year and sequentially, despite incremental payroll expense incurred to staff up the Lakeside Casino. We are well prepared to drive strong operating leverage when the market returns to normal. 
Our Las Vegas operations produced adjusted EBITDA of $80.1 million in the third quarter on operating revenue of $368.8 million. Our results were negatively impacted by lower table games hold in both baccarat and domestic tables, costing us about $20 million of EBITDA, as Matt mentioned. While baccarat was soft year-over-year on a tough comp, we saw 4% growth in non-baccarat table drop and slot handle. 
On the hotel side, RevPAR increased approximately 3% year-over-year to $288, driving $120.3 million of hotel revenue. Bad debt expense in Las Vegas was $4.1 million compared to $1 million in the prior year quarter, costing us $3 million in comparable EBITDA. The team in Las Vegas also did an excellent job controlling costs in the face of upward pressure on payroll, with operating expenses, excluding tax and bad debt, down slightly year-over-year. 
We spent approximately $49 million in project costs in the group space at Wynn Las Vegas in Q4 '19, taking our spend to date to roughly $351 million. Construction is now complete and the expansion is slated to open in a few weeks. 
Encore Boston Harbor produced $15.3 million in EBITDA on a $169.3 million in operating revenue. Table Games hold was in the normal range. As Matt mentioned, we have a number of initiatives in play in Boston designed to drive revenue growth, and we expect those initiatives will bear fruit over the course of 2020. 
We have also carefully managed our expense base there and operating expenses, excluding gaming tax in Boston were down approximately 11% quarter-over-quarter. We anticipate making additional investments in the property throughout the year, particularly in food and beverage. But we are not yet ready to quantify the budget for those initiatives, we expect they will be relatively modest. 
Turning to the balance sheet. During the quarter, we successfully completed a $1 billion 10-year senior notes offering in Macau with strong support from Asia-based long-term investors. We intend to use the proceeds from the notes offering to repay a portion of our term loans in Macau. As a result, this will reduce our senior secured debt and related leverage ratio, while extending our maturity profile at an attractive rate. 
We ended the quarter with total debt of $10.4 billion, inclusive of the $1 billion of recently issued Macao bonds. We also had total cash and investments of $2.36 billion, including approximately $1.8 billion at Wynn Macau, and total company-wide revolver capacity of $1.25 billion. Our liquidity position, particularly in Macau is very strong. Finally, during the quarter, we returned over $100 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend payment. 
With that, we will now open up the call to Q&A. Operator?"

And so far, we feel like things are fairly well contained, and we're just watching it very carefully. 
In terms of Macau, in general, I think the way we look at it is there's been so much investment in the region and all the new infrastructure that was just coming to fruition with the high-speed rail coming into Macau and the light rail launching, and it was really set up for a quite extraordinary 2020. We were quite excited about it. So I'm not -- I don't want to predict when operations will be back to normal. They will be eventually. We're not exactly sure when. But Macau is set up for a really great rebound. Tourism was one of the first things that rebound in events like this because people want to get out and move around and get back to normal.

To your question on covenants, the vast majority of our debt stack is comprised of long-dated unsecured bonds with no maintenance covenants. The 2 bank facilities do have maintenance covenants. The U.S. facility has more than ample covenant headroom to sustain a very prolonged period of suppressed business volumes in Macau. And the Macau facility does have a maintenance covenant that is sensitive to Macau EBITDA. And as I suspect, several concessionaires do, we've already have a game plan in place to manage that to the extent that the shutdown is extended, but it would have to be quite extended.

Right now, in Macau, the roughly $1.8 million to $1.9 million a day of payroll, we are not looking at cutting that at all. Now is the time when you invest in your people. You don't do something short-term that will hurt the culture or cause any distraction. So we're investing in the community right now. Because we know this will be temporary, and we think that it's the right long-term investment. 
For Encore Boston Harbor, when we laid out the program when we opened to Analyst Day, we talked about a 2-year ramp period. Admittedly, it has launched softer than we thought, in particular on the slot side. And so we're doing a lot of work. What we realized was we didn't have quite the right food and beverage program, in particular, around quick serve for the daytime slot customer. It's actually the same thing that we went through at Wynn Palace. And when we opened, we realized we needed more quick-serve restaurants in Wynn Palace. We immediately closed 1/3 of the casino. We built Red 8. We've built 5 new restaurants in the meantime. And so we're going through that process in a very fast way at Encore Boston Harbor. Because when we see a problem, we fix it. So I think we're still in that 2-year ramp-up mode."

And welcome, everyone, to our fourth quarter conference call today. To kick it off, I'd like to start in Macau.

And welcome, everyone, to our fourth quarter conference call today. To kick it off, I'd like to start in Macau. So we are currently focused almost solely on the health and safety of our employees, our customers and the Macau community at large right now in Macau. 
I'd like to commend the government of Macau and China, in fact, for the quick and decisive action that they take and continue to take to contain the coronavirus. We're in daily conversations with the government, has been extremely transparent and we -- they have been terrific partners with us as we focus on the safety of everyone in Macau. 
In fact, on February 5 at midnight, we worked closely with the government of Macau and all of the operators in Macau to cease our casino operations at midnight on February 5. It was a controlled and organized closure of the casino. We do still have our hotel and a couple of restaurants opened for the few remaining guests that are in Macau. But during this time, while the casino is closed, our operating expense burn rate is roughly $2.4 million to $2.6 million a day, and that's largely comprised of payroll to our 12,200 employees. 
Looking back at the fourth quarter, we generated $347.7 million of EBITDA. And like the past quarters, we experienced quick growth in core mass, coupled with compression in the VIP segment. As we reported on the third quarter, October was actually quite strong, generating EBITDA of a little over $4 million a day. But we began to see deceleration, leading up to the 20th year celebration handover of Macau back to China in mid -- on December 20, just like the entire market. However, while it's a short period of time, we did notice that beginning on December 23 through January 10 in a somewhat normal operating environment, our business jumped right back to $4 million a day in EBITDA between the 2 properties on a normalized basis. 
Moving to Las Vegas, we made $80 million in EBITDA, with a $20 million negative hold impact during the quarter. On a full year, just to put it in perspective, in 2019, our baccarat volumes were down roughly 30% in 2019 compared to all of 2018, and that contributed to more than a $50 million decline in EBITDA year-over-year. 
Our domestic business continues to be up in the casino and in non-gaming. RevPAR was up over 3%, in the fourth quarter, and our retail revenues were up double digits. 
We're excited about 2020 in Las Vegas. We have a 430,000 square foot convention center that's opening in weeks to great fanfare. We have 3 new restaurants that will be more social dining focused and high energy that will be opening throughout 2020, and we'll begin the remodel of Wynn Las Vegas, the 2,700 rooms here in the summer of this year and completing before the end of 2020. So we have a lot going on in Las Vegas, and we feel really good about all of the segments of our business as we continue to monitor the Far East segment as it relates to Las Vegas. 
Looking at Encore Boston Harbor. We doubled our EBITDA from the third quarter to the fourth quarter to $15 million. Our Table Games business remains healthy. We opened -- and Table Games is healthy, and it continues to grow and to be quite strong, actually. And all the programs that we're putting in place for our slot win, we launched the Wynn rewards program, which is a first for us in North America, which is a tiered card program, we're starting to see those things work in at Encore Boston Harbor. In fact, our win per unit on the slot was up a little over 14% compared to the third quarter, and we're continuing to see incremental growth on the slot floor. 
In 2020, we're focused on continuing to match our food and beverage concepts with our customers. So destination dining for the overnight visitors as we're ramping our hotel business there and providing more quick-serve options for the daily visitors. So we feel good about the progress that we're making at Encore Boston Harbor as we continue to ramp that property throughout 2020. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Craig."

As noted in our release, our Macau operations delivered adjusted EBITDA of $347.7 million on $1.1 billion of operating revenues.

As noted in our release, our Macau operations delivered adjusted EBITDA of $347.7 million on $1.1 billion of operating revenues. The quarter was characterized by strength in mass with combined property win in the mass segment, up 6% year-over-year. 
Our results in Macau were positively impacted by higher than normal direct VIP hold percentage, which increased EBITDA by approximately $17.5 million from a normalized level with the hold impact weighted more heavily to Wynn Macau at approximately $12.5 million. 
The team in Macau has done a great job of controlling costs at both properties. At Wynn Palace, our operating expenses, excluding taxes, were down both year-over-year and sequentially, which drove a 40 basis point increase in normalized EBITDA margin compared to Q3 despite the top line pressure experienced market wide. 
At Wynn Macau, OpEx was flat year-over-year and sequentially, despite incremental payroll expense incurred to staff up the Lakeside Casino. We are well prepared to drive strong operating leverage when the market returns to normal. 
Our Las Vegas operations produced adjusted EBITDA of $80.1 million in the third quarter on operating revenue of $368.8 million. Our results were negatively impacted by lower table games hold in both baccarat and domestic tables, costing us about $20 million of EBITDA, as Matt mentioned. While baccarat was soft year-over-year on a tough comp, we saw 4% growth in non-baccarat table drop and slot handle. 
On the hotel side, RevPAR increased approximately 3% year-over-year to $288, driving $120.3 million of hotel revenue. Bad debt expense in Las Vegas was $4.1 million compared to $1 million in the prior year quarter, costing us $3 million in comparable EBITDA. The team in Las Vegas also did an excellent job controlling costs in the face of upward pressure on payroll, with operating expenses, excluding tax and bad debt, down slightly year-over-year. 
We spent approximately $49 million in project costs in the group space at Wynn Las Vegas in Q4 '19, taking our spend to date to roughly $351 million. Construction is now complete and the expansion is slated to open in a few weeks. 
Encore Boston Harbor produced $15.3 million in EBITDA on a $169.3 million in operating revenue. Table Games hold was in the normal range. As Matt mentioned, we have a number of initiatives in play in Boston designed to drive revenue growth, and we expect those initiatives will bear fruit over the course of 2020. 
We have also carefully managed our expense base there and operating expenses, excluding gaming tax in Boston were down approximately 11% quarter-over-quarter. We anticipate making additional investments in the property throughout the year, particularly in food and beverage. But we are not yet ready to quantify the budget for those initiatives, we expect they will be relatively modest. 
Turning to the balance sheet. During the quarter, we successfully completed a $1 billion 10-year senior notes offering in Macau with strong support from Asia-based long-term investors. We intend to use the proceeds from the notes offering to repay a portion of our term loans in Macau. As a result, this will reduce our senior secured debt and related leverage ratio, while extending our maturity profile at an attractive rate. 
We ended the quarter with total debt of $10.4 billion, inclusive of the $1 billion of recently issued Macao bonds. We also had total cash and investments of $2.36 billion, including approximately $1.8 billion at Wynn Macau, and total company-wide revolver capacity of $1.25 billion. Our liquidity position, particularly in Macau is very strong. Finally, during the quarter, we returned over $100 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend payment. 
With that, we will now open up the call to Q&A. Operator?"

In terms of Macau, in general, I think the way we look at it is there's been so much investment in the region and all the new infrastructure that was just coming to fruition with the high-speed rail coming into Macau and the light rail launching, and it was really set up for a quite extraordinary 2020. We were quite excited about it. So I'm not -- I don't want to predict when operations will be back to normal. They will be eventually. We're not exactly sure when.

And the Macau facility does have a maintenance covenant that is sensitive to Macau EBITDA. And as I suspect, several concessionaires do, we've already have a game plan in place to manage that to the extent that the shutdown is extended, but it would have to be quite extended. And as you rightly pointed out, we have a ton of liquidity. We have a couple of billion dollars of availability between cash and revolver in Macau, and that's more than sufficient to last for really any period of closure. Ian, did you -- would you kind of comment on the OpEx controls?"

You don't do something short-term that will hurt the culture or cause any distraction. So we're investing in the community right now. Because we know this will be temporary, and we think that it's the right long-term investment. 
For Encore Boston Harbor. When we laid out the program when we opened to Analyst Day, we talked about a 2-year ramp period. Admittedly, it has launched softer than we thought, in particular on the slot side. And so we're doing a lot of work. What we realized was we didn't have quite the right food and beverage program, in particular, around quick serve for the daytime slot customer. It's actually the same thing that we went through at Wynn Palace. And when we opened, we realized we needed more quick-serve restaurants in Wynn Palace. We immediately closed 1/3 of the casino. We built Red 8. We've built 5 new restaurants in the meantime. And so we're going through that process in a very fast way at Encore Boston Harbor. Because when we see a problem, we fix it. So I think we're still in that 2-year ramp-up mode."

And welcome, everyone, to our fourth quarter conference call today. To kick it off, I'd like to start in Macau.

And welcome, everyone, to our fourth quarter conference call today. To kick it off, I'd like to start in Macau. So we are currently focused almost solely on the health and safety of our employees, our customers and the Macau community at large right now in Macau. 
I'd like to commend the government of Macau and China, in fact, for the quick and decisive action that they take and continue to take to contain the coronavirus. We're in daily conversations with the government, has been extremely transparent and we -- they have been terrific partners with us as we focus on the safety of everyone in Macau. 
In fact, on February 5 at midnight, we worked closely with the government of Macau and all of the operators in Macau to cease our casino operations at midnight on February 5. It was a controlled and organized closure of the casino. We do still have our hotel and a couple of restaurants opened for the few remaining guests that are in Macau. But during this time, while the casino is closed, our operating expense burn rate is roughly $2.4 million to $2.6 million a day, and that's largely comprised of payroll to our 12,200 employees. 
Looking back at the fourth quarter, we generated $347.7 million of EBITDA. And like the past quarters, we experienced quick growth in core mass, coupled with compression in the VIP segment. As we reported on the third quarter, October was actually quite strong, generating EBITDA of a little over $4 million a day. But we began to see deceleration, leading up to the 20th year celebration handover of Macau back to China in mid -- on December 20, just like the entire market. However, while it's a short period of time, we did notice that beginning on December 23 through January 10 in a somewhat normal operating environment, our business jumped right back to $4 million a day in EBITDA between the 2 properties on a normalized basis. 
Moving to Las Vegas, we made $80 million in EBITDA, with a $20 million negative hold impact during the quarter. On a full year, just to put it in perspective, in 2019, our baccarat volumes were down roughly 30% in 2019 compared to all of 2018, and that contributed to more than a $50 million decline in EBITDA year-over-year. 
Our domestic business continues to be up in the casino and in non-gaming. RevPAR was up over 3%, in the fourth quarter, and our retail revenues were up double digits. 
We're excited about 2020 in Las Vegas. We have a 430,000 square foot convention center that's opening in weeks to great fanfare. We have 3 new restaurants that will be more social dining focused and high energy that will be opening throughout 2020, and we'll begin the remodel of Wynn Las Vegas, the 2,700 rooms here in the summer of this year and completing before the end of 2020. So we have a lot going on in Las Vegas, and we feel really good about all of the segments of our business as we continue to monitor the Far East segment as it relates to Las Vegas. 
Looking at Encore Boston Harbor. We doubled our EBITDA from the third quarter to the fourth quarter to $15 million. Our Table Games business remains healthy. We opened -- and Table Games is healthy, and it continues to grow and to be quite strong, actually. And all the programs that we're putting in place for our slot win, we launched the Wynn rewards program, which is a first for us in North America, which is a tiered card program, we're starting to see those things work in at Encore Boston Harbor. In fact, our win per unit on the slot was up a little over 14% compared to the third quarter, and we're continuing to see incremental growth on the slot floor. 
In 2020, we're focused on continuing to match our food and beverage concepts with our customers. So destination dining for the overnight visitors as we're ramping our hotel business there and providing more quick-serve options for the daily visitors. So we feel good about the progress that we're making at Encore Boston Harbor as we continue to ramp that property throughout 2020. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Craig."

As noted in our release, our Macau operations delivered adjusted EBITDA of $347.7 million on $1.1 billion of operating revenues. The quarter was characterized by strength in mass with combined property win in the mass segment, up 6% year-",614,"Thank you, Matt. As noted in our release, our Macau operations delivered adjusted EBITDA of $347.7 million on $1.1 billion of operating revenues. The quarter was characterized by strength in mass with combined property win in the mass segment, up 6% year-over-year. 
Our results in Macau were positively impacted by higher than normal direct VIP hold percentage, which increased EBITDA by approximately $17.5 million from a normalized level with the hold impact weighted more heavily to Wynn Macau at approximately $12.5 million. 
The team in Macau has done a great job of controlling costs at both properties. At Wynn Palace, our operating expenses, excluding taxes, were down both year-over-year and sequentially, which drove a 40 basis point increase in normalized EBITDA margin compared to Q3 despite the top line pressure experienced market wide. 
At Wynn Macau, OpEx was flat year-over-year and sequentially, despite incremental payroll expense incurred to staff up the Lakeside Casino. We are well prepared to drive strong operating leverage when the market returns to normal. 
Our Las Vegas operations produced adjusted EBITDA of $80.1 million in the third quarter on operating revenue of $368.8 million. Our results were negatively impacted by lower table games hold in both baccarat and domestic tables, costing us about $20 million of EBITDA, as Matt mentioned. While baccarat was soft year-over-year on a tough comp, we saw 4% growth in non-baccarat table drop and slot handle. 
On the hotel side, RevPAR increased approximately 3% year-over-year to $288, driving $120.3 million of hotel revenue. Bad debt expense in Las Vegas was $4.1 million compared to $1 million in the prior year quarter, costing us $3 million in comparable EBITDA. The team in Las Vegas also did an excellent job controlling costs in the face of upward pressure on payroll, with operating expenses, excluding tax and bad debt, down slightly year-over-year. 
We spent approximately $49 million in project costs in the group space at Wynn Las Vegas in Q4 '19, taking our spend to date to roughly $351 million. Construction is now complete and the expansion is slated to open in a few weeks. 
Encore Boston Harbor produced $15.3 million in EBITDA on a $169.3 million in operating revenue. Table Games hold was in the normal range. As Matt mentioned, we have a number of initiatives in play in Boston designed to drive revenue growth, and we expect those initiatives will bear fruit over the course of 2020. 
We have also carefully managed our expense base there and operating expenses, excluding gaming tax in Boston were down approximately 11% quarter-over-quarter. We anticipate making additional investments in the property throughout the year, particularly in food and beverage. But we are not yet ready to quantify the budget for those initiatives, we expect they will be relatively modest. 
Turning to the balance sheet. During the quarter, we successfully completed a $1 billion 10-year senior notes offering in Macau with strong support from Asia-based long-term investors. We intend to use the proceeds from the notes offering to repay a portion of our term loans in Macau. As a result, this will reduce our senior secured debt and related leverage ratio, while extending our maturity profile at an attractive rate. 
We ended the quarter with total debt of $10.4 billion, inclusive of the $1 billion of recently issued Macao bonds. We also had total cash and investments of $2.36 billion, including approximately $1.8 billion at Wynn Macau, and total company-wide revolver capacity of $1.25 billion. Our liquidity position, particularly in Macau is very strong. Finally, during the quarter, we returned over $100 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend payment. 
With that, we will now open up the call to Q&A. Operator?"

In terms of Macau, in general, I think the way we look at it is there's been so much investment in the region and all the new infrastructure that was just coming to fruition with the high-speed rail coming into Macau and the light rail launching, and it was really set up for a quite extraordinary 2020. We were quite excited about it. So I'm not -- I don't want to predict when operations will be back to normal. They will be eventually. We're not exactly sure when.

So we don't expect material business interruption coverage proceeds from the coronavirus event. 
To your question on covenants, the vast majority of our debt stack is comprised of long-dated unsecured bonds with no maintenance covenants. The 2 bank facilities do have maintenance covenants. The U.S. facility has more than ample covenant headroom to sustain a very prolonged period of suppressed business volumes in Macau. And the Macau facility does have a maintenance covenant that is sensitive to Macau EBITDA. And as I suspect, several concessionaires do, we've already have a game plan in place to manage that to the extent that the shutdown is extended, but it would have to be quite extended. And as you rightly pointed out, we have a ton of liquidity. We have a couple of billion dollars of availability between cash and revolver in Macau, and that's more than sufficient to last for really any period of closure.

You don't do something short-term that will hurt the culture or cause any distraction. So we're investing in the community right now. Because we know this will be temporary, and we think that it's the right long-term investment. 
For Encore Boston Harbor, when we laid out the program when we opened to Analyst Day, we talked about a 2-year ramp period. Admittedly, it has launched softer than we thought, in particular on the slot side. And so we're doing a lot of work. What we realized was we didn't have quite the right food and beverage program, in particular, around quick serve for the daytime slot customer. It's actually the same thing that we went through at Wynn Palace. And when we opened, we realized we needed more quick-serve restaurants in Wynn Palace. We immediately closed 1/3 of the casino. We built Red 8. We've built 5 new restaurants in the meantime. And so we're going through that process in a very fast way at Encore Boston Harbor. Because when we see a problem, we fix it. So I think we're still in that 2-year ramp-up mode."

And welcome, everyone, to our fourth quarter conference call today. To kick it off, I'd like to start in Macau. So we are currently focused almost solely on the health and safety of our employees, our customers and the Macau community at large right now in Macau. 
I'd like to commend the government of Macau and China, in fact, for the quick and decisive action that they take and continue to take to contain the coronavirus. We're in daily conversations with the government, has been extremely transparent and we -- they have been terrific partners with us as we focus on the safety of everyone in Macau. 
In fact, on February 5 at midnight, we worked closely with the government of Macau and all of the operators in Macau to cease our casino operations at midnight on February 5. It was a controlled and organized closure of the casino. We do still have our hotel and a couple of restaurants opened for the few remaining guests that are in Macau. But during this time, while the casino is closed, our operating expense burn rate is roughly $2.4 million to $2.6 million a day, and that's largely comprised of payroll to our 12,200 employees. 
Looking back at the fourth quarter, we generated $347.7 million of EBITDA. And like the past quarters, we experienced quick growth in core mass coupled with compression in the VIP segment. As we reported on the third quarter, October was actually quite strong, generating EBITDA of a little over $4 million a day. But we began to see deceleration, leading up to the 20th year celebration handover of Macau back to China in mid -- on December 20, just like the entire market. However, while it's a short period of time, we did notice that beginning on December 23 through January 10 in a somewhat normal operating environment, our business jumped right back to $4 million a day in EBITDA between the 2 properties on a normalized basis. 
Moving to Las Vegas, we made $80 million in EBITDA, with a $20 million negative hold impact during the quarter. On a full year, just to put it in perspective, in 2019, our baccarat volumes were down roughly 30% in 2019 compared to all of 2018, and that contributed to more than a $50 million decline in EBITDA year-over-year. 
Our domestic business continues to be up in the casino and in non-gaming. RevPAR was up over 3%, in the fourth quarter, and our retail revenues were up double digits. 
We're excited about 2020 in Las Vegas. We have a 430,000 square foot convention center that's opening in weeks to great fanfare. We have 3 new restaurants that will be more social dining focused and high energy that will be opening throughout 2020 and we'll begin the remodel of Wynn Las Vegas, the 2,700 rooms here in the summer of this year and completing before the end of 2020. So we have a lot going on in Las Vegas, and we feel really good about all of the segments of our business as we continue to monitor the Far East segment as it relates to Las Vegas. 
Looking at Encore Boston Harbor. We doubled our EBITDA from the third quarter to the fourth quarter to $15 million. Our Table Games business remains healthy. We opened -- and Table Games is healthy, and it continues to grow and to be quite strong, actually. And all the programs that we're putting in place for our slot win, we launched the Wynn rewards program, which is a first for us in North America, which is a tiered card program, we're starting to see those things work in at Encore Boston Harbor. In fact, our win per unit on the slot was up a little over 14% compared to the third quarter, and we're continuing to see incremental growth on the slot floor. 
In 2020, we're focused on continuing to match our food and beverage concepts with our customers. So destination dining for the overnight visitors as we're ramping our hotel business there and providing more quick-serve options for the daily visitors. So we feel good about the progress that we're making at Encore Boston Harbor as we continue to ramp that property throughout 2020. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Craig."

As noted in our release, our Macau operations delivered adjusted EBITDA of $347.7 million on $1.1 billion of operating revenues. The quarter was characterized by strength in mass with combined property win in the mass segment, up 6% year-",614,"Thank you, Matt. As noted in our release, our Macau operations delivered adjusted EBITDA of $347.7 million on $1.1 billion of operating revenues. The quarter was characterized by strength in mass with combined property win in the mass segment, up 6% year-over-year. 
Our results in Macau were positively impacted by higher than normal direct VIP hold percentage, which increased EBITDA by approximately $17.5 million from a normalized level with the hold impact weighted more heavily to Wynn Macau at approximately $12.5 million. 
The team in Macau has done a great job of controlling costs at both properties. At Wynn Palace, our operating expenses, excluding taxes, were down both year-over-year and sequentially, which drove a 40 basis point increase in normalized EBITDA margin compared to Q3 despite the top line pressure experienced market wide. 
At Wynn Macau, OpEx was flat year-over-year and sequentially, despite incremental payroll expense incurred to staff up the Lakeside Casino. We are well prepared to drive strong operating leverage when the market returns to normal. 
Our Las Vegas operations produced adjusted EBITDA of $80.1 million in the third quarter on operating revenue of $368.8 million. Our results were negatively impacted by lower table games hold in both baccarat and domestic tables, costing us about $20 million of EBITDA, as Matt mentioned. While baccarat was soft year-over-year on a tough comp, we saw 4% growth in non-baccarat table drop and slot handle. 
On the hotel side, RevPAR increased approximately 3% year-over-year to $288, driving $120.3 million of hotel revenue. Bad debt expense in Las Vegas was $4.1 million compared to $1 million in the prior year quarter, costing us $3 million in comparable EBITDA. The team in Las Vegas also did an excellent job controlling costs in the face of upward pressure on payroll, with operating expenses, excluding tax and bad debt, down slightly year-over-year. 
We spent approximately $49 million in project costs in the group space at Wynn Las Vegas in Q4 '19, taking our spend to date to roughly $351 million. Construction is now complete and the expansion is slated to open in a few weeks. 
Encore Boston Harbor produced $15.3 million in EBITDA on a $169.3 million in operating revenue. Table Games hold was in the normal range. As Matt mentioned, we have a number of initiatives in play in Boston designed to drive revenue growth, and we expect those initiatives will bear fruit over the course of 2020. 
We have also carefully managed our expense base there and operating expenses, excluding gaming tax in Boston were down approximately 11% quarter-over-quarter. We anticipate making additional investments in the property throughout the year, particularly in food and beverage. But we are not yet ready to quantify the budget for those initiatives, we expect they will be relatively modest. 
Turning to the balance sheet. During the quarter, we successfully completed a $1 billion 10-year senior notes offering in Macau with strong support from Asia-based long-term investors. We intend to use the proceeds from the notes offering to repay a portion of our term loans in Macau. As a result, this will reduce our senior secured debt and related leverage ratio, while extending our maturity profile at an attractive rate. 
We ended the quarter with total debt of $10.4 billion, inclusive of the $1 billion of recently issued Macao bonds. We also had total cash and investments of $2.36 billion, including approximately $1.8 billion at Wynn Macau, and total company-wide revolver capacity of $1.25 billion. Our liquidity position, particularly in Macau is very strong. Finally, during the quarter, we returned over $100 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend payment. 
With that, we will now open up the call to Q&A. Operator?"

In terms of Macau, in general, I think the way we look at it is there's been so much investment in the region and all the new infrastructure that was just coming to fruition with the high-speed rail coming into Macau and the light rail launching, and it was really set up for a quite extraordinary 2020. We were quite excited about it. So I'm not -- I don't want to predict when operations will be back to normal. They will be eventually. We're not exactly sure when.

To your question on covenants, the vast majority of our debt stack is comprised of long-dated unsecured bonds with no maintenance covenants. The 2 bank facilities do have maintenance covenants. The U.S. facility has more than ample covenant headroom to sustain a very prolonged period of suppressed business volumes in Macau. And the Macau facility does have a maintenance covenant that is sensitive to Macau EBITDA. And as I suspect, several concessionaires do, we've already have a game plan in place to manage that to the extent that the shutdown is extended, but it would have to be quite extended. And as you rightly pointed out, we have a ton of liquidity. We have a couple of billion dollars of availability between cash and revolver in Macau, and that's more than sufficient to last for really any period of closure.

You don't do something short-term that will hurt the culture or cause any distraction. So we're investing in the community right now. Because we know this will be temporary, and we think that it's the right long-term investment. 
For Encore Boston Harbor, when we laid out the program when we opened to Analyst Day, we talked about a 2-year ramp period. Admittedly, it has launched softer than we thought, in particular on the slot side. And so we're doing a lot of work. What we realized was we didn't have quite the right food and beverage program, in particular, around quick serve for the daytime slot customer. It's actually the same thing that we went through at Wynn Palace. And when we opened, we realized we needed more quick-serve restaurants in Wynn Palace. We immediately closed 1/3 of the casino. We built Red 8. We've built 5 new restaurants in the meantime. And so we're going through that process in a very fast way at Encore Boston Harbor. Because when we see a problem, we fix it. So I think we're still in that 2-year ramp-up mode."

I hope that you are all safe and healthy, likely working from home right now. Instead of just jumping right into our first quarter results. What I'd like to do I spend some time talking about how we've handled this pandemic in the way that we've been thinking about it. So well before we closed our facilities in North America because of our Macau experience, I reached out to one of the leading experts in -- really in the world in terms of pandemic research and global health security. It's the Director for Global Health security from Georgetown University. And engaged that team months ago and spent daily conversations with that team, trying to understand situation and what was going on and how best we could protect our customers and our employees and provide information to our medical communities and to our state and local government. We actually, because of that led the industry, both in Massachusetts and in Nevada in closing our casinos. We suggested to the Massachusetts Gaming Commission in mid-March that it was time for us to close. Based on the data and based on the science and the potential community spread that we were seeing. And we actually closed our resorts in Las Vegas in advance of the state decoration to close. And we were the first that led that. And we did it because at that time, it was the right thing to do. And we knew that we needed to be early and to make that move. We also knew, during that time, they asking our 30,000 employees, team members, 15,000 of them in North America and 15,000 in Macau. That a pandemic is upon us, that we're closing our resorts, we felt that we should invest in our culture right now because it's taken years and years and years to build the best team in the industry. And so we chose and I chose to pay all of our people since we closed through the end of May. 
We are one of the outliers in our industry or in hospitality in general that have done that. But I believe that investing in culture right now and making sure that your team members feel safe during these times is a corporate responsibility, and I also believe it's a great investment. I'm not sure how long this will last, and I'm not sure how much longer we can continue this practice it currently to May 31. But what I know is when we do reopen, in whatever state that is in Las Vegas and in Massachusetts that I want our team members to have smiles on their face. It will be underneath the mask, but it will still radiate through because we're in the business of making people happy. And only if our customers -- and our customers will only be happy if our employees felt like they were part of the family. So that's been my focus is to really make sure that we're doing this as a family and to think about the future because you can quickly disrupt a culture that takes years and years to build. It also allowed us, I think, to be -- to act quite fast in the way that we're thinking about a reopening because of the resources we had in. As an example, I believe we were one of the first companies in the nation, not just in our industry, but in the nation, to produce a detailed reopening plan. 
We published it for the world to see on April 19. It's a 23-page plan that goes department by department, area by area, space by space in terms of how we're going to keep our employees safe and our customers safe. It's actually become known as the Win plan and I've had sports teams call to walk through it, airlines call and walk through it. Retail, large landlords calling up through it, developers, dozens of CEOs to look at the wind plan and to think about it and apply it to their own business. And we did that because we want to help lead the conversation to a reopening of our economy, but in a phased approach and in a safe approach and focused on the data. We've been working with our experts and state and local officials on benchmarks to track that should be public and transparent. We've crafted with our medical community here in Nevada, benchmarks based on disease growth, which is a case growth coupled with hospitalizations and death. And the disease growth needs to be a certain level before you consider reopening. We have set benchmarks for ICU capacity with our medical community as well as ventilator capacity that you need the ability to achieve a 2x surge in COVID patients in your ICU without needing crisis care to begin a phased approach to opening as well as test positivity rate. So -- which really measures the amount of tests that are being conducted in an area. Those benchmarks have been widely distributed. They're going to be quite public. And it's really a great way that our medical community is looking at this to think about phased openings of the economy. 
In Nevada, our governor has launched a -- the concept of a phased opening. The Phase 1 should begin in the next week or so, sometime around mid-May. And then based on the benchmarks and the data, I believe we'll continue to see in Phase 2 openings of additional businesses and potentially opening of our business in late May. But again, that is assuming that we stay in line with the benchmarks and that the environment is safe for customers and for all of our employees. 
In Massachusetts, they have formed a task force at the state level, and I want to commend both Governor Sissac and Governor Baker for early fast action and for their tireless work on this effort. 
Massachusetts is also, I believe, will be coming out with a phased approach to opening. They have clearly had a much more difficult time than Nevada has given the high amount of cases and deaths there. But their medical community has handled it really as good as has been handled around the globe and should be commended. 
On the testing front, we think a lot about this. And in fact, we, in Las Vegas, has signed a partnership with the University Medical Center, the research hospital in Las Vegas, whereby any of our employees can get tested for COVID-19. In fact, we have on-site testing tomorrow, set up in an 85,000 square foot ballroom with 25 nurses from UMC, all appropriately spaced out, and we believe that we'll have over the next couple of days, thousands of employees that will have been tested. These are the types of things that we're doing now and early into an eventual lead up to opening our properties. 
In Macau, we've been -- we've remained open in Macau after the closure in the first 2 weeks of February, however as all of you on this phone know there the Macau volumes have really not been there because there's a 14-day quarantine of going in and out of Macau from Hong Kong or Mainland China. One of some encouraging things that we have seen in Macau is, first, there hasn't been a new COVID case in Macau in weeks. Second, in Mainland China and Macau and Hong Kong, teachers and students are back-to-school as of last week. There's continued to be progress in the Macau government has publicly talked about it. In the health check system, which in China, as I'm sure a lot of you are aware, on your mobile phone, you have a red, yellow or green system that gives access to various areas. And Macau has been working very closely with Guangdong to make sure that those health checks are in line. All of those seem to be in our progress. So we would anticipate that, as everyone else is, that progress will continue in terms of reopening the borders in a cautious way, resuming tourism in a cautious way. And the amount of progress that's been made over there has been extraordinary. Just looking at the results, high level, before our closure in Las Vegas, RevPAR was up 8%. In Massachusetts, we were on our way to record EBITDA and win per unit per day before closure was up on the slot floor, about 13%. 
In Macau, as we laid out for all of you on the first quarter call, during the closure, we were roughly between $2.2 million and $2.6 million a day of burn. And what we saw from February 20 to roughly March 20 after we reopened, was a gradual increase in gaming volumes, and particularly led by VIP and Premium segment to the point where our burn went in a matter of 3 weeks, from $2.5 million a day to $800,000 a day. And we were back to roughly 25% of our volumes in the fourth quarter. So we're continuing to be optimistic about what's going to happen in Macau as the cautious reopening of the border continues. We're focused on our 3 pillars that we talk about on these calls, which in Macau and in North America. In Macau, particularly, it's investing in our people, which we're doing. Investing in our communities, which includes the Greater Bay area and really helping to position win to be beneficial in the Greater Bay area and working on investments throughout the region and investing in our assets. 
So during these times, we have continued extensive design development work design work on our Crystal Pavilion project in Macau, and we remain very excited about it. So that's really where we are right now. We -- I believe we're going to continue to lead in our industry in Las Vegas and in Massachusetts. We're working very carefully and closely on a daily basis with state and local officials and the gaming regulatory bodies. And I believe that the data will be transparent as to opening dates based on benchmarks, and we'll be ready to begin in the new normal atmosphere. 
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Craig to talk about some of our financial results."

This quarter, I'll focus my remarks on the company's current liquidity position and our expected cash burn rate. At the onset of the outbreak of the virus in both Asia and the U.S., we took immediate and decisive action to bolster our global liquidity position, maximize our financial flexibility and preserve cash. On April 30, our global cash and liquidity position was nearly $3.4 billion, providing the company with significant runway to weather the impact of the pandemic on our business. In Macau, where we drew down our revolving credit facility in February, we had approximately $1.8 billion of available liquidity as of April 30. And in the U.S., we had total available liquidity of approximately $1.6 billion at the end of April. Our already strong domestic liquidity position was recently bolstered by the issuance of $600 million of unsecured notes in April. In fact, the transaction was upsized from $350 million and was approximately 8x oversubscribed. We were pleased to be the first company in our industry to issue unsecured notes since the onset of the pandemic, once again highlighting the strength of our brands and our business. We also obtained a covenant waiver for our U.S. credit facility, further increasing our financial flexibility. We are well positioned to bridge the current period of uncertainty and to thrive operationally and strategically during the recovery period. 
Turning to our cash burn rate. Upon the closure of casino operations in Macau in February as Matt just alluded to, we announced an expected daily OpEx burn rate in Macau of $2.5 million. As he also mentioned, upon reopening in late February, our normalized EBITDA burn rate improved to approximately $800,000 per day in March. And with the subsequent implementation of additional public health measures, quarantines and border closures, this rate in April was approximately $2 million per day. Reflective of limited business volumes. Until the reimplementation of visas schemes and full reopening of transit to Hong Kong, we expect a daily burn rate in the $2 million to $2.5 million range in Macau, excluding interest and CapEx. 
In the U.S., we have currently committed to pay all our team members, their full wages and benefits. Under this approach, our daily OpEx burn rate in the U.S. is approximately $3.6 million, inclusive of corporate expense. Globally, cash interest expense and our scale down CapEx program combined are approximately $1.7 million per day, and thus, our current global worst-case all-in daily cash burn rate, is approximately $7.8 million per day, meaning we have sufficient liquidity runway in a worst case, no revenue full pay environment until at least the third quarter of 2021. But we will, of course, continue to actively assess our cash OpEx usage and liquidity position as the situation evolves, and we'll make adjustments as required based on the facts on the ground, including likely reopening dates. 
On the CapEx front, we have postponed the Wynn Las Vegas room remodel, which was slated to begin in June conserving approximately 
[Audio Gap] 
with our global normal course maintenance capital spend over the coming quarters, only proceeding with our highest priority projects. Our preconstruction planning work on the Crystal Pavilion at Wynn Palace continues with our in-house development team, as Matt mentioned. 
And in order to further solidify the company's financial position, our Board, along with senior management, have decided to temporarily suspend the company's quarterly dividend, preserving over $100 million of liquidity per quarter. We look forward to resuming the dividend when business conditions permit. 
Lastly, I'll quickly note that our reported EBITDA for our U.S. properties in the first quarter was negatively impacted by a $75.7 million accrual associated with our commitment to pay our domestic team members full wages and benefits after quarter end from April 1 through May 15. $56.4 million of this accrual was from in Las Vegas and $19.3 million was for Boston. 
With that, we will now open up the call to Q&A."

So at Wynn, we're not looking for 100,000 people a day to be going through our properties. That's never been our business. We've always been focused on the premium end.

The biggest wealthiest province in China, 114 million people, of the 49 IVS cities in China, 21 of them are in Guangdong. It looks like our borders will be opening up over the next couple of months.

If you look at what's happening on the beaches in Southern California, we're going to have a very safe environment, but we will have an environment that I think a lot of people want to to come and participate in.

In Las Vegas, like I said, we're going to have the ability working with UMC when we open it when. Any employee, any customer that wants the swap test, you can get it, we have on site. Anybody -- we have 3 various antibody tests that are going through EUA approval right now and 1 that already has it, that we're working on. That will also be available.

And they've already altered the border open closure hours back to where they were previously. So there's a lot of things happening. One of the great outcomes of this is the dialogue between Guangdong and Macau at a government departmental level. This augurs really well for the future. When you look at Hensen Island and how that opens up to Macau and how we become a bigger part of the Greater Bay area. So we appreciate the sequencing, the measured approach and the safety first approach, but it's happening and it's imminent."

I hope that you are all safe and healthy, likely working from home right now. Instead of just jumping right into our first quarter results. What I'd like to do is spend some time talking about how we've handled this pandemic in the way that we've been thinking about it. So well before we closed our facilities in North America because of our Macau experience, I reached out to one of the leading experts in -- really in the world in terms of pandemic research and global health security. It's the Director for Global Health Security from Georgetown University. And engaged that team months ago and spent daily conversations with that team, trying to understand the situation and what was going on and how best we could protect our customers and our employees and provide information to our medical communities and to our state and local government. We actually -- because of that led the industry, both in Massachusetts and in Nevada in closing our casinos. We suggested to the Massachusetts Gaming Commission in mid-March that it was time for us to close. Based on the data and based on the science and the potential community spread that we were seeing. And we actually closed our resorts in Las Vegas in advance of the state declaration to close. And we were the first that led that. And we did it because at that time it was the right thing to do. And we knew that we needed to be early and to make that move. We also knew, during that time, they -- asking our 30,000 employees, team members, 15,000 of them in North America and 15,000 in Macau, that a pandemic is upon us, that we're closing our resorts. We felt that we should invest in our culture right now because it's taken years and years and years to build the best team in the industry. And so we chose and I chose to pay all of our people since we closed through the end of May.  
We are one of the outliers in our industry or in hospitality in general that have done that. But I believe that investing in culture right now and making sure that your team members feel safe during these times is a corporate responsibility, and I also believe it's a great investment. I'm not sure how long this will last, and I'm not sure how much longer we can continue this practice. It's currently till May 31. But what I know is when we do reopen, in whatever state that is in Las Vegas and in Massachusetts that I want our team members to have smiles on their face. It will be underneath the mask, but it'll still radiate through because we're in the business of making people happy. And only if our customers -- and our customers will only be happy if our employees felt like they were part of a family. So that's been my focus is to really make sure that we're doing this as a family and to think about the future because you can quickly disrupt a culture that takes years and years to build. It also allowed us, I think, to be -- to act quite fast in the way that we're thinking about a reopening because of the resources we had at hand. As an example, I believe we were one of the first companies in the nation, not just in our industry, but in the nation, to produce a detailed reopening plan.  
We published it for the world to see on April 19. It's a 23-page plan that goes department by department, area by area, space by space in terms of how we're going to keep our employees safe and our customers safe. It's actually become known as the Wynn plan. And I've had sports teams call to walk through it; airlines call and walk through it; retail, large; landlords calling up through it; developers; dozens of CEOs to look at the Wynn plan and to think about it and apply it to their own business. And we did that because we want to help lead the conversation to a reopening of our economy, but in a phased approach and in a safe approach and focused on the data. 
We've been working with our experts and state and local officials on benchmarks to track that should be public and transparent. We've crafted, with our medical community here in Nevada, benchmarks based on disease growth, which is a case growth coupled with hospitalizations and deaths. And the disease growth needs to be at a certain level before you consider reopening. We have set benchmarks for ICU capacity with our medical community as well as ventilator capacity that you need the ability to achieve a 2x surge in COVID patients in your ICU without needing crisis care to begin a phased approach to opening as well as test positivity rate. So -- which really measures the amount of tests that are being conducted in an area. Those benchmarks have been widely distributed. They're going to be quite public. And it's really a great way that our medical community is looking at this to think about phased openings of the economy.  
In Nevada, our governor has launched a -- the concept of a phased opening. The Phase 1 should begin in the next week or so, sometime around mid-May. And then based on the benchmarks and the data, I believe we'll continue to see, in Phase 2, openings of additional businesses and potentially opening of our business in late May. But again, that is assuming that we stay in line with the benchmarks and that the environment is safe for customers and for all of our employees.  
In Massachusetts, they have formed a task force at the state level, and I want to commend both Governor Sisolak and Governor Baker for early, fast action and for their tireless work on this effort.  
Massachusetts is also, I believe, will be coming out with a phased approach to opening. They have clearly had a much more difficult time than Nevada has given the high amount of cases and deaths there. But their medical community has handled it really as good as has been handled around the globe and should be commended.  
On the testing front, we think a lot about this. And in fact, we in -- Las Vegas, has signed a partnership with the University Medical Center, the research hospital in Las Vegas, whereby any of our employees can get tested for COVID-19. In fact, we have on-site testing tomorrow, set up in an 85,000 square foot ballroom with 25 nurses from UMC, all appropriately spaced out, and we believe that we'll have, over the next couple of days, thousands of employees that will have been tested. These are the types of things that we're doing now and early into an eventual lead up to opening our properties.  
In Macau, we've been -- we've remained open in Macau after the closure in the first 2 weeks of February. However, as all of you on this phone know there -- the Macau volumes have really not been there because there's a 14-day quarantine of going in and out of Macau from Hong Kong or Mainland China. One of -- some encouraging things that we have seen in Macau is: first, there hasn't been a new COVID case in Macau in weeks; second, in Mainland China and Macau and Hong Kong, teachers and students are back to school as of last week. There's continued to be progress in -- the Macau government has publicly talked about it, in the health check system, which in China, as I'm sure a lot of you are aware, on your mobile phone, you have a red, yellow or green system that gives access to various areas. And Macau has been working very closely with Guangdong to make sure that those health checks are in line. All of those seem to be in our progress. So we would anticipate that, as everyone else is, that progress will continue in terms of reopening the borders in a cautious way, resuming tourism in a cautious way. And the amount of progress that's been made over there has been extraordinary. Just looking at the results, high level, before our closure in Las Vegas, RevPAR was up 8%. In Massachusetts, we were on our way to record EBITDA and win per unit per day before closure was up on the slot floor, about 13%.  
In Macau, as we laid out for all of you on the first quarter call, during the closure, we were roughly between $2.2 million and $2.6 million a day of burn. And what we saw from February 20 to roughly March 20 after we reopened, was a gradual increase in gaming volumes and particularly led by VIP and Premium segment to the point where our burn went, in a matter of 3 weeks, from $2.5 million a day to $800,000 a day. And we were back to roughly 25% of our volumes in the fourth quarter. So we're continuing to be optimistic about what's going to happen in Macau as the cautious reopening of the border continues. We're focused on our 3 pillars that we talk about on these calls, which in Macau and in North America, in Macau, particularly: it's investing in our people, which we're doing; investing in our communities, which includes the Greater Bay Area; and really helping to position win to be beneficial in the Greater Bay Area and working on investments throughout the region and investing in our assets. So during these times, we have continued extensive design development work -- design work on our Crystal Pavilion project in Macau, and we remain very excited about it. So that's really where we are right now. We -- I believe we're going to continue to lead in our industry in Las Vegas and in Massachusetts. We're working very carefully and closely on a daily basis with state and local officials and the gaming regulatory bodies. And I believe that the data will be transparent as to opening dates based on benchmarks, and we'll be ready to begin in the new normal atmosphere.  
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Craig to talk about some of our financial results."

This quarter, I'll focus my remarks on the company's current liquidity position and our expected cash burn rate. At the onset of the outbreak of the virus in both Asia and the U.S., we took immediate and decisive action to bolster our global liquidity position, maximize our financial flexibility and preserve cash. On April 30, our global cash and liquidity position was nearly $3.4 billion, providing the company with significant runway to weather the impact of the pandemic on our business. In Macau, where we drew down our revolving credit facility in February, we had approximately $1.8 billion of available liquidity as of April 30. And in the U.S., we had total available liquidity of approximately $1.6 billion at the end of April. Our already strong domestic liquidity position was recently bolstered by the issuance of $600 million of unsecured notes in April. In fact, the transaction was upsized from $350 million and was approximately 8x oversubscribed. We were pleased to be the first company in our industry to issue unsecured notes since the onset of the pandemic, once again highlighting the strength of our brands and our business. We also obtained a covenant waiver for our U.S. credit facility, further increasing our financial flexibility. We are well positioned to bridge the current period of uncertainty and to thrive operationally and strategically during the recovery period.  
Turning to our cash burn rate. Upon the closure of casino operations in Macau in February as Matt just alluded to, we announced an expected daily OpEx burn rate in Macau of $2.5 million. As he also mentioned, upon reopening in late February, our normalized EBITDA burn rate improved to approximately $800,000 per day in March. And with the subsequent implementation of additional public health measures, quarantines and border closures, this rate in April was approximately $2 million per day. Reflective of limited business volumes. Until the reimplementation of visa schemes and full reopening of transit to Hong Kong, we expect a daily burn rate in the $2 million to $2.5 million range in Macau, excluding interest and CapEx.  
In the U.S., we have currently committed to pay all our team members their full wages and benefits. Under this approach, our daily OpEx burn rate in the U.S. is approximately $3.6 million, inclusive of corporate expense. Globally, cash interest expense and our scale down CapEx program combined are approximately $1.7 million per day, and thus, our current global worst-case, all-in daily cash burn rate, is approximately $7.8 million per day, meaning we have sufficient liquidity runway in a worst case, no revenue full pay environment until at least the third quarter of 2021. But we will, of course, continue to actively assess our cash OpEx usage and liquidity position as the situation evolves, and we'll make adjustments as required based on the facts on the ground, including likely reopening dates.  
On the CapEx front, we have postponed the Wynn Las Vegas room remodel, which was slated to begin in June conserving approximately $170 million of cash and liquidity. We're fortunate to have the highest quality room product in Las Vegas, and we plan to revisit the project again as we plan for 2021. We will also be very judicious with our global normal course maintenance capital spending over the coming quarters, only proceeding with our highest priority projects. Our preconstruction planning work on the Crystal Pavilion at Wynn Palace continues with our in-house development team, as Matt mentioned.  
And in order to further solidify the company's financial position, our Board, along with senior management, have decided to temporarily suspend the company's quarterly dividend, preserving over $100 million of liquidity per quarter. We look forward to resuming the dividend when business conditions permit.  
Lastly, I'll quickly note that our reported EBITDA for our U.S. properties in the first quarter was negatively impacted by a $75.7 million accrual associated with our commitment to pay our domestic team members' full wages and benefits after quarter end from April 1 through May 15. $56.4 million of this accrual was for Wynn Las Vegas and $19.3 million was for Boston.  
With that, we will now open up the call to Q&A."

So at Wynn, we're not looking for 100,000 people a day to be going through our properties. That's never been our business. We've always been focused on the premium end.

We've got proximity to Guangdong, the biggest, wealthiest province in China, 114 million people, of the 49 IVS cities in China, 21 of them are in Guangdong. It looks like our borders will be opening up over the next couple of months. And I think everybody is anticipating us building business very nicely. There is pent-up demand in China. What we've seen over the May holiday is a lot of resort and luxury-driven travel, a lot of family-driven travel, which is very good for Cotai.

In Las Vegas, like I said, we're going to have the ability working with UMC when we open it wins. Any employee and any customer that wants the swab test, you can get it, we have on-site.

And now we really appreciate the fact that it's about safety first. They're phasing the lifting of restrictions. They've had a very progressive development over the last 2 weeks. The first stage was allowing teachers and students based in Zhuhai, who live in Zhuhai and come over to Macau to attend school and teachers, to work. And so they've gone through that process. That process involved introducing relative mass testing for the individuals, and that was very successfully done. We're now looking at Macau people that are working in Macau but actually living in Zhuhai. They're the next stage of the testing process. The merging and synchronizing of the 2 health colds for Guangdong and for Macau involved a lot of regional cooperation between government departments that -- they're deep in dialogue about that. The system is being set up and now they're trialing it. And they've already altered the border open and closure hours back to where they were previously. So there's a lot of things happening. One of the great outcomes of this is the dialogue between Guangdong and Macau at a government departmental level. This augurs really well for the future.

I hope that you are all safe and healthy, likely working from home right now. Instead of just jumping right into our first quarter results. What I'd like to do is spend some time talking about how we've handled this pandemic in the way that we've been thinking about it. So well before we closed our facilities in North America because of our Macau experience, I reached out to one of the leading experts in -- really in the world in terms of pandemic research and global health security. It's the Director for Global Health Security from Georgetown University. And engaged that team months ago and spent daily conversations with that team, trying to understand the situation and what was going on and how best we could protect our customers and our employees and provide information to our medical communities and to our state and local government. We actually -- because of that led the industry, both in Massachusetts and in Nevada in closing our casinos. We suggested to the Massachusetts Gaming Commission in mid-March that it was time for us to close. Based on the data and based on the science and the potential community spread that we were seeing. And we actually closed our resorts in Las Vegas in advance of the state declaration to close. And we were the first that led that. And we did it because at that time it was the right thing to do. And we knew that we needed to be early and to make that move. We also knew, during that time, they -- asking our 30,000 employees, team members, 15,000 of them in North America and 15,000 in Macau, that a pandemic is upon us, that we're closing our resorts. We felt that we should invest in our culture right now because it's taken years and years and years to build the best team in the industry. And so we chose and I chose to pay all of our people since we closed through the end of May.  
We are one of the outliers in our industry or in hospitality in general that have done that. But I believe that investing in culture right now and making sure that your team members feel safe during these times is a corporate responsibility, and I also believe it's a great investment. I'm not sure how long this will last, and I'm not sure how much longer we can continue this practice. It's currently till May 31. But what I know is when we do reopen, in whatever state that is in Las Vegas and in Massachusetts that I want our team members to have smiles on their face. It will be underneath the mask, but it'll still radiate through because we're in the business of making people happy. And only if our customers -- and our customers will only be happy if our employees felt like they were part of a family. So that's been my focus is to really make sure that we're doing this as a family and to think about the future because you can quickly disrupt a culture that takes years and years to build. It also allowed us, I think, to be -- to act quite fast in the way that we're thinking about a reopening because of the resources we had at hand. As an example, I believe we were one of the first companies in the nation, not just in our industry, but in the nation, to produce a detailed reopening plan.  
We published it for the world to see on April 19. It's a 23-page plan that goes department by department, area by area, space by space in terms of how we're going to keep our employees safe and our customers safe. It's actually become known as the Wynn plan. And I've had sports teams call to walk through it; airlines call and walk through it; retail, large; landlords calling up through it; developers; dozens of CEOs to look at the Wynn plan and to think about it and apply it to their own business. And we did that because we want to help lead the conversation to a reopening of our economy, but in a phased approach and in a safe approach and focused on the data. 
We've been working with our experts and state and local officials on benchmarks to track that should be public and transparent. We've crafted, with our medical community here in Nevada, benchmarks based on disease growth, which is a case growth coupled with hospitalizations and deaths. And the disease growth needs to be at a certain level before you consider reopening. We have set benchmarks for ICU capacity with our medical community as well as ventilator capacity that you need the ability to achieve a 2x surge in COVID patients in your ICU without needing crisis care to begin a phased approach to opening as well as test positivity rate. So -- which really measures the amount of tests that are being conducted in an area. Those benchmarks have been widely distributed. They're going to be quite public. And it's really a great way that our medical community is looking at this to think about phased openings of the economy.  
In Nevada, our governor has launched a -- the concept of a phased opening. The Phase 1 should begin in the next week or so, sometime around mid-May. And then based on the benchmarks and the data, I believe we'll continue to see, in Phase 2, openings of additional businesses and potentially opening of our business in late May. But again, that is assuming that we stay in line with the benchmarks and that the environment is safe for customers and for all of our employees.  
In Massachusetts, they have formed a task force at the state level, and I want to commend both Governor Sisolak and Governor Baker for early, fast action and for their tireless work on this effort.  
Massachusetts is also, I believe, will be coming out with a phased approach to opening. They have clearly had a much more difficult time than Nevada has given the high amount of cases and deaths there. But their medical community has handled it really as good as has been handled around the globe and should be commended.  
On the testing front, we think a lot about this. And in fact, we in -- Las Vegas, has signed a partnership with the University Medical Center, the research hospital in Las Vegas, whereby any of our employees can get tested for COVID-19. In fact, we have on-site testing tomorrow, set up in an 85,000 square foot ballroom with 25 nurses from UMC, all appropriately spaced out, and we believe that we'll have, over the next couple of days, thousands of employees that will have been tested. These are the types of things that we're doing now and early into an eventual lead up to opening our properties.  
In Macau, we've been -- we've remained open in Macau after the closure in the first 2 weeks of February. However, as all of you on this phone know there -- the Macau volumes have really not been there because there's a 14-day quarantine of going in and out of Macau from Hong Kong or Mainland China. One of -- some encouraging things that we have seen in Macau is: first, there hasn't been a new COVID case in Macau in weeks; second, in Mainland China and Macau and Hong Kong, teachers and students are back to school as of last week. There's continued to be progress in -- the Macau government has publicly talked about it, in the health check system, which in China, as I'm sure a lot of you are aware, on your mobile phone, you have a red, yellow or green system that gives access to various areas. And Macau has been working very closely with Guangdong to make sure that those health checks are in line. All of those seem to be in our progress. So we would anticipate that, as everyone else is, that progress will continue in terms of reopening the borders in a cautious way, resuming tourism in a cautious way. And the amount of progress that's been made over there has been extraordinary. Just looking at the results, high level, before our closure in Las Vegas, RevPAR was up 8%. In Massachusetts, we were on our way to record EBITDA and win per unit per day before closure was up on the slot floor, about 13%.  
In Macau, as we laid out for all of you on the first quarter call, during the closure, we were roughly between $2.2 million and $2.6 million a day of burn. And what we saw from February 20 to roughly March 20 after we reopened, was a gradual increase in gaming volumes and particularly led by VIP and Premium segment to the point where our burn went, in a matter of 3 weeks, from $2.5 million a day to $800,000 a day. And we were back to roughly 25% of our volumes in the fourth quarter. So we're continuing to be optimistic about what's going to happen in Macau as the cautious reopening of the border continues. We're focused on our 3 pillars that we talk about on these calls, which in Macau and in North America, in Macau, particularly: it's investing in our people, which we're doing; investing in our communities, which includes the Greater Bay Area; and really helping to position win to be beneficial in the Greater Bay Area and working on investments throughout the region and investing in our assets. So during these times, we have continued extensive design development work -- design work on our Crystal Pavilion project in Macau, and we remain very excited about it. So that's really where we are right now. We -- I believe we're going to continue to lead in our industry in Las Vegas and in Massachusetts. We're working very carefully and closely on a daily basis with state and local officials and the gaming regulatory bodies. And I believe that the data will be transparent as to opening dates based on benchmarks, and we'll be ready to begin in the new normal atmosphere.  
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Craig to talk about some of our financial results."

This quarter, I'll focus my remarks on the company's current liquidity position and our expected cash burn rate. At the onset of the outbreak of the virus in both Asia and the U.S., we took immediate and decisive action to bolster our global liquidity position, maximize our financial flexibility and preserve cash. On April 30, our global cash and liquidity position was nearly $3.4 billion, providing the company with significant runway to weather the impact of the pandemic on our business. In Macau, where we drew down our revolving credit facility in February, we had approximately $1.8 billion of available liquidity as of April 30. And in the U.S., we had total available liquidity of approximately $1.6 billion at the end of April. Our already strong domestic liquidity position was recently bolstered by the issuance of $600 million of unsecured notes in April. In fact, the transaction was upsized from $350 million and was approximately 8x oversubscribed. We were pleased to be the first company in our industry to issue unsecured notes since the onset of the pandemic, once again highlighting the strength of our brands and our business. We also obtained a covenant waiver for our U.S. credit facility, further increasing our financial flexibility. We are well positioned to bridge the current period of uncertainty and to thrive operationally and strategically during the recovery period.  
Turning to our cash burn rate. Upon the closure of casino operations in Macau in February as Matt just alluded to, we announced an expected daily OpEx burn rate in Macau of $2.5 million. As he also mentioned, upon reopening in late February, our normalized EBITDA burn rate improved to approximately $800,000 per day in March. And with the subsequent implementation of additional public health measures, quarantines and border closures, this rate in April was approximately $2 million per day. Reflective of limited business volumes. Until the reimplementation of visa schemes and full reopening of transit to Hong Kong, we expect a daily burn rate in the $2 million to $2.5 million range in Macau, excluding interest and CapEx.  
In the U.S., we have currently committed to pay all our team members their full wages and benefits. Under this approach, our daily OpEx burn rate in the U.S. is approximately $3.6 million, inclusive of corporate expense. Globally, cash interest expense and our scale down CapEx program combined are approximately $1.7 million per day, and thus, our current global worst-case, all-in daily cash burn rate, is approximately $7.8 million per day, meaning we have sufficient liquidity runway in a worst case, no revenue full pay environment until at least the third quarter of 2021. But we will, of course, continue to actively assess our cash OpEx usage and liquidity position as the situation evolves, and we'll make adjustments as required based on the facts on the ground, including likely reopening dates.  
On the CapEx front, we have postponed the Wynn Las Vegas room remodel, which was slated to begin in June conserving approximately $170 million of cash and liquidity. We're fortunate to have the highest quality room product in Las Vegas, and we plan to revisit the project again as we plan for 2021. We will also be very judicious with our global normal course maintenance capital spending over the coming quarters, only proceeding with our highest priority projects. Our preconstruction planning work on the Crystal Pavilion at Wynn Palace continues with our in-house development team, as Matt mentioned.  
And in order to further solidify the company's financial position, our Board, along with senior management, have decided to temporarily suspend the company's quarterly dividend, preserving over $100 million of liquidity per quarter. We look forward to resuming the dividend when business conditions permit.  
Lastly, I'll quickly note that our reported EBITDA for our U.S. properties in the first quarter was negatively impacted by a $75.7 million accrual associated with our commitment to pay our domestic team members' full wages and benefits after quarter end from April 1 through May 15. $56.4 million of this accrual was for Wynn Las Vegas and $19.3 million was for Boston.  
With that, we will now open up the call to Q&A."

So at Wynn, we're not looking for 100,000 people a day to be going through our properties. That's never been our business. We've always been focused on the premium end.

Something we talk about locally is the Macau advantage. We have proximity to China. We've got proximity to Guangdong, the biggest, wealthiest province in China, 114 million people, of the 49 IVS cities in China, 21 of them are in Guangdong. It looks like our borders will be opening up over the next couple of months. And I think everybody is anticipating us building business very nicely. There is pent-up demand in China. What we've seen over the May holiday is a lot of resort and luxury-driven travel, a lot of family-driven travel, which is very good for Cotai.

And so we're working through that. I think each day people's mentality changes depending on where they live and what they're experiencing.

In Las Vegas, like I said, we're going to have the ability working with UMC when we open it wins. Any employee and any customer that wants the swab test, you can get it, we have on-site.

And now we really appreciate the fact that it's about safety first. They're phasing the lifting of restrictions. They've had a very progressive development over the last 2 weeks. The first stage was allowing teachers and students based in Zhuhai, who live in Zhuhai and come over to Macau to attend school and teachers, to work. And so they've gone through that process. That process involved introducing relative mass testing for the individuals, and that was very successfully done. We're now looking at Macau people that are working in Macau but actually living in Zhuhai. They're the next stage of the testing process. The merging and synchronizing of the 2 health colds for Guangdong and for Macau involved a lot of regional cooperation between government departments that -- they're deep in dialogue about that. The system is being set up and now they're trialing it. And they've already altered the border open and closure hours back to where they were previously. So there's a lot of things happening.

I hope that you are all safe and healthy, likely working from home right now. Instead of just jumping right into our first quarter results. What I'd like to do is spend some time talking about how we've handled this pandemic in the way that we've been thinking about it. So well before we closed our facilities in North America because of our Macau experience, I reached out to one of the leading experts in -- really in the world in terms of pandemic research and global health security. It's the Director for Global Health Security from Georgetown University. And engaged that team months ago and spent daily conversations with that team, trying to understand the situation and what was going on and how best we could protect our customers and our employees and provide information to our medical communities and to our state and local government. We actually -- because of that led the industry, both in Massachusetts and in Nevada in closing our casinos. We suggested to the Massachusetts Gaming Commission in mid-March that it was time for us to close. Based on the data and based on the science and the potential community spread that we were seeing. And we actually closed our resorts in Las Vegas in advance of the state declaration to close. And we were the first that led that. And we did it because at that time it was the right thing to do. And we knew that we needed to be early and to make that move. We also knew, during that time, they -- asking our 30,000 employees, team members, 15,000 of them in North America and 15,000 in Macau, that a pandemic is upon us, that we're closing our resorts. We felt that we should invest in our culture right now because it's taken years and years and years to build the best team in the industry. And so we chose and I chose to pay all of our people since we closed through the end of May.  
We are one of the outliers in our industry or in hospitality in general that have done that. But I believe that investing in culture right now and making sure that your team members feel safe during these times is a corporate responsibility, and I also believe it's a great investment. I'm not sure how long this will last, and I'm not sure how much longer we can continue this practice. It's currently till May 31. But what I know is when we do reopen, in whatever state that is in Las Vegas and in Massachusetts that I want our team members to have smiles on their face. It will be underneath the mask, but it'll still radiate through because we're in the business of making people happy. And only if our customers -- and our customers will only be happy if our employees felt like they were part of a family. So that's been my focus is to really make sure that we're doing this as a family and to think about the future because you can quickly disrupt a culture that takes years and years to build. It also allowed us, I think, to be -- to act quite fast in the way that we're thinking about a reopening because of the resources we had at hand. As an example, I believe we were one of the first companies in the nation, not just in our industry, but in the nation, to produce a detailed reopening plan.  
We published it for the world to see on April 19. It's a 23-page plan that goes department by department, area by area, space by space in terms of how we're going to keep our employees safe and our customers safe. It's actually become known as the Wynn plan. And I've had sports teams call to walk through it; airlines call and walk through it; retail, large; landlords calling up through it; developers; dozens of CEOs to look at the Wynn plan and to think about it and apply it to their own business. And we did that because we want to help lead the conversation to a reopening of our economy, but in a phased approach and in a safe approach and focused on the data. 
We've been working with our experts and state and local officials on benchmarks to track that should be public and transparent. We've crafted, with our medical community here in Nevada, benchmarks based on disease growth, which is a case growth coupled with hospitalizations and deaths. And the disease growth needs to be at a certain level before you consider reopening. We have set benchmarks for ICU capacity with our medical community as well as ventilator capacity that you need the ability to achieve a 2x surge in COVID patients in your ICU without needing crisis care to begin a phased approach to opening as well as test positivity rate. So -- which really measures the amount of tests that are being conducted in an area. Those benchmarks have been widely distributed. They're going to be quite public. And it's really a great way that our medical community is looking at this to think about phased openings of the economy.  
In Nevada, our governor has launched a -- the concept of a phased opening. The Phase 1 should begin in the next week or so, sometime around mid-May. And then based on the benchmarks and the data, I believe we'll continue to see, in Phase 2, openings of additional businesses and potentially opening of our business in late May. But again, that is assuming that we stay in line with the benchmarks and that the environment is safe for customers and for all of our employees.  
In Massachusetts, they have formed a task force at the state level, and I want to commend both Governor Sisolak and Governor Baker for early, fast action and for their tireless work on this effort.  
Massachusetts is also, I believe, will be coming out with a phased approach to opening. They have clearly had a much more difficult time than Nevada has given the high amount of cases and deaths there. But their medical community has handled it really as good as has been handled around the globe and should be commended.  
On the testing front, we think a lot about this. And in fact, we in -- Las Vegas, has signed a partnership with the University Medical Center, the research hospital in Las Vegas, whereby any of our employees can get tested for COVID-19. In fact, we have on-site testing tomorrow, set up in an 85,000 square foot ballroom with 25 nurses from UMC, all appropriately spaced out, and we believe that we'll have, over the next couple of days, thousands of employees that will have been tested. These are the types of things that we're doing now and early into an eventual lead up to opening our properties.  
In Macau, we've been -- we've remained open in Macau after the closure in the first 2 weeks of February. However, as all of you on this phone know there -- the Macau volumes have really not been there because there's a 14-day quarantine of going in and out of Macau from Hong Kong or Mainland China. One of -- some encouraging things that we have seen in Macau is: first, there hasn't been a new COVID case in Macau in weeks; second, in Mainland China and Macau and Hong Kong, teachers and students are back to school as of last week. There's continued to be progress in -- the Macau government has publicly talked about it, in the health check system, which in China, as I'm sure a lot of you are aware, on your mobile phone, you have a red, yellow or green system that gives access to various areas. And Macau has been working very closely with Guangdong to make sure that those health checks are in line. All of those seem to be in our progress. So we would anticipate that, as everyone else is, that progress will continue in terms of reopening the borders in a cautious way, resuming tourism in a cautious way. And the amount of progress that's been made over there has been extraordinary. Just looking at the results, high level, before our closure in Las Vegas, RevPAR was up 8%. In Massachusetts, we were on our way to record EBITDA and win per unit per day before closure was up on the slot floor, about 13%.  
In Macau, as we laid out for all of you on the first quarter call, during the closure, we were roughly between $2.2 million and $2.6 million a day of burn. And what we saw from February 20 to roughly March 20 after we reopened, was a gradual increase in gaming volumes and particularly led by VIP and Premium segment to the point where our burn went, in a matter of 3 weeks, from $2.5 million a day to $800,000 a day. And we were back to roughly 25% of our volumes in the fourth quarter. So we're continuing to be optimistic about what's going to happen in Macau as the cautious reopening of the border continues. We're focused on our 3 pillars that we talk about on these calls, which in Macau and in North America, in Macau, particularly: it's investing in our people, which we're doing; investing in our communities, which includes the Greater Bay Area; and really helping to position win to be beneficial in the Greater Bay Area and working on investments throughout the region and investing in our assets. So during these times, we have continued extensive design development work -- design work on our Crystal Pavilion project in Macau, and we remain very excited about it. So that's really where we are right now. We -- I believe we're going to continue to lead in our industry in Las Vegas and in Massachusetts. We're working very carefully and closely on a daily basis with state and local officials and the gaming regulatory bodies. And I believe that the data will be transparent as to opening dates based on benchmarks, and we'll be ready to begin in the new normal atmosphere.  
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Craig to talk about some of our financial results."

This quarter, I'll focus my remarks on the company's current liquidity position and our expected cash burn rate. At the onset of the outbreak of the virus in both Asia and the U.S., we took immediate and decisive action to bolster our global liquidity position, maximize our financial flexibility and preserve cash. On April 30, our global cash and liquidity position was nearly $3.4 billion, providing the company with significant runway to weather the impact of the pandemic on our business. In Macau, where we drew down our revolving credit facility in February, we had approximately $1.8 billion of available liquidity as of April 30. And in the U.S., we had total available liquidity of approximately $1.6 billion at the end of April. Our already strong domestic liquidity position was recently bolstered by the issuance of $600 million of unsecured notes in April. In fact, the transaction was upsized from $350 million and was approximately 8x oversubscribed. We were pleased to be the first company in our industry to issue unsecured notes since the onset of the pandemic, once again highlighting the strength of our brands and our business. We also obtained a covenant waiver for our U.S. credit facility, further increasing our financial flexibility. We are well positioned to bridge the current period of uncertainty and to thrive operationally and strategically during the recovery period.  
Turning to our cash burn rate. Upon the closure of casino operations in Macau in February as Matt just alluded to, we announced an expected daily OpEx burn rate in Macau of $2.5 million. As he also mentioned, upon reopening in late February, our normalized EBITDA burn rate improved to approximately $800,000 per day in March. And with the subsequent implementation of additional public health measures, quarantines and border closures, this rate in April was approximately $2 million per day. Reflective of limited business volumes. Until the reimplementation of visa schemes and full reopening of transit to Hong Kong, we expect a daily burn rate in the $2 million to $2.5 million range in Macau, excluding interest and CapEx.  
In the U.S., we have currently committed to pay all our team members their full wages and benefits. Under this approach, our daily OpEx burn rate in the U.S. is approximately $3.6 million, inclusive of corporate expense. Globally, cash interest expense and our scale down CapEx program combined are approximately $1.7 million per day, and thus, our current global worst-case, all-in daily cash burn rate, is approximately $7.8 million per day, meaning we have sufficient liquidity runway in a worst case, no revenue full pay environment until at least the third quarter of 2021. But we will, of course, continue to actively assess our cash OpEx usage and liquidity position as the situation evolves, and we'll make adjustments as required based on the facts on the ground, including likely reopening dates.  
On the CapEx front, we have postponed the Wynn Las Vegas room remodel, which was slated to begin in June conserving approximately $170 million of cash and liquidity. We're fortunate to have the highest quality room product in Las Vegas, and we plan to revisit the project again as we plan for 2021. We will also be very judicious with our global normal course maintenance capital spending over the coming quarters, only proceeding with our highest priority projects. Our preconstruction planning work on the Crystal Pavilion at Wynn Palace continues with our in-house development team, as Matt mentioned.  
And in order to further solidify the company's financial position, our Board, along with senior management, have decided to temporarily suspend the company's quarterly dividend, preserving over $100 million of liquidity per quarter. We look forward to resuming the dividend when business conditions permit.  
Lastly, I'll quickly note that our reported EBITDA for our U.S. properties in the first quarter was negatively impacted by a $75.7 million accrual associated with our commitment to pay our domestic team members' full wages and benefits after quarter end from April 1 through May 15. $56.4 million of this accrual was for Wynn Las Vegas and $19.3 million was for Boston.  
With that, we will now open up the call to Q&A."

So at Wynn, we're not looking for 100,000 people a day to be going through our properties. That's never been our business. We've always been focused on the premium end.

Something we talk about locally is the Macau advantage. We have proximity to China. We've got proximity to Guangdong, the biggest, wealthiest province in China, 114 million people, of the 49 IVS cities in China, 21 of them are in Guangdong. It looks like our borders will be opening up over the next couple of months. And I think everybody is anticipating us building business very nicely. There is pent-up demand in China. What we've seen over the May holiday is a lot of resort and luxury-driven travel, a lot of family-driven travel, which is very good for Cotai.

And so we're working through that. I think each day people's mentality changes depending on where they live and what they're experiencing.

In Las Vegas, like I said, we're going to have the ability working with UMC when we open it wins. Any employee and any customer that wants the swab test, you can get it, we have on-site.

And now we really appreciate the fact that it's about safety first. They're phasing the lifting of restrictions. They've had a very progressive development over the last 2 weeks. The first stage was allowing teachers and students based in Zhuhai, who live in Zhuhai and come over to Macau to attend school and teachers, to work. And so they've gone through that process. That process involved introducing relative mass testing for the individuals, and that was very successfully done. We're now looking at Macau people that are working in Macau but actually living in Zhuhai. They're the next stage of the testing process. The merging and synchronizing of the 2 health colds for Guangdong and for Macau involved a lot of regional cooperation between government departments that -- they're deep in dialogue about that. The system is being set up and now they're trialing it. And they've already altered the border open and closure hours back to where they were previously. So there's a lot of things happening.

As we look back at what has occurred in 2020, we made a decision back in March that we were going to invest in our brands and our culture. When we closed our facilities in March in Las Vegas an",1074,"Thanks, Craig, and thank you, everybody, for joining today. As we look back at what has occurred in 2020, we made a decision back in March that we were going to invest in our brands and our culture. 
When we closed our facilities in March in Las Vegas and in Boston and also the borders were restricted in Macau, we decided to pay all 30,000 team members their full wages and benefits through the closure, through the end of May. Because we know that over the long term, our brand and our culture are what is going to lead us out of this and will continue to allow us to lead in this industry. 
One thing that we did during the closure is we developed a comprehensive health and safety guidelines that, in fact, I believe, became the gold standard in the hospitality industry. Of course, everyone now has the electrostatic spray and UV technology and all the sanitization efforts same as us, thermal cameras as you walk in to take temperatures. But one of the things that I'm particularly proud of is our testing capability. 
Not only did we test all of our employees before they started, but we developed an algorithm where we surveil our staff and we test randomly 500 to 600 people every couple of weeks, and we have 10 contact tracers in-house. To put that in perspective, we performed 16,750 tests, and 98% have come back negative. The roughly 300 that were positive of our staff, our contact tracers contacted them immediately and through an extensive interview process, 99% of those 300 people were exposed outside of Wynn. 
Each week, I sit with and talk to the head of Global Health Security and Pandemic Research and her team from Georgetown University, going through our protocols and everything that we're doing. And just last week, talking about these numbers, her response was, ""Wynn is probably the safest place outside of home that your employees and your customers go during the day."" That's part of our brand. That's who we are, and that's what we're going to go up to. 
When we began preparing to reopen on June 4 in Las Vegas, we knew that our brand and our culture were imperative, but so is our cash. And all along, I've been very clear that we were going to be staffing to demand when we opened. We made some tough decisions, rightsizing our expense structure since we've opened. And in the month of June, 26 days at Las Vegas, on a normalized basis, we made roughly $9 million in EBITDA. 
Our focus here is that we continue to keep our brand and keep our culture intact, but also keep our cash. We are going to continue to focus on breaking even or making money. We did notice in Las Vegas, there was some pent-up demand, in particular from California as we opened in June. We were receiving roughly 4,000 reservations a day that would be spread over the upcoming 2 weeks. And then as the virus began to spike in our key drive end markets in California and in Arizona, we saw a downtick in reservations, roughly 25% here at Wynn after the fourth of July. 
And we staffed appropriately. We're managing our business every day based on that reduced demand. And sitting here 30-odd days into the third quarter, our EBITDA is roughly $5 million. So it's impossible to predict whether Wynn Las Vegas during these times of restriction and closure will be making $5 million a month or $10 million a month. It's really out of our hands outside of the expenses, and we're focused on that every day and what's going on in our key drive end markets. 
We're experiencing mid-50% occupancy on the weekends and in the 30s during the week. And the visibility is quite murky because it really is short-term bookings from our drive-in markets. Moving on to Encore Boston Harbor in Massachusetts. Clearly, we were not open in the second quarter. We opened that property in mid-July, on July 12 actually. And Encore Boston Harbor is experiencing what many regional casinos are experiencing around the country. Slot volumes are actually quite good. They're, in fact, up over last year on significantly reduced units. 
Table volumes are off and probably disproportionately in Massachusetts relative to some other jurisdictions because of the very tight restrictions that are in place. As an example, craps and roulette are still not open. We're working closely with the MGC to show how we can do that in a very safe way. And the number of physicians are limited on the table side. So I do think there is more demand than supply for table games in our local markets there, and it's really just limited by our current restrictions. 
In Macau, the second quarter was similar to the first quarter. And what is good about Macau is the direction of travel feels like progress. So I'm sure as all of you on this call that are watching notice that every 2 weeks, there's a slight reduction in the restrictions, traveler restrictions going to Macau, whether it was eliminating the quarantine between the Guangdong Province and Macau, and then allowing for nontourist visas to be issued beginning this month and continued talk among various people about when tourist visas, the individual visa scheme, for the travel bubble of the Guangdong Province and Macau will begin. 
While we do not have any dates on when that will start, we are confident that, that is going to be happening in 2020. And each week, there seems to be a new, small incremental step forward. And once that travel bubble begins to open and people and tourist visas are being issued, Macau will be back in business. 
So before I hand it back over to Craig to give more color on the quarter, I just want to stress that we are going to be focused on leading in our industry, maintaining our brand, maintaining our culture and maintaining our cash. So there will be winners and losers that come out of this. And when this is over, and we come out, we want to make sure that we have the capital available to grow, and we have the culture in place to take care of our people and our customers. 
With that, I'll go ahead and turn it over to Craig for additional thoughts."

I want to remind everyone that the results presented in our earnings release reflect the closure of Wynn Las Vegas through June 3 and the closure of Encore Boston Harbor for the entire quarter. As Matt noted, subsequent to reopening in",580,"Thank you, Matt. I want to remind everyone that the results presented in our earnings release reflect the closure of Wynn Las Vegas through June 3 and the closure of Encore Boston Harbor for the entire quarter. 
As Matt noted, subsequent to reopening in Las Vegas, we generated approximately $9 million of normalized EBITDA from a business that is heavily weighted to weakened occupancy. In the casino, slot business has been resilient with handle per operating day in the second quarter up 2% year-over-year, while table drop per operating day was down 31% year-over-year, primarily due to lower baccarat volumes. 
In light of current forecasted business trends and the absence of a number of key visitor segments, the team at Wynn Las Vegas has made adjustments to our business subsequent to reopening, including to staffing. As a result, our daily OpEx levels, excluding gaming taxes in Las Vegas, have declined 40% from Q4 2019 to approximately $1.8 million per day in July. We are focused on cash generation in Las Vegas. And as Matt noted, we expect to be breakeven to slightly EBITDA positive over the next few months, a substantial improvement over the daily cash burn rate we experienced during the closure. 
In Boston, we reopened in early July with a number of safety-related operating restrictions in place. Our reopening plan there was focused on opening only those amenities that support the casino, including the closure of the hotel on most weekdays. Overall, we've seen encouraging trends in the casino, particularly in slots with handle per operating day up approximately 7% versus Q4 2019. 
Similar to Las Vegas, we made a number of operating and staffing adjustments resulting in a reduction of daily OpEx, excluding gaming taxes from Q4 2019 of approximately 33% to $830,000 per day post reopening in July. 
In Macau, business volumes remained subdued throughout the quarter due to ongoing travel restrictions in place in the region. While we await the return of visitation to the market, we have made certain OpEx adjustments with a focus on nonlabor fixed costs. As a result, we anticipate that we will break even at approximately 40% of Q4 2019 gaming volumes. Until that point, we anticipate a gradually improving daily EBITDA burn of $1.5 million to $2 million per day. 
As of last Friday, July 31, our global cash and liquidity position was over $3.8 billion, providing us with significant runway to weather the pandemic. In Macau, we had approximately $2.5 billion of available liquidity as of July 31. And in the U.S., we had total available liquidity of $1.3 billion as of July 31, with a substantially lower domestic daily cash burn subsequent to the reopening of our U.S.-based properties. 
Our CapEx in the quarter was $52 million. As noted last quarter, the vast majority of our CapEx plans remain on hold, and we are only proceeding with our highest priority projects. Lastly, I'd like to remind everyone that in the first quarter of 2020, we accrued $75.7 million of OpEx associated with our prior commitment to pay our domestic team members full wages and benefits from April 1 through May 15, and thus, this amount was not included in OpEx in the second quarter of 2020. Additionally, corporate expense in the quarter benefited from a $27.7 million net gain in relation to a derivative litigation settlement that the company received after the close of the quarter. 
With that, we will now turn the call over to Q&A."

So groups are all holding off until kind of late spring '21 into the back half of next year to decide what's going to happen and what they need. One thing that we're doing, which I think is probably different than most of our peers, is I'm spending a lot of time on point-of-care testing. There's a couple of really exciting technologies that are moving forward. And we are in line if those get their EUA, Emergency Use Authorization, under the FDA, because I believe if we can have on-site point-of-care testing that provides pooling, meaning we -- it looks like you can do 10 people at a time with a 5-minute turnaround that, that changes the game for groups. So maybe you're not waiting until the mid-next year, if you can actually have point-of-care testing to show that everyone walking into this space is COVID-free, I think that, that could accelerate, I don't know, how much by months, our ramp-up of some of the smaller groups. 
That stuff has not been approved yet, but -- those point-of-care tests are not approved yet by the FDA, but they're moving fast. And the cost, especially with pooling are coming down significantly. So I think my belief is that's sort of the bridge that we need to get to in a place that requires a lot of people to be together before we're into the vaccine. Because I think as everyone knows, by the time that's approved and rolled out and implemented, those things are complicated and take a lot of time. So those are the types of things we're talking to our groups about in addition to all the social distancing measures and everything that we do to provide a really safe experience. And so the conversations are ongoing, but to say that we knew when groups could start coming back is, I think, it's too early."

As we look back at what has occurred in 2020, we made a decision back in March that we were going to invest in our brands and our culture.  
When we closed our facilities in March in Las Vegas and in Boston and also the borders were restricted in Macau, we decided to pay all 30,000 team members their full wages and benefits through the closure, through the end of May. Because we know that over the long term, our brand and our culture are what is going to lead us out of this and will continue to allow us to lead in this industry.  
One thing that we did during the closure is we developed a comprehensive health and safety guidelines that, in fact, I believe, became the gold standard in the hospitality industry. Of course, everyone now has the electrostatic spray and UV technology and all the sanitization efforts same as us, thermal cameras as you walk in to take temperatures. But one of the things that I'm particularly proud of is our testing capability.  
Not only did we test all of our employees before they started, but we developed an algorithm where we surveil our staff and we test randomly 500 to 600 people every couple of weeks, and we have 10 contact tracers in-house. To put that in perspective, we performed 16,750 tests, and 98% have come back negative. The roughly 300 that were positive of our staff, our contact tracers contacted them immediately and through an extensive interview process, 99% of those 300 people were exposed outside of Wynn.
Each week, I sit with and talk to the head of Global Health Security and Pandemic Research and her team from Georgetown University, going through our protocols and everything that we're doing. And just last week, talking about these numbers, her response was, ""Wynn is probably the safest place outside of home that your employees and your customers go during the day."" That's part of our brand. That's who we are, and that's what we're going to go live up to.  
When we began preparing to reopen on June 4 in Las Vegas, we knew that our brand and our culture were imperative, but so is our cash. And all along, I've been very clear that we were going to be staffing to demand when we opened. We made some tough decisions, rightsizing our expense structure since we've opened. And in the month of June, 26 days at Las Vegas, on a normalized basis, we made roughly $9 million in EBITDA. Our focus here is that we continue to keep our brand and keep our culture intact, but also keep our cash. We are going to continue to focus on breaking even or making money. 
We did notice in Las Vegas, there was some pent-up demand, in particular from California as we opened in June. We were receiving roughly 4,000 reservations a day that would be spread over the upcoming 2 weeks. And then as the virus began to spike in our key drive end markets in California and in Arizona, we saw a downtick in reservations, roughly 25% here at Wynn after the 4th of July.  
And we staffed appropriately. We're managing our business every day based on that reduced demand. And sitting here 30-odd days into the third quarter, our EBITDA is roughly $5 million. So it's impossible to predict whether Wynn Las Vegas during these times of restriction and closure will be making $5 million a month or $10 million a month. It's really out of our hands outside of the expenses, and we're focused on that every day and what's going on in our key drive end markets. We're experiencing mid-50% occupancy on the weekends and in the 30s during the week. And the visibility is quite murky because it really is short-term bookings from our drive-in markets. 
Moving on to Encore Boston Harbor in Massachusetts. Clearly, we were not open in the second quarter. We opened that property in mid-July, on July 12 actually. And Encore Boston Harbor is experiencing what many regional casinos are experiencing around the country. Slot volumes are actually quite good. They're in fact up over last year on significantly reduced units. Table volumes are off and probably disproportionately in Massachusetts relative to some other jurisdictions because of the very tight restrictions that are in place. 
As an example, craps and roulette are still not open. We're working closely with the MGC to show how we can do that in a very safe way. And the number of physicians are limited on the table side. So I do think there is more demand than supply for table games in our local markets there, and it's really just limited by our current restrictions.
In Macau, the second quarter was similar to the first quarter. And what is good about Macau is the direction of travel feels like progress. So I'm sure as all of you on this call that are watching notice that every 2 weeks, there's a slight reduction in the restrictions, traveler restrictions going to Macau, whether it was eliminating the quarantine between the Guangdong province and Macau, and then allowing for nontourist visas to be issued beginning this month and continued talk among various people about when tourist visas, the individual visa scheme, for the travel bubble of the Guangdong province and Macau will begin.  
While we do not have any dates on when that will start, we are confident that, that is going to be happening in 2020. And each week, there seems to be a new, small incremental step forward. And once that travel bubble begins to open and tourist visas are being issued, Macau will be back in business.  
So before I hand it back over to Craig to give more color on the quarter, I just want to stress that we are going to be focused on leading in our industry, maintaining our brand, maintaining our culture and maintaining our cash. So there will be winners and losers that come out of this. And when this is over, and we come out, we want to make sure that we have the capital available to grow, and we have the culture in place to take care of our people and our customers. 
With that, I'll go ahead and turn it over to Craig for additional thoughts."

I want to remind everyone that the results presented in our earnings release reflect the closure of Wynn Las Vegas through June 3 and the closure of Encore Boston Harbor for the entire quarter.  As Matt noted, subsequent to reopening in",580,"Thank you, Matt. I want to remind everyone that the results presented in our earnings release reflect the closure of Wynn Las Vegas through June 3 and the closure of Encore Boston Harbor for the entire quarter.  
As Matt noted, subsequent to reopening in Las Vegas, we generated approximately $9 million of normalized EBITDA from a business that is heavily weighted to weakened occupancy. In the casino, slot business has been resilient with handle per operating day in the second quarter up 2% year-over-year, while table drop per operating day was down 31% year-over-year, primarily due to lower baccarat volumes. 
In light of current forecasted business trends and the absence of a number of key visitor segments, the team at Wynn Las Vegas has made adjustments to our business subsequent to reopening, including to staffing. As a result, our daily OpEx levels, excluding gaming taxes in Las Vegas, have declined 40% from Q4 2019 to approximately $1.8 million per day in July. We are focused on cash generation in Las Vegas. And as Matt noted, we expect to be breakeven to slightly EBITDA positive over the next few months, a substantial improvement over the daily cash burn rate we experienced during the closure.  
In Boston, we reopened in early July with a number of safety-related operating restrictions in place. Our reopening plan there was focused on opening only those amenities that support the casino, including the closure of the hotel on most weekdays. Overall, we've seen encouraging trends in the casino, particularly in slots with handle per operating day up approximately 7% versus Q4 2019.
Similar to Las Vegas, we made a number of operating and staffing adjustments, resulting in a reduction of daily OpEx, excluding gaming taxes from Q4 2019 of approximately 33% to $830,000 per day post reopening in July.  
In Macau, business volumes remained subdued throughout the quarter due to ongoing travel restrictions in place in the region. While we await the return of visitation to the market, we have made certain OpEx adjustments with a focus on nonlabor fixed costs. As a result, we anticipate that we will break even at approximately 40% of Q4 2019 gaming volumes. Until that point, we anticipate a gradually improving daily EBITDA burn of $1.5 million to $2 million per day.  
As of last Friday, July 31, our global cash and liquidity position was over $3.8 billion, providing us with significant runway to weather the pandemic. In Macau, we had approximately $2.5 billion of available liquidity as of July 31. And in the U.S., we had total available liquidity of $1.3 billion as of July 31, with a substantially lower domestic daily cash burn subsequent to the reopening of our U.S.-based properties.
Our CapEx in the quarter was $52 million. As noted last quarter, the vast majority of our CapEx plans remain on hold, and we are only proceeding with our highest priority projects. 
Lastly, I'd like to remind everyone that in the first quarter of 2020, we accrued $75.7 million of OpEx associated with our prior commitment to pay our domestic team members full wages and benefits from April 1 through May 15, and thus, this amount was not included in OpEx in the second quarter of 2020. Additionally, corporate expense in the quarter benefited from a $27.7 million net gain in relation to a derivative litigation settlement that the company received after the close of the quarter.  
With that, we will now turn the call over to Q&A."

So groups are all holding off until kind of late spring '21 into the back half of next year to decide what's going to happen and what they need. One thing that we're doing, which I think is probably different than most of our peers, is I'm spending a lot of time on point-of-care testing. There's a couple of really exciting technologies that are moving forward. And we are in line if those get their EUA, Emergency Use Authorization, under the FDA, because I believe if we can have on-site point-of-care testing that provides pooling, meaning we -- it looks like you can do 10 people at a time with a 5-minute turnaround that, that changes the game for groups. So maybe you're not waiting until the mid-next year, if you can actually have point-of-care testing to show that everyone walking into this space is COVID-free. I think that, that could accelerate, I don't know, how much by months, our ramp-up of some of the smaller groups.  
That stuff has not been approved yet, but -- those point-of-care tests are not approved yet by the FDA, but they're moving fast. And the cost, especially with pooling are coming down significantly. So I think my belief is that's sort of the bridge that we need to get to in a place that requires a lot of people to be together before we're into the vaccine. Because I think as everyone knows, by the time that's approved and rolled out and implemented, those things are complicated and take a lot of time. So those are the types of things we're talking to our groups about in addition to all the social distancing measures and everything that we do to provide a really safe experience. And so the conversations are ongoing, but to say that we knew when groups could start coming back is, I think, it's too early."

As we look back at what has occurred in 2020, we made a decision back in March that we were going to invest in our brand and in our culture.  When we closed our facilities in March in Las Vegas",1072,"Thanks, Craig, and thank you, everybody, for joining today. As we look back at what has occurred in 2020, we made a decision back in March that we were going to invest in our brand and in our culture.  
When we closed our facilities in March in Las Vegas and in Boston, and also the borders were restricted in Macau, we decided to pay all 30,000 team members their full wages and benefits through the closure, through the end of May. Because we know that over the long term, our brand and our culture are what is going to lead us out of this and will continue to allow us to lead in this industry.  
One thing that we did during the closure is we developed a comprehensive health and safety guidelines that, in fact, I believe, became the gold standard in the hospitality industry. Of course, everyone now has the electrostatic spray and UV technology and all the sanitization efforts same as us, thermal cameras as you walk in, to take temperatures. But one of the things that I'm particularly proud of is our testing capability.  
Not only did we test all of our employees before they started, but we developed an algorithm where we surveil our staff and we test randomly 500 to 600 people every couple of weeks, and we have 10 contact tracers in-house. To put that in perspective, we performed 16,750 tests, and 98% have come back negative. The roughly 300 that were positive of our staff, our contact tracers contacted them immediately and through an extensive interview process, 99% of those 300 people were exposed outside of Wynn.
Each week, I sit with and talk to the head of Global Health Security and Pandemic Research and her team from Georgetown University, going through our protocols and everything that we're doing. And just last week, talking about these numbers, her response was, ""Wynn is probably the safest place outside of home that your employees and your customers go during the day."" That's part of our brand. That's who we are, and that's what we're going to go live up to.  
When we began preparing to reopen on June 4 in Las Vegas, we knew that our brand and our culture were imperative, but so is our cash. And all along, I've been very clear that we were going to be staffing to demand when we opened. We made some tough decisions, rightsizing our expense structure since we've opened. And in the month of June, 26 days at Las Vegas, on a normalized basis, we made roughly $9 million in EBITDA. Our focus here is that we continue to keep our brand and keep our culture intact, but also keep our cash. We are going to continue to focus on breaking even or making money. 
We did notice in Las Vegas, there was some pent-up demand, in particular from California, as we opened in June. We were receiving roughly 4,000 reservations a day that would be spread over the upcoming 2 weeks. And then as the virus began to spike in our key drive-in markets in California and in Arizona, we saw a downtick in reservations, roughly 25% here at Wynn after the 4th of July.  
And we staffed appropriately. We're managing our business every day based on that reduced demand. And sitting here 30-odd days into the third quarter, our EBITDA is roughly $5 million. So it's impossible to predict whether Wynn Las Vegas during these times of restriction and closure will be making $5 million a month or $10 million a month. It's really out of our hands outside of the expenses, and we're focused on that every day and what's going on in our key drive-in markets. We're experiencing mid-50% occupancy on the weekends and in the 30s during the week. And the visibility is quite murky because it really is short-term bookings from our drive-in markets. 
Moving on to Encore Boston Harbor in Massachusetts. Clearly, we were not open in the second quarter. We opened that property in mid-July, on July 12 actually. And Encore Boston Harbor is experiencing what many regional casinos are experiencing around the country. Slot volumes are actually quite good. They're in fact up over last year on significantly reduced units. Table volumes are off, and probably disproportionately in Massachusetts relative to some other jurisdictions, because of the very tight restrictions that are in place. 
As an example, craps and roulette are still not open. We're working closely with the MGC to show how we can do that in a very safe way. And the number of positions are limited on the table side. So I do think there is more demand than supply for table games in our local markets there, and it's really just limited by our current restrictions.
In Macau, the second quarter was similar to the first quarter. And what is good about Macau is the direction of travel feels like progress. So I'm sure, as all of you on this call that are watching noticed, that every 2 weeks, there's a slight reduction in the restrictions, travel restrictions going to Macau, whether it was eliminating the quarantine between the Guangdong Province and Macau, and then allowing for nontourist visas to be issued beginning this month, and continued talk among various people about when tourist visas, the individual visa scheme, for the travel bubble of the Guangdong Province and Macau will begin.  
While we do not have any dates on when that will start, we are confident that, that is going to be happening in 2020. And each week, there seems to be a new, small incremental step forward. And once that travel bubble begins to open and tourist visas are being issued, Macau will be back in business.  
So before I hand it back over to Craig to give more color on the quarter, I just want to stress that we are going to be focused on leading in our industry, maintaining our brand, maintaining our culture and maintaining our cash. So there will be winners and losers that come out of this. And when this is over, and we come out, we want to make sure that we have the capital available to grow, and we have the culture in place to take care of our people and our customers. 
With that, I'll go ahead and turn it over to Craig for additional thoughts."

I want to remind everyone that the results presented in our earnings release reflect the closure of Wynn Las Vegas through June 3 and the closure of Encore Boston Harbor for the entire quarter.  As Matt noted, subsequent to reopening in",579,"Thank you, Matt. I want to remind everyone that the results presented in our earnings release reflect the closure of Wynn Las Vegas through June 3 and the closure of Encore Boston Harbor for the entire quarter.  
As Matt noted, subsequent to reopening in Las Vegas, we generated approximately $9 million of normalized EBITDA from a business that is heavily weighted to weakened occupancy. In the casino, slot business has been resilient with handle per operating day in the second quarter up 2% year-over-year, while table drop per operating day was down 31% year-over-year, primarily due to lower baccarat volumes. 
In light of current forecasted business trends and the absence of a number of key visitor segments, the team at Wynn Las Vegas has made adjustments to our business subsequent to reopening, including to staffing. As a result, our daily OpEx levels, excluding gaming taxes in Las Vegas, have declined 40% from Q4 2019 to approximately $1.8 million per day in July. We are focused on cash generation in Las Vegas. And as Matt noted, we expect to be breakeven to slightly EBITDA-positive over the next few months, a substantial improvement over the daily cash burn rate we experienced during the closure.  
In Boston, we reopened in early July with a number of safety-related operating restrictions in place. Our reopening plan there was focused on opening only those amenities that support the casino, including the closure of the hotel on most weekdays. Overall, we've seen encouraging trends in the casino, particularly in slots, with handle per operating day up approximately 7% versus Q4 2019.
Similar to Las Vegas, we made a number of operating and staffing adjustments, resulting in a reduction of daily OpEx, excluding gaming taxes, from Q4 2019 of approximately 33% to $830,000 per day post reopening in July.  
In Macau, business volumes remained subdued throughout the quarter due to ongoing travel restrictions in place in the region. While we await the return of visitation to the market, we have made certain OpEx adjustments with a focus on nonlabor fixed costs. As a result, we anticipate that we will break even at approximately 40% of Q4 2019 gaming volumes. Until that point, we anticipate a gradually improving daily EBITDA burn of $1.5 million to $2 million per day.  
As of last Friday, July 31, our global cash and liquidity position was over $3.8 billion, providing us with significant runway to weather the pandemic. In Macau, we had approximately $2.5 billion of available liquidity as of July 31. And in the U.S., we had total available liquidity of $1.3 billion as of July 31, with a substantially lower domestic daily cash burn subsequent to the reopening of our U.S.-based properties.
Our CapEx in the quarter was $52 million. As noted last quarter, the vast majority of our CapEx plans remain on hold, and we are only proceeding with our highest priority projects. 
Lastly, I'd like to remind everyone that in the first quarter of 2020, we accrued $75.7 million of OpEx associated with our prior commitment to pay our domestic team members full wages and benefits from April 1 through May 15, and thus this amount was not included in OpEx in the second quarter of 2020. Additionally, corporate expense in the quarter benefited from a $27.7 million net gain in relation to a derivative litigation settlement that the company received after the close of the quarter.  
With that, we will now turn the call over to Q&A."

So without the convention base, without the nightclub crowd, without the large shows, we've become super regional. So we're really focused on promos, on offers, we have partnerships with JetSuiteX. We're doing lots of things to try to get people to come here more often, basically from California and Arizona, so frequency and worth to spend more.  
So the market is very promotional right now, obviously. And we're focused on our database and driving more casino revenue. Non-gaming revenue is down for us by 2/3. And that was 2/3 of our business. So we're doing everything we can to get heads in beds in the hotel and really focused on how we can get more of our drive-in market here on a more frequent basis."

So groups are all holding off until kind of late spring '21 into the back half of next year to decide what's going to happen and what they need. One thing that we're doing, which I think is probably different than most of our peers, is I'm spending a lot of time on point-of-care testing. There's a couple of really exciting technologies that are moving forward. And we are in line if those get their EUA, Emergency Use Authorization, under the FDA. Because I believe if we can have on-site point-of-care testing that provides pooling, meaning we -- it looks like you can do 10 people at a time with a 5-minute turnaround that, that changes the game for groups. So maybe you're not waiting until the mid-next year, if you can actually have point-of-care testing to show that everyone walking into this space is COVID-free. I think that, that could accelerate, I don't know how much, by months, our ramp-up of some of the smaller groups.  
That stuff has not been approved yet, but -- those point-of-care tests are not approved yet by the FDA, but they're moving fast. And the cost, especially with pooling, are coming down significantly. So I think my belief is that's sort of the bridge that we need to get to in a place that requires a lot of people to be together, before we're into the vaccine. Because I think as everyone knows, by the time that's approved and rolled out and implemented, those things are complicated and take a lot of time. So those are the types of things we're talking to our groups about in addition to all the social distancing measures and everything that we do to provide a really safe experience. And so the conversations are ongoing, but to say that we knew when groups would start coming back is, I think it's too early."

As we look back at what has occurred in 2020, we made a decision back in March that we were going to invest in our brand and in our culture. When we closed our facilities in March in Las Vegas",1072,"Thanks, Craig, and thank you, everybody, for joining today. As we look back at what has occurred in 2020, we made a decision back in March that we were going to invest in our brand and in our culture. 
When we closed our facilities in March in Las Vegas and in Boston, and also the borders were restricted in Macau, we decided to pay all 30,000 team members their full wages and benefits through the closure, through the end of May. Because we know that over the long term, our brand and our culture are what is going to lead us out of this and will continue to allow us to lead in this industry. 
One thing that we did during the closure is we developed a comprehensive health and safety guidelines that, in fact, I believe, became the gold standard in the hospitality industry. Of course, everyone now has the electrostatic spray and UV technology and all the sanitization efforts same as us, thermal cameras as you walk in, to take temperatures. But one of the things that I'm particularly proud of is our testing capability. 
Not only did we test all of our employees before they started, but we developed an algorithm where we surveil our staff and we test randomly 500 to 600 people every couple of weeks, and we have 10 contact tracers in-house. To put that in perspective, we performed 16,750 tests, and 98% have come back negative. The roughly 300 that were positive of our staff, our contact tracers contacted them immediately and through an extensive interview process, 99% of those 300 people were exposed outside of Wynn.
Each week, I sit with and talk to the head of Global Health Security and Pandemic Research and her team from Georgetown University, going through our protocols and everything that we're doing. And just last week, talking about these numbers, her response was, ""Wynn is probably the safest place outside of home that your employees and your customers go during the day."" That's part of our brand. That's who we are, and that's what we're going to go live up to. 
When we began preparing to reopen on June 4 in Las Vegas, we knew that our brand and our culture were imperative, but so is our cash. And all along, I've been very clear that we were going to be staffing to demand when we opened. We made some tough decisions, rightsizing our expense structure since we've opened. And in the month of June, 26 days at Las Vegas, on a normalized basis, we made roughly $9 million in EBITDA. Our focus here is that we continue to keep our brand and keep our culture intact, but also keep our cash. We are going to continue to focus on breaking even or making money. 
We did notice in Las Vegas, there was some pent-up demand, in particular from California, as we opened in June. We were receiving roughly 4,000 reservations a day that would be spread over the upcoming 2 weeks. And then as the virus began to spike in our key drive-in markets in California and in Arizona, we saw a downtick in reservations, roughly 25% here at Wynn after the 4th of July. 
And we staffed appropriately. We're managing our business every day based on that reduced demand. And sitting here 30-odd days into the third quarter, our EBITDA is roughly $5 million. So it's impossible to predict whether Wynn Las Vegas during these times of restriction and closure will be making $5 million a month or $10 million a month. It's really out of our hands outside of the expenses, and we're focused on that every day and what's going on in our key drive-in markets. We're experiencing mid-50% occupancy on the weekends and in the 30s during the week. And the visibility is quite murky because it really is short-term bookings from our drive-in markets. 
Moving on to Encore Boston Harbor in Massachusetts. Clearly, we were not open in the second quarter. We opened that property in mid-July, on July 12 actually. And Encore Boston Harbor is experiencing what many regional casinos are experiencing around the country. Slot volumes are actually quite good. They're in fact up over last year on significantly reduced units. Table volumes are off, and probably disproportionately in Massachusetts relative to some other jurisdictions, because of the very tight restrictions that are in place. 
As an example, craps and roulette are still not open. We're working closely with the MGC to show how we can do that in a very safe way. And the number of positions are limited on the table side. So I do think there is more demand than supply for table games in our local markets there, and it's really just limited by our current restrictions.
In Macau, the second quarter was similar to the first quarter. And what is good about Macau is the direction of travel feels like progress. So I'm sure, as all of you on this call that are watching noticed, that every 2 weeks, there's a slight reduction in the restrictions, travel restrictions going to Macau, whether it was eliminating the quarantine between the Guangdong Province and Macau, and then allowing for nontourist visas to be issued beginning this month, and continued talk among various people about when tourist visas, the individual visa scheme, for the travel bubble of the Guangdong Province and Macau will begin. 
While we do not have any dates on when that will start, we are confident that, that is going to be happening in 2020. And each week, there seems to be a new, small incremental step forward. And once that travel bubble begins to open and tourist visas are being issued, Macau will be back in business. 
So before I hand it back over to Craig to give more color on the quarter, I just want to stress that we are going to be focused on leading in our industry, maintaining our brand, maintaining our culture and maintaining our cash. So there will be winners and losers that come out of this. And when this is over, and we come out, we want to make sure that we have the capital available to grow, and we have the culture in place to take care of our people and our customers. 
With that, I'll go ahead and turn it over to Craig for additional thoughts."

I want to remind everyone that the results presented in our earnings release reflect the closure of Wynn Las Vegas through June 3 and the closure of Encore Boston Harbor for the entire quarter. As Matt noted, subsequent to reopening in",579,"Thank you, Matt. I want to remind everyone that the results presented in our earnings release reflect the closure of Wynn Las Vegas through June 3 and the closure of Encore Boston Harbor for the entire quarter. 
As Matt noted, subsequent to reopening in Las Vegas, we generated approximately $9 million of normalized EBITDA from a business that is heavily weighted to weakened occupancy. In the casino, slot business has been resilient with handle per operating day in the second quarter up 2% year-over-year, while table drop per operating day was down 31% year-over-year, primarily due to lower baccarat volumes. 
In light of current forecasted business trends and the absence of a number of key visitor segments, the team at Wynn Las Vegas has made adjustments to our business subsequent to reopening, including to staffing. As a result, our daily OpEx levels, excluding gaming taxes in Las Vegas, have declined 40% from Q4 2019 to approximately $1.8 million per day in July. We are focused on cash generation in Las Vegas. And as Matt noted, we expect to be breakeven to slightly EBITDA-positive over the next few months, a substantial improvement over the daily cash burn rate we experienced during the closure. 
In Boston, we reopened in early July with a number of safety-related operating restrictions in place. Our reopening plan there was focused on opening only those amenities that support the casino, including the closure of the hotel on most weekdays. Overall, we've seen encouraging trends in the casino, particularly in slots, with handle per operating day up approximately 7% versus Q4 2019.
Similar to Las Vegas, we made a number of operating and staffing adjustments, resulting in a reduction of daily OpEx, excluding gaming taxes, from Q4 2019 of approximately 33% to $830,000 per day post reopening in July. 
In Macau, business volumes remained subdued throughout the quarter due to ongoing travel restrictions in place in the region. While we await the return of visitation to the market, we have made certain OpEx adjustments with a focus on nonlabor fixed costs. As a result, we anticipate that we will break even at approximately 40% of Q4 2019 gaming volumes. Until that point, we anticipate a gradually improving daily EBITDA burn of $1.5 million to $2 million per day. 
As of last Friday, July 31, our global cash and liquidity position was over $3.8 billion, providing us with significant runway to weather the pandemic. In Macau, we had approximately $2.5 billion of available liquidity as of July 31. And in the U.S., we had total available liquidity of $1.3 billion as of July 31, with a substantially lower domestic daily cash burn subsequent to the reopening of our U.S.-based properties.
Our CapEx in the quarter was $52 million. As noted last quarter, the vast majority of our CapEx plans remain on hold, and we are only proceeding with our highest priority projects. 
Lastly, I'd like to remind everyone that in the first quarter of 2020, we accrued $75.7 million of OpEx associated with our prior commitment to pay our domestic team members full wages and benefits from April 1 through May 15, and thus this amount was not included in OpEx in the second quarter of 2020. Additionally, corporate expense in the quarter benefited from a $27.7 million net gain in relation to a derivative litigation settlement that the company received after the close of the quarter. 
With that, we will now turn the call over to Q&A."

So groups are all holding off until kind of late spring '21 into the back half of next year to decide what's going to happen and what they need. One thing that we're doing, which I think is probably different than most of our peers, is I'm spending a lot of time on point-of-care testing. There's a couple of really exciting technologies that are moving forward. And we are in line if those get their EUA, Emergency Use Authorization, under the FDA. Because I believe if we can have on-site point-of-care testing that provides pooling, meaning we -- it looks like you can do 10 people at a time with a 5-minute turnaround that, that changes the game for groups. So maybe you're not waiting until the mid-next year, if you can actually have point-of-care testing to show that everyone walking into this space is COVID-free. I think that, that could accelerate, I don't know how much, by months, our ramp-up of some of the smaller groups. 
That stuff has not been approved yet, but -- those point-of-care tests are not approved yet by the FDA, but they're moving fast. And the cost, especially with pooling, are coming down significantly. So I think my belief is that's sort of the bridge that we need to get to in a place that requires a lot of people to be together, before we're into the vaccine. Because I think as everyone knows, by the time that's approved and rolled out and implemented, those things are complicated and take a lot of time. So those are the types of things we're talking to our groups about in addition to all the social distancing measures and everything that we do to provide a really safe experience. And so the conversations are ongoing, but to say that we knew when groups would start coming back is, I think it's too early."

You'll see that the second half of '21 is going to be very strong, '22, '23. So people are coming and they're seeing that. The first quarter of '21 is a lot about what's going on with CES and how are the other groups going to be falling out. But we see that by about April, there's some firmness in the market. Clearly, 2000 -- every year ahead of this, first quarter and second quarter are the best quarters. And so we missed that this year, and it's too early to tell for the rest of 2020 if there's any business.

I'm sure everybody is glued to the television watching these exciting election results right now. So we'll just -- we'll get right into it on our results here. I'd like to start in Macau. So t",1996,"Thanks, Craig, and thank you for joining us today, everyone. I'm sure everybody is glued to the television watching these exciting election results right now. So we'll just -- we'll get right into it on our results here. 
I'd like to start in Macau. So the third quarter in Macau was really very similar to the second. There wasn't a lot to talk about. We're still seeing roughly 8% to 10% of our visitor volumes compared to pre-COVID levels. And it was really -- there was just not a whole lot going on. But as everyone has been seeing, the government of Macau with its deliberate approach and steadfastness has been working very hard to continue to open Macau. 
Macau is probably one of the safest places on the planet, hasn't had COVID cases in months and months and months. And everyone there is really excited to see the progress that's going on. So as an example, in the month of August in Macau, our EBITDA line was negative $40 million because there's very low revenue, and we are carrying our cost. 
Our team is doing a great job saving money where we can, being more efficient while protecting the local employment and all of our employees. 
However, in October, we started to see those trends change. So we went from 10% of our normal visitor volumes, up to almost 30%. And it wasn't just over golden week. It was actually throughout the month. And in fact, I looked at our visitor data from November 2, 3 and 4 that went ballast before I walked in here. And we're seeing roughly 6,000 people a day come in the building, pre COVID, that number was 18,000. 
So those trends that we saw in early October are continuing into November. From a revenue standpoint in October, masked drop on our -- on the table side was roughly 40% of our pre-COVID levels. And on the junket side, which everyone has been talking about the junket business. What's going to happen to it? Is it going to survive? Where is it going to go? 
Clearly, it's changing. Clearly, it will be smaller even as we come through this than it was before, but it's still very real. We saw 30% -- roughly between 25% and 30% in turnover compared to our pre COVID levels in the junket space. 
So that activity produced actual positive EBITDA for us in October. So if you think about it, we went from a negative $40 million in August, which was normal, it was similar in July, et cetera, to a positive 6 in October, quite a big swing. And what we are optimistic about in Macau is the way that everything has been handled there, it doesn't appear to be 1 step forward, 1 step backward, 1 step forward. It's been a very deliberate approach, very thoughtful. And it just feels like we are -- and the market is just going to continue to get better. I don't know at what speed. I don't know at what pace, but the overall mood, attitude and trajectory is quite good. 
In fact, looking at October at our sales, they were roughly flat with last year. And our top 5 stores in Macau were up 25% compared to last year. So there's real consumer -- pent-up consumer demand. And it's just going to take time for the market to continue to open, but we feel really good about the current trajectory that's going on there. 
Moving to North America. As we talked about on the last call, we are not going to sacrifice our brand or our culture to make an extra few dollars here or there. That means, while we have significantly less staff and approximately 7,400 less staff globally now that we did pre COVID, we are still operating at a 5-star level in Macau and in North America. 
We are focused on making sure we have the highest room rates in the market. But we've also been focusing on making sure that we continue to breakeven or make money. And in Las Vegas, we made $20 million in the third quarter, both adjusted closer to $28 million. Some of the things that are encouraging that we're seeing in Las Vegas is we are taking share in the casino segment. We're seeing new domestic customers that we've never seen before that previously were lifers at some of our competitors. And I think for all of the reasons that we've been laying out from our security protocols of checking everyone when they walk in to our COVID protocols to all of our restaurants being open. We're beginning to continue -- we're not beginning. We are taking market share on the casino side. 
Slots in the market were down over 33% during the quarter, and we were down [  60%. ] 
Table drop was down about 35% in the quarter, and we were down 25%. So we're just seeing more business. We're seeing higher end customers, not a lot, but we're seeing that we are gaining share on that front. 
In October in Las Vegas, we actually had our best month. We generated roughly $14 million of EBITDA in October. We had a little bit of hold luck in there, maybe $2 million. But overall, it was a very good month. 
Now as everyone on the call knows, Las Vegas has seasonality, and we're coming in to the slow time. So COVID cases are picking up in the U.S., obviously. And November, December, are quite slow in Las Vegas and have been heavily reliant on group. 
So our team -- well, so October will not be repeated in November and December. But it shows that when there is just a little bit of business with the way we've restructured our expense line, the amount of operating leverage that we have now revenue quickly converts into EBITDA. And our focus, as things do get a little slower during the winter, is to make sure that we stay EBITDA positive. That's what we're going to do in Las Vegas. And I would think it's hard to tell. But I think when Las Vegas probably was the most profitable integrated resort Casino on the strip or if not the most, it was definitely at the top of the list. So our strategy is working. We're maintaining our brand, we're maintaining our culture, and we're making a little bit of money. 
Moving to Boston. Encore Boston Harbor is really starting to hit its stride. So we generated roughly $26 million in EBITDA, significantly more than we ever have in the past during the quarter. And our team has really learned how to be a super regional operator. We focused during the shutdown on how to run Encore Boston Harbor differently than we were because clearly, what we were doing was not quite right. And so we've had a laser focus on the casino segment. And what it is that those customers want and how we're going to deliver it? 
And if you look at our results, slot handle per day, just overall volume per day was actually up over last year. It's pretty extraordinary. When you think about -- we had 1,800 slot machines opened during this third quarter compared to 3,000 last year and volume was higher on a daily basis. Win per unit was over $400 on 1,800 unit, I think, $407 compared to $219 million last year. 
So Encore Boston Harbor is really starting to understand how -- and we are starting to understand what that market is, how to market to those customers and how to monetize there? Massachusetts recently, just this week, announced that starting over the weekend, restaurants, bars, casinos, et cetera, will need to close COVID related, starting at 9:30 at night. That's clearly a setback for us but it's very temporary. And I'm not sure it's the right thing to do from a health perspective. The government of Massachusetts has done a terrific job, throughout all of this, managing this from Governor Baker to the Massachusetts Gaming Commission. So we view it as a temporary setback, but it's really nothing that we're worried about. Because our business model is sound, and I think that we're going to continue to see increases in revenue and increases in EBITDA out of Encore Boston Harbor. 
Moving on to 1 more topic. This is a new 1 for us. There's been a lot going on in the gaming world concerning sports betting, and in particular, online sports betting. We've been very focused on this topic for the last couple of years but we've been admittedly quiet about it. In 2019, working with Craig Billings, who is helping me run this effort. We decided that we wanted to focus on product first. So how can we have the best product because that is who we are when it comes to sports betting, online sports betting. We scoured the earth, and we found a company in the U.K. called Betbull. And the founders and the operators of that company we had a great cultural fit. They were the founders of Bwin and party and understand this intimately. And they built a product in the U.K. that was really very social. So the engagement that they had with their customers was quite extraordinary. And therefore, their KPIs were really, really good. So when you see your friend making a bet, it will pop up on your phone. Do you want to follow your friend? It's very parly heavy. It moves you into chat rooms quickly. It's fun. It's a lot of fun. And their user acquisition cost in the U.K. and their LTVs were quite attractive relative to industry standards. 
So we made an investment in that company in 2019 and began working on a U.S. rollout with them. We then move forward, and we acquired that company. We own 70% of that company now, and they are fully integrated in. We have 150 people inside Wynn Interactive and we've begun our U.S. rollout. 
So quietly, but we'll -- we can talk about it. We have signed market access deals in the United States in 9 states. That represents about 25% of the total addressable market. I think a lot of the analysts on this call say that that's roughly $20 billion to $30 billion. So we already have access to 25% of that, and we're in very active dialogue, definitive documentation, in many cases, on 7 additional states, which represents another 1/3 of that market. 
So the way that we're going, we think that we'll have more than half of the total addressable market through market access deals underway and in Wynn Interactive and in fairly short order. We have launched Wynn bet, our product in New Jersey. We're learning a lot as we have product releases every 2 weeks. And so far, and Craig will talk a little bit more about this. Our CPAs are quite good, and it's encouraging what we're seeing. So we will be rolling out this product in the various markets where we have access, and it's something that we have a lot of focus on. 
We've invested $80 million within -- into that company to focus on user acquisition and continued development over the next few months, and we've had lots and lots of interest from various people wanting to co-invest, wanting to be a part of it. And what I've been focused on, along with Craig is we're going to build an amazing product and have a real business opportunity and roll it out. And that's where we are and feel very good that while currently, Wynn interactive does roughly $20 million in revenue. That number is going to grow at an exponential rate as we move forward. 
So with that, I think I'll go ahead and open it up to Craig to talk a little bit more about the quarter."

I'd like to start with a few points on liquidity and operating expenses. As of October 31, our global cash and liquidity position was over $3.4 billion, providing us with significant runway to weather the pandemic. In Macau, we had approximately $2.2 billion of available liquidity as of October 31. In the U.S., we had total available liquidity of approximately $1.2 billion on October 31 with substantially lower domestic daily cash burn as demand has started to return to each of our markets. Meanwhile, we continue to be very focused on operating expense. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, our global FTE count has decreased by nearly 7,500 or 30%, and our global payroll and non-variable expenses have declined by nearly $200 million or 34%, leading to consolidated OpEx per day, inclusive of corporate and exclusive of gaming taxes of $4.8 million compared to $7.6 million in Q4 '19. 
While these are often difficult decisions, many of the changes we made to achieve these decreases are permanent and will drive operating leverage as business volumes return. It's important to note that the 3Q OpEx numbers I just mentioned, and those that I will mention throughout my remarks exclude the benefit of a reversal of certain payroll and incentive accruals totaling approximately $50 million, which are reflected in our earnings release. 
In Macau, as Matt noted, we have been encouraged by performance during October as we delivered positive normalized EBITDA during the month, driven by solid gaming and non-gaming performance as well as a continued focus on cost control. Gross gaming revenue per day in October was approximately 33% Q4 2019, with premium mass strengthening into the later portion of the month. 
With respect to cost controls, our OpEx, again, excluding gaming taxes and excluding the reversal of certain performance-based incentives, accruals in the third quarter was approximately $2 million. This is down from approximately $3 million in Q4 '19. 
At Wynn Las Vegas, we generated $20.3 million of adjusted property EBITDA or approximately $28 million adjusted for lower than normal hold from a business that is heavily weighted to weakened occupancy. 
In the casino, we saw broad-based strength across key segments with both table drop handle reaching 78% of Q4 2019 levels during the quarter. We remain focused on cost discipline in Las Vegas with our OpEx per day, excluding gaming taxes and excluding the reversal of those performance-based incentive accruals decreasing to $1.8 million per day in Q3 2020 from $3 million per day in Q4 2019. 
In this environment of suppressed group demand, we expect recent trends to generally continue throughout Q1 '21. We believe the combination of meaningful permanent cost saves, along with increased group demand position us well to accelerate our recovery as we move into the back half of 2021. 
In Boston, we reopened in July with a number of safety-related operating restrictions in place. As Matt mentioned, our reopening plan there was focused on operating only those amenities that support the casino. Overall, we have seen encouraging trends in the casino, particularly in slots with handle per day operating day up approximately 5% versus Q4 '19. Similar to Las Vegas, we made a number of operating and staffing adjustments, resulting in daily OpEx down from Q4 2019 by approximately 40% to approximately $750,000 per day in 3Q 2020. 
Our CapEx in the quarter was $69 million. As noted last quarter, the vast majority of our CapEx plans remain on hold, and we are only proceeding with the highest priority projects. Finally, in October, we entered into a series of transactions, resulting in the creation of Wynn Interactive through the merger of Betbull, our strategic partner for digital gaming and several wind owned entities. I'd like to welcome the Betbull team to the Wynn family. This new subsidiary when interactive is 71% owned by Wynn Resorts and positions us well to advance our sports betting and online casino business during 2021. 
Wynn bet, our sports betting and online casino application has been live in New Jersey for several months. And while it's early days, initial returns on our user acquisition spend have been encouraging. Over the next 2 quarters, we anticipate going live in Colorado, Michigan and Indiana. We have posted a series of slides on our IR website, further outlining the Wynn interactive business. We're excited to tell you more about that business as it develops in 2021. 
With that, we'll now open up the call to Q&A.

We feel very, very good about our position, in particular, on the premium mass side, over the next couple of years. We have the right product. As far as junkets, again, lots of conversation about junkets, that business is not dead as some people like to say. We saw -- get back to 25% to 30% of its previous levels. I believe it will continue to consolidate with some of the largest operators, and we will continue to participate in it. So I don't anticipate that the junket business will be back to 2019 levels because it is consolidating and it is shrinking. But the Macau market overall is very well positioned to be one of the top tourist destinations in Asia over the next 3 years."

So we think those OpEx levels are reflective of the current environment and certainly sustainable for the near term, particularly with the adjusted hours at Encore Las Vegas. In Macau, we saw a modest increase in variable expenses per day as business volumes returned in October. OpEx was up a little over 10% compared to the $2 million per day I mentioned in Q3, again, adjusting for those accrual reversals. Of course, that compares to revenues that were up a lot more than that, which is why we were EBITDA positive. Over time, a good chunk of the cost saves that we have implemented will be retained. And that's particularly true in the U.S., where I think we've -- we're actually running our businesses differently while maintaining the appropriate level of brand standards.

And I think we're really well positioned, given that the overall crowds or customers will likely be less. I don't think will Macau be getting back to 100,000 people a day in the short term. So focusing on the higher end in the premium segment, which is where we are, I think will actually be an advantage in terms of our EBITDA and EBITDA share in the market."

We intend to leverage the land-based assets that we can bring to bear to be competitive. At the same time, every 2 weeks as we're putting out a release, we're going to make our product better and better and make it befitting of Wynn standards, and we think that, that will drive an outsized customer lifetime value. And so if you can drive a higher LTV and you can drive a lower CPA, you can scale a business like this, and we intend to do so. With respect to NASCAR, we have a long history with NASCAR, actually, we've hosted them a number of times at Wynn Las Vegas in the group and convention business. We have a tremendous amount of respect for them as an organization, and we were delighted to partner with them in pursuit of a license in Virginia.

I'm sure everybody is glued to the television watching these exciting election results right now. So we'll just -- we'll get right into it on our results here.  I'd like to start in Macau. So",1994,"Thanks, Craig, and thank you for joining us today, everyone. I'm sure everybody is glued to the television watching these exciting election results right now. So we'll just -- we'll get right into it on our results here.  
I'd like to start in Macau. So the third quarter in Macau was really very similar to the second. There wasn't a lot to talk about. We're still seeing roughly 8% to 10% of our visitor volumes compared to pre-COVID levels. And it was really -- there was just not a whole lot going on. But as everyone has been seeing, the government of Macau with its deliberate approach and steadfastness has been working very hard to continue to open Macau.  
Macau is probably one of the safest places on the planet, hasn't had COVID cases in months and months and months. And everyone there is really excited to see the progress that's going on. 
So as an example, in the month of August in Macau, our EBITDA line was negative $40 million because there's very low revenue, and we are carrying our cost.  
Our team is doing a great job saving money where we can, being more efficient while protecting the local employment and all of our employees.  
However, in October, we started to see those trends change. So we went from 10% of our normal visitor volumes, up to almost 30%. And it wasn't just over golden week. It was actually throughout the month. And in fact, I looked at our visitor data from November 2, 3 and 4 that went ballast before I walked in here. And we're seeing roughly 6,000 people a day come in the building, pre COVID, that number was 18,000.  
So those trends that we saw in early October are continuing into November. 
From a revenue standpoint in October, masked drop on our -- on the table side was roughly 40% of our pre-COVID levels. And on the junket side, which everyone has been talking about the junket business. What's going to happen to it? Is it going to survive? Where is it going to go?  
Clearly, it's changing. Clearly, it will be smaller even as we come through this than it was before, but it's still very real. We saw 30% -- roughly between 25% and 30% in turnover compared to our pre COVID levels in the junket space.  
So that activity produced actual positive EBITDA for us in October. So if you think about it, we went from a negative $40 million in August, which was normal, it was similar in July, et cetera, to a positive $6 million in October, quite a big swing. And what we are optimistic about in Macau is the way that everything has been handled there, it doesn't appear to be 1 step forward, 1 step backward, 1 step forward. It's been a very deliberate approach, very thoughtful. And it just feels like we are -- and the market is just going to continue to get better. I don't know at what speed. I don't know at what pace, but the overall mood, attitude and trajectory is quite good. In fact, looking at October at our sales, they were roughly flat with last year. And our top 5 stores in Macau were up 25% compared to last year. 
So there's real consumer -- pent-up consumer demand. And it's just going to take time for the market to continue to open, but we feel really good about the current trajectory that's going on there.  
Moving to North America. As we talked about on the last call, we are not going to sacrifice our brand or our culture to make an extra few dollars here or there. That means, while we have significantly less staff and approximately 7,400 less staff globally now that we did pre COVID, we are still operating at a 5-star level in Macau and in North America.  
We are focused on making sure we have the highest room rates in the market. But we've also been focusing on making sure that we continue to breakeven or make money. And in Las Vegas, we made $20 million in the third quarter, both adjusted closer to $28 million. 
Some of the things that are encouraging that we're seeing in Las Vegas is we are taking share in the casino segment. We're seeing new domestic customers that we've never seen before that previously were lifers at some of our competitors. And I think for all of the reasons that we've been laying out from our security protocols of checking everyone when they walk in, to our COVID protocols, to all of our restaurants being open. We're beginning to continue -- not beginning. We are taking market share on the casino side.  
Slots in the market were down over 33% during the quarter, and we were down 16%.
Table drop was down about 35% in the quarter, and we were down 25%. So we're just seeing more business. We're seeing higher end customers, not a lot, but we're seeing that we are gaining share on that front.  
In October in Las Vegas, we actually had our best month. We generated roughly $14 million of EBITDA in October. We had a little bit of cold luck in there, maybe $2 million. But overall, it was a very good month.  
Now as everyone on the call knows, Las Vegas has seasonality, and we're coming in to the slow time. So COVID cases are picking up in the U.S., obviously. And November, December, are quite slow in Las Vegas and have been heavily reliant on group.  
So our team -- well, so October will not be repeated in November and December. But it shows that when there is just a little bit of business with the way we've restructured our expense line, the amount of operating leverage that we have now revenue quickly converts into EBITDA. And our focus, as things do get a little slower during the winter, is to make sure that we stay EBITDA positive. That's what we're going to do in Las Vegas. And I would think it's hard to tell. But I think when Las Vegas probably was the most profitable integrated resort Casino on the strip or if not the most, it was definitely at the top of the list. 
So our strategy is working. We're maintaining our brand, we're maintaining our culture, and we're making a little bit of money.  
Moving to Boston. Encore Boston Harbor is really starting to hit its stride. So we generated roughly $26 million in EBITDA, significantly more than we ever have in the past during the quarter. And our team has really learned how to be a super regional operator. We focused during the shutdown on how to run Encore Boston Harbor differently than we were because clearly, what we were doing was not quite right. 
And so we've had a laser focus on the casino segment. And what it is that those customers want and how we're going to deliver it? And if you look at our results, slot handle per day, just overall volume per day was actually up over last year. It's pretty extraordinary. When you think about -- we had 1,800 slot machines opened during this third quarter compared to 3,000 last year and volume was higher on a daily basis. Win per unit was over $400 on 1,800 unit, I think, $407 compared to $219 million last year.  
So Encore Boston Harbor is really starting to understand how -- and we are starting to understand what that market is, how to market to those customers and how to monetize there? Massachusetts recently, just this week, announced that starting over the weekend, restaurants, bars, casinos, et cetera, will need to close, COVID related, starting at 9:30 at night. That's clearly a setback for us but it's very temporary. And I'm not sure it's the right thing to do from a health perspective. The government of Massachusetts has done a terrific job, throughout all of this, managing this from Governor Baker to the Massachusetts Gaming Commission. So we view it as a temporary setback, but it's really nothing that we're worried about. Because our business model is sound, and I think that we're going to continue to see increases in revenue and increases in EBITDA out of Encore Boston Harbor.  
Moving on to 1 more topic. This is a new one for us. There's been a lot going on in the gaming world concerning sports betting, and in particular, online sports betting. We've been very focused on this topic for the last couple of years but we've been admittedly quiet about it. In 2019, working with Craig Billings, who is helping me run this effort. We decided that we wanted to focus on product first. So how can we have the best product because that is who we are when it comes to sports betting, online sports betting. We scoured the earth, and we found a company in the U.K. called BetBull. And the founders and the operators of that company we had a great cultural fit. They were the founders of Bwin and Party and understand this intimately. And they built a product in the U.K. that was really very social. So the engagement that they had with their customers was quite extraordinary. And therefore, their KPIs were really, really good. 
So when you see your friend making a bet, it will pop up on your phone. Do you want to follow your friend? It's very parley heavy. It moves you into chat rooms quickly. It's fun. It's a lot of fun. And their user acquisition cost in the U.K. and their LTVs were quite attractive relative to industry standards.  
So we made an investment in that company in 2019 and began working on a U.S. rollout with them. We then moved forward, and we acquired that company. We own 70% of that company now, and they are fully integrated in. We have 150 people inside Wynn Interactive and we've begun our U.S. rollout.  
So quietly, but we'll -- we can talk about it. We have signed market access deals, in the United States, in 9 states. That represents about 25% of the total addressable market. I think a lot of the analysts on this call say that, that's roughly $20 billion to $30 billion. So we already have access to 25% of that, and we're in very active dialogue, definitive documentation, in many cases, on 7 additional states, which represents another 1/3 of that market.  
So the way that we're going, we think that we'll have more than half of the total addressable market through market access deals underway and in Wynn Interactive and in fairly short order. We have launched Wynn bet, our product in New Jersey. We're learning a lot as we have product releases every 2 weeks. And so far, and Craig will talk a little bit more about this. Our CPAs are quite good, and it's encouraging what we're seeing. 
So we will be rolling out this product in the various markets where we have access, and it's something that we have a lot of focus on. We've invested $80 million within -- into that company to focus on user acquisition and continued development over the next few months, and we've had lots and lots of interest from various people wanting to co-invest, wanting to be a part of it. And what I've been focused on, along with Craig is we're going to build an amazing product and have a real business opportunity and roll it out. And that's where we are and feel very good that while currently, Wynn interactive does roughly $20 million in revenue. That number is going to grow at an exponential rate as we move forward.  
So with that, I think I'll go ahead and open it up to Craig to talk a little bit more about the quarter."

I'd like to start with a few points on liquidity and operating expenses. As of October 31, our global cash and liquidity position was over $3.4 billion, providing us with significant runway to weather the pandemic. In Macau, we had approximately $2.2 billion of available liquidity as of October 31. In the U.S., we had total available liquidity of approximately $1.2 billion on October 31 with substantially lower domestic daily cash burn as demand has started to return to each of our markets. Meanwhile, we continue to be very focused on operating expense. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, our global FTE count has decreased by nearly 7,500 or 30%, and our global payroll and non-variable expenses have declined by nearly $200 million or 34%, leading to consolidated OpEx per day, inclusive of corporate and exclusive of gaming taxes of $4.8 million compared to $7.6 million in Q4 '19.  
While these are often difficult decisions, many of the changes we made to achieve these decreases are permanent and will drive operating leverage as business volumes return. It's important to note that the 3Q OpEx numbers I just mentioned, and those that I will mention throughout my remarks exclude the benefit of a reversal of certain payroll and incentive accruals totaling approximately $50 million, which are reflected in our earnings release.  
In Macau, as Matt noted, we have been encouraged by performance during October as we delivered positive normalized EBITDA during the month, driven by solid gaming and non-gaming performance as well as a continued focus on cost control. Gross gaming revenue per day in October was approximately 33% Q4 2019, with premium mass strengthening into the later portion of the month.  
With respect to cost controls, our OpEx, again, excluding gaming taxes and excluding the reversal of certain performance-based incentives, accruals in the third quarter was approximately $2 million. This is down from approximately $3 million in Q4 '19.  
At Wynn Las Vegas, we generated $20.3 million of adjusted property EBITDA or approximately $28 million adjusted for lower than normal hold from a business that is heavily weighted to weakened occupancy.  
In the casino, we saw broad-based strength across key segments with both table drop handle reaching 78% of Q4 2019 levels during the quarter. We remain focused on cost discipline in Las Vegas with our OpEx per day, excluding gaming taxes and excluding the reversal of those performance-based incentive accruals decreasing to $1.8 million per day in Q3 2020 from $3 million per day in Q4, 2019.  
In this environment of suppressed group demand, we expect recent trends to generally continue throughout Q1 '21. We believe the combination of meaningful permanent cost saves, along with increased group demand position us well to accelerate our recovery as we move into the back half of 2021.  
In Boston, we reopened in July with a number of safety-related operating restrictions in place. As Matt mentioned, our reopening plan there was focused on operating only those amenities that support the casino. Overall, we have seen encouraging trends in the casino, particularly in slots with handle per day operating day up approximately 5% versus Q4 '19. Similar to Las Vegas, we made a number of operating and staffing adjustments, resulting in daily OpEx down from Q4 2019 by approximately 40% to approximately $750,000 per day in 3Q, 2020.  
Our CapEx in the quarter was $69 million. As noted last quarter, the vast majority of our CapEx plans remain on hold, and we are only proceeding with the highest priority projects. Finally, in October, we entered into a series of transactions, resulting in the creation of Wynn Interactive through the merger of BetBull, our strategic partner for digital gaming and several Wynn owned entities. I'd like to welcome the BetBull team to the Wynn family. This new subsidiary when interactive is 71% owned by Wynn Resorts and positions us well to advance our sports betting and online casino business during 2021.  
WynnBET, our sports betting and online casino application has been live in New Jersey for several months. And while it's early days, initial returns on our user acquisition spend have been encouraging. Over the next 2 quarters, we anticipate going live in Colorado, Michigan and Indiana. We have posted a series of slides on our IR website, further outlining the Wynn interactive business. We're excited to tell you more about that business as it develops in 2021.  
With that, we'll now open up the call to Q&A."

We feel very, very good about our position, in particular, on the premium mass side, over the next couple of years. We have the right product. As far as junkets, again, lots of conversation about junkets, that business is not dead as some people like to say. We saw -- get back to 25% to 30% of its previous levels. I believe it will continue to consolidate with some of the largest operators, and we will continue to participate in it. So I don't anticipate that the junket business will be back to 2019 levels because it is consolidating and it is shrinking.

In the U.S., both properties Q3 OpEx was pretty consistent from reopening through October, once you adjust for those accrual reversals that I mentioned. So we think those OpEx levels are reflective of the current environment and certainly sustainable for the near term, particularly with the adjusted hours at Encore Las Vegas. In Macau, we saw a modest increase in variable expenses per day as business volumes returned in October. OpEx was up a little over 10% compared to the $2 million per day I mentioned in Q3, again, adjusting for those accrual reversals. Of course, that compares to revenues that were up a lot more than that, which is why we were EBITDA positive. Over time, a good chunk of the cost saves that we have implemented will be retained. And that's particularly true in the U.S., where I think we've -- we're actually running our businesses differently while maintaining the appropriate level of brand standards. So it's a little early to give you guidance on what portion will come back, but a significant chunk will stay out of the business, and that's how we'll drive operating leverage as the business returns."

And I think we're really well positioned, given that the overall crowds or customers will likely be less. I don't think will Macau be getting back to 100,000 people a day in the short term.

So we think there's a lot of opportunity for us in i-casino. On the customer acquisition side, the brand provides a distinct competitive advantage. I think that's true for some of our peers as well, but that's particularly true for us given the national recognition and premium nature of our brand. So we think that's an acquisition advantage. On the sports side, we've obviously operated our own sports book for many, many years. We understand trading. We understand what excites the customer and where the market is, and we are working with the team and the BetBull team that understands that as well as we do. So in terms of database overlap, I mean that's not going to be enough to scale any digital sports betting business, to be honest. You have to understand what the customer wants, you have to build a product to it and you have to scale into that. And that's what we're in the early stages of doing in New Jersey."

And we've partnered with a really strong group out of New York, on top of a hospital here. It's under construction now it's not a lot of money. It's a couple of million dollars, but we will be able to facilitate thousands and thousands and thousands of saliva-based tests with -- that can be distributed throughout the property and turned around within 5 to 6 hours, PCR. We're not talking antibody or antigen test here. With sensitivity rates and the 98% specificity rates over 99%. So the gold standard in terms of testing. And what I've been talking to, are elected leaders about is this could be one of our opportunities as we get through this to get entertainment going again to get conventions going again, that we'll be able to test thousands of people in a very short period of time, so that they can be together. 
We will be creating safe zones throughout our property, not for the whole property, but any place like a theater or in a convention, where we want to get more people together than 50 or 250. So that's underway. The team is being built. It will be finished this year. And the best thing would be if we never have to use it. But I'm not sitting around hoping that, that will be a good strategy. We're going to be ready, and we'll be the first ones -- really probably the first ones in the U.S. to do something like that. 
And a lot of people are paying attention to it, and I think it's going to be a good blueprint to help get Las Vegas back."
