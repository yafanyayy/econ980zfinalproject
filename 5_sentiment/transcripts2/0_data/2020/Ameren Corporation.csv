Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This morning, I'm going to kick off our presentation by summarizing our team's strong 2019 financial and operating performance as well as highlight some of our key accomplishments that will position Ameren for success in the future. Importantly, I will then look ahead and discuss how we plan to continue delivering superior long-term value in 2020 and beyond to our customers, communities and shareholders. I'll then turn it over to Michael to discuss key drivers of our 2019 earnings results and 2020 earnings guidance as well as some key regulatory matters. And as always, we will turn it over to you for Q&A after our remarks. 
Before I jump into the details of our accomplishments and strategic areas of focus, I want to reiterate the strategy that has been delivering significant long-term value to all of our stakeholders. Specifically, our strategy is to invest in a robust pipeline of rate-regulated energy infrastructure, continuously improving operating performance and advocate for responsible energy policies to deliver superior value to our customers and shareholders. As always, our customers continue to be at the center of our strategy. As a result, we are focused on meeting our customers' energy needs and exceeding their expectations. And in so doing, delivering on our shareholders' expectations for sustainable and strong long-term earnings per share and dividend growth. 
Our customers' expectations include providing them with safe, reliable and affordable service. They want new tools, products and services to enhance their interactions with us and to better manage their energy usage. And our customers also want us to continue to be forward-thinking when it comes to environmental, social and governance matters. I'm pleased to say that our actions and performance in 2019 as well as our strategic areas of focus for the future are aligned with our customers' and shareholders' expectations, which brings me to a discussion of our 2019 performance. 
As I said earlier, we delivered strong financial and operational performance in 2019. Earlier today, we announced 2019 earnings of $3.35 per share compared to core earnings of $3.37 per share earned in [ 2018 ]. Excluding the impact from weather, 2019 normalized earnings increased to $3.32 per share or approximately 9% from 2018's normalized base of $3.05 per share. With our customers and shareholders' expectations in mind, we made $2.4 billion of infrastructure investments in 2019 that resulted in a more reliable, resilient, secure and cleaner energy grid as well as contributed to strong rate base growth at all of our business segments. Consistent with these objectives, we successfully completed several important projects in 2019. I'm sure that you're familiar with some of the more notable projects on this slide, as we've discussed them with you throughout 2019. 
I also want to congratulate our Callaway Energy Center for receiving an exemplary rating from the World Association of Nuclear Operators in 2019. It was a great team effort that demonstrates our focus on operational excellence. In 2019, we also achieved constructive outcomes in several regulatory proceedings that will help drive additional infrastructure investments that will benefit customers and shareholders while keeping our customer rates affordable. Those constructive regulatory outcomes are outlined on this slide. 
We're also able to obtain regulatory approvals in 2019 of our planned acquisition of 700 megawatts of wind generation, along with several other innovative programs such as Charge Ahead and Community Solar, which will drive incremental investments in electric vehicle charging stations and renewable energy. Further, we continue to deliver robust energy efficiency programs for our customers. All of these programs are consistent with our ESG initiatives to bring cleaner energy and innovative solutions to the grid and our customers. The bottom line is that we successfully executed our strategy in 2019, which will have significant long-term value for all of our stakeholders. 
Turning to Page 5. As you can see on this page, our laser focus on executing this strategy for the last several years has delivered strong results. From our customer standpoint, our investments in infrastructure have improved reliability while, at the same time, our disciplined management of costs have kept our electric rates among the lowest in the country. Not surprisingly, these factors have also driven higher customer satisfaction scores. 
We've also delivered superior value to our shareholders, as you can see on Slide 6. Our weather-normalized core earnings per share has risen 60% or an approximately 8% compound annual growth rate since 2013, while our dividend has increased 20% over the same time period. This has resulted in a significant reduction in our weather-normalized dividend payout ratio from over 77% in 2013 to 58% in 2019, near the bottom of our 55% to 70% targeted dividend payout range, position us well for continued strong infrastructure investment and rate base growth as well as future dividend growth. I want to express my appreciation to all of our coworkers who have been relentlessly focused on executing our strategy over the last several years. Their actions are clearly consistent with our mission to power the quality of life. 
While I'm very pleased with our performance over the last several years, we are not sitting back and taking a deep breath. We will remain focused on accelerating and enhancing our performance in 2020 and in the years ahead, which brings me to Slide 7. 
Earlier this morning, we also announced that we expect our 2020 earnings to be in the range of $3.40 to $3.60 per share. Michael will provide you with more details on our 2020 guidance a bit later. 
Building on our robust earnings growth over the past several years, I am pleased to say we continue to expect to deliver long-term earnings growth that is among the best in the industry. Today, we affirm our expected 6% to 8% compound annual earnings per share growth rate from [ 2019 ] through 2023 issued last February. In addition, we expect to deliver 6% to 8% compound annual earnings per share growth from 2020 through 2024, using the midpoint of our 2020 guidance, $3.50 per share, as the base. Our long-term earnings growth will be driven by continued execution of our strategy, including investing in infrastructure for the benefit of our customers while keeping rates affordable. This outlook accommodates several factors, including a range of treasury rates, sales growth, spending levels and regulatory developments. And of course, earnings growth in any individual year will be impacted by the timing of capital expenditures, regulatory rate reviews and weather, among other factors. 
Turning to Page 8. The first pillar of our strategy stresses investing in and operating our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. The strong earnings growth I just discussed is primarily driven by our rate base growth outlook. Today, we are rolling forward our 5-year investment plan. And as you can see, we expect to grow our rate base in an approximately 9% compound annual rate for the 2019 through 2024 period. This growth is driven by a robust capital plan of $16 billion over the next 5 years that will deliver significant value to our customers and the communities we serve. Our plan also includes strategically allocating significant capital to all 4 of our business segments. 
Finally, we remain relentlessly focused on disciplined cost management to earn as close to our allowable returns as possible in all of our businesses. 
Moving now to Page 9. This morning, Ameren Missouri filed its updated smart energy plan with the Missouri Public Service Commission, which includes a status update for 2019 and a capital investment plan for 2020 through 2024. Ameren Missouri is making significant investments to modernize the energy grid and enhance how customers receive and consume energy. In 2019, Ameren Missouri invested $1 billion under the plan of more than 900 projects that are already delivering value to our customers. Some examples of the important projects undertaken in 2019 is shown on this slide. 
Our work in 2019 was just the beginning, and the pipeline for investment remains robust. The $7.6 billion updated smart energy plan filing today includes investments focused on improvements and upgrades to modernize the energy grid as well as our approximately $1.2 billion wind generation investment. 
In 2020, we will also begin the deployment of 1 million smart meters over the next 5 years, which will provide more visibility and choices for our customers to control their energy usage. We look forward to working with the Missouri PSC and other key stakeholders as we implement the second year of the smart energy plan and continue to provide benefits to customers while we transform the image grid of today to build a brighter energy future for generations to come as well as create significant jobs. 
Moving to Page 10 for an update on Ameren Missouri's pending electric rate review. I am pleased to report that as a result of extensive collaboration, all the major parties participating in this rate review, Ameren Missouri, the staff of the Missouri PSC, the Office of Public Counsel, industrial consumer groups and others, recently reached an agreement in principle of nearly all the issues in this case. As a result, we expect non-unanimous stipulation and agreement to be filed with the Missouri PSC this week, with the request that the agreement be approved by the Commission. At this point, the terms of the agreement in principle are confidential. This page outlines the remaining open items, which will be taken to hearings in early March. Specifically, we will defend the current sharing ratio for the fuel adjustment clause, which we have successfully defended since 2009. In addition, we will strongly defend the recovery of all of our affiliate transaction costs and investments and expenses related to our coal-fired energy centers. We look forward to presenting our views to Missouri PSC. 
Turning now to Page 11. Next, I want to cover the second pillar of our strategy: enhancing regulatory frameworks and advocating for responsible energy and economic policies. Beginning with Ameren Illinois electric distribution, downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act legislation was filed recently. This important legislation would allow Ameren Illinois to make significant investments at lower cost solar energy and battery storage to improve reliability as well as in transportation electrification in order to benefit customers in the economy across Central and Southern Illinois. The Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act would also extend electric formula ratemaking through 2032 and builds on Ameren Illinois' efforts to modernize the energy grid under a transparent and stable regulatory framework that has supported significant investment to modernize the energy grid, while improving reliability and created approximately 1,400 jobs, all while keeping rates well below the Midwest and national averages. In addition, this legislation will modify the allowed turn on equity formula to increase the basis point adder to the average 30-year treasury rate from 5 80 to 6 80 and set an ROE cap at no more than 50 basis points above the national average for electric utility ROEs. This bill will move the state of Illinois closer to reaching its goal of 100% clean energy by 2050 and is a great example of how Ameren Illinois is supporting our ESG initiatives to bring cleaner energy to our customers. With all these benefits in mind, we are focused on working with key stakeholders to get this important legislation passed this year. 
Turning to Page 12. Earlier this month, the Missouri PSC approved the unanimous stipulation and agreement that allows the expenses for Callaway Energy Center refueling and maintenance outages to be deferred and amortized over approximately 18 months, beginning with our fall 2020 outage. This change will allow the timing of expense recognition associated with these outages to more closely align with the timing of related revenue recognition, starting with our fall outage this year. 
Moving on to FERC regulatory matters. Ameren, along with other MISO transmission owners, EEI and many other parties, requested a rehearing of FERC's November 2019 order related to the MISO ROE complaint cases. From an overall policy perspective, we believe FERC's order is inconsistent with this long-standing policy to incentivize transmission investment, particularly at a time when meaningful investments were needed for reliability and to enable the nation to continue to transition to cleaner and more diverse generation sources. Strong agreements were presented by several parties, and we are pleased that the FERC issued an order extending the time to consider the rehearing requests. We look forward to addressing this important matter with the FERC in the months ahead. It should be noted that FERC has no set time line to address this matter. And of course, we can't predict the timing and ultimate outcome of these proceedings. 
Moving now to Page 13 for an update on our wind generation investment plans to achieve compliance with Missouri's renewable energy standard and continue to transition our generation portfolio to benefit our customers, the communities we serve and the environment. 
As I discussed earlier, we received regulatory approvals from the Missouri PSC in 2019 to acquire 700 megawatts of new wind generation at 2 sites in Missouri. We expect our investment in these projects to be approximately $1.2 billion, which is included in the 5-year capital expenditure and rate base growth plans we laid out today. Both facilities will be significant additions to our renewable energy portfolio, and importantly, help us continue our transition to a cleaner and more diverse generation portfolio in a responsible fashion. Construction is well underway at both sites. Of course, we continue to work closely with the developers for both projects to monitor the time of the manufacturing and shipment of certain facility components coming from China, due to the potential for issues associated with the coronavirus. At this time, both projects remain on schedule to be in service by the end of 2020, and we expect to see meaningful contributions to earnings in 2021 from these investments. 
I would now like to provide an update on the Renewable Choice Program. As you may recall, the Renewable Choice Program enables Ameren Missouri to provide certain commercial, industrial and municipal customers with up to 400 megawatts of wind generation to meet their energy needs. Under this program, we can own 200 megawatts of this wind generation. Over the last several months, we've been working to meet our customers' top priorities for the program, including prices competitive with existing rates, long-term price predictability and for renewable power generated in Missouri. To date, we have not been able to put together a project that effectively meets the needs of our customers who have expressed an interest in this program. Given that our customers are at the center of our strategy, we remain focused on finding solutions to best meet their needs and expectations. For example, we're exploring the possibility of allowing solar projects to qualify under this program given our success with similar programs for our residential customers. This and certain other modifications to the program could require Missouri PSC approval. The bottom line is that we will continue to relentlessly work with our customers and the Missouri PSC, as needed, to design and develop projects to best serve our customers' needs. We will keep you posted on developments associated with this program. 
Finally, consistent with our goal to meet our customers' long-term energy needs, we will assess additional renewable generation opportunities in the context of our next comprehensive integrated resource plan, which is expected to be filed in September of this year. This comprehensive stakeholder process is well underway to evaluate our future customer demand as well as the existing and new generation needs over the next 20 years and beyond. We are excited about working with key stakeholders in this process and are committed to transitioning Ameren Missouri's generation to a cleaner, more diverse portfolio in a responsible fashion for the environment, our customers and our shareholders. 
Turning now to Page 14. As we look to the future, the successful execution of our 5-year plan is not only focused on delivering strong results through 2024, but is also designed to position Ameren for success over the next decade and beyond. We believe that a safe, reliable, resilient and secure energy grid will be increasingly important and bring even greater value to our customers, our communities and shareholders. With this long-term view in mind, we are making investments that will position Ameren to meet our customers' future energy needs and rising expectations, support increased electrification of the transportation sector and other industrial processes and provide safe and reliable natural gas services. 
The right side of this page shows that our allocation of capital is expected to grow our energy delivery investments to nearly 80% of our rate base by the end of 2024. As a result of Ameren Missouri's investment in 700 megawatts of wind, combined with the scheduled retirement of the Meramec coal-fired energy center in 2022, we expect coal-fired generation to decline to just 8% of rate base by year-end 2024. These steps are consistent with our goals to reduce carbon emissions by at least 80%, low 2005 levels, by 2015. These actions are just some more examples of the actions we are taking to address our customers' and shareholders' focus on ESG matters. The bottom line is that we are taking steps today across the board to position Ameren for success in 2020 and beyond. 
Moving to Page 15. Looking ahead through the end of this decade, we will remain focused on delivering superior long-term value to our customers. In addition to our robust $16 billion 5-year capital plan in years 2025 through 2029, we foresee a strong pipeline of additional investment opportunities of at least $20 billion that will deliver significant value to all of our stakeholders. These projects will be consistent with the Missouri smart energy plan as well as Illinois' Modernization action plan, both of which were designed to make our energy grid stronger, smarter and cleaner. We also plan to continue to bolster our nation's transmission infrastructure to enhance reliability and support greater levels of renewable generation on the grid. 
And speaking of renewable generation, our current plan reflects 700 megawatts of wind generation and 100 megawatts of solar generation over the next decade. As I noted previously, we will be filing our integrated resource plan in Missouri in September. In that plan, we will take a close look at additional renewable generation opportunities that will help us transition to an even cleaner and more diverse portfolio in a responsible fashion and deliver significant long-term benefits to our customers. Of course, these investments will not only create a stronger and cleaner energy grid to meet our customers' needs and exceed their expectations, but they will also create thousands of jobs for our local economies. Our ability to make these critical infrastructure investments has been facilitated by constructive state and federal energy policies across all of our businesses. Maintaining constructive energy policies, which support robust investment in energy infrastructure will be critical to meeting our customers' future energy needs and delivering on our customers' expectations. 
Moving to Page 16. To sum up our value proposition, we remain firmly convinced that the execution of our strategy in 2020 and over the next decade will deliver superior value to our customers, shareholders and the environment. We believe the expectation of a 6% to 8% earnings per share compound annual growth rate from 2020 through 2024 driven by strong rate base growth compares very favorably with our regulated utility peers. I am confident in our ability to execute our investment plans and strategies across all 4 of our business segments, as we have an experienced and dedicated team to get it done. That back, coupled with our sustained past execution of our strategy on many fronts, has positioned us well for future success. 
Further, our shares continue to offer investors a solid dividend. In the fourth quarter of last year, Ameren's Board of Directors expressed its confidence in our long-term growth plan by increasing the dividend by approximately 4%, the sixth consecutive year with a dividend increase. Our strong earnings growth expectations outlined today positions us well for future dividend growth. Of course, future dividend decisions will be driven by earnings growth, in addition to cash flows and other business conditions. Together, we believe our strong earnings growth outlook, combined with our solid dividend, results in a very attractive total return opportunity for shareholders. 
Again, thank you all for joining us today, and I'll now turn the call over to Michael. Michael?"
373264,651878665,1921956,"Ameren Corporation, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2020",2020-02-26,"Earnings Calls","Ameren Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Warner, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 18 of our presentation. Today, we reported 2019 core earnings of $3.35 per share compared to core earnings of $3.37 per share in 2018. Ameren Missouri, our largest segment, experienced a decr",1539,"Thanks, Warner, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 18 of our presentation. Today, we reported 2019 core earnings of $3.35 per share compared to core earnings of $3.37 per share in 2018. Ameren Missouri, our largest segment, experienced a decrease of $0.24 per share from $1.98 per share in 2018 to $1.74 per share in 2019. This decrease was largely due to lower electric retail sales, driven by weather, which reduced earnings by approximately $0.26 per share. 
In 2019, we experienced near-normal summer and winter temperatures compared to warmer summer and colder winter temperatures in the year-ago period. Ameren reserves results also reflected this year's scheduled refueling outage in our Callaway Energy Center, which reduced earnings by $0.09 per share compared to 2018 when there was no refueling outage. The next Callaway refueling is scheduled for the fall of 2020. 
Higher property tax has also reduced earnings by $0.05 per share in 2019 when compared to 2018. These items were partially offset by the positive comparative impacts related to EMEA performance incentives, which contributed $0.08 per share, in addition to lower other operations and maintenance expenses. 
Turning to the other segments. Ameren transmission earnings were up $0.08, which reflected increased infrastructure investments. Earnings for Ameren Illinois natural gas were up $0.05, which reflected higher rates effective in November [ 2018 ] and increased infrastructure investments. In addition, Ameren Illinois electric distribution earnings were up $0.02 due to increased investments, mostly offset by a lower allowed return on equity under formulaic rate making of 8.4% compared to 8.9% for the prior year. 
The 2019 allowed ROE is based on a 2019 average 30-year treasury yield of approximately 2.6%, down from the 2018 average of 3.1%. Ameren Parent & Other results reflected higher tax benefits, primarily associated with share-based compensation and charitable donations returning to more normal levels. 
Before moving on, let me briefly cover electric sales trends for Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois electric distribution for 2019 compared to 2018. Weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales to Missouri residential and commercial customers on a combined basis were up a little over 0.5%, excluding the effects of the Missouri energy efficiency plan in EMEA. Sales to low-margin Missouri industrial customers decreased about 4%, excluding the effects of our energy efficiency plan. We exclude the FX because the plan provides rate recovery to ensure that earnings are not affected by reduced electric sales resulting from our energy efficiency efforts. Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to resident, Illinois residential and commercial customers on a combined basis decreased 1.5%, and sales to industrial customers decreased 2%. Recall that changes in electric sales in Illinois, no matter the cause, do not affect earnings since we have full revenue decoupling. 
Moving to Page 19 of the presentation. Here, we provide an overview of our $16 billion of planned capital expenditures for the 2020 through 2024 period by business segment. That underlines the approximately 9% projected rate base growth Warner discussed earlier. This plan includes an incremental $2.7 billion compared to the $13.3 billion 5-year plan for 2019 through 2023 that was laid out last February. 
Turning to Page 20. We outlined here the expected funding sources for the infrastructure investments noted on the prior page. We expect continued growth in cash from operations as investments are reflected in customer rates. We also expect to generate significant tax deferrals. The tax deferrals are driven primarily by timing differences between financial statement depreciation reflected in customer rates and accelerated depreciation for tax purposes under makers. 
I should note that over the 5-year time horizon of our plan, we expect to make income tax and payments totaling $150 million to $200 million over our 5-year plan. In addition to the benefits of accelerated tax depreciation as a result of our expected $1.2 billion investment and 700 megawatts of wind generation, we expect to begin generating production tax credits over this period. 
From a financing perspective, we expect to continue to issue long-term debt at Ameren Parent, Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois to refinance the maturing obligations and to fund a portion of our cash requirements. We also plan to continue to use newly issued shares from our dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans over the 5-year guidance period. We expect this to provide equity funding of approximately $100 million annually. Our plan also includes the settlement of the forward equity contract in 2020 to generate between $540 million and $550 million to fund, in part, Ameren Missouri's wind generation investment by the end of that year. In order for us to maintain a strong balance sheet while we fund our robust infrastructure plan, we expect incremental equity issuances of approximately $150 million a year starting in 2021. All of these actions are expected to enable us to maintain a consolidated capitalization target of approximately 45% equity. 
Moving to Page 21 of our presentation. I would now like to discuss key drivers impacting our 2020 earnings guidance. As Warner stated, we expect 2020 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.40 to $3.60 per share. On this page and the next, we have listed key earnings drivers of, and assumptions behind, our 2020 earnings guidance, broken down by segment and compared to the 2019 results. 
Beginning with Ameren Missouri, earnings are expected to rise in 2020 [indiscernible] are expected to be favorably affected by the electric service rates that are expected to be effective as of April -- as early as April 1. In addition, we also expect deferral expenses for the fall 2020 scheduled Callaway refueling and maintenance outage to increase earnings by approximately $0.08 per share compared to the spring 2019 outage. Our expenses will be deferred and amortized over approximately 18 months after completion. Partially offsetting these favorable earnings drivers, we expect lower energy efficiency performance incentives in 2020 of approximately $0.09. 
Finally, at Ameren Missouri, we expect the 700-megawatt wind generation investment by the end of 2020 to not have a material impact on 2020 earnings. Ameren transmission earnings are expected to benefit from additional investments in Ameren Illinois and ATXI projects made under FERC's formula ratemaking. Our guidance assumes the current 10.38% FERC-allowed ROE for the full year of 2020, which includes a 50 basis point adder for the MISO participation, except for the Mark Twain project, which assumes an allowed ROE of 10.88%. 
Turning to Page 22. For Ameren Illinois electric distribution, we anticipate increased earnings in 2020 compared to 2019 from additional infrastructure investments made under Illinois formula ratemaking. Our guidance incorporates a formula-based ROE of 8% using a forecasted 2.2% 2020 average yield for the 30-year treasury bond, which is lower than the allowed ROE of 8.4% in 2019. 
For Ameren Illinois natural gas distribution earnings, we expect to benefit from qualified investments that are included in rates on a timely basis under the state's gas infrastructure rider. 
Moving now to Ameren wide drivers and assumptions. We expect lower tax benefits associated with share-based compensation in 2020 compared to 2019. In addition, the increased number of shares outstanding as a result of issuance under our dividend reinvestment employee benefits plans are expected to unfavorably impact earnings by $0.02 per share. 
I would also like to take a moment to discuss our electric sales outlook. We expect weather-normalized Missouri kilowatt hour sales to customers to be up approximately 0.5% compounded annually over our 5-year plan, excluding the effects of our EMEA energy efficiency plan. Again, we exclude EMEA because the plan provides rate recovery to ensure that earnings are not affected by reduced electric sales resulting from our energy efficiency efforts. 
Turning to Illinois. We expect our weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to customers, including energy efficiency, to be flat to down slightly over our 5-year plan. 
Turning to Page 23 and Ameren Illinois regulatory matters. In December, the ICC approved an electric distribution rate change consistent with our filing and our annual rate update proceeding, with new rates effective at the beginning of this year. In Ameren Illinois, to get natural gas regulatory matters, last week, we filed a request for $102 million annual increase in gas distribution rates using a 2021 future test year with the ICC. This $102 million included an estimated $46 million of annual revenues that would otherwise [ have ] recovered in 2021, under Ameren Illinois qualifying infrastructure plant and other riders. The details of this gas rate case filing are noted on this page. An ICC decision is required by January 2021, with new rates expected to be effective in February of 2021. 
Finally, turning to Page 24. We delivered strong earnings growth in 2019, and we expect to again deliver strong earnings growth in 2020 as we continue to successfully execute our strategy. As we look ahead, we expect strong 6% to 8% compound earnings per share growth from 2020 to 2024, driven by robust rate base growth and disciplined cost management. Further, we believe this growth will compare favorably with the growth of our regulated utility peers. And Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we have an attractive total shareholder return story that compares very favorable to our peers. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

We think it really has some really important elements in terms of trying to move Illinois to the clean energy future that they've been talking about, but also doing the things that we have been doing for the past 8 years, and that's modernizing the grid. 
So number one, one of the things in terms of trying to put some perspective on it. Clearly, the grid modernization efforts we talk a lot about those. And those are, in some respects, reflected back in the slide that we showed in terms of our 10-year outlook. Some of those dollars are certainly a mirror but I think right now, it's premature for us to put a specific number on the solar and energy storage opportunities or electrification. I think clearly, as you've seen us do in Missouri, we see the solar plus battery storage projects, and they have been really important to help reliability. Richard and his team in Illinois certainly see those same types of opportunities. 
And look, at electrification, I think, across the country, we're just scratching the surface in terms of what those opportunities can be. So I'd like to put something around that for you. But I think it's just a little early for us to do that. But clearly, we see this as an important opportunity for the state of Illinois and especially downstate Illinois."

Our execution of our strategy over the last several years has driven our dividend payout ratio down meaningfully to the lower end of our 55% to 70%. And so as a result, as you look ahead, there's no doubt that we have been allocating a great deal of capital to rate base growth. And as you see in this plan, we continue to do that. And we've had a solid dividend. And so as we look ahead, I think the fact that we've been able to bring the dividend payout ratio down [ ages ], it gives us greater flexibility with respect to capital allocation, including, from my perspective, position us well for future dividend growth."

The Senator signed on the house side, it is sponsors are representative with Greenwood and representative Hoffman. So when you step back and you look at the fundamental elements of this bill, this legislation, number one, it's very consistent with things that have been talked about in Illinois, really, for the past 12 months in terms of trying to put greater levels of investment for solar, for battery storage, electrification, these are all things which are consistent with the governor's package. So we think, as we've talked around with key stakeholders, these are important elements of any forward-thinking legislation, and so that's in this bill. 
Secondly, I think, over time, you have seen the modernization of the grid and the legislation associated with that, how that has received widespread support for all the right reasons. For reliability purposes for customer affordability purposes for job creation, all those things are really spelled robust support for that. 
When you put these 2 things together, we think this legislation has really the opportunity to gain broad-based support. Having said that, it's early in the session here. And so Richard and his team had done a fantastic job of educating key stakeholders, talking with many folks that are at the table, including those that are looking at other pieces of legislation. And so we're not done doing that. So I would say that a lot of these elements of this legislation are very consistent and much aligned with what key stakeholders want to see, but there's still more work to do. But we're pleased with where things are at today and look forward to engage with these folks in the future."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This morning, I'm going to kick off our presentation by summarizing our team's strong 2019 financial and operating performance as well as highlight some of our key accomplishments that will position Ameren for success in the future. Importantly, I will then look ahead and discuss how we plan to continue delivering superior long-term value in 2020 and beyond to our customers, communities and shareholders. I'll then turn it over to Michael to discuss key drivers of our 2019 earnings results and 2020 earnings guidance as well as some key regulatory matters. And as always, we will turn it over to you for Q&A after our remarks. 
Before I jump into the details of our accomplishments and strategic areas of focus, I want to reiterate the strategy that has been delivering significant long-term value to all of our stakeholders. Specifically, our strategy is to invest in a robust pipeline of rate-regulated energy infrastructure, continuously improving operating performance and advocate for responsible energy policies to deliver superior value to our customers and shareholders. 
As always, our customers continue to be at the center of our strategy. As a result, we are focused on meeting our customers' energy needs and exceeding their expectations. And in so doing, delivering on our shareholders' expectations for sustainable and strong long-term earnings per share and dividend growth. 
Our customers' expectations include providing them with safe, reliable and affordable service. They want new tools, products and services to enhance their interactions with us and to better manage their energy usage. And our customers also want us to continue to be forward-thinking when it comes to environmental, social and governance matters. I'm pleased to say that our actions and performance in 2019 as well as our strategic areas of focus for the future are aligned with our customers' and shareholders' expectations, which brings me to our discussion of our 2019 performance. 
As I said earlier, we delivered strong financial and operational performance in 2019. Earlier today, we announced 2019 earnings of $3.35 per share compared to core earnings of $3.37 per share earned in 2018.  Excluding the impact from weather, 2019 normalized earnings increased to $3.32 per share or approximately 9% from 2018's normalized base of $3.05 per share. With our customers and shareholders' expectations in mind, we made $2.4 billion of infrastructure investments in 2019 that resulted in a more reliable, resilient, secure and cleaner energy grid as well as contributed to strong rate base growth at all of our business segments. 
Consistent with these objectives, we successfully completed several important projects in 2019. I'm sure that you're familiar with some of the more notable projects on this slide, as we've discussed them with you throughout 2019. I also want to congratulate our Callaway Energy Center for receiving an exemplary rating from the World Association of Nuclear Operators in 2019. It was a great team effort that demonstrates our focus on operational excellence. 
In 2019, we also achieved constructive outcomes in several regulatory proceedings that will help drive additional infrastructure investments that will benefit customers and shareholders while keeping our customer rates affordable. Those constructive regulatory outcomes are outlined on this slide. 
We're also able to obtain regulatory approvals in 2019 of our planned acquisition of 700 megawatts of wind generation, along with several other innovative programs such as Charge Ahead and Community Solar, which will drive incremental investments in electric vehicle charging stations and renewable energy. Further, we continue to deliver robust energy efficiency programs for our customers. All of these programs are consistent with our ESG initiatives to bring cleaner energy and innovative solutions to the grid and our customers. The bottom line is that we successfully executed our strategy in 2019, which will have significant long-term value for all of our stakeholders. 
Turning to Page 5. As you can see on this page, our laser focus on executing this strategy for the last several years has delivered strong results. From our customer standpoint, our investments in infrastructure have improved reliability while, at the same time, our disciplined management of costs have kept our electric rates among the lowest in the country. Not surprisingly, these factors have also driven higher customer satisfaction scores. 
We've also delivered superior value to our shareholders, as you can see on Slide 6. Our weather-normalized core earnings per share has risen 60% or an approximately 8% compound annual growth rate since 2013, while our dividend has increased 20% over the same time period. This has resulted in a significant reduction in our weather-normalized dividend payout ratio from over 77% in 2013 to 58% in 2019, near the bottom of our 55% to 70% targeted dividend payout range, position us well for continued strong infrastructure investment and rate base growth as well as future dividend growth. I want to express my appreciation to all of our coworkers who have been relentlessly focused on executing our strategy over the last several years. Their actions are clearly consistent with our mission to power the quality of life. 
While I'm very pleased with our performance over the last several years, we are not sitting back and taking a deep breath. We will remain focused on accelerating and enhancing our performance in 2020 and in the years ahead, which brings me to Slide 7. 
Earlier this morning, we also announced that we expect our 2020 earnings to be in the range of $3.40 to $3.60 per share. Michael will provide you with more details on our 2020 guidance a bit later. 
Building on our robust earnings growth over the past several years, I am pleased to say we continue to expect to deliver long-term earnings growth that is among the best in the industry. Today, we affirm our expected 6% to 8% compound annual earnings per share growth rate from 2018 through 2023 issued last February. In addition, we expect to deliver 6% to 8% compound annual earnings per share growth from 2020 through 2024, using the midpoint of our 2020 guidance, $3.50 per share, as the base. Our long-term earnings growth will be driven by continued execution of our strategy, including investing in infrastructure for the benefit of our customers while keeping rates affordable. This outlook accommodates several factors, including a range of treasury rates, sales growth, spending levels and regulatory developments. And of course, earnings growth in any individual year will be impacted by the timing of capital expenditures, regulatory rate reviews and weather, among other factors. 
Turning to Page 8. The first pillar of our strategy stresses investing in and operating our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. The strong earnings growth I just discussed is primarily driven by our rate base growth outlook. Today, we are rolling forward our 5-year investment plan. And as you can see, we expect to grow our rate base in an approximately 9% compound annual rate for the 2019 through 2024 period. This growth is driven by a robust capital plan of $16 billion over the next 5 years that will deliver significant value to our customers and the communities we serve. Our plan also includes strategically allocating significant capital to all 4 of our business segments. 
Finally, we remain relentlessly focused on disciplined cost management to earn as close to our allowed returns as possible in all of our businesses. 
Moving now to Page 9. This morning, Ameren Missouri filed its updated Smart Energy Plan with the Missouri Public Service Commission, which includes a status update for 2019 and a capital investment plan for 2020 through 2024. Ameren Missouri is making significant investments to modernize the energy grid and enhance how customers receive and consume energy. In 2019, Ameren Missouri invested $1 billion under the plan on more than 900 projects that are already delivering value to our customers. Some examples of the important projects undertaken in 2019 is shown on this slide. 
Our work in 2019 was just the beginning, and the pipeline for investment remains robust. The $7.6 billion updated Smart Energy Plan filing today includes investments focused on improvements and upgrades to modernize the energy grid as well as our approximately $1.2 billion wind generation investment. 
In 2020, we will also begin the deployment of 1 million smart meters over the next 5 years, which will provide more visibility and choices for our customers to control their energy usage. We look forward to working with the Missouri PSC and other key stakeholders as we implement the second year of the Smart Energy Plan and continue to provide benefits to customers while we transform the energy grid of today to build a brighter energy future for generations to come as well as create significant jobs. 
Moving to Page 10 for an update on Ameren Missouri's pending electric rate review. I am pleased to report that as a result of extensive collaboration, all the major parties participating in this rate review, Ameren Missouri, the staff of the Missouri PSC, the Office of Public Counsel, industrial consumer groups and others, recently reached an agreement in principle on nearly all the issues in this case. As a result, we expect non-unanimous stipulation and agreement to be filed with the Missouri PSC this week, with the request that the agreement be approved by the Commission. At this point, the terms of the agreement in principle are confidential. This page outlines the remaining open items, which will be taken to hearings in early March. 
Specifically, we will defend the current sharing ratio for the fuel adjustment clause, which we have successfully defended since 2009. In addition, we will strongly defend the recovery of all of our affiliate transaction costs and investments and expenses related to our coal-fired energy centers. We look forward to presenting our views to Missouri PSC. 
Turning now to Page 11. Next, I want to cover the second pillar of our strategy: enhancing regulatory frameworks and advocating for responsible energy and economic policies. Beginning with Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution, Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act legislation was filed recently. This important legislation would allow Ameren Illinois to make significant investments at lower cost solar energy and battery storage to improve reliability as well as in transportation electrification in order to benefit customers in the economy across Central and Southern Illinois. The Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act would also extend electric formula ratemaking through 2032 and builds on Ameren Illinois' efforts to modernize the energy grid under a transparent and stable regulatory framework that has supported significant investment to modernize the energy grid, while improving reliability and creating approximately 1,400 jobs, all while keeping rates well below the Midwest and national averages. 
In addition, this legislation will modify the allowed turn on equity formula to increase the basis point adder to the average 30-year treasury rate from 580 to 680, and set an ROE cap at no more than 50 basis points above the national average for electric utility ROEs. This bill will move the state of Illinois closer to reaching its goal of 100% clean energy by 2050 and is a great example of how Ameren Illinois is supporting our ESG initiatives to bring cleaner energy to our customers. With all these benefits in mind, we are focused on working with key stakeholders to get this important legislation passed this year. 
Turning to Page 12. Earlier this month, the Missouri PSC approved the unanimous stipulation and agreement that allows the expenses for Callaway Energy Center refueling and maintenance outages to be deferred and amortized over approximately 18 months, beginning with our fall 2020 outage. This change will allow the timing of expense recognition associated with these outages to more closely align with the timing of related revenue recognition, starting with our fall outage this year. 
Moving on to FERC regulatory matters. Ameren, along with other MISO transmission owners, EEI and many other parties, requested a rehearing of FERC's November 2019 order related to the MISO ROE complaint cases. From an overall policy perspective, we believe FERC's order is inconsistent with this long-standing policy to incentivize transmission investment, particularly at a time when meaningful investments were needed for reliability and to enable the nation to continue to transition to cleaner and more diverse generation sources. Strong arguments were presented by several parties, and we are pleased that the FERC issued an order extending the time to consider the rehearing requests. We look forward to addressing this important matter with the FERC in the months ahead. It should be noted that FERC has no set time line to address this matter. And of course, we can't predict the timing and ultimate outcome of these proceedings. 
Moving now to Page 13 for an update on our wind generation investment plans to achieve compliance with Missouri's renewable energy standard and continue to transition our generation portfolio to benefit our customers, the communities we serve and the environment. 
As I discussed earlier, we received regulatory approvals from the Missouri PSC in 2019 to acquire 700 megawatts of new wind generation at 2 sites in Missouri. We expect our investment in these projects to be approximately $1.2 billion, which is included in the 5-year capital expenditure and rate base growth plans we laid out today. Both facilities will be significant additions to our renewable energy portfolio, and importantly, will help us continue our transition to a cleaner and more diverse generation portfolio in a responsible fashion. 
Construction is well underway at both sites. Of course, we continue to work closely with the developers for both projects to monitor the time of the manufacturing and shipment of certain facility components coming from China, due to the potential for issues associated with the coronavirus. At this time, both projects remain on schedule to be in service by the end of 2020, and we expect to see meaningful contributions to earnings in 2021 from these investments. 
I would now like to provide an update on the Renewable Choice Program. As you may recall, the Renewable Choice Program enables Ameren Missouri to provide certain commercial, industrial and municipal customers with up to 400 megawatts of wind generation to meet their energy needs. Under this program, we can own 200 megawatts of this wind generation. Over the last several months, we've been working to meet our customers' top priorities for the program, including prices competitive with existing rates, long-term price predictability and for renewable power generated in Missouri. To date, we have not been able to put together a project that effectively meets the needs of our customers who've expressed an interest in this program. 
Given that our customers are at the center of our strategy, we remain focused on finding solutions to best meet their needs and expectations. For example, we're exploring the possibility of allowing solar projects to qualify under this program given our success with similar programs for our residential customers. This and certain other modifications to the program could require Missouri PSC approval. The bottom line is that we'll continue to relentlessly work with our customers and the Missouri PSC as needed to design and develop projects to best serve our customers' needs. We will keep you posted on developments associated with this program. 
Finally, consistent with our goal to meet our customers' long-term energy needs, we will assess additional renewable generation opportunities in the context of our next comprehensive integrated resource plan, which is expected to be filed in September of this year. This comprehensive stakeholder process is well underway to evaluate our future customer demand as well as the existing and new generation needs over the next 20 years and beyond. We are excited about working with key stakeholders in this process and are committed to transitioning Ameren Missouri's generation to a cleaner, more diverse portfolio in a responsible fashion for the environment, our customers and our shareholders. 
Turning now to Page 14. As we look to the future, the successful execution of our 5-year plan is not only focused on delivering strong results through 2024, but is also designed to position Ameren for success over the next decade and beyond. We believe that a safe, reliable, resilient and secure energy grid will be increasingly important and bring even greater value to our customers, our communities and shareholders. With this long-term view in mind, we are making investments that will position Ameren to meet our customers' future energy needs and rising expectations, support increased electrification of the transportation sector and other industrial processes and provide safe and reliable natural gas services. 
The right side of this page shows that our allocation of capital is expected to grow our energy delivery investments to nearly 80% of our rate base by the end of 2024. As a result of Ameren Missouri's investment in 700 megawatts of wind, combined with the scheduled retirement of the Meramec coal-fired energy center in 2022, we expect coal-fired generation to decline to just 8% of rate base by year-end 2024. These steps are consistent with our goals to reduce carbon emissions by at least 80%, low 2005 levels, by 2015. These actions are just some more examples of the actions we are taking to address our customers' and shareholders' focus on ESG matters. The bottom line is that we are taking steps today across the board to position Ameren for success in 2020 and beyond. 
Moving to Page 15. Looking ahead through the end of this decade, we will remain focused on delivering superior long-term value to our customers. In addition to our robust $16 billion 5-year capital plan in years 2025 through 2029, we foresee a strong pipeline of additional investment opportunities of at least $20 billion that will deliver significant value to all of our stakeholders. These projects will be consistent with the Missouri Smart Energy Plan as well as Illinois' Modernization Action Plan, both of which were designed to make our energy grid stronger, smarter and cleaner. We also plan to continue to bolster our nation's transmission infrastructure to enhance reliability and support greater levels of renewable generation on the grid. 
And speaking of renewable generation, our current plan reflects 700 megawatts of wind generation and 100 megawatts of solar generation over the next decade. As I noted previously, we will be filing our Integrated Resource Plan in Missouri in September. In that plan, we will take a close look at additional renewable generation opportunities that will help us transition to an even cleaner and more diverse portfolio in a responsible fashion and deliver significant long-term benefits to our customers. Of course, these investments will not only create a stronger and cleaner energy grid to meet our customers' needs and exceed their expectations, but they will also create thousands of jobs for our local economies. Our ability to make these critical infrastructure investments has been facilitated by constructive state and federal energy policies across all of our businesses. Maintaining constructive energy policies, which support robust investment in energy infrastructure will be critical to meeting our customers' future energy needs and delivering on our customers' expectations. 
Moving to Page 16. To sum up our value proposition, we remain firmly convinced that the execution of our strategy in 2020 and over the next decade will deliver superior value to our customers, shareholders and the environment. We believe the expectation of a 6% to 8% earnings per share compound annual growth rate from 2020 through 2024 driven by strong rate base growth compares very favorably with our regulated utility peers. I am confident in our ability to execute our investment plans and strategies across all 4 of our business segments, as we have an experienced and dedicated team to get it done. That back, coupled with our sustained past execution of our strategy on many fronts, has positioned us well for future success. 
Further, our shares continue to offer investors a solid dividend. In the fourth quarter of last year, Ameren's Board of Directors expressed its confidence in our long-term growth plan by increasing the dividend by approximately 4%, the sixth consecutive year with a dividend increase. Our strong earnings growth expectations outlined today positions us well for future dividend growth. Of course, future dividend decisions will be driven by earnings growth, in addition to cash flows and other business conditions. Together, we believe our strong earnings growth outlook, combined with our solid dividend, results in a very attractive total return opportunity for shareholders. 
Again, thank you all for joining us today, and I'll now turn the call over to Michael. Michael?"
373264,651878665,1922083,"Ameren Corporation, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2020",2020-02-26,"Earnings Calls","Ameren Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Warner, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 18 of our presentation. Today, we reported 2019 core earnings of $3.35 per share compared to core earnings of $3.37 per share in 2018. Ameren Missouri, our largest segment, experienced a decr",1533,"Thanks, Warner, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 18 of our presentation. Today, we reported 2019 core earnings of $3.35 per share compared to core earnings of $3.37 per share in 2018. Ameren Missouri, our largest segment, experienced a decrease of $0.24 per share from $1.98 per share in 2018 to $1.74 per share in 2019. This decrease was largely due to lower electric retail sales, driven by weather, which reduced earnings by approximately $0.26 per share. 
In 2019, we experienced near-normal summer and winter temperatures compared to warmer summer and colder winter temperatures in the year-ago period. Ameren Missouri's results also reflected this year's scheduled refueling outage in our Callaway Energy Center, which reduced earnings by $0.09 per share compared to 2018 when there was no refueling outage. The next Callaway refueling is scheduled for the fall of 2020. 
Higher property tax has also reduced earnings by $0.05 per share in 2019 when compared to 2018. These items were partially offset by the positive comparative impacts related to MEEIA performance incentives, which contributed $0.08 per share, in addition to lower other operations and maintenance expenses. 
Turning to the other segments. Ameren Transmission earnings were up $0.08, which reflected increased infrastructure investments. Earnings for Ameren Illinois Natural Gas were up $0.05, which reflected higher rates effective in November 2018 and increased infrastructure investments. In addition, Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution earnings were up $0.02 due to increased investments, mostly offset by a lower allowed return on equity under formulaic rate making of 8.4% compared to 8.9% for the prior year. 
The 2019 allowed ROE is based on a 2019 average 30-year treasury yield of approximately 2.6%, down from the 2018 average of 3.1%. Ameren Parent and Other results reflected higher tax benefits, primarily associated with share-based compensation and charitable donations returning to more normal levels. 
Before moving on, let me briefly cover electric sales trends for Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois electric distribution for 2019 compared to 2018. Weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales to Missouri residential and commercial customers on a combined basis were up a little over 0.5%, excluding the effects of the Missouri Energy Efficiency Plan under MEEIA. Sales to low-margin Missouri industrial customers decreased about 4%, excluding the effects of our Energy Efficiency Plan. We exclude the FX because the plan provides rate recovery to ensure that earnings are not affected by reduced electric sales resulting from our energy efficiency efforts. Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to resident -- Illinois residential and commercial customers on a combined basis decreased 1.5%, and sales to industrial customers decreased 2%. Recall that changes in electric sales in Illinois, no matter the cause, do not affect earnings since we have full revenue decoupling. 
Moving to Page 19 of the presentation. Here, we provide an overview of our $16 billion of planned capital expenditures for the 2020 through 2024 period by business segment. That underlines the approximately 9% projected rate base growth Warner discussed earlier. This plan includes an incremental $2.7 billion compared to the $13.3 billion 5-year plan for 2019 through 2023 that was laid out last February. 
Turning to Page 20. We outlined here the expected funding sources for the infrastructure investments noted on the prior page. We expect continued growth in cash from operations as investments are reflected in customer rates. We also expect to generate significant tax deferrals. The tax deferrals are driven primarily by timing differences between financial statement depreciation reflected in customer rates and accelerated depreciation for tax purposes under makers. 
I should note that over the 5-year time horizon of our plan, we expect to make income tax and payments totaling $150 million to $200 million over our 5-year plan. In addition to the benefits of accelerated tax depreciation as a result of our expected $1.2 billion investment and 700 megawatts of wind generation, we expect to begin generating production tax credits over this period. 
From a financing perspective, we expect to continue to issue long-term debt at Ameren Parent, Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois to refinance the maturing obligations and to fund a portion of our cash requirements. 
We also plan to continue to use newly issued shares from our dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans over the 5-year guidance period. We expect this to provide equity funding of approximately $100 million annually. Our plan also includes the settlement of the forward equity contract in 2020 to generate between $540 million and $550 million to fund, in part, Ameren Missouri's wind generation investment by the end of that year. In order for us to maintain a strong balance sheet while we fund our robust infrastructure plan, we expect incremental equity issuances of approximately $150 million a year starting in 2021. All of these actions are expected to enable us to maintain a consolidated capitalization target of approximately 45% equity. 
Moving to Page 21 of our presentation. I would now like to discuss key drivers impacting our 2020 earnings guidance. As Warner stated, we expect 2020 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.40 to $3.60 per share. On this page and the next, we've listed key earnings drivers of and assumptions behind our 2020 earnings guidance, broken down by segment and compared to the 2019 results. 
Beginning with Ameren Missouri, earnings are expected to rise in 2020. Earnings are expected to be favorably affected by the electric service rates that are expected to be effective as of April -- as early as April 1. In addition, we also expect deferral expenses for the fall 2020 scheduled Callaway refueling and maintenance outage to increase earnings by approximately $0.08 per share compared to the spring 2019 outage. Our expenses will be deferred and amortized over approximately 18 months after completion. Partially offsetting these favorable earnings drivers, we expect lower energy efficiency performance incentives in 2020 of approximately $0.09. 
Finally, at Ameren Missouri, we expect the 700-megawatt wind generation investment by the end of 2020 to not have a material impact on 2020 earnings. Ameren transmission earnings are expected to benefit from additional investments in Ameren Illinois and ATXI projects made under FERC's formula ratemaking. Our guidance assumes the current 10.38% FERC-allowed ROE for the full year of 2020, which includes a 50 basis point adder for the MISO participation, except for the Mark Twain project, which assumes an allowed ROE of 10.88%. 
Turning to Page 22. For Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution, we anticipate increased earnings in 2020 compared to 2019 from additional infrastructure investments made under Illinois formula ratemaking. Our guidance incorporates a formula-based ROE of 8% using a forecasted 2.2% 2020 average yield for the 30-year treasury bond, which is lower than the allowed ROE of 8.4% in 2019. 
For Ameren Illinois Natural Gas distribution earnings, we expect to benefit from qualified investments that are included in rates on a timely basis under the state's gas infrastructure rider. 
Moving now to Ameren-wide drivers and assumptions. We expect lower tax benefits associated with share-based compensation in 2020 compared to 2019. In addition, the increased number of shares outstanding as a result of issuance under our dividend reinvestment employee benefits plans are expected to unfavorably impact earnings by $0.02 per share. 
I would also like to take a moment to discuss our electric sales outlook. We expect weather-normalized Missouri kilowatt hour sales to customers to be up approximately 0.5% compounded annually over our 5-year plan, excluding the effects of our MEEIA Energy Efficiency Plan. Again, we exclude MEEIA effects because the plan provides rate recovery to ensure that earnings are not affected by reduced electric sales resulting from our energy efficiency efforts. 
Turning to Illinois. We expect our weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to customers, including energy efficiency, to be flat to down slightly over our 5-year plan. 
Turning to Page 23, on Ameren Illinois regulatory matters. In December, the ICC approved an electric distribution rate change consistent with our filing and our annual rate update proceeding, with new rates effective at the beginning of this year. In Ameren Illinois Natural Gas regulatory matters, last week, we filed a request for $102 million annual increase in gas distribution rates using a 2021 future test year with the ICC. This $102 million included an estimated $46 million of annual revenues that would otherwise be recovered in 2021, under Ameren Illinois qualifying infrastructure plant and other riders. The details of this gas rate case filing are noted on this page. An ICC decision is required by January 2021, with new rates expected to be effective in February of 2021. 
Finally, turning to Page 24. We delivered strong earnings growth in 2019, and we expect to again deliver strong earnings growth in 2020 as we continue to successfully execute our strategy. As we look ahead, we expect strong 6% to 8% compound earnings per share growth from 2020 to 2024, driven by robust rate base growth and disciplined cost management. Further, we believe this growth will compare favorably with the growth of our regulated utility peers. And Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we have an attractive total shareholder return story that compares very favorably to our peers. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

We think it really has some really important elements in terms of trying to move Illinois to the clean energy future that they've been talking about, but also doing the things that we have been doing for the past 8 years, and that's modernizing the grid. 
So number one, one of the things in terms of trying to put some perspective on it, clearly, the grid modernization efforts, we talk a lot about those. And those are, in some respects, reflected back in the slide that we showed in terms of our 10-year outlook. Some of those dollars are certainly [ a mirror ]. But I think right now, it's premature for us to put a specific number on the solar and energy storage opportunities or electrification. I think clearly, as you've seen us do in Missouri, we see the solar plus battery storage projects, and they have been really important to help reliability. Richard and his team in Illinois certainly see those same types of opportunities. 
And look, at electrification, I think, across the country, we're just scratching the surface in terms of what those opportunities can be. So I'd like to put something around that for you. But I think it's just a little early for us to do that. But clearly, we see this as an important opportunity for the state of Illinois and especially downstate Illinois."

Our execution of our strategy over the last several years has driven our dividend payout ratio down meaningfully to the lower end of our 55% to 70%. And so as a result, as you look ahead, there's no doubt that we have been allocating a great deal of capital to rate base growth. And as you see in this plan, we continue to do that. And we've had a solid dividend. And so as we look ahead, I think the fact that we've been able to bring the dividend payout ratio down [ outages ], it gives us greater flexibility with respect to capital allocation, including, from my perspective, position us well for future dividend growth."

And on the House side, it is -- sponsors are Representative Greenwood and Representative Huffman. So when you step back and you look at the fundamental elements of this bill, this legislation, number one, it's very consistent with things that have been talked about in Illinois, really, for the past 12 months in terms of trying to put greater levels of investment for solar, for battery storage, electrification, these are all things which are consistent with the governor's package. So we think, as we've talked around with key stakeholders, these are important elements of any forward-thinking legislation, and so that's in this bill. 
Secondly, I think, over time, you have seen the modernization of the grid and the legislation associated with that, how that has received widespread support for all the right reasons. For reliability purposes, for customer affordability purposes for job creation, all those things are really spelled robust support for that. 
When you put these 2 things together, we think this legislation has really the opportunity to gain broad-based support. Having said that, it's early in the session here. And so Richard and his team had done a fantastic job of educating key stakeholders, talking with many folks that are at the table, including those that are looking at other pieces of legislation. And so we're not done doing that. So I would say that a lot of these elements of this legislation are very consistent and much aligned with what key stakeholders want to see, but there's still more work to do. But we're pleased with where things are at today and look forward to engage with these folks in the future."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This morning, I'm going to kick off our presentation by summarizing our team's strong 2019 financial and operating performance as well as highlight some of our key accomplishments that will position Ameren for success in the future. Importantly, I will then look ahead and discuss how we plan to continue delivering superior long-term value in 2020 and beyond to our customers, communities and shareholders. I'll then turn it over to Michael to discuss key drivers of our 2019 earnings results and 2020 earnings guidance as well as some key regulatory matters. And as always, we will turn it over to you for Q&A after our remarks. 
Before I jump into the details of our accomplishments and strategic areas of focus, I want to reiterate the strategy that has been delivering significant long-term value to all of our stakeholders. Specifically, our strategy is to invest in a robust pipeline of rate-regulated energy infrastructure, continuously improving operating performance and advocate for responsible energy policies to deliver superior value to our customers and shareholders. 
As always, our customers continue to be at the center of our strategy. As a result, we are focused on meeting our customers' energy needs and exceeding their expectations, and in so doing, delivering on our shareholders' expectations for sustainable and strong long-term earnings per share and dividend growth. 
Our customers' expectations include providing them with safe, reliable and affordable service. They want new tools, products and services to enhance their interactions with us and to better manage their energy usage. And our customers also want us to continue to be forward-thinking when it comes to environmental, social and governance matters. I'm pleased to say that our actions and performance in 2019 as well as our strategic areas of focus for the future are aligned with our customers' and shareholders' expectations, which brings me to a discussion of our 2019 performance. 
As I said earlier, we delivered strong financial and operational performance in 2019. Earlier today, we announced 2019 earnings of $3.35 per share compared to core earnings of $3.37 per share earned in 2018. Excluding the impact from weather, 2019 normalized earnings increased to $3.32 per share or approximately 9% from 2018's normalized base of $3.05 per share. With our customers and shareholders' expectations in mind, we made $2.4 billion of infrastructure investments in 2019 that resulted in a more reliable, resilient, secure and cleaner energy grid as well as contributed to strong rate base growth at all of our business segments. 
Consistent with these objectives, we successfully completed several important projects in 2019. I'm sure that you're familiar with some of the more notable projects on this slide, as we've discussed them with you throughout 2019. I also want to congratulate our Callaway Energy Center for receiving an exemplary rating from the World Association of Nuclear Operators in 2019. It was a great team effort that demonstrates our focus on operational excellence. 
In 2019, we also achieved constructive outcomes in several regulatory proceedings that will help drive additional infrastructure investments that will benefit customers and shareholders while keeping our customer rates affordable. Those constructive regulatory outcomes are outlined on this slide. 
We're also able to obtain regulatory approvals in 2019 for our planned acquisition of 700 megawatts of wind generation, along with several other innovative programs such as Charge Ahead and Community Solar, which will drive incremental investments in electric vehicle charging stations and renewable energy. 
Further, we continue to deliver robust energy efficiency programs for our customers. All of these programs are consistent with our ESG initiatives to bring cleaner energy and innovative solutions to the grid and our customers. The bottom line is that we successfully executed our strategy in 2019, which will drive significant long-term value for all of our stakeholders. 
Turning to Page 5. As you can see on this page, our laser focus on executing this strategy for the last several years has delivered strong results. From our customer standpoint, our investments in infrastructure have improved reliability while, at the same time, our disciplined management of costs have kept our electric rates among the lowest in the country. Not surprisingly, these factors have also driven higher customer satisfaction scores. 
We've also delivered superior value to our shareholders, as you can see on Slide 6. Our weather-normalized core earnings per share has risen 60% or an approximately 8% compound annual growth rate since 2013, while our dividend has increased 20% over the same time period. This has resulted in a significant reduction in our weather-normalized dividend payout ratio from over 77% in 2013 to 58% in 2019, near the bottom of our 55% to 70% targeted dividend payout range, position us well for continued strong infrastructure investment and rate base growth as well as future dividend growth. 
I want to express my appreciation to all of our coworkers who have been relentlessly focused on executing our strategy over the last several years. Their actions are clearly consistent with our mission to power the quality of life. 
While I'm very pleased with our performance over the last several years, we are not sitting back and taking a deep breath. We will remain focused on accelerating and enhancing our performance in 2020 and in the years ahead, which brings me to Slide 7. 
Earlier this morning, we also announced that we expect our 2020 earnings to be in the range of $3.40 to $3.60 per share. Michael will provide you with more details on our 2020 guidance a bit later. 
Building on our robust earnings growth over the past several years, I am pleased to say we continue to expect to deliver long-term earnings growth that is among the best in the industry. Today, we affirm our expected 6% to 8% compound annual earnings per share growth rate from 2018 through 2023 issued last February. In addition, we expect to deliver 6% to 8% compound annual earnings per share growth from 2020 through 2024, using the midpoint of our 2020 guidance, $3.50 per share, as the base. 
Our long-term earnings growth will be driven by continued execution of our strategy, including investing in infrastructure for the benefit of our customers while keeping rates affordable. This outlook accommodates several factors, including a range of treasury rates, sales growth, spending levels and regulatory developments. And of course, earnings growth in any individual year will be impacted by the timing of capital expenditures, regulatory rate reviews and weather, among other factors. 
Turning to Page 8. The first pillar of our strategy stresses investing in and operating our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. The strong earnings growth I just discussed is primarily driven by our rate base growth outlook. Today, we are rolling forward our 5-year investment plan. And as you can see, we expect to grow our rate base in an approximately 9% compound annual rate for the 2019 through 2024 period. This growth is driven by a robust capital plan of $16 billion over the next 5 years that will deliver significant value to our customers and the communities we serve. Our plan also includes strategically allocating significant capital to all 4 of our business segments. 
Finally, we remain relentlessly focused on disciplined cost management to earn as close to our allowed returns as possible in all of our businesses. 
Moving now to Page 9. This morning, Ameren Missouri filed its updated Smart Energy Plan with the Missouri Public Service Commission, which includes a status update for 2019 and a capital investment plan for 2020 through 2024. Ameren Missouri is making significant investments to modernize the energy grid and enhance how customers receive and consume energy. In 2019, Ameren Missouri invested $1 billion under the plan on more than 900 projects that are already delivering value to our customers. Some examples of the important projects undertaken in 2019 is shown on this slide. 
Our work in 2019 was just the beginning, and the pipeline for investment remains robust. The $7.6 billion updated Smart Energy Plan filing today includes investments focused on improvements and upgrades to modernize the energy grid as well as our approximately $1.2 billion wind generation investment. 
In 2020, we will also begin the deployment of 1 million smart meters over the next 5 years, which will provide more visibility and choices for our customers to control their energy usage. 
We look forward to working with the Missouri PSC and other key stakeholders as we implement the second year of the Smart Energy Plan and continue to provide benefits to customers while we transform the energy grid of today to build a brighter energy future for generations to come as well as create significant jobs. 
Moving to Page 10 for an update on Ameren Missouri's pending electric rate review. I am pleased to report that as a result of extensive collaboration, all the major parties participating in this rate review, Ameren Missouri, the staff of the Missouri PSC, the Office of Public Counsel, industrial consumer groups and others, recently reached an agreement in principle on nearly all the issues in this case. As a result, we expect non-unanimous stipulation and agreement to be filed with the Missouri PSC this week, with the request that the agreement be approved by the Commission. At this point, the terms of the agreement in principle are confidential. This page outlines the remaining open items, which will be taken to hearings in early March. 
Specifically, we will defend the current sharing ratio for the fuel adjustment clause, which we have successfully defended since 2009. In addition, we will strongly defend the recovery of all of our affiliate transaction costs and investments and expenses related to our coal-fired energy centers. We look forward to presenting our views to Missouri PSC. 
Turning now to Page 11. Next, I want to cover the second pillar of our strategy: enhancing regulatory frameworks and advocating for responsible energy and economic policies. Beginning with Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution, the Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act legislation was filed recently. This important legislation would allow Ameren Illinois to make significant investments at lower cost solar energy and battery storage to improve reliability as well as in transportation electrification in order to benefit customers in the economy across Central and Southern Illinois. 
The Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act would also extend electric formula ratemaking through 2032 and builds on Ameren Illinois' efforts to modernize the energy grid under a transparent and stable regulatory framework that has supported significant investment to modernize the energy grid, while improving reliability and creating approximately 1,400 jobs, all while keeping rates well below the Midwest and national averages. 
In addition, this legislation will modify the allowed return on equity formula to increase the basis point adder to the average 30-year treasury rate from 580 to 680, and set an ROE cap at no more than 50 basis points above the national average for electric utility ROEs. This bill will move the state of Illinois closer to reaching its goal of 100% clean energy by 2050 and is a great example of how Ameren Illinois is supporting our ESG initiatives to bring cleaner energy to our customers. 
With all these benefits in mind, we are focused on working with key stakeholders to get this important legislation passed this year. 
Turning to Page 12. Earlier this month, the Missouri PSC approved the unanimous stipulation and agreement that allows the expenses for Callaway Energy Center refueling and maintenance outages to be deferred and amortized over approximately 18 months, beginning with our fall 2020 outage. This change will allow the timing of expense recognition associated with these outages to more closely align with the timing of related revenue recognition, starting with our fall outage this year. 
Moving on to FERC regulatory matters. Ameren, along with other MISO transmission owners, EEI and many other parties, requested a rehearing of FERC's November 2019 order related to the MISO ROE complaint cases. From an overall policy perspective, we believe FERC's order is inconsistent with this long-standing policy to incentivize transmission investment, particularly at a time when meaningful investments were needed for reliability and to enable the nation to continues transition to cleaner and more diverse generation sources. Strong arguments were presented by several parties, and we are pleased that the FERC issued an order extending the time to consider the rehearing requests. 
We look forward to addressing this important matter with the FERC in the months ahead. It should be noted that FERC has no set time line to address this matter. And of course, we can't predict the timing and ultimate outcome of these proceedings. 
Moving now to Page 13 for an update on our wind generation investment plans to achieve compliance with Missouri's renewable energy standard and continue to transition our generation portfolio to benefit our customers, the communities we serve and the environment. As I discussed earlier, we received regulatory approvals from the Missouri PSC in 2019 to acquire 700 megawatts of new wind generation at 2 sites in Missouri. We expect our investment in these projects to be approximately $1.2 billion, which is included in the 5-year capital expenditure and rate base growth plans we laid out today. 
Both facilities will be significant additions to our renewable energy portfolio, and importantly, will help us continue our transition to a cleaner and more diverse generation portfolio in a responsible fashion. 
Construction is well underway at both sites. Of course, we continue to work closely with the developers for both projects to monitor the time of the manufacturing and shipment of certain facility components coming from China, due to the potential for issues associated with the coronavirus. At this time, both projects remain on schedule to be in service by the end of 2020, and we expect to see meaningful contributions to earnings in 2021 from these investments. 
I would now like to provide an update on the Renewable Choice Program. As you may recall, the Renewable Choice Program enables Ameren Missouri to provide certain commercial, industrial and municipal customers with up to 400 megawatts of wind generation to meet their energy needs. Under this program, we can own 200 megawatts of this wind generation. 
Over the last several months, we've been working to meet our customers' top priorities for this program, including prices competitive with the existing rates, long-term price predictability and for renewable power generated in Missouri. To date, we have not been able to put together a project that effectively meets the needs of our customers who've expressed an interest in this program. 
Given that our customers are at the center of our strategy, we remain focused on finding solutions to best meet their needs and expectations. For example, we're exploring the possibility of allowing solar projects to qualify under this program given our success with similar programs for our residential customers. This and certain other modifications to the program could require Missouri PSC approval. The bottom line is that we will continue to relentlessly work with our customers and the Missouri PSC, as needed, to design and develop projects that best serve our customers' needs. We will keep you posted on developments associated with this program. 
Finally, consistent with our goal to meet our customers' long-term energy needs, we will assess additional renewable generation opportunities in the context of our next comprehensive Integrated Resource Plan, which is expected to be filed in September of this year. This comprehensive stakeholder process is well underway to evaluate our future customer demand as well as the existing and new generation needs over the next 20 years and beyond. We are excited about working with key stakeholders in this process and are committed to transitioning Ameren Missouri's generation to a cleaner, more diverse portfolio in a responsible fashion for the environment, our customers and our shareholders. 
Turning now to Page 14. As we look to the future, the successful execution of our 5-year plan is not only focused on delivering strong results through 2024, but is also designed to position Ameren for success over the next decade and beyond. We believe that a safe, reliable, resilient and secure energy grid will be increasingly important and bring even greater value to our customers, our communities and shareholders. 
With this long-term view in mind, we are making investments that will position Ameren to meet our customers' future energy needs and rising expectations, support increased electrification of the transportation sector and other industrial processes and provide safe and reliable natural gas services. 
The right side of this page shows that our allocation of capital is expected to grow our energy delivery investments to nearly 80% of our rate base by the end of 2024. As a result of Ameren Missouri's investment in 700 megawatts of wind, combined with the scheduled retirement of the Meramec coal-fired energy center in 2022, we expect coal-fired generation to decline to just 8% of rate base by year-end 2024. 
These steps are consistent with our goals to reduce carbon emissions by at least 80% low 2005 levels by 2015. These actions are just some more examples of the actions we are taking to address our customers' and shareholders' focus on ESG matters. The bottom line is that we are taking steps today across the board to position Ameren for success in 2020 and beyond. 
Moving to Page 15. Looking ahead through the end of this decade, we will remain focused on delivering superior long-term value to our customers. In addition to our robust $16 billion 5-year capital plan in years 2025 through 2029, we foresee a strong pipeline of additional investment opportunities of at least $20 billion that will deliver significant value to all of our stakeholders. These projects will be consistent with the Missouri Smart Energy Plan as well as Illinois' Modernization Action Plan, both of which were designed to make our energy grid stronger, smarter and cleaner. We also plan to continue to bolster our nation's transmission infrastructure to enhance reliability and support greater levels of renewable generation on the grid. 
And speaking of renewable generation, our current plan reflects 700 megawatts of wind generation and 100 megawatts of solar generation over the next decade. As I noted previously, we will be filing our Integrated Resource Plan in Missouri in September. In that plan, we will take a close look at additional renewable generation opportunities that will help us transition to an even cleaner and more diverse portfolio in a responsible fashion and deliver significant long-term benefits to our customers. 
Of course, these investments will not only create a stronger and cleaner energy grid to meet our customers' needs and exceed their expectations, but they will also create thousands of jobs for our local economies. Our ability to make these critical infrastructure investments has been facilitated by constructive state and federal energy policies across all of our businesses. Maintaining constructive energy policies, which support robust investment in energy infrastructure, will be critical to meeting our customers' future energy needs and delivering on our customers' expectations. 
Moving to Page 16. To sum up our value proposition, we remain firmly convinced that the execution of our strategy in 2020 and over the next decade will deliver superior value to our customers, shareholders and the environment. We believe the expectation of a 6% to 8% earnings per share compound annual growth rate from 2020 through 2024, driven by strong rate base growth, compares very favorably with our regulated utility peers. I am confident in our ability to execute our investment plans and strategies across all 4 of our business segments, as we have an experienced and dedicated team to get it done. That fact, coupled with our sustained past execution of our strategy on many fronts, has positioned us well for future success. 
Further, our shares continue to offer investors a solid dividend. In the fourth quarter of last year, Ameren's Board of Directors expressed its confidence in our long-term growth plan by increasing the dividend by approximately 4%, the sixth consecutive year with a dividend increase. Our strong earnings growth expectations outlined today positions us well for future dividend growth. 
Of course, future dividend decisions will be driven by earnings growth, in addition to cash flows and other business conditions. Together, we believe our strong earnings growth outlook, combined with our solid dividend, results in a very attractive total return opportunity for shareholders. 
Again, thank you all for joining us today, and I'll now turn the call over to Michael. Michael?"
373264,651878665,1931864,"Ameren Corporation, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2020",2020-02-26,"Earnings Calls","Ameren Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Warner, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 18 of our presentation. Today, we reported 2019 core earnings of $3.35 per share compared to core earnings of $3.37 per share in 2018. Ameren Missouri, our largest segment, experienced a decr",1534,"Thanks, Warner, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 18 of our presentation. Today, we reported 2019 core earnings of $3.35 per share compared to core earnings of $3.37 per share in 2018. Ameren Missouri, our largest segment, experienced a decrease of $0.24 per share from $1.98 per share in 2018 to $1.74 per share in 2019. This decrease was largely due to lower electric retail sales driven by weather, which reduced earnings by approximately $0.26 per share. 
In 2019, we experienced near-normal summer and winter temperatures compared to warmer summer and colder winter temperatures in the year-ago period. Ameren Missouri's results also reflected this year's scheduled refueling outage in our Callaway Energy Center, which reduced earnings by $0.09 per share compared to 2018 when there was no refueling outage. The next Callaway refueling is scheduled for the fall of 2020. 
Higher property tax has also reduced earnings by $0.05 per share in 2019 when compared to 2018. These items were partially offset by the positive comparative impacts related to MEEIA performance incentives, which contributed $0.08 per share, in addition to lower other operation and maintenance expenses. 
Turning to the other segments. Ameren Transmission earnings were up $0.08, which reflected increased infrastructure investments. Earnings for Ameren Illinois Natural Gas were up $0.05, which reflected higher rates effective in November 2018 and increased infrastructure investments. In addition, Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution earnings were up $0.02 due to increased investments, mostly offset by a lower allowed return on equity under formulaic ratemaking of 8.4% compared to 8.9% for the prior year. 
The 2019 allowed ROE is based on a 2019 average 30-year treasury yield of approximately 2.6%, down from the 2018 average of 3.1%. Ameren Parent and Other results reflected higher tax benefits primarily associated with share-based compensation, and charitable donations returning to more normal levels. 
Before moving on, let me briefly cover electric sales trends for Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois electric distribution for 2019 compared to 2018. Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Missouri residential and commercial customers on a combined basis were up a little over 0.5%, excluding the effects of the Missouri Energy Efficiency Plan under MEEIA. Sales to low-margin Missouri industrial customers decreased about 4%, excluding the effects of our Energy Efficiency Plan. 
We exclude the FX because the plan provides rate recovery to ensure that earnings are not affected by reduced electric sales resulting from our energy efficiency efforts. Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to resident -- Illinois residential and commercial customers on a combined basis decreased 1.5%, and sales to industrial customers decreased 2%. Recall that changes on electric sales in Illinois, no matter the cause, do not affect earnings since we have full revenue decoupling. 
Moving to Page 19 of the presentation. Here, we provide an overview of our $16 billion of planned capital expenditures for the 2020 through 2024 period by business segment. That underlines the approximately 9% projected rate base growth Warner discussed earlier. This plan includes an incremental $2.7 billion compared to the $13.3 billion 5-year plan for 2019 through 2023 that was laid out last February. 
Turning to Page 20. We outlined here the expected funding sources for the infrastructure investments noted on the prior page. We expect continued growth in cash from operations as investments are reflected in customer rates. We also expect to generate significant tax deferrals. The tax deferrals are driven primarily by timing differences between financial statement depreciation reflected in customer rates and accelerated depreciation for tax purposes under makers. 
I should note that over the 5-year time horizon of our plan, we expect to make income tax and payments totaling $150 million to $200 million over our 5-year plan. In addition to the benefits of accelerated tax depreciation, as a result of our expected $1.2 billion investment and 700 megawatts of wind generation, we expect to begin generating production tax credits over this period. 
From a financing perspective, we expect to continue to issue long-term debt at Ameren Parent, Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois to refinance the maturing obligations and to fund a portion of our cash requirements. 
We also plan to continue to use newly issued shares from our dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans over the 5-year guidance period. We expect this to provide equity funding of approximately $100 million annually. Our plan also includes the settlement of the forward equity contract in 2020 to generate between $540 million and $550 million to fund, in part, Ameren Missouri's wind generation investment by the end of that year. 
In order for us to maintain a strong balance sheet while we fund our robust infrastructure plan, we expect incremental equity issuances of approximately $150 million a year starting in 2021. All of these actions are expected to enable us to maintain a consolidated capitalization target of approximately 45% equity. 
Moving to Page 21 of our presentation. I would now like to discuss key drivers impacting our 2020 earnings guidance. As Warner stated, we expect 2020 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.40 to $3.60 per share. On this page and the next, we've listed key earnings drivers of and assumptions behind our 2020 earnings guidance, broken down by segment and compared to the 2019 results. 
Beginning with Ameren Missouri, earnings are expected to rise in 2020. Earnings are expected to be favorably affected by the electric service rates that are expected to be effective as of April -- as early as April 1. In addition, we also expect deferral of expenses for the fall 2020 scheduled Callaway refueling and maintenance outage to increase earnings by approximately $0.08 per share compared to the spring 2019 outage. Outage expenses will be deferred and amortized over approximately 18 months after completion. Partially offsetting these favorable earnings drivers, we expect lower energy efficiency performance incentives in 2020 of approximately $0.09. 
Finally, at Ameren Missouri, we expect the 700-megawatt wind generation investment by the end of 2020 to not have a material impact on 2020 earnings. Ameren Transmission earnings are expected to benefit from additional investments in Ameren Illinois and ATXI projects made under FERC's formula ratemaking. Our guidance assumes the current 10.38% FERC-allowed ROE for the full year of 2020, which includes a 50 basis point adder for the MISO participation, except for the Mark Twain project, which assumes an allowed ROE of 10.88%. 
Turning to Page 22. For Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution, we anticipate increased earnings in 2020 compared to 2019 from additional infrastructure investments made under Illinois formula ratemaking. Our guidance incorporates a formula-based ROE of 8% using a forecasted 2.2% 2020 average yield for the 30-year treasury bond, which is lower than the allowed ROE of 8.4% in 2019. 
For Ameren Illinois Natural Gas distribution earnings, we expect to benefit from qualified investments that are included in rates on a timely basis under the state's gas infrastructure rider. 
Moving now to Ameren-wide drivers and assumptions. We expect lower tax benefits associated with share-based compensation in 2020 compared to 2019. In addition, the increased number of shares outstanding as a result of issuance under our dividend reinvestment employee benefits plans are expected to unfavorably impact earnings by $0.02 per share. 
I would also like to take a moment to discuss our electric sales outlook. We expect weather-normalized Missouri kilowatt hour sales to customers to be up approximately 0.5% compounded annually over our 5-year plan, excluding the effects of our MEEIA Energy Efficiency Plan. Again, we exclude MEEIA effects because the plan provides rate recovery to ensure that earnings are not affected by reduced electric sales resulting from our energy efficiency efforts. 
Turning to Illinois. We expect our weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to customers, including energy efficiency, to be flat to down slightly over our 5-year plan. 
Turning to Page 23, on Ameren Illinois regulatory matters. In December, the ICC approved an electric distribution rate change consistent with our filing and our annual rate update proceeding, with new rates effective at the beginning of this year. In Ameren Illinois Natural Gas regulatory matters, last week, we filed a request for $102 million annual increase in gas distribution rates using a 2021 future test year with the ICC. This $102 million included an estimated $46 million of annual revenues that would otherwise be recovered in 2021 under Ameren Illinois' qualifying infrastructure plant and other riders. 
The details of this gas rate case filing are noted on this page. An ICC decision is required by January 2021, with new rates expected to be effective in February of 2021. 
Finally, turning to Page 24. We delivered strong earnings growth in 2019, and we expect to again deliver strong earnings growth in 2020 as we continue to successfully execute our strategy. As we look ahead, we expect strong 6% to 8% compound earnings per share growth from 2020 to 2024 driven by robust rate base growth and disciplined cost management. Further, we believe this growth will compare favorably with the growth of our regulated utility peers. And Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we have an attractive total shareholder return story that compares very favorably to our peers. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

We think it really has some really important elements in terms of trying to move Illinois to the clean energy future that they've been talking about, but also doing the things that we have been doing for the past 8 years, and that's modernizing the grid. 
So number one, one of the things in terms of trying to put some perspective on it, clearly, the grid modernization efforts, we talk a lot about those. And those are, in some respects, reflected back in the slide that we showed in terms of our 10-year outlook. Some of those dollars are certainly a mirror. But I think right now, it's premature for us to put a specific number on the solar and energy storage opportunities or electrification. I think clearly, as you've seen us do in Missouri, we see the solar plus battery storage projects, and they have been really important to help reliability. Richard and his team in Illinois certainly see those same types of opportunities. 
And look, at electrification, I think, across the country, we're just scratching the surface in terms of what those opportunities can be. So I'd like to put something around that for you. But I think it's just a little early for us to do that. But clearly, we see this as an important opportunity for the state of Illinois and especially downstate Illinois."

And on the House side, it is -- sponsors are Representative Greenwood and Representative Huffman. So when you step back and you look at the fundamental elements of this bill, in this legislation, number one, it's very consistent with things that have been talked about in Illinois, really for the past 12 months in terms of trying to put greater levels of investment for solar, for battery storage, electrification, these are all things which are consistent with the Governor's package. So we think, as we've talked around with key stakeholders, these are important elements of any forward-thinking legislation, and so that's in this bill. 
Secondly, I think, over time, you have seen the modernization of the grid and the legislation associated with that, how that has received widespread support for all the right reasons. For reliability purposes, for customer affordability purposes, for job creation, all those things are really spelled robust support for that. 
When you put these 2 things together, we think this legislation has really the opportunity to gain broad-based support. Having said that, it's early in the session here. And so Richard and his team had done a fantastic job of educating key stakeholders, talking with many folks that are at the table, including those that are looking at other pieces of legislation. And so we're not done doing that. 
So I would say that a lot of these elements of this legislation are very consistent and much aligned with what key stakeholders want to see, but there's still more work to do. But we're pleased with where things are at today and look forward to engage with these folks in the future."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This morning, I'm going to kick off our presentation by summarizing our team's strong 2019 financial and operating performance as well as highlight some of our key accomplishments that will position Ameren for success in the future. Importantly, I will then look ahead and discuss how we plan to continue delivering superior long-term value in 2020 and beyond to our customers, communities and shareholders. I'll then turn it over to Michael to discuss key drivers of our 2019 earnings results and 2020 earnings guidance as well as some key regulatory matters. And as always, we will turn it over to you for Q&A after our remarks. 
Before I jump into the details of our accomplishments and strategic areas of focus, I want to reiterate the strategy that has been delivering significant long-term value to all of our stakeholders. Specifically, our strategy is to invest in a robust pipeline of rate-regulated energy infrastructure, continuously improving operating performance and advocate for responsible energy policies to deliver superior value to our customers and shareholders. 
As always, our customers continue to be at the center of our strategy. As a result, we are focused on meeting our customers' energy needs and exceeding their expectations, and in so doing, delivering on our shareholders' expectations for sustainable and strong long-term earnings per share and dividend growth. 
Our customers' expectations include providing them with safe, reliable and affordable service. They want new tools, products and services to enhance their interactions with us and to better manage their energy usage. And our customers also want us to continue to be forward-thinking when it comes to environmental, social and governance matters. I'm pleased to say that our actions and performance in 2019 as well as our strategic areas of focus for the future are aligned with our customers' and shareholders' expectations, which brings me to a discussion of our 2019 performance. 
As I said earlier, we delivered strong financial and operational performance in 2019. Earlier today, we announced 2019 earnings of $3.35 per share compared to core earnings of $3.37 per share earned in 2018. Excluding the impact from weather, 2019 normalized earnings increased to $3.32 per share or approximately 9% from 2018's normalized base of $3.05 per share. With our customers and shareholders' expectations in mind, we made $2.4 billion of infrastructure investments in 2019 that resulted in a more reliable, resilient, secure and cleaner energy grid as well as contributed to strong rate base growth at all of our business segments. 
Consistent with these objectives, we successfully completed several important projects in 2019. I'm sure that you're familiar with some of the more notable projects on this slide, as we've discussed them with you throughout 2019. I also want to congratulate our Callaway Energy Center for receiving an exemplary rating from the World Association of Nuclear Operators in 2019. It was a great team effort that demonstrates our focus on operational excellence. 
In 2019, we also achieved constructive outcomes in several regulatory proceedings that will help drive additional infrastructure investments that will benefit customers and shareholders while keeping our customer rates affordable. Those constructive regulatory outcomes are outlined on this slide. 
We're also able to obtain regulatory approvals in 2019 for our planned acquisition of 700 megawatts of wind generation, along with several other innovative programs such as Charge Ahead and Community Solar, which will drive incremental investments in electric vehicle charging stations and renewable energy. 
Further, we continue to deliver robust energy efficiency programs for our customers. All of these programs are consistent with our ESG initiatives to bring cleaner energy and innovative solutions to the grid and our customers. The bottom line is that we successfully executed our strategy in 2019, which will drive significant long-term value for all of our stakeholders. 
Turning to Page 5. As you can see on this page, our laser focus on executing this strategy for the last several years has delivered strong results. From our customer standpoint, our investments in infrastructure have improved reliability while, at the same time, our disciplined management of costs have kept our electric rates among the lowest in the country. Not surprisingly, these factors have also driven higher customer satisfaction scores. 
We've also delivered superior value to our shareholders, as you can see on Slide 6. Our weather-normalized core earnings per share has risen 60% or an approximately 8% compound annual growth rate since 2013, while our dividend has increased 20% over the same time period. This has resulted in a significant reduction in our weather-normalized dividend payout ratio from over 77% in 2013 to 58% in 2019, near the bottom of our 55% to 70% targeted dividend payout range, position us well for continued strong infrastructure investment and rate base growth as well as future dividend growth. 
I want to express my appreciation to all of our coworkers who have been relentlessly focused on executing our strategy over the last several years. Their actions are clearly consistent with our mission to power the quality of life. 
While I'm very pleased with our performance over the last several years, we are not sitting back and taking a deep breath. We will remain focused on accelerating and enhancing our performance in 2020 and in the years ahead, which brings me to Slide 7. 
Earlier this morning, we also announced that we expect our 2020 earnings to be in the range of $3.40 to $3.60 per share. Michael will provide you with more details on our 2020 guidance a bit later. 
Building on our robust earnings growth over the past several years, I am pleased to say we continue to expect to deliver long-term earnings growth that is among the best in the industry. Today, we affirm our expected 6% to 8% compound annual earnings per share growth rate from 2018 through 2023 issued last February. In addition, we expect to deliver 6% to 8% compound annual earnings per share growth from 2020 through 2024, using the midpoint of our 2020 guidance, $3.50 per share, as the base. 
Our long-term earnings growth will be driven by continued execution of our strategy, including investing in infrastructure for the benefit of our customers while keeping rates affordable. This outlook accommodates several factors, including a range of treasury rates, sales growth, spending levels and regulatory developments. And of course, earnings growth in any individual year will be impacted by the timing of capital expenditures, regulatory rate reviews and weather, among other factors. 
Turning to Page 8. The first pillar of our strategy stresses investing in and operating our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. The strong earnings growth I just discussed is primarily driven by our rate base growth outlook. Today, we are rolling forward our 5-year investment plan. And as you can see, we expect to grow our rate base in an approximately 9% compound annual rate for the 2019 through 2024 period. This growth is driven by a robust capital plan of $16 billion over the next 5 years that will deliver significant value to our customers and the communities we serve. Our plan also includes strategically allocating significant capital to all 4 of our business segments. 
Finally, we remain relentlessly focused on disciplined cost management to earn as close to our allowed returns as possible in all of our businesses. 
Moving now to Page 9. This morning, Ameren Missouri filed its updated Smart Energy Plan with the Missouri Public Service Commission, which includes a status update for 2019 and a capital investment plan for 2020 through 2024. Ameren Missouri is making significant investments to modernize the energy grid and enhance how customers receive and consume energy. In 2019, Ameren Missouri invested $1 billion under the plan on more than 900 projects that are already delivering value to our customers. Some examples of the important projects undertaken in 2019 is shown on this slide. 
Our work in 2019 was just the beginning, and the pipeline for investment remains robust. The $7.6 billion updated Smart Energy Plan filing today includes investments focused on improvements and upgrades to modernize the energy grid as well as our approximately $1.2 billion wind generation investment. 
In 2020, we will also begin the deployment of 1 million smart meters over the next 5 years, which will provide more visibility and choices for our customers to control their energy usage. 
We look forward to working with the Missouri PSC and other key stakeholders as we implement the second year of the Smart Energy Plan and continue to provide benefits to customers while we transform the energy grid of today to build a brighter energy future for generations to come as well as create significant jobs. 
Moving to Page 10 for an update on Ameren Missouri's pending electric rate review. I am pleased to report that as a result of extensive collaboration, all the major parties participating in this rate review, Ameren Missouri, the staff of the Missouri PSC, the Office of Public Counsel, industrial consumer groups and others, recently reached an agreement in principle on nearly all the issues in this case. As a result, we expect non-unanimous stipulation and agreement to be filed with the Missouri PSC this week, with the request that the agreement be approved by the Commission. At this point, the terms of the agreement in principle are confidential. This page outlines the remaining open items, which will be taken to hearings in early March. 
Specifically, we will defend the current sharing ratio for the fuel adjustment clause, which we have successfully defended since 2009. In addition, we will strongly defend the recovery of all of our affiliate transaction costs and investments and expenses related to our coal-fired energy centers. We look forward to presenting our views to Missouri PSC. 
Turning now to Page 11. Next, I want to cover the second pillar of our strategy: enhancing regulatory frameworks and advocating for responsible energy and economic policies. Beginning with Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution, the Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act legislation was filed recently. This important legislation would allow Ameren Illinois to make significant investments at lower cost solar energy and battery storage to improve reliability as well as in transportation electrification in order to benefit customers in the economy across Central and Southern Illinois. 
The Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act would also extend electric formula ratemaking through 2032 and builds on Ameren Illinois' efforts to modernize the energy grid under a transparent and stable regulatory framework that has supported significant investment to modernize the energy grid, while improving reliability and creating approximately 1,400 jobs, all while keeping rates well below the Midwest and national averages. 
In addition, this legislation will modify the allowed return on equity formula to increase the basis point adder to the average 30-year treasury rate from 580 to 680, and set an ROE cap at no more than 50 basis points above the national average for electric utility ROEs. This bill will move the state of Illinois closer to reaching its goal of 100% clean energy by 2050 and is a great example of how Ameren Illinois is supporting our ESG initiatives to bring cleaner energy to our customers. 
With all these benefits in mind, we are focused on working with key stakeholders to get this important legislation passed this year. 
Turning to Page 12. Earlier this month, the Missouri PSC approved the unanimous stipulation and agreement that allows the expenses for Callaway Energy Center refueling and maintenance outages to be deferred and amortized over approximately 18 months, beginning with our fall 2020 outage. This change will allow the timing of expense recognition associated with these outages to more closely align with the timing of related revenue recognition, starting with our fall outage this year. 
Moving on to FERC regulatory matters. Ameren, along with other MISO transmission owners, EEI and many other parties, requested a rehearing of FERC's November 2019 order related to the MISO ROE complaint cases. From an overall policy perspective, we believe FERC's order is inconsistent with this long-standing policy to incentivize transmission investment, particularly at a time when meaningful investments were needed for reliability and to enable the nation to continues transition to cleaner and more diverse generation sources. Strong arguments were presented by several parties, and we are pleased that the FERC issued an order extending the time to consider the rehearing requests. 
We look forward to addressing this important matter with the FERC in the months ahead. It should be noted that FERC has no set time line to address this matter. And of course, we can't predict the timing and ultimate outcome of these proceedings. 
Moving now to Page 13 for an update on our wind generation investment plans to achieve compliance with Missouri's renewable energy standard and continue to transition our generation portfolio to benefit our customers, the communities we serve and the environment. As I discussed earlier, we received regulatory approvals from the Missouri PSC in 2019 to acquire 700 megawatts of new wind generation at 2 sites in Missouri. We expect our investment in these projects to be approximately $1.2 billion, which is included in the 5-year capital expenditure and rate base growth plans we laid out today. 
Both facilities will be significant additions to our renewable energy portfolio, and importantly, will help us continue our transition to a cleaner and more diverse generation portfolio in a responsible fashion. 
Construction is well underway at both sites. Of course, we continue to work closely with the developers for both projects to monitor the time of the manufacturing and shipment of certain facility components coming from China, due to the potential for issues associated with the coronavirus. At this time, both projects remain on schedule to be in service by the end of 2020, and we expect to see meaningful contributions to earnings in 2021 from these investments. 
I would now like to provide an update on the Renewable Choice Program. As you may recall, the Renewable Choice Program enables Ameren Missouri to provide certain commercial, industrial and municipal customers with up to 400 megawatts of wind generation to meet their energy needs. Under this program, we can own 200 megawatts of this wind generation. 
Over the last several months, we've been working to meet our customers' top priorities for this program, including prices competitive with the existing rates, long-term price predictability and for renewable power generated in Missouri. To date, we have not been able to put together a project that effectively meets the needs of our customers who've expressed an interest in this program. 
Given that our customers are at the center of our strategy, we remain focused on finding solutions to best meet their needs and expectations. For example, we're exploring the possibility of allowing solar projects to qualify under this program given our success with similar programs for our residential customers. This and certain other modifications to the program could require Missouri PSC approval. The bottom line is that we will continue to relentlessly work with our customers and the Missouri PSC, as needed, to design and develop projects that best serve our customers' needs. We will keep you posted on developments associated with this program. 
Finally, consistent with our goal to meet our customers' long-term energy needs, we will assess additional renewable generation opportunities in the context of our next comprehensive Integrated Resource Plan, which is expected to be filed in September of this year. This comprehensive stakeholder process is well underway to evaluate our future customer demand as well as the existing and new generation needs over the next 20 years and beyond. We are excited about working with key stakeholders in this process and are committed to transitioning Ameren Missouri's generation to a cleaner, more diverse portfolio in a responsible fashion for the environment, our customers and our shareholders. 
Turning now to Page 14. As we look to the future, the successful execution of our 5-year plan is not only focused on delivering strong results through 2024, but is also designed to position Ameren for success over the next decade and beyond. We believe that a safe, reliable, resilient and secure energy grid will be increasingly important and bring even greater value to our customers, our communities and shareholders. 
With this long-term view in mind, we are making investments that will position Ameren to meet our customers' future energy needs and rising expectations, support increased electrification of the transportation sector and other industrial processes and provide safe and reliable natural gas services. 
The right side of this page shows that our allocation of capital is expected to grow our energy delivery investments to nearly 80% of our rate base by the end of 2024. As a result of Ameren Missouri's investment in 700 megawatts of wind, combined with the scheduled retirement of the Meramec coal-fired energy center in 2022, we expect coal-fired generation to decline to just 8% of rate base by year-end 2024. 
These steps are consistent with our goals to reduce carbon emissions by at least 80% low 2005 levels by 2015. These actions are just some more examples of the actions we are taking to address our customers' and shareholders' focus on ESG matters. The bottom line is that we are taking steps today across the board to position Ameren for success in 2020 and beyond. 
Moving to Page 15. Looking ahead through the end of this decade, we will remain focused on delivering superior long-term value to our customers. In addition to our robust $16 billion 5-year capital plan in years 2025 through 2029, we foresee a strong pipeline of additional investment opportunities of at least $20 billion that will deliver significant value to all of our stakeholders. These projects will be consistent with the Missouri Smart Energy Plan as well as Illinois' Modernization Action Plan, both of which were designed to make our energy grid stronger, smarter and cleaner. We also plan to continue to bolster our nation's transmission infrastructure to enhance reliability and support greater levels of renewable generation on the grid. 
And speaking of renewable generation, our current plan reflects 700 megawatts of wind generation and 100 megawatts of solar generation over the next decade. As I noted previously, we will be filing our Integrated Resource Plan in Missouri in September. In that plan, we will take a close look at additional renewable generation opportunities that will help us transition to an even cleaner and more diverse portfolio in a responsible fashion and deliver significant long-term benefits to our customers. 
Of course, these investments will not only create a stronger and cleaner energy grid to meet our customers' needs and exceed their expectations, but they will also create thousands of jobs for our local economies. Our ability to make these critical infrastructure investments has been facilitated by constructive state and federal energy policies across all of our businesses. Maintaining constructive energy policies, which support robust investment in energy infrastructure, will be critical to meeting our customers' future energy needs and delivering on our customers' expectations. 
Moving to Page 16. To sum up our value proposition, we remain firmly convinced that the execution of our strategy in 2020 and over the next decade will deliver superior value to our customers, shareholders and the environment. We believe the expectation of a 6% to 8% earnings per share compound annual growth rate from 2020 through 2024, driven by strong rate base growth, compares very favorably with our regulated utility peers. I am confident in our ability to execute our investment plans and strategies across all 4 of our business segments, as we have an experienced and dedicated team to get it done. That fact, coupled with our sustained past execution of our strategy on many fronts, has positioned us well for future success. 
Further, our shares continue to offer investors a solid dividend. In the fourth quarter of last year, Ameren's Board of Directors expressed its confidence in our long-term growth plan by increasing the dividend by approximately 4%, the sixth consecutive year with a dividend increase. Our strong earnings growth expectations outlined today positions us well for future dividend growth. 
Of course, future dividend decisions will be driven by earnings growth, in addition to cash flows and other business conditions. Together, we believe our strong earnings growth outlook, combined with our solid dividend, results in a very attractive total return opportunity for shareholders. 
Again, thank you all for joining us today, and I'll now turn the call over to Michael. Michael?"
373264,651878665,1933640,"Ameren Corporation, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2020",2020-02-26,"Earnings Calls","Ameren Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Warner, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 18 of our presentation. Today, we reported 2019 core earnings of $3.35 per share compared to core earnings of $3.37 per share in 2018. Ameren Missouri, our largest segment, experienced a decr",1534,"Thanks, Warner, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 18 of our presentation. Today, we reported 2019 core earnings of $3.35 per share compared to core earnings of $3.37 per share in 2018. Ameren Missouri, our largest segment, experienced a decrease of $0.24 per share from $1.98 per share in 2018 to $1.74 per share in 2019. This decrease was largely due to lower electric retail sales driven by weather, which reduced earnings by approximately $0.26 per share. 
In 2019, we experienced near-normal summer and winter temperatures compared to warmer summer and colder winter temperatures in the year-ago period. Ameren Missouri's results also reflected this year's scheduled refueling outage in our Callaway Energy Center, which reduced earnings by $0.09 per share compared to 2018 when there was no refueling outage. The next Callaway refueling is scheduled for the fall of 2020. 
Higher property tax has also reduced earnings by $0.05 per share in 2019 when compared to 2018. These items were partially offset by the positive comparative impacts related to MEEIA performance incentives, which contributed $0.08 per share, in addition to lower other operation and maintenance expenses. 
Turning to the other segments. Ameren Transmission earnings were up $0.08, which reflected increased infrastructure investments. Earnings for Ameren Illinois Natural Gas were up $0.05, which reflected higher rates effective in November 2018 and increased infrastructure investments. In addition, Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution earnings were up $0.02 due to increased investments, mostly offset by a lower allowed return on equity under formulaic ratemaking of 8.4% compared to 8.9% for the prior year. 
The 2019 allowed ROE is based on a 2019 average 30-year treasury yield of approximately 2.6%, down from the 2018 average of 3.1%. Ameren Parent and Other results reflected higher tax benefits primarily associated with share-based compensation, and charitable donations returning to more normal levels. 
Before moving on, let me briefly cover electric sales trends for Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois electric distribution for 2019 compared to 2018. Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Missouri residential and commercial customers on a combined basis were up a little over 0.5%, excluding the effects of the Missouri Energy Efficiency Plan under MEEIA. Sales to low-margin Missouri industrial customers decreased about 4%, excluding the effects of our Energy Efficiency Plan. 
We exclude the FX because the plan provides rate recovery to ensure that earnings are not affected by reduced electric sales resulting from our energy efficiency efforts. Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to resident -- Illinois residential and commercial customers on a combined basis decreased 1.5%, and sales to industrial customers decreased 2%. Recall that changes on electric sales in Illinois, no matter the cause, do not affect earnings since we have full revenue decoupling. 
Moving to Page 19 of the presentation. Here, we provide an overview of our $16 billion of planned capital expenditures for the 2020 through 2024 period by business segment. That underlines the approximately 9% projected rate base growth Warner discussed earlier. This plan includes an incremental $2.7 billion compared to the $13.3 billion 5-year plan for 2019 through 2023 that was laid out last February. 
Turning to Page 20. We outlined here the expected funding sources for the infrastructure investments noted on the prior page. We expect continued growth in cash from operations as investments are reflected in customer rates. We also expect to generate significant tax deferrals. The tax deferrals are driven primarily by timing differences between financial statement depreciation reflected in customer rates and accelerated depreciation for tax purposes under makers. 
I should note that over the 5-year time horizon of our plan, we expect to make income tax and payments totaling $150 million to $200 million over our 5-year plan. In addition to the benefits of accelerated tax depreciation, as a result of our expected $1.2 billion investment and 700 megawatts of wind generation, we expect to begin generating production tax credits over this period. 
From a financing perspective, we expect to continue to issue long-term debt at Ameren Parent, Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois to refinance the maturing obligations and to fund a portion of our cash requirements. 
We also plan to continue to use newly issued shares from our dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans over the 5-year guidance period. We expect this to provide equity funding of approximately $100 million annually. Our plan also includes the settlement of the forward equity contract in 2020 to generate between $540 million and $550 million to fund, in part, Ameren Missouri's wind generation investment by the end of that year. 
In order for us to maintain a strong balance sheet while we fund our robust infrastructure plan, we expect incremental equity issuances of approximately $150 million a year starting in 2021. All of these actions are expected to enable us to maintain a consolidated capitalization target of approximately 45% equity. 
Moving to Page 21 of our presentation. I would now like to discuss key drivers impacting our 2020 earnings guidance. As Warner stated, we expect 2020 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.40 to $3.60 per share. On this page and the next, we've listed key earnings drivers of and assumptions behind our 2020 earnings guidance, broken down by segment and compared to the 2019 results. 
Beginning with Ameren Missouri, earnings are expected to rise in 2020. Earnings are expected to be favorably affected by the electric service rates that are expected to be effective as of April -- as early as April 1. In addition, we also expect deferral of expenses for the fall 2020 scheduled Callaway refueling and maintenance outage to increase earnings by approximately $0.08 per share compared to the spring 2019 outage. Outage expenses will be deferred and amortized over approximately 18 months after completion. Partially offsetting these favorable earnings drivers, we expect lower energy efficiency performance incentives in 2020 of approximately $0.09. 
Finally, at Ameren Missouri, we expect the 700-megawatt wind generation investment by the end of 2020 to not have a material impact on 2020 earnings. Ameren Transmission earnings are expected to benefit from additional investments in Ameren Illinois and ATXI projects made under FERC's formula ratemaking. Our guidance assumes the current 10.38% FERC-allowed ROE for the full year of 2020, which includes a 50 basis point adder for the MISO participation, except for the Mark Twain project, which assumes an allowed ROE of 10.88%. 
Turning to Page 22. For Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution, we anticipate increased earnings in 2020 compared to 2019 from additional infrastructure investments made under Illinois formula ratemaking. Our guidance incorporates a formula-based ROE of 8% using a forecasted 2.2% 2020 average yield for the 30-year treasury bond, which is lower than the allowed ROE of 8.4% in 2019. 
For Ameren Illinois Natural Gas distribution earnings, we expect to benefit from qualified investments that are included in rates on a timely basis under the state's gas infrastructure rider. 
Moving now to Ameren-wide drivers and assumptions. We expect lower tax benefits associated with share-based compensation in 2020 compared to 2019. In addition, the increased number of shares outstanding as a result of issuance under our dividend reinvestment employee benefits plans are expected to unfavorably impact earnings by $0.02 per share. 
I would also like to take a moment to discuss our electric sales outlook. We expect weather-normalized Missouri kilowatt hour sales to customers to be up approximately 0.5% compounded annually over our 5-year plan, excluding the effects of our MEEIA Energy Efficiency Plan. Again, we exclude MEEIA effects because the plan provides rate recovery to ensure that earnings are not affected by reduced electric sales resulting from our energy efficiency efforts. 
Turning to Illinois. We expect our weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to customers, including energy efficiency, to be flat to down slightly over our 5-year plan. 
Turning to Page 23, on Ameren Illinois regulatory matters. In December, the ICC approved an electric distribution rate change consistent with our filing and our annual rate update proceeding, with new rates effective at the beginning of this year. In Ameren Illinois Natural Gas regulatory matters, last week, we filed a request for $102 million annual increase in gas distribution rates using a 2021 future test year with the ICC. This $102 million included an estimated $46 million of annual revenues that would otherwise be recovered in 2021 under Ameren Illinois' qualifying infrastructure plant and other riders. 
The details of this gas rate case filing are noted on this page. An ICC decision is required by January 2021, with new rates expected to be effective in February of 2021. 
Finally, turning to Page 24. We delivered strong earnings growth in 2019, and we expect to again deliver strong earnings growth in 2020 as we continue to successfully execute our strategy. As we look ahead, we expect strong 6% to 8% compound earnings per share growth from 2020 to 2024 driven by robust rate base growth and disciplined cost management. Further, we believe this growth will compare favorably with the growth of our regulated utility peers. And Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we have an attractive total shareholder return story that compares very favorably to our peers. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

We think it really has some really important elements in terms of trying to move Illinois to the clean energy future that they've been talking about, but also doing the things that we have been doing for the past 8 years, and that's modernizing the grid. 
So number one, one of the things in terms of trying to put some perspective on it, clearly, the grid modernization efforts, we talk a lot about those. And those are, in some respects, reflected back in the slide that we showed in terms of our 10-year outlook. Some of those dollars are certainly a mirror. But I think right now, it's premature for us to put a specific number on the solar and energy storage opportunities or electrification. I think clearly, as you've seen us do in Missouri, we see the solar plus battery storage projects, and they have been really important to help reliability. Richard and his team in Illinois certainly see those same types of opportunities. 
And look, at electrification, I think, across the country, we're just scratching the surface in terms of what those opportunities can be. So I'd like to put something around that for you. But I think it's just a little early for us to do that. But clearly, we see this as an important opportunity for the state of Illinois and especially downstate Illinois."

Our execution of our strategy over the last several years has driven our dividend payout ratio down meaningfully to the lower end of our 55% to 70%. 
And so as a result, as you look ahead, there's no doubt that we have been allocating a great deal of capital to rate base growth. And as you see in this plan, we continue to do that. And we've had a solid dividend. And so as we look ahead, I think the fact that we've been able to bring the dividend payout ratio down outages, it gives us greater flexibility with respect to capital allocation, including, from my perspective, position us well for future dividend growth."

And on the House side, it is -- sponsors are Representative Greenwood and Representative Huffman. So when you step back and you look at the fundamental elements of this bill, in this legislation, number one, it's very consistent with things that have been talked about in Illinois, really for the past 12 months in terms of trying to put greater levels of investment for solar, for battery storage, electrification, these are all things which are consistent with the Governor's package. So we think, as we've talked around with key stakeholders, these are important elements of any forward-thinking legislation, and so that's in this bill. 
Secondly, I think, over time, you have seen the modernization of the grid and the legislation associated with that, how that has received widespread support for all the right reasons. For reliability purposes, for customer affordability purposes, for job creation, all those things are really spelled robust support for that. 
When you put these 2 things together, we think this legislation has really the opportunity to gain broad-based support. Having said that, it's early in the session here. And so Richard and his team had done a fantastic job of educating key stakeholders, talking with many folks that are at the table, including those that are looking at other pieces of legislation. And so we're not done doing that. 
So I would say that a lot of these elements of this legislation are very consistent and much aligned with what key stakeholders want to see, but there's still more work to do. But we're pleased with where things are at today and look forward to engage with these folks in the future."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This morning, I'm going to begin our presentation by providing a COVID-19 update, and in particular, highlight some of the key efforts we are taking for the safety and security of our coworkers and customers during this difficult time, while providing the central electric and natural gas service. 
I will then touch on our first quarter results and 2020 earnings guidance. Finally, I will discuss our long-term growth prospects while highlighting some important strategies that will position Ameren for future success. 
Before I jump into the details, I hope that you, your families and colleagues are safe and healthy during this unprecedented time. 
As our world works to address COVID-19, many things are uncertain. But the Ameren's commitment, the safety for our coworkers, our customers and our communities remains constant. And Ameren may never compromise on safety.  It is one of our core values. 
I want to express my profound appreciation for those who are on the front lines battling this virus to the health care workers, first responders, grocery store workers, local leaders, community workers and, of course, all utility workers across our nation, thank you. 
In particular, I want to express my sincere appreciation to my Ameren coworkers who remain focused every day on delivering safe, reliable power and natural gas to millions of people in Missouri and Illinois. 
To ensure that we could continue to deliver safe and reliable service, we took swift action in January and assembled a cross-functional crisis management response team, following reports about threats related to COVID-19. 
Since January, our team has been planning and implementing our pandemic response, consistent with established guidelines and industry best practices as well as in consultation with world-class health experts and state and local government leaders. 
We quickly restricted domestic and international travel and implemented from work from home policies for anyone that could to limit exposure of our coworkers. 
Of course, our coworkers are crucial to the execution of our mission and many continue to be out in our communities and in our energy centers every day, keeping the lights on and the natural gas flowing from millions of customers in Missouri and Illinois. 
Our actions to continue safe operations also included securing and supplying personal protective equipment, separating more crews, adjusting more schedules, performing robust health screenings at home and on-site and of course, practicing social distancing with coworkers and customers. 
Our transition to our new work practices went very well. Not only were we able to quickly take significant actions to protect the safety of our coworkers and customers, we have been able to continue executing our projects and strategic plan across our entire business. 
We also recognize this is a difficult time for many of our customers who are struggling financially due to lost wages and other circumstances related to COVID-19. That's why we currently have voluntarily suspended all-electric and gas disconnects for nonpayment and waved ALA payment fees for customers unable to pay their energy bill on time. 
In addition, we have contributed $1 million in energy assistance and nearly $1 million to fund other COVID-19 relief efforts to help families and businesses in our Illinois and Missouri communities. 
And we're not  in helping our customers and our communities. As part of our Ameren Missouri Rate Review Settlement, we are working with Missouri Office of the Public Counsel to provide another $3.5 million in energy assistance funds from Missouri residential customers in need.  Our proposal is pending approval for the Missouri Public Service Commission. 
In addition, we live and work in our communities. And we want to go beyond keeping the lights on and natural gas flowing for our millions of customers. 
As a result, we recently launched an Ameren Cares initiative, whereby our leadership team Board of Directors and all Ameren coworkers can contribute to COVID-19 relief efforts, including energy assistance for our customers. 
Operationally, we are exercising financial discipline and taking several actions to mitigate the expected financial impacts for COVID-19 on our business. Those actions include, among other things, stringent hiring restrictions, managing spending on outside of consultants, significantly restricting travel and modifying the scope of our energies and our maintenance outages, in large part, to enhance the safety of our coworkers. 
In addition, we have taken several actions to strengthen our already solid liquidity position. Those steps included proactively accessing the capital markets earlier this year.  Michael will share some of those details with you a bit later. 
Looking ahead, we are putting the final touches on the first phase of our return facilities transition plan for our coworkers that are working remotely. Safety will remain at the top of our mind, and this transition will be done in a very measured and thoughtful way. 
We will also continue to work with state and local leaders as well as with the health care community to support reopening the regional economy in a safe, measured and timely fashion. Stay-at-home orders in Missouri were lifted on May 4. 
On the St. Louis area, those orders will be in lifting on May 18. In Illinois, the stay-in-home motor remains in place through May 30. 
Of course, we expect restrictions on economic and social activity will continue in all of our communities for some time. Since we are on essential business, these orders have not limited our operations or the execution of our strategic plan beyond the safety measures we have implemented for the protection of our coworkers and customers. 
I am very proud of our work that our coworkers have done for the last several months. 
Having said that, we are not letting our guard down. We will continue to be relentlessly focused on safety and delivering on our mission to power the quality of life for our customers and communities and managing through this unprecedented period of time. 
With that, let's now turn to Page 5 for an update on first quarter results and 2020 earnings guidance. 
Yesterday, we announced first quarter 2020 earnings of $0.59 per share compared to $0.78 per share earned in 2019. 
This slide outlines some key drivers that impacted earnings in the first quarter. While we had some items that drove earnings down compared to last year, I am pleased to tell you that we continue to effectively execute all elements of our strategic plan. 
In addition, due to the action we have taken to mitigate the expected financial impacts of COVID-19, which I described earlier, combined with the constructive outcome in our Missouri rate review, which benefited all stakeholders. 
We remain on track to deliver within our 2020 earnings guidance range or $3.40 per share to $3.60 per share. 
And affirming our 2020 guidance, we have assessed several economic scenarios and taken into consideration expectations associated with lower Missouri total electric sales, the potential for higher bad debt expenses and lower returns in our Illinois electric distribution business due to lower interest rates, among other things. 
Michael will discuss our first quarter earnings, 2020 earnings guidance and other related items in more detail later. 
Turning now to Page 6. Yesterday, we also affirmed our expectation to deliver 6% to 8% compound annual earnings per share growth from 2020 to 2024, driven by robust compound annual rate base growth of approximately 9%. 
Simply put, we continue to believe our strategy to deliver strong, long-term earnings growth remains intact. This outlook accommodates several factors, including the range of treasury rates, sales growth, spending levels, regulatory developments and impacts of COVID-19. 
And of course, earnings growth in any individual year will be impacted by the timing of capital expenditures, regulatory rate reviews and sales volumes, including those driven by weather, impacts from COVID-19 and other factors. 
Moving to Page 7. Here, we reiterate our strategic plan. The first pillar of our strategy stresses investing in and operating our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. 
This has driven our multiyear focus on investing in energy infrastructure for the long-term benefit of customers. 
As a result and as you can see on the right side of this page, during the first 3 months of this year, we invested significant capital in each of our business segments, and the pipeline remains robust. 
In addition, we remain on track to achieve our capital expenditure target for 2020. 
Regarding regulatory matters, I am pleased to report that in March, the Missouri Public Service Commission approved a constructive settlement in Ameren Missouri's electric rate review that included a $32 million annual revenue decrease. 
It incorporates lower fuel and transportation costs, taxes and regulatory asset amortization expenses, while providing for a recovery of significant infrastructure investments as well as an opportunity to earn within the implicit range of 9.4% to 9.8% return on equity on a growing Missouri rate base. 
This decrease marks the second consecutive decrease since 2018 when customers received a 6% rate cut as a result of the federal corporate income tax reduction and our Smart Energy Plan. 
In Illinois last month, we made our required annual electric distribution form in the rate update filing, requesting a $45 million base rate decrease. 
If we're approved as requested, all in 2021 residential electric rates for customers taking delivery and energy supply from Ameren and Illinois would be down approximately 1% since formula ratemaking began in 2012. 
As you can see with these rate decreases, we are clearly focused on keeping our customers cost competitive and affordable through continuous improvement and disciplined cost management, while we make significant investments in energy infrastructure to deliver long-term value. 
Michael will provide more detail about the electric and natural gas rate reviews in a moment. 
Turning now to Page 8 and the second pillar of our strategy, enhancing regulatory frameworks and advocating for responsible energy and economic policies. 
Beginning with Ameren Illinois electric distribution. The Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act was filed in February. This important legislation would allow Ameren Illinois to make significant investments in solar energy and battery storage to improve reliability as well as to make investments in transportation electrification in order to benefit customers in the economy across central and Southern Illinois. 
In addition, this legislation would modify the allowed return on equity formula to increase the basis point adder to the average 30-year treasury rate from 5 80 to 6 80 and would also extend electric formula ratemaking to 2032. 
 The Downstate Clean energy Affordability Act will move the state of Illinois closer to region its goal of 100% clean energy by 2015 and  builds on Ameren Illinois' efforts to modernize the energy grid under a transparent and stable regulatory framework that has supported significant investment to modernize the energy grid, while improving reliability and creating jobs, all while keeping rates well below the Midwest and national averages. 
With all these benefits in mind, we are focused on working with key stakeholders to get this important legislation passed. 
Prior to adjournment of the Illinois General Assembly in mid-March due to COVID-19, as Bill had advanced to the Public Utilities Committee and a Senate Bill still awaited assignment to the Energy and Public Utilities Committee. 
In light of the challenges that exist with COVID-19, it's unclear whether these bills will advance in the spring session, which is currently set to end May 31, that's extended by the leadership in the Illinois House and Senate. 
If not past the spring, these bills could also be addressed in a veto session or potentially other special sessions later this year. 
Turning to Page 9 for an update on FERC regulatory matters. In terms of the FERC's November 2019 order and its subsequent order to extend time to reconsider hearing requests, I do not have any significant updates. 
However, the FERC did recently take some constructive actions that could further support investment in transmission. 
In particular, in March, the FERC issued a notice of proposed rule-making on the electric transmission ROE incentives. 
In the notice, the FERC proposed several changes to ROE incentives, including an increase in the Regional Transmission Organization, or RTO, participation adder from 50 basis points to 100 basis points. 
For perspective, every 50 basis point change in our FERC ROE impacts annual earnings per share by approximately $0.04. 
The notice also proposes incentives on new projects by considering the benefits rather than the risks of a project. We are pleased with the direction the FERC has taken with this notice. 
It suggests that the FERC understands the importance of incentivizing transmission investment to both upgrade and replace the aging infrastructure and also enable the transition to more renewable generation across the country. 
We expect to file comments by the July 1 deadline. Of course, we are unable to predict the ultimate timing or impact of these FERC matters, as the FERC is under no timeline to issue a decision. 
Moving now to Page 10 for an update on the third pillar of our strategy, creating and capitalizing on opportunities for investment for the benefit of our customers, shareholders in the environment. 
Here, we provide an update on our wind generation investment plans to achieve compliance with Missouri's renewable energy standard and continue to transition our generation portfolio. 
We have received all regulatory approvals to acquire 700 megawatts of new wind generation at 2 sites in Missouri. Construction is well underway and continues to the both wind generation facilities. 
We continue to work closely with the developers for both projects to monitor the timely manufacturing, shipment and installation of facility components, which are coming from various parts of the world. 
We continue to expect the 400-megawatt facility to be in service by the end of 2020. 
However, the 300-megawatt facility is facing greater challenges given that this project was originally scheduled to be completed later in the year. 
The developer continues to work towards completing the entire project in 2020. However, manufacturing, shipping and other supply chain issues have negatively impacted the schedule on this project. 
We have not received formal notice from the developer that any portion of this project will be delayed beyond December 31, 2020, at this time, our discussions with the developer indicate that a completion of a portion of the project representing approximately $100 million of investment may go in service in the first quarter of 2021. 
While we would be disappointed that this entire project is not completed in 2020, it is important to keep some key factors in mind. 
First, if only this portion of this project is not completed in 2020, we would still be closing on approximately $1.1 billion or 92% of our planned 2020 wind generation investment of $1.2 billion. 
In addition, for any portion of the project completed in 2021, we have contractual protections to pay a reduced amount to account for the potential loss of production tax credits, subject to an obligation to later pay the original contracted amount should Ameren be entitled to receive those credits. 
Finally, late last week, U.S. Department of the Treasury indicated plans to modify the wind production tax credit rules, which is expected to result in a 1-year extension of in-service criteria. The bottom line is, we expect to deliver on the vast majority of our wind generation investment in 2020. We these investments will deliver clear, long-term benefits to our customers, the communities we serve and the environment. 
Finally, consistent with our goal to meet our customers' long-term energy needs in a responsible manner, we will assess additional renewable generation opportunities in the context of our next integrated resource plan, which will be filed in September of this year. 
This comprehensive stakeholder process is well underway to evaluate our future customer demand as well as generation resources needed over the next 20 years and beyond. 
We continue to work with key stakeholders in this process and are committed to transitioning Ameren Missouri's generation to a cleaner, more diverse portfolio in a responsible fashion for our customers, our shareholders in the environment. 
Moving to Page 11. Looking ahead through the end of this decade, we have a robust pipeline of investments of over $36 billion that will deliver significant value to all of our stakeholders by making our energy grid stronger, smarter and cleaner. 
These investment opportunities exclude any potential new renewable generation from the next Missouri integrated resource plan, which, as I just noted, will be filed in September, as well as any potential new multi-value transmission projects. 
Of course, our investment opportunities will not only create a stronger and cleaner energy grid to meet our customers' needs and exceed their expectations, but they will also create thousands of jobs for local economies. 
Needless to say, this is very important for our country and the communities we serve at this time. Maintaining constructive energy policies that support robust investment in energy infrastructure will be critical to meeting our customers' countries [Audio Gap] future energy needs and position us well for future success in 2020 and over the next decade, we'll deliver superior value to our customers, shareholders in the environment. 
We believe the expectation of a 6% to 8% earnings per share compound annual growth rate from 2020 through 2024, driven by strong rate base growth compares very favorably with our regulated utility peers. 
I am confident in our ability to execute our investment plans and strategies across all 4 of our business segments, as we have an experienced and dedicated team to get it done. 
Further, our shares continue to offer investors a solid dividend. Our strong earnings growth expectations outlined today position us well for future dividend growth. 
Of course, future dividend decisions will be driven by earnings growth in addition to cash flows and other business conditions. 
Together, we believe our strong earnings growth outlook, combined with our solid dividend, results in a very attractive total return opportunity for shareholders. 
Before I turn the call over to Michael, I'd like to mention an important report that we recently issued. 
Just last week, we published the Annual Ameren Sustainability Report. This report outlines how we are effectively managing a wide range of environmental, social and governance matters for the benefit of all stakeholders. 
I encourage you to read it in amereninvestors.com. Again, thank you all for joining us today. I'll now turn the call over to Michael."

The key factors that drove the ov",2411,"Thanks, Warner, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 14 of our presentation. Today, we reported first quarter 2020 earnings of $0.59 per share compared to earnings of $0.78 per share for the year ago quarter. 
The key factors that drove the overall $0.19 per share decrease are highlighted by segment on this page. 
Earnings for our Missouri, our largest segment, were down $0.20 per share. The results reflected lower electric retail sales, primarily driven by mild temperatures in 2020 compared to colder-than-normal temperatures in the year ago period as well as the absence of energy efficiency, performance incentives in the first quarter of 2020, which, combined, reduced earnings by $0.11 per share. 
In addition, earnings were impacted by higher operations and maintenance expenses, which reduced earnings by $0.08 per share. 
This increase in operation and maintenance expense was primarily driven by changes in the cash surrender value of our company-owned life insurance. 
Finally, under terms of the Missouri Rate Review Settlement in order, we recognized a onetime charitable contributions in the first quarter, which reduced earnings by $0.02 per share. 
Earnings per Ameren Illinois natural gas were slightly lower due to higher operation and maintenance expenses, also due to change in the cash surrender value of COLI, mostly offset by increased investments in infrastructure. 
Ameren Illinois electric distribution earnings were flat, reflecting increased investments in infrastructure, offset by a lower allowed return on equity. 
Ameren transmission earnings were $0.01 per share higher due to an increased investments in infrastructure, partially offset by a lower allowed return on equity. 
Finally, Ameren parent and other results also increased $0.01 per share, driven primarily by the timing of income tax expense, which is not expected to impact full year earnings, offset by reduced tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. 
Before moving on, let me briefly cover electric sales trends for our Missouri and Ameren Illinois electric distribution for the first 3 months of this year compared to the first 3 months of last year. 
While we did see an impact on electric margins for Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois electric distribution due to COVID-19, the impact was not material in the first quarter due in part to the timing of the stay-at-home orders in Illinois that began March 21 and the state-at-home orders in the city, St. Louis City and St. Louis County that began March 23. 
In addition, March is a month. As a result, we tend to have less earnings exposure to large percentage changes in sales than we would otherwise have in the winter or summer months. 
Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Missouri residential customers increased 2.5%, excluding the effects of our Missouri energy efficiency plan in EMEA. 
Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales in Missouri commercial and industrial customers decreased 1.5% and 2%, respectively, after excluding the effects of our energy efficiency plan. 
We exclude because the plan provides rate recovery to ensure that earnings are not affected by the reduced electric sales resulting from our energy efficiency efforts. 
Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois residential customers increased about 1% and  weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois commercial and industrial customers decreased 1.5% and 2%, respectively. 
Recall that changes in electric sales in Illinois, no matter the cause, do not affect our earnings since we have full revenue decoupling. 
I'll touch a bit more on sales expectations for the second quarter and the balance of the year in a moment. 
Turning to Page 15. As you think about the financial uncertainties for the remainder of the year due to COVID-19, this page lays out the regulatory mechanisms available in our business segments to mitigate certain COVID-19 uncertainties, including lower sales revenues, higher bad debt and pension expense. 
As you can see on this slide, we have constructive regulatory mechanisms to address these uncertainties for business segments that accounted for approximately 50% of our 2019 earnings. 
We have limited exposure to changes in sales in Illinois as we are fully decoupled in our electric distribution business as well as for residential and small nonresidential natural gas sales. 
In addition, any variance in bad debt expense in Illinois recovered through the electric and gas uncollectible adjustment writers. 
Also, formula rates in our Ameren transmission business provide for a recovery of any variance in revenues, bad debt expense or pension expense. 
In Missouri, we currently do not have any -- have a regulatory mechanism to mitigate the financial impacts of changes in sales volume or bad debt expense. 
For perspective, approximately 50% of our annual Missouri electric margins are residential, 40% are commercial and 10% are industrial. 
The earnings impact of a 1% change in annual sales in 2020 by class is approximately $0.03 for residential, $0.02 for commercial and a half cent for industrial. 
It should be noted that we have seasonal electric rates in Missouri. Because of seasonal rates, approximately 50% of our electric margins are typically realized from June through September, assuming normal weather. 
We are mining the financial impacts of COVID-19 and have the ability to seek an accounting authority order from the Missouri PSC to track such impacts or recovery in a future rate review. 
Finally, any variance in pension expense from Missouri is recovered through a pension tracker. 
With that in mind, turning to Page 16, I would like to briefly touch on key drivers impacting our 2020 earnings guidance. 
As Warner stated, we continue to expect 2020 diluted earnings to be in the range of $3.40 to $3.60 per share. This guidance range assumes normal weather in the remaining 9 months of the year as well as reflects several other updates from our February call, primarily related to COVID-19. 
While it's still very difficult to predict the ultimate impact of COVID-19 in our business, our team viewed several COVID-19 scenarios incorporated what we believe are prudent and reasonable assumptions into our earnings guidance. 
Our guidance contemplates the state-at-home orders currently in effect. 
As Warner mentioned, the Governor of Missouri lifted the statewide state-at-home order on May 4, although St. Louis City and County will begin lifting in their orders on May 18. 
While these restrictions are being lifted in May, our guidance assumes limited business activity during the entire second quarter, which will significantly impact commercial and industrial sales, while favorably impacting residential sales. 
As the year goes on, we expect to see commercial industrial sales improve in the third and fourth quarters, but never fully recovering by year-end. We also expect residential sales to taper off as the year goes on, especially in the fall when school is open. 
As a result, our guidance assumes a gradual recovery. As we sit here today, we expect lower sales in a Missouri due to COVID-19 to reduce earnings approximately $0.10 per share compared to 2019 weather normalized sales. 
For the year, we expect total weather-normalized sales to be down approximately 2.5%. Broken down by class, we expect 2020 commercial sales to decline approximately 7%, industrial decline approximately 4% and residential to increase approximately 2.5%. 
Before moving on, I would note that Ameren Missouri customer sales for April, excluding the impact of colder-than-normal weather, were down approximately 7%, reflecting the negative impact from COVID-19 compared to the prior year.  Broken down by class and compared to the prior year, preliminary Missouri April weather-normalized commercial and industrial sales declined approximately 15% and 10%, respectively, which more than offset the margins on increased weather-normalized sales to residential customers of approximately 6%. 
Similar to March, April and May are mild weather months. As a result, our annual earnings have less exposure to large percentage changes in residential and commercial sales than in those months. 
Moving on to other guidance considerations. Despite the extensive federal actions being taken to provide COVID-19 relief to individual and businesses across the country as well as the energy assistance funding then is providing. 
We understand that some customers will still say challenges in paying their bills, and we incorporate an increase in bad debt expense into our guidance for the balance of the year. 
Today's guidance also incorporates an estimated 2020 ROE for Ameren Illinois electric distribution of 7.3%, which reflects a 30-year treasury yield of approximately 1.5% as well as an increase in parent interest expense associated with the accelerated $800 million note issuance at Ameren Corp., which I'll touch on more in a moment. 
On the positive side, we've incorporated the final terms of the Ameren Missouri Electric Rate Review Settlement, which we'll discuss later as well. 
In addition, as Warner mentioned, we've already taken certain actions put in place other actions to reduce cost to help mitigate the expected negative financial impacts of COVID-19. 
Rest assured, we will remain very disciplined in managing our costs for the remainder of the year. 
Finally, select earnings considerations by quarter for the balance of the Are listed on this page. 
Moving now to Page 17 for a discussion of Ameren Missouri regulatory matters. In March, the PSC approved a stipulation and agreement that resolved the Ameren Missouri rate review. 
As many of you know, the agreement was a black box settlement, and therefore, the final order does not provide certain specific details. Effective April 1, base electric revenues were decreased by $32 million annually or a decrease of approximately 1%. 80% of which we expect to realize this year. 
Concurrently, net base energy costs, which will be the basis used for prospective changes to the fuel adjustment clause rider, decreased by approximately $115 million annually. 
In addition, net regulatory asset and liability amortization expenses and the base level of expenses for regulatory tracking mechanisms reduced by approximately $50 million annually. 
The agreement did not specify and allow ROE a rate base level or a common equity ratio. However, the PSC determined that an implicit ROE in the range of 9.4% to 9.8% is reasonable. 
In the absence of a stated ROE, our goal continues to be earned as close to 9.6%, the midpoint of the ROE range as possible. 
The agreement also called for a continued use of a 9.53% ROE to calculate allowance for funds used during construction. 
Finally, the approved agreement provided for a continuation of key trackers and riders, including the fuel adjustment clause, where the sharing percentage of 95 5 was affirmed by the commission in April. 
Looking ahead, we will continue to assess the timing of our next Missouri rate review. In making this determination, we will take into account consideration of the constructive rate settlement of this recent rate review; the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 on our customers and our business; our capital expenditures, including the planned wind acquisitions, coupled with the flexibility provided by Senate Bill 564 Plan and Service Accounting and other cost of service considerations. 
Turning to Page 18 for a financing and liquidity update. We feel very good about our liquidity and financial position today, in particular, after taking a number of steps in March, in early April to access the capital markets. 
On March '20, Ameren Missouri issued $465 million of 2.95% first mortgage bond due in 2030. This tied for the lowest rate for a 10-year bond issuance in Ameren Missouri's history, which helps keep customers rates low as proceeds were used to repay short-term debt, including short-term debt incurred to repay a maturity in a $85 million of 5% senior unsecured notes that matured on February 1. 
Additionally, on April 3, Ameren Corp. issued $800 million of 3.5% senior unsecured notes due in 2031. These proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including to repay short-term debt and to fund the repayment of Ameren Corp.'s 2.7% senior notes due November 15, which is the only maturity remaining in 2020. 
We decided to accelerate the holding company debt offering to secure our liquidity position during an uncertain time in the credit markets. 
We continue to expect to issue long-term debt at later this year to fund a portion of the wind generation investments expected to be in-service by the end of 2020. And I would note there are no long-term debt maturities in 2021. 
In December, we also increased the capacity of our credit facilities by $200 million and extended the maturity dates out to December 2024. 
Ameren's available liquidity on April 30 was approximately $2.5 billion. This includes the $2.3 billion of combined credit facilities available and approximately $150 million of cash on hand at the end of the month. 
There are no outstanding credit facility or commercial paper borrowings as of April 30. 
In addition, we also expect to receive between $540 million and $550 million upon the physical settlement of the August 2019 forward sale agreement on or before March 31, 2021, which is expected to be used to fund a portion of the Ameren Missouri's wind generation investments. 
Finally, I'm pleased to report that last month, both Moody's and S&P affirmed their credit rating outlooks of stable. 
Moving now to Page 19 for an update on Ameren Illinois regulatory matters. Last month, we made our required annual electric distribution formula rate update filing, requesting a $45 million base rate decrease. 
Under Illinois formula ratemaking, Ameren Illinois is required to make an annual rate updates to systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost of service and to true-up any prior period over or under recoveries of such costs. 
If approved, as requested, all in 2021 residential electric rates for customers taking delivery and energy supply for Ameren Illinois would be down by approximately 1% since formula ratemaking began in 2012. 
The ICC will review the matter in the months ahead with a decision expected in December of this year and new rates effective in January of next year. 
This, along with our natural gas rate review, remain on track. 
Finally, turning to Page 20, I'll summarize. We have a strong team and are well positioned to continue executing on our plan during these unprecedented times. We continue to expect to deliver strong earnings growth in 2020 as we successfully execute our strategy. 
As we look to the longer term, we continue to expect strong earnings per share growth driven by robust rate base growth and disciplined cost management. 
Further, we believe this growth compares very favorably with the growth of our regulated utility peers.  And Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. 
In total, we have an attractive total shareholder returns very favorably to our peers. This concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

And so those coupled with the fact that we just completed our last rate review, and those are some of the things that you would put on the list in terms of making a final determination there.

Of course, Senate Bill 564, the Plan and Service Accounting has really provided us some better flexibility on capital expenditures and the ability to be able to defer depreciation, return and get full recovery.  So that's a consideration. 
But as Warner said, we feel good about the constructive rate settlement that we just had in this past rate review. I think that puts us in a good position to really think about the timing going forward. 
COVID-19, obviously having impacts on our customers and our business, as Warner mentioned. And so all of those will be considerations as well as other cost of service considerations that will go into it.

But as we step back and look at and going back to '08, '09, you're right, I think that's a great place for us to spend some time. I mean, we've done a nice job of driving down bad debt over time. We're probably at about $8 million today in bad debt expense. 
If you think about '08, '09 time frame, you're probably closer to $14 million, $15 million. So that's probably a good proxy to think about in terms of a couple of cents, about $6 million in terms of headwind potentially associated with bad debt expense."

I think as you think about the long-term guidance, and if you think about the 3 50 is the midpoint for 2020 and you take the  6 to 8 off of that, Paul, I mean, you get to about a $0.35 range out there in 20",224,"And -- okay, got it.

So a decent size range. 
I think that range accommodates a number of things, which I think Warren maybe even referred to us earlier. I mean, it refers potential treasury outcomes, certainly rate case outcomes, the timing of Capex, other things. I mean, there are a number of levers that can be pulled over time. 
I would remind you a couple of, I think, key data points just to keep in mind. I mean, for every 50 basis points move in that distribution business, it's worth about -- it's an impact of about 3.5 cents. 
And the other thing to keep in mind, too, is, I mean, as you think about how we're allocating capital today and where rate base growth is going over time, I mean, you get out to 2024, that Illinois distribution business is only about 18% of the overall rate base. So those are things just to keep in the back of your mind as you think about different impacts associated with that $0.35 range."

So maybe I'll add then a little bit more color because you had a specific question around how we might think about our investments in Illinois. 
So look, we're mindful of the fact that our return on equity in Illinois is below industry averages. And I mean, that's why we're supporting legislation that's going to add 100 basis points to the current 580 basis points to the 30-year treasury. 
And so  at the same time, too, we recognized that we're currently in, frankly, unprecedented period in our country's history, that's obviously driving historically low interest rates. 
And so what I would say is that, look, we're not going to have a knee-jerk reaction to our investment strategy because the investments that we've been making in Illinois have been delivering value to both our customers and shareholders. 
But look, we're also going to continue to monitor the situation. And at the same time, Rich and his team, they're going to be relentless and  trying to make sure we pass what we think is really good legislation for our customers, the state of Illinois and certainly for our shareholders. 
And in so doing, we're going to continue to advocate for fair returns on those infrastructure investments. And then so doing to, we think if we continue to make them, they're going to deliver a lot of value to our customers. So that's the color. That's in terms of how we think about it right now."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This morning, I'm going to begin our presentation by providing a COVID-19 update and, in particular, highlighting some of the key efforts we are taking for the safety and security of our coworkers and customers during this difficult time, while providing the central electric and natural gas service. I will then touch on our first quarter results and 2020 earnings guidance. Finally, I will discuss our long-term growth prospects while highlighting some important strategic matters that will position Ameren for future success.
Before I jump into the details, I hope that you, your families and colleagues are safe and healthy during this unprecedented time. As our world works to address COVID-19, many things are uncertain. But the Ameren's commitment to safety of our coworkers, our customers and our communities remains constant. At Ameren, we never compromise on safety, it is one of our core values.
I want to express my profound appreciation for those who are on the front lines battling this virus. To the health care workers, first responders, grocery store workers, local leaders, community workers and, of course, all utility workers across our nation, thank you. In particular, I want to express my sincere appreciation to my Ameren coworkers, who remain focused every day on delivering safe, reliable power and natural gas to millions of people in Missouri and Illinois.
To ensure that we could continue to deliver safe and reliable service, we took swift action in January and assembled a cross-functional crisis management response team following reports about threats related to COVID-19. Since January, our team has been planning and implementing a pandemic response, consistent with established guidelines and industry best practices as well as in consultation with world-class health experts and state and local government leaders. We quickly restricted domestic and international travel and implemented from -- work-from-home policies for anyone that could to limit exposure of our coworkers. Of course, our coworkers are crucial to the execution of our mission and many continue to be out in our communities and in our energy centers every day, keeping the lights on and the natural gas flowing for millions of customers in Missouri and Illinois.
Our actions to continue safe operations also included securing and supplying personal protective equipment, separating work crews, adjusting more schedules, performing robust health screenings at home and on-site and of course, practicing social distancing with coworkers and customers. Our transition to our new work practices went very well. Not only were we able to quickly take significant actions to protect the safety of our coworkers and customers, we have been able to continue executing our projects and strategic plan across our entire business.
We also recognize this is a difficult time for many of our customers, who are struggling financially due to lost wages and other circumstances related to COVID-19. That's why we currently have voluntarily suspended all electric and gas disconnects for nonpayment and waived all late payment fees for customers unable to pay their energy bill on time. In addition, we have contributed $1 million in energy assistance and nearly $1 million to fund other COVID-19 relief efforts to help families and businesses in our Illinois and Missouri communities, and we're not done helping our customers and our communities.
As part of our Ameren Missouri rate review settlement, we are working with Missouri Office of the Public Counsel to provide another $3.5 million in energy assistance funds for Missouri residential customers in need. Our proposal is pending approval from Missouri Public Service Commission. In addition, we live and work in our communities. And we want to go beyond keeping the lights on and natural gas flowing for our millions of customers. As a result, we recently launched an Ameren Cares initiative, whereby our leadership team, Board of Directors and all Ameren coworkers can contribute to COVID-19 relief efforts, including energy assistance for our customers.
Operationally, we are exercising financial discipline and taking several actions to mitigate the expected financial impacts of COVID-19 on our business. Those actions include, among other things, stringent hiring restrictions, managing spending on outside of consultants, significantly restricting travel and modifying the scope of our energies and our maintenance outages, in large part, to enhance the safety of our coworkers. In addition, we have taken several actions to strengthen our already solid liquidity position. Those steps included proactively accessing the capital markets earlier this year. Michael will share some of those details with you a bit later.
Looking ahead, we are putting the final touches on the first phase of our return to facilities transition plan for our coworkers that are working remotely. Safety will remain at the top of our mind, and this transition will be done in a very measured and thoughtful way. We will also continue to work with state and local leaders as well as with the health care community to support reopening of regional economy in a safe, measured and timely fashion. Stay-at-home orders in Missouri were lifted on May 4. On the St. Louis area, those orders will be lifting on May 18. In Illinois, the stay-at-home motor remains in place through May 30.
Of course, we expect restrictions on economic and social activity will continue in all of our communities for some time. Since we are an essential business, these orders should not limit our operations or the execution of our strategic plan beyond the safety measures we have implemented for the protection of our coworkers and customers. I am very proud of our work that our coworkers have done over the last several months. Having said that, we are not letting our guard down. We will continue to be relentlessly focused on safety and delivering on our mission to power the quality of life for our customers and communities and managing through this unprecedented period of time.
With that, let's now turn to Page 5 for an update on first quarter results and 2020 earnings guidance. Yesterday, we announced first quarter 2020 earnings of $0.59 per share compared to $0.78 per share earned in 2019. This slide outlines some of the key drivers that impacted earnings in the first quarter. While we had some items that drove earnings down compared to last year, I am pleased to tell you that we continue to effectively execute all elements of our strategic plan. In addition, due to the actions we have taken to mitigate the expected financial impacts of COVID-19, which I described earlier, combined with the constructive outcome in our Missouri rate review, which benefited all stakeholders, we remain on track to deliver within our 2020 earnings guidance range or $3.40 per share to $3.60 per share.
In affirming our 2020 guidance, we have assessed several economic scenarios and taken into consideration expectations associated with lower Missouri total electric sales, the potential for higher bad debt expenses and lower returns in our Illinois electric distribution business due to lower interest rates, among other things. Michael will discuss our first quarter earnings, 2020 earnings guidance and other related items in more detail later.
Turning now to Page 6. Yesterday, we also affirmed our expectation to deliver 6% to 8% compound annual earnings per share growth from 2020 to 2024, driven by robust compound annual rate base growth of approximately 9%. Simply put, we continue to believe our strategy to deliver strong, long-term earnings growth remains intact. This outlook accommodates several factors, including the range of treasury rates, sales growth, spending levels, regulatory developments and impacts of COVID-19. And of course, earnings growth in any individual year will be impacted by the timing of capital expenditures, regulatory rate reviews and sales volumes, including those driven by weather, impacts from COVID-19 and other factors.
Moving to Page 7. Here, we reiterate our strategic plan. The first pillar of our strategy stresses investing in and operating our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. This has driven our multiyear focus on investing in energy infrastructure for the long-term benefit of customers. As a result, and as you can see on the right side of this page, during the first 3 months of this year, we invested significant capital in each of our business segments, and the pipeline remains robust. In addition, we remain on track to achieve our capital expenditure target for 2020.
Regarding regulatory matters, I am pleased to report that in March the Missouri Public Service Commission approved a constructive settlement in Ameren Missouri's electric rate review that included a $32 million annual revenue decrease. It incorporates lower fuel and transportation costs, taxes and regulatory asset amortization expenses, while providing for recovery of significant infrastructure investments as well as an opportunity to earn within the implicit range of 9.4% to 9.8% return on equity on a growing Missouri rate base. This decrease marks the second consecutive decrease since 2018 when customers received a 6% rate cut as a result of the federal corporate income tax reduction and our Smart Energy Plan.
In Illinois last month, we made our required annual electric distribution formula rate update filing, requesting a $45 million base rate decrease. If we're approved as requested, all-in 2021 residential electric rates for customers taking delivery and energy supply from Ameren Illinois would be down approximately 1% since formula ratemaking began in 2012. As you can see with these rate decreases, we are clearly focused on keeping our customers cost competitive and affordable through continuous improvement and disciplined cost management, while we make significant investments in energy infrastructure to deliver long-term value. Michael will provide more detail about the electric and natural gas rate reviews in a moment.
Turning now to Page 8 and the second pillar of our strategy, enhancing regulatory frameworks and advocating for responsible energy and economic policies, beginning with Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution. The Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act legislation was filed in February. This important legislation would allow Ameren Illinois to make significant investments in solar energy and battery storage to improve reliability as well as to make investments in transportation electrification in order to benefit customers and the economy across Central and Southern Illinois. In addition, this legislation would modify the allowed return on equity formula to increase the basis point adder to the average 30-year treasury rate from 580 basis points to 680 basis points and would also extend electric formula ratemaking to 2032.
The Downstate Clean energy Affordability Act will move the state of Illinois closer to reaching its goal of 100% clean energy by 2050, and builds on Ameren Illinois' efforts to modernize the energy grid under a transparent and stable regulatory framework that has supported significant investment to modernize the energy grid, while improving reliability and creating jobs, all while keeping rates well below the Midwest and national averages. With all these benefits in mind, we are focused on working with key stakeholders to get this important legislation passed.
Prior to adjournment of the Illinois General Assembly in mid-March due to COVID-19, the House Bill had advanced to the Public Utilities Committee and a Senate Bill still awaited assignment to the Energy and Public Utilities Committee. In light of the challenges that exist with COVID-19, it's unclear whether these bills will advance in the spring session, which is currently set to end May 31, that's extended by the leadership in the Illinois House and Senate. If not past the spring, these bills could also be addressed in a veto session or potentially other special sessions later this year.
Turning to Page 9 for an update on FERC regulatory matters. In terms of the FERC's November 2019 order and its subsequent order to extend time to reconsider hearing requests, I do not have any significant updates. However, the FERC did recently take some constructive actions that could further support investment in transmission. In particular, in March, the FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on electric transmission ROE incentives.
In the notice, the FERC proposed several changes to ROE incentives, including an increase in the regional transmission organization, or RTO, participation adder from 50 basis points to 100 basis points. For perspective, every 50 basis point change in our FERC ROE impacts annual earnings per share by approximately $0.04. The notice also proposes incentives on new projects by considering the benefits rather than the risks of a project. We are pleased with the direction the FERC has taken with this notice. It suggests that the FERC understands the importance of incentivizing transmission investment to both upgrade and replace the aging infrastructure and to also enable the transition to more renewable generation across the country. We expect to file comments by the July 1st deadline. Of course, we are unable to predict the ultimate timing or impact of these FERC matters as the FERC is under no time line to issue a decision.
Moving now to Page 10 for an update on the third pillar of our strategy, creating and capitalizing on opportunities for investment for the benefit of our customers, shareholders and the environment. Here, we provide an update on our wind generation investment plans to achieve compliance with Missouri's renewable energy standard and continue to transition our generation portfolio. We've received all regulatory approvals to acquire 700 megawatts of new wind generation at 2 sites in Missouri. Construction is well underway and continues at both wind generation facilities. We continue to work closely with the developers for both projects to monitor the timely manufacturing, shipment and installation of facility components, which are coming from various parts of the world.
We continue to expect the 400-megawatt facility to be in service by the end of 2020. However, the 300-megawatt facility is facing greater challenges, given that this project was originally scheduled to be completed later in the year. The developer continues to work towards completing the entire project in 2020. However, manufacturing, shipping and other supply chain issues have negatively impacted the schedule on this project. While we have not received formal notice from the developer that any portion of this project will be delayed beyond December 31, 2020, at this time, our discussions with the developer indicate that completion of a portion of the project representing approximately $100 million of investment may go in service in the first quarter of 2021.
While we would be disappointed that this entire project is not completed in 2020, it is important to keep some key factors in mind. First, if only this portion of this project is not completed in 2020, we would still be closing on approximately $1.1 billion or 92% of our planned 2020 wind generation investment of $1.2 billion. In addition, for any portion of the project completed in 2021, we have contractual protections to pay a reduced amount to account for the potential loss of production tax credits, subject to an obligation to later pay the original contracted amount should Ameren be entitled to receive those credits. 
Finally, late last week, U.S. Department of the Treasury indicated plans to modify the wind production tax credit rules, which is expected to result in a 1-year extension of in-service criteria. The bottom line is, we expect to deliver on the vast majority of our wind generation investment in 2020. We believe these investments will deliver clear, long-term benefits to our customers, the communities we serve and the environment.
Finally, consistent with our goal to meet our customers' long-term energy needs in a responsible manner, we will assess additional renewable generation opportunities in the context of our next integrated resource plan, which will be filed in September of this year. This comprehensive stakeholder process is well underway to evaluate our future customer demand as well as generation resources needed over the next 20 years and beyond. We continue to work with key stakeholders in this process and are committed to transitioning Ameren Missouri's generation to a cleaner, more diverse portfolio in a responsible fashion for our customers, our shareholders and the environment.
Moving to Page 11. Looking ahead through the end of this decade, we have a robust pipeline of investments of over $36 billion that will deliver significant value to all of our stakeholders by making our energy grid stronger, smarter and cleaner. These investment opportunities exclude any potential new renewable generation from the next Missouri integrated resource plan, which, as I just noted, will be filed in September as well as any potential new multi-value transmission projects. Of course, our investment opportunities will not only create a stronger and cleaner energy grid to meet our customers' needs and exceed their expectations, but they will also create thousands of jobs for local economies. Needless to say, this is very important for our country and the communities we serve at this time.
Maintaining constructive energy policies that support robust investment in energy infrastructure will be critical to meeting our customers -- country's future energy needs and delivering on our customers' expectations. 
Moving to Page 12. To sum up our value proposition, while the current environment is challenging, we are optimistic about the future. The consistent execution of our strategy over many years and on many fronts has positioned us well for future success. We remain firmly convinced that the execution of this same strategy in 2020 and over the next decade will deliver superior value to our customers, shareholders and the environment. We believe the expectation of a 6% to 8% earnings per share compound annual growth rate from 2020 through 2024 driven by strong rate base growth compares very favorably with our regulated utility peers. I am confident in our ability to execute our investment plans and strategies across all 4 of our business segments as we have an experienced and dedicated team to get it done.
Further, our shares continue to offer investors a solid dividend. Our strong earnings growth expectations outlined today position us well for future dividend growth. Of course, future dividend decisions will be driven by earnings growth in addition to cash flows and other business conditions. Together, we believe our strong earnings growth outlook, combined with our solid dividend, results in a very attractive total return opportunity for shareholders. 
Before I turn the call over to Michael, I'd like to mention an important report that we recently issued. Just last week, we published the Annual Ameren Sustainability Report. This report outlines how we are effectively managing a wide range of environmental, social and governance matters for the benefit of all stakeholders. I encourage you to read it at amereninvestors.com.
Again, thank you all for joining us today. I'll now turn the call over to Michael."
373264,664345768,1982386,"Ameren Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 12, 2020",2020-05-12,"Earnings Calls","Ameren Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Warner, and good morning, everyone.

The key factors that drove the over",2419,"Thanks, Warner, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 14 of our presentation. Today, we reported first quarter 2020 earnings of $0.59 per share compared to earnings of $0.78 per share for the year ago quarter. The key factors that drove the overall $0.19 per share decrease are highlighted by segment on this page.
Earnings from Missouri, our largest segment, were down $0.20 per share. The results reflected lower electric retail sales, primarily driven by mild winter temperatures in 2020 compared to colder-than-normal temperatures in the year ago period as well as the absence of energy efficiency performance incentives in the first quarter of 2020, which, combined, reduced earnings by $0.11 per share. In addition, earnings were impacted by higher operations and maintenance expenses, which reduced earnings by $0.08 per share. This increase in operation and maintenance expense was primarily driven by changes in the cash surrender value of our company-owned life insurance. Finally, under terms of the Missouri rate review settlement in order, we recognized a onetime charitable contributions in the first quarter, which reduced earnings by $0.02 per share.
Earnings for Ameren Illinois natural gas were slightly lower due to higher operation and maintenance expenses, also due to change in the cash surrender value of COLI, mostly offset by increased investments in infrastructure. Ameren Illinois electric distribution earnings were flat, reflecting increased investments in infrastructure, offset by a lower allowed return on equity. Ameren transmission earnings were $0.01 per share higher due to an increased investments in infrastructure, partially offset by a lower allowed return on equity.
Finally, Ameren parent and Other results also increased $0.01 per share, driven primarily by the timing of income tax expense, which is not expected to impact full year earnings, offset by reduced tax benefits associated with share-based compensation.
Before moving on, let me briefly cover electric sales trends for our Missouri and Ameren Illinois electric distribution for the first 3 months of this year compared to the first 3 months of last year. While we did see an impact on electric margins for Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois electric distribution due to COVID-19, the impact was not material in the first quarter due in part to the timing of the stay-at-home orders in Illinois that began March 21 and the stay-at-home orders in the city -- St. Louis City and St. Louis County that began March 23. In addition, March is a solar month. As a result, we tend to have less earnings exposure to large percentage changes in sales than we would otherwise have in the winter or summer months.
Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Missouri residential customers increased 2.5%, excluding the effects of our Missouri Energy Efficiency Plan under MEEIA. Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Missouri commercial and industrial customers decreased 1.5% and 2%, respectively, after excluding the effects of our energy efficiency plan. We exclude MEEIA effects because the plan provides rate recovery to ensure that earnings are not affected by the reduced electric sales resulting from our energy efficiency efforts.
Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois residential customers increased about 1% and weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois commercial and industrial customers decreased 1.5% and 2%, respectively. Recall that changes in electric sales in Illinois, no matter the cause, do not affect our earnings since we have full revenue decoupling. I'll touch a bit more on sales expectations for the second quarter and the balance of the year in a moment.
Turning to Page 15. As you think about the financial uncertainties for the remainder of the year due to COVID-19, this page lays out the regulatory mechanisms available in our business segments to mitigate certain COVID-19 uncertainties, including lower sales revenues, higher bad debt and pension expense. As you can see on this slide, we have constructive regulatory mechanisms to address these uncertainties for business segments that accounted for approximately 50% of our 2019 earnings. We have limited exposure to changes in sales in Illinois as we are fully decoupled in our electric distribution business as well as for residential and small nonresidential natural gas sales. 
In addition, any variance in bad debt expense in Illinois are recovered through the electric and gas uncollectible adjustment riders. Also, formula rates in our Ameren transmission business provide for a recovery of any variance in revenues, bad debt expense or pension expense. In Missouri, we currently do not have any -- have a regulatory mechanism to mitigate the financial impacts of changes in sales volume or bad debt expense.
For perspective, approximately 50% of our annual Missouri electric margins are residential, 40% are commercial and 10% are industrial. The earnings impact of a 1% change in annual sales in 2020 by class is approximately $0.03 for residential, $0.02 for commercial and $0.005 for industrial. It should be noted that we have seasonal electric rates in Missouri. Because of seasonal rates, approximately 50% of our electric margins are typically realized from June through September, assuming normal weather. We are mining the financial impacts of COVID-19 and have the ability to seek an accounting authority order from the Missouri PSC to track such impacts for recovery in a future rate review. Finally, any variance in pension expense from Missouri is recovered through a pension tracker.
With that in mind, turning to Page 16, I'd like to briefly touch on key drivers impacting our 2020 earnings guidance. As Warner stated, we continue to expect 2020 diluted earnings to be in the range of $3.40 to $3.60 per share. This guidance range assumes normal weather in the remaining 9 months of the year as well as reflects several other updates from our February call, primarily related to COVID-19. While it's still very difficult to predict the ultimate impacts of COVID-19 on our business, our team viewed several COVID-19 scenarios incorporated what we believe are prudent and reasonable assumptions into our earnings guidance.
Our guidance contemplates the stay-at-home orders currently in effect. As Warner mentioned, the Governor of Missouri lifted the statewide stay-at-home order on May 4, although St. Louis City and County will begin lifting in their orders on May 18. While these restrictions are being lifted in May, our guidance assumes limited business activity during the entire second quarter, which will significantly impact commercial and industrial sales, while favorably impacting residential sales. As the year goes on, we expect to see commercial and industrial sales improve in the third and fourth quarters, but never fully recovering by year-end. We also expect residential sales to taper off as the year goes on, especially in the fall when schools reopen. As a result, our guidance assumes a gradual recovery.
As we sit here today, we expect lower sales in Missouri due to COVID-19 to reduce earnings approximately $0.10 per share compared to 2019 weather-normalized sales. For the year, we expect total weather-normalized sales to be down approximately 2.5%. Broken down by class, we expect 2020 commercial sales to decline approximately 7%, industrial to decline approximately 4% and residential to increase approximately 2.5%.
Before moving on, I would note that Ameren Missouri customer sales for April, excluding the impact of colder-than-normal weather, were down approximately 7%, reflecting the negative impact from COVID-19 compared to the prior year. Broken down by class and compared to the prior year, preliminary Ameren Missouri April weather-normalized commercial and industrial sales declined approximately 15% and 10%, respectively, which more than offset the margins on increased weather-normalized sales to residential customers of approximately 6%. Similar to March, April and May are mild weather months. As a result, our annual earnings have less exposure to large percentage changes in residential and commercial sales than in those months.
Moving on to other guidance considerations. Despite the extensive federal actions being taken to provide COVID-19 relief to individual and businesses across the country as well as the energy assistance funding that Ameren is providing, we understand that some customers will still face challenges in paying their bills, and we incorporated an increase in bad debt expense into our guidance for the balance of the year.
Today's guidance also incorporates an estimated 2020 allowed ROE for Ameren Illinois electric distribution of 7.3%, which reflects a 30-year treasury yield of approximately 1.5% as well as an increase in parent interest expense associated with the accelerated $800 million note issuance at Ameren Corp., which I'll touch on more in a moment.
On the positive side, we've incorporated the final terms of the Ameren Missouri Electric rate review settlement, which we'll discuss later as well. In addition, as Warner mentioned, we've already taken certain actions, put in place other actions to reduce cost to help mitigate the expected negative financial impacts of COVID-19. Rest assured, we will remain very disciplined in managing our costs for the remainder of the year. Finally, select earnings considerations by quarter for the balance of the year are listed on this page. 
Moving now to Page 17 for a discussion of Ameren Missouri regulatory matters. In March, the PSC approved a stipulation and agreement that resolved the Ameren Missouri rate review. As many of you know, the agreement was a black box settlement, and therefore, the final order does not provide certain specific details. Effective April 1, base electric revenues were decreased by $32 million annually or a decrease of approximately 1%, 80% of which we expect to realize this year. Concurrently, net base energy costs, which will be the basis used for prospective changes to the fuel adjustment clause rider, decreased by approximately $115 million annually. In addition, net regulatory asset and liability amortization expenses and the base level of expenses for regulatory tracking mechanisms reduced by approximately $50 million annually.
The agreement did not specify an allowed ROE at rate base level or a common equity ratio. However, the PSC determined that an implicit ROE in the range of 9.4% to 9.8% is reasonable. In the absence of a stated ROE, our goal continues to be earn as close to 9.6%, the midpoint of the ROE range as possible. The agreement also called for a continued use of a 9.53% ROE to calculate allowance for funds used during construction. Finally, the approved agreement provided for a continuation of key trackers and riders, including the fuel adjustment clause, where the sharing percentage of 95%-5% was affirmed by the commission in April. 
Looking ahead, we will continue to assess the timing of our next Missouri rate review. In making this determination, we will take into account consideration of the constructive rate settlement of this recent rate review; the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 on our customers and our business; our capital expenditures, including the planned wind acquisitions coupled with the flexibility provided by Senate Bill 564 Plan and Service Accounting and other cost of service considerations.
Turning to Page 18 for a financing and liquidity update. We feel very good about our liquidity and financial position today, in particular, after taking a number of steps in March and early April to access the capital markets. On March 20, Ameren Missouri issued $465 million of 2.95% first mortgage bond due in 2030. This tied for the lowest rate for a 10-year bond issuance in Ameren Missouri's history, which helps keep customers rates low as proceeds were used to repay short-term debt, including short-term debt incurred to repay a maturity in a $85 million of 5% senior unsecured notes that matured on February 1.
Additionally, on April 3, Ameren Corp. issued $800 million of 3.5% senior unsecured notes due in 2031. These proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including to repay short-term debt and to fund the repayment of Ameren Corp.'s 2.7% senior notes due November 15, which is the only maturity remaining in 2020.
We decided to accelerate the holding company debt offering to secure our liquidity position during an uncertain time in the credit markets. We continue to expect to issue long-term debt at Ameren Missouri later this year to fund a portion of the wind generation investments expected to be in-service by the end of 2020. And I would note there are no long-term debt maturities in 2021.
In December, we also increased the capacity of our credit facilities by $200 million and extended the maturity dates out to December 2024. Ameren's available liquidity on April 30 was approximately $2.5 billion. This includes the $2.3 billion of combined credit facilities available and approximately $150 million of cash on hand at the end of the month. There are no outstanding credit facility or commercial paper borrowings as of April 30. In addition, we also expect to receive between $540 million and $550 million upon the physical settlement of the August 2019 forward sale agreement on or before March 31, 2021, which is expected to be used to fund a portion of the Ameren Missouri's wind generation investments. Finally, I'm pleased to report that last month, both Moody's and S&P affirmed their credit rating outlooks of stable.
Moving now to Page 19 for an update on Ameren Illinois regulatory matters. Last month, we made a required annual electric distribution formula rate update filing requesting a $45 million base rate decrease. Under Illinois formula ratemaking, Ameren Illinois is required to make an annual rate updates to systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost of service and to true-up any prior period over or under recoveries of such costs. If approved, as requested, all-in 2021 residential electric rates for customers taking delivery and energy supply from Ameren Illinois would be down by approximately 1% since formula ratemaking began in 2012. The ICC will review the matter in the months ahead with a decision expected in December of this year and new rates effective in January of next year. This along with our natural gas rate review remain on track.
Finally, turning to Page 20, I'll summarize. We have a strong team and are well positioned to continue executing on our plan during these unprecedented times. We continue to expect to deliver strong earnings growth in 2020 as we successfully execute our strategy. As we look to the longer term, we continue to expect strong earnings per share growth driven by robust rate base growth and disciplined cost management. Further, we believe this growth compares very favorably with the growth of our regulated utility peers. And Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we have an attractive total shareholder return story that compares very favorably to our peers.
This concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

We didn't guide to a specific number, we just said that we were going to be higher. Obviously, you have these headwinds that are occurring in the first quarter.

I think, Julien, when you look back at our last rate review filing, it was really to set up the timing for this next one, given the wind projects that we have going into service later this year, so those projects will still be top of mind in terms of getting those completed and making sure we think about how to time a rate case around those. Of course, Senate Bill 564, the Plan and Service Accounting, has really provided us some better flexibility on capital expenditures and the ability to be able to defer depreciation, return and get full recovery, so that's a consideration.
But as Warner said, we feel good about the constructive rate settlement that we just had in this past rate review. I think that puts us in a good position to really think about the timing going forward. COVID-19, obviously, having impacts on our customers and our business, as Warner mentioned. And so all of those will be considerations as well as other cost of service considerations that will go into it. So I think all of that considered just means that we'll be thinking about really the best timing for this next rate review."

And I think that range accommodates a number of things, which I think Warner maybe even referred to earlier. I mean, it refers potential treasury outcomes, certainly rate case outcomes, the timing of CapEx, other things. I mean, there are a number of levers that can be pulled over time.
I would remind you a couple of, I think, key data points just to keep in mind. I mean, for every 50 basis points move in that distribution business, it's worth about -- it's an impact of about $0.035. And the other thing to keep in mind, too, is, I mean, as you think about how we're allocating capital today and where rate base growth is going over time, I mean, you get out to 2024, that Illinois distribution business is only about 18% of the overall rate base.

So maybe I'll add then a little bit more color because you had a specific question around how we might think about our investments in Illinois. So look, we're mindful of the fact that our return on equity in Illinois is below industry averages. And I mean, that's why we're supporting legislation that's going to add 100 basis points to the current 580 basis points to the 30-year treasury. And so at the same time, too, we recognized that we're currently in an, frankly, unprecedented period in our country's history that's obviously driving historically low interest rates.
And so what I would say is that, look, we're not going to have a knee-jerk reaction to our investment strategy because the investments that we've been making in Illinois have been delivering value to both our customers and shareholders. But look, we're also going to continue to monitor the situation. And at the same time, Rich and his team, they're going to be relentless and  trying to make sure we pass what we think is really good legislation for our customers, the state of Illinois and certainly for our shareholders.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This morning, I'm going to begin our presentation by providing a COVID-19 update and, in particular, highlighting some of the key efforts we are taking for the safety and security of our coworkers and customers during this difficult time, while providing the central electric and natural gas service. I will then touch on our first quarter results and 2020 earnings guidance. Finally, I will discuss our long-term growth prospects while highlighting some important strategic matters that will position Ameren for future success.
Before I jump into the details, I hope that you, your families and colleagues are safe and healthy during this unprecedented time. As our world works to address COVID-19, many things are uncertain. But the Ameren's commitment to safety of our coworkers, our customers and our communities remains constant. At Ameren, we never compromise on safety, it is one of our core values.
I want to express my profound appreciation for those who are on the front lines battling this virus. To the health care workers, first responders, grocery store workers, local leaders, community workers and, of course, all utility workers across our nation, thank you. In particular, I want to express my sincere appreciation to my Ameren coworkers, who remain focused every day on delivering safe, reliable power and natural gas to millions of people in Missouri and Illinois.
To ensure that we could continue to deliver safe and reliable service, we took swift action in January and assembled a cross-functional crisis management response team following reports about threats related to COVID-19. Since January, our team has been planning and implementing a pandemic response, consistent with established guidelines and industry best practices as well as in consultation with world-class health experts and state and local government leaders. We quickly restricted domestic and international travel and implemented from -- work-from-home policies for anyone that could to limit exposure of our coworkers. Of course, our coworkers are crucial to the execution of our mission and many continue to be out in our communities and in our energy centers every day, keeping the lights on and the natural gas flowing for millions of customers in Missouri and Illinois.
Our actions to continue safe operations also included securing and supplying personal protective equipment, separating work crews, adjusting more schedules, performing robust health screenings at home and on-site and of course, practicing social distancing with coworkers and customers. Our transition to our new work practices went very well. Not only were we able to quickly take significant actions to protect the safety of our coworkers and customers, we have been able to continue executing our projects and strategic plan across our entire business.
We also recognize this is a difficult time for many of our customers, who are struggling financially due to lost wages and other circumstances related to COVID-19. That's why we currently have voluntarily suspended all electric and gas disconnects for nonpayment and waived all late payment fees for customers unable to pay their energy bill on time. In addition, we have contributed $1 million in energy assistance and nearly $1 million to fund other COVID-19 relief efforts to help families and businesses in our Illinois and Missouri communities, and we're not done helping our customers and our communities.
As part of our Ameren Missouri rate review settlement, we are working with Missouri Office of the Public Counsel to provide another $3.5 million in energy assistance funds for Missouri residential customers in need. Our proposal is pending approval from Missouri Public Service Commission. In addition, we live and work in our communities. And we want to go beyond keeping the lights on and natural gas flowing for our millions of customers. As a result, we recently launched an Ameren Cares initiative, whereby our leadership team, Board of Directors and all Ameren coworkers can contribute to COVID-19 relief efforts, including energy assistance for our customers.
Operationally, we are exercising financial discipline and taking several actions to mitigate the expected financial impacts of COVID-19 on our business. Those actions include, among other things, stringent hiring restrictions, managing spending on outside of consultants, significantly restricting travel and modifying the scope of our energies and our maintenance outages, in large part, to enhance the safety of our coworkers. In addition, we have taken several actions to strengthen our already solid liquidity position. Those steps included proactively accessing the capital markets earlier this year. Michael will share some of those details with you a bit later.
Looking ahead, we are putting the final touches on the first phase of our return to facilities transition plan for our coworkers that are working remotely. Safety will remain at the top of our mind, and this transition will be done in a very measured and thoughtful way. We will also continue to work with state and local leaders as well as with the health care community to support reopening of regional economy in a safe, measured and timely fashion. Stay-at-home orders in Missouri were lifted on May 4. On the St. Louis area, those orders will be lifting on May 18. In Illinois, the stay-at-home motor remains in place through May 30.
Of course, we expect restrictions on economic and social activity will continue in all of our communities for some time. Since we are an essential business, these orders should not limit our operations or the execution of our strategic plan beyond the safety measures we have implemented for the protection of our coworkers and customers. I am very proud of our work that our coworkers have done over the last several months. Having said that, we are not letting our guard down. We will continue to be relentlessly focused on safety and delivering on our mission to power the quality of life for our customers and communities and managing through this unprecedented period of time.
With that, let's now turn to Page 5 for an update on first quarter results and 2020 earnings guidance. Yesterday, we announced first quarter 2020 earnings of $0.59 per share compared to $0.78 per share earned in 2019. This slide outlines some of the key drivers that impacted earnings in the first quarter. While we had some items that drove earnings down compared to last year, I am pleased to tell you that we continue to effectively execute all elements of our strategic plan. In addition, due to the actions we have taken to mitigate the expected financial impacts of COVID-19, which I described earlier, combined with the constructive outcome in our Missouri rate review, which benefited all stakeholders, we remain on track to deliver within our 2020 earnings guidance range or $3.40 per share to $3.60 per share.
In affirming our 2020 guidance, we have assessed several economic scenarios and taken into consideration expectations associated with lower Missouri total electric sales, the potential for higher bad debt expenses and lower returns in our Illinois electric distribution business due to lower interest rates, among other things. Michael will discuss our first quarter earnings, 2020 earnings guidance and other related items in more detail later.
Turning now to Page 6. Yesterday, we also affirmed our expectation to deliver 6% to 8% compound annual earnings per share growth from 2020 to 2024, driven by robust compound annual rate base growth of approximately 9%. Simply put, we continue to believe our strategy to deliver strong, long-term earnings growth remains intact. This outlook accommodates several factors, including the range of treasury rates, sales growth, spending levels, regulatory developments and impacts of COVID-19. And of course, earnings growth in any individual year will be impacted by the timing of capital expenditures, regulatory rate reviews and sales volumes, including those driven by weather, impacts from COVID-19 and other factors.
Moving to Page 7. Here, we reiterate our strategic plan. The first pillar of our strategy stresses investing in and operating our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. This has driven our multiyear focus on investing in energy infrastructure for the long-term benefit of customers. As a result, and as you can see on the right side of this page, during the first 3 months of this year, we invested significant capital in each of our business segments, and the pipeline remains robust. In addition, we remain on track to achieve our capital expenditure target for 2020.
Regarding regulatory matters, I am pleased to report that in March the Missouri Public Service Commission approved a constructive settlement in Ameren Missouri's electric rate review that included a $32 million annual revenue decrease. It incorporates lower fuel and transportation costs, taxes and regulatory asset amortization expenses, while providing for recovery of significant infrastructure investments as well as an opportunity to earn within the implicit range of 9.4% to 9.8% return on equity on a growing Missouri rate base. This decrease marks the second consecutive decrease since 2018 when customers received a 6% rate cut as a result of the federal corporate income tax reduction and our Smart Energy Plan.
In Illinois last month, we made our required annual electric distribution formula rate update filing, requesting a $45 million base rate decrease. If we're approved as requested, all-in 2021 residential electric rates for customers taking delivery and energy supply from Ameren Illinois would be down approximately 1% since formula ratemaking began in 2012. As you can see with these rate decreases, we are clearly focused on keeping our customers cost competitive and affordable through continuous improvement and disciplined cost management, while we make significant investments in energy infrastructure to deliver long-term value. Michael will provide more detail about the electric and natural gas rate reviews in a moment.
Turning now to Page 8 and the second pillar of our strategy, enhancing regulatory frameworks and advocating for responsible energy and economic policies, beginning with Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution. The Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act legislation was filed in February. This important legislation would allow Ameren Illinois to make significant investments in solar energy and battery storage to improve reliability as well as to make investments in transportation electrification in order to benefit customers and the economy across Central and Southern Illinois. In addition, this legislation would modify the allowed return on equity formula to increase the basis point adder to the average 30-year treasury rate from 580 basis points to 680 basis points and would also extend electric formula ratemaking to 2032.
The Downstate Clean energy Affordability Act will move the state of Illinois closer to reaching its goal of 100% clean energy by 2050, and builds on Ameren Illinois' efforts to modernize the energy grid under a transparent and stable regulatory framework that has supported significant investment to modernize the energy grid, while improving reliability and creating jobs, all while keeping rates well below the Midwest and national averages. With all these benefits in mind, we are focused on working with key stakeholders to get this important legislation passed.
Prior to adjournment of the Illinois General Assembly in mid-March due to COVID-19, the House Bill had advanced to the Public Utilities Committee and a Senate Bill still awaited assignment to the Energy and Public Utilities Committee. In light of the challenges that exist with COVID-19, it's unclear whether these bills will advance in the spring session, which is currently set to end May 31, that's extended by the leadership in the Illinois House and Senate. If not past the spring, these bills could also be addressed in a veto session or potentially other special sessions later this year.
Turning to Page 9 for an update on FERC regulatory matters. In terms of the FERC's November 2019 order and its subsequent order to extend time to reconsider hearing requests, I do not have any significant updates. However, the FERC did recently take some constructive actions that could further support investment in transmission. In particular, in March, the FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on electric transmission ROE incentives.
In the notice, the FERC proposed several changes to ROE incentives, including an increase in the regional transmission organization, or RTO, participation adder from 50 basis points to 100 basis points. For perspective, every 50 basis point change in our FERC ROE impacts annual earnings per share by approximately $0.04. The notice also proposes incentives on new projects by considering the benefits rather than the risks of a project. We are pleased with the direction the FERC has taken with this notice. It suggests that the FERC understands the importance of incentivizing transmission investment to both upgrade and replace the aging infrastructure and to also enable the transition to more renewable generation across the country. We expect to file comments by the July 1st deadline. Of course, we are unable to predict the ultimate timing or impact of these FERC matters as the FERC is under no time line to issue a decision.
Moving now to Page 10 for an update on the third pillar of our strategy, creating and capitalizing on opportunities for investment for the benefit of our customers, shareholders and the environment. Here, we provide an update on our wind generation investment plans to achieve compliance with Missouri's renewable energy standard and continue to transition our generation portfolio. We've received all regulatory approvals to acquire 700 megawatts of new wind generation at 2 sites in Missouri. Construction is well underway and continues at both wind generation facilities. We continue to work closely with the developers for both projects to monitor the timely manufacturing, shipment and installation of facility components, which are coming from various parts of the world.
We continue to expect the 400-megawatt facility to be in service by the end of 2020. However, the 300-megawatt facility is facing greater challenges, given that this project was originally scheduled to be completed later in the year. The developer continues to work towards completing the entire project in 2020. However, manufacturing, shipping and other supply chain issues have negatively impacted the schedule on this project. While we have not received formal notice from the developer that any portion of this project will be delayed beyond December 31, 2020, at this time, our discussions with the developer indicate that completion of a portion of the project representing approximately $100 million of investment may go in service in the first quarter of 2021.
While we would be disappointed that this entire project is not completed in 2020, it is important to keep some key factors in mind. First, if only this portion of this project is not completed in 2020, we would still be closing on approximately $1.1 billion or 92% of our planned 2020 wind generation investment of $1.2 billion. In addition, for any portion of the project completed in 2021, we have contractual protections to pay a reduced amount to account for the potential loss of production tax credits, subject to an obligation to later pay the original contracted amount should Ameren be entitled to receive those credits. 
Finally, late last week, U.S. Department of the Treasury indicated plans to modify the wind production tax credit rules, which is expected to result in a 1-year extension of in-service criteria. The bottom line is, we expect to deliver on the vast majority of our wind generation investment in 2020. We believe these investments will deliver clear, long-term benefits to our customers, the communities we serve and the environment.
Finally, consistent with our goal to meet our customers' long-term energy needs in a responsible manner, we will assess additional renewable generation opportunities in the context of our next integrated resource plan, which will be filed in September of this year. This comprehensive stakeholder process is well underway to evaluate our future customer demand as well as generation resources needed over the next 20 years and beyond. We continue to work with key stakeholders in this process and are committed to transitioning Ameren Missouri's generation to a cleaner, more diverse portfolio in a responsible fashion for our customers, our shareholders and the environment.
Moving to Page 11. Looking ahead through the end of this decade, we have a robust pipeline of investments of over $36 billion that will deliver significant value to all of our stakeholders by making our energy grid stronger, smarter and cleaner. These investment opportunities exclude any potential new renewable generation from the next Missouri integrated resource plan, which, as I just noted, will be filed in September as well as any potential new multi-value transmission projects. Of course, our investment opportunities will not only create a stronger and cleaner energy grid to meet our customers' needs and exceed their expectations, but they will also create thousands of jobs for local economies. Needless to say, this is very important for our country and the communities we serve at this time.
Maintaining constructive energy policies that support robust investment in energy infrastructure will be critical to meeting our customers -- country's future energy needs and delivering on our customers' expectations. 
Moving to Page 12. To sum up our value proposition, while the current environment is challenging, we are optimistic about the future. The consistent execution of our strategy over many years and on many fronts has positioned us well for future success. We remain firmly convinced that the execution of this same strategy in 2020 and over the next decade will deliver superior value to our customers, shareholders and the environment. We believe the expectation of a 6% to 8% earnings per share compound annual growth rate from 2020 through 2024 driven by strong rate base growth compares very favorably with our regulated utility peers. I am confident in our ability to execute our investment plans and strategies across all 4 of our business segments as we have an experienced and dedicated team to get it done.
Further, our shares continue to offer investors a solid dividend. Our strong earnings growth expectations outlined today position us well for future dividend growth. Of course, future dividend decisions will be driven by earnings growth in addition to cash flows and other business conditions. Together, we believe our strong earnings growth outlook, combined with our solid dividend, results in a very attractive total return opportunity for shareholders. 
Before I turn the call over to Michael, I'd like to mention an important report that we recently issued. Just last week, we published the Annual Ameren Sustainability Report. This report outlines how we are effectively managing a wide range of environmental, social and governance matters for the benefit of all stakeholders. I encourage you to read it at amereninvestors.com.
Again, thank you all for joining us today. I'll now turn the call over to Michael."
373264,664345768,2017309,"Ameren Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 12, 2020",2020-05-12,"Earnings Calls","Ameren Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Warner, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 14 of our presentation. Today, we reported first quarter 2020 earnings of $0.59 per share compared to earnings of $0.78 per share for the year ago quarter. The key factors that drove the over",2419,"Thanks, Warner, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 14 of our presentation. Today, we reported first quarter 2020 earnings of $0.59 per share compared to earnings of $0.78 per share for the year ago quarter. The key factors that drove the overall $0.19 per share decrease are highlighted by segment on this page.
Earnings from Missouri, our largest segment, were down $0.20 per share. The results reflected lower electric retail sales, primarily driven by mild winter temperatures in 2020 compared to colder-than-normal temperatures in the year ago period as well as the absence of energy efficiency performance incentives in the first quarter of 2020, which, combined, reduced earnings by $0.11 per share. In addition, earnings were impacted by higher operations and maintenance expenses, which reduced earnings by $0.08 per share. This increase in operation and maintenance expense was primarily driven by changes in the cash surrender value of our company-owned life insurance. Finally, under terms of the Missouri rate review settlement in order, we recognized a onetime charitable contributions in the first quarter, which reduced earnings by $0.02 per share.
Earnings for Ameren Illinois natural gas were slightly lower due to higher operation and maintenance expenses, also due to change in the cash surrender value of COLI, mostly offset by increased investments in infrastructure. Ameren Illinois electric distribution earnings were flat, reflecting increased investments in infrastructure, offset by a lower allowed return on equity. Ameren transmission earnings were $0.01 per share higher due to an increased investments in infrastructure, partially offset by a lower allowed return on equity.
Finally, Ameren Parent and Other results also increased $0.01 per share, driven primarily by the timing of income tax expense, which is not expected to impact full year earnings, offset by reduced tax benefits associated with share-based compensation.
Before moving on, let me briefly cover electric sales trends for our Missouri and Ameren Illinois electric distribution for the first 3 months of this year compared to the first 3 months of last year. While we did see an impact on electric margins for Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois electric distribution due to COVID-19, the impact was not material in the first quarter due in part to the timing of the stay-at-home orders in Illinois that began March 21 and the stay-at-home orders in the city -- St. Louis City and St. Louis County that began March 23. In addition, March is a solar month. As a result, we tend to have less earnings exposure to large percentage changes in sales than we would otherwise have in the winter or summer months.
Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Missouri residential customers increased 2.5%, excluding the effects of our Missouri Energy Efficiency Plan under MEEIA. Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Missouri commercial and industrial customers decreased 1.5% and 2%, respectively, after excluding the effects of our energy efficiency plan. We exclude MEEIA effects because the plan provides rate recovery to ensure that earnings are not affected by the reduced electric sales resulting from our energy efficiency efforts.
Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois residential customers increased about 1% and weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois commercial and industrial customers decreased 1.5% and 2%, respectively. Recall that changes in electric sales in Illinois, no matter the cause, do not affect our earnings since we have full revenue decoupling. I'll touch a bit more on sales expectations for the second quarter and the balance of the year in a moment.
Turning to Page 15. As you think about the financial uncertainties for the remainder of the year due to COVID-19, this page lays out the regulatory mechanisms available in our business segments to mitigate certain COVID-19 uncertainties, including lower sales revenues, higher bad debt and pension expense. As you can see on this slide, we have constructive regulatory mechanisms to address these uncertainties for business segments that accounted for approximately 50% of our 2019 earnings. We have limited exposure to changes in sales in Illinois as we are fully decoupled in our electric distribution business as well as for residential and small nonresidential natural gas sales. 
In addition, any variance in bad debt expense in Illinois are recovered through the electric and gas uncollectible adjustment riders. Also, formula rates in our Ameren transmission business provide for a recovery of any variance in revenues, bad debt expense or pension expense. In Missouri, we currently do not have any -- have a regulatory mechanism to mitigate the financial impacts of changes in sales volume or bad debt expense.
For perspective, approximately 50% of our annual Missouri electric margins are residential, 40% are commercial and 10% are industrial. The earnings impact of a 1% change in annual sales in 2020 by class is approximately $0.03 for residential, $0.02 for commercial and $0.005 for industrial. It should be noted that we have seasonal electric rates in Missouri. Because of seasonal rates, approximately 50% of our electric margins are typically realized from June through September, assuming normal weather. We are mining the financial impacts of COVID-19 and have the ability to seek an accounting authority order from the Missouri PSC to track such impacts for recovery in a future rate review. Finally, any variance in pension expense from Missouri is recovered through a pension tracker.
With that in mind, turning to Page 16, I'd like to briefly touch on key drivers impacting our 2020 earnings guidance. As Warner stated, we continue to expect 2020 diluted earnings to be in the range of $3.40 to $3.60 per share. This guidance range assumes normal weather in the remaining 9 months of the year as well as reflects several other updates from our February call, primarily related to COVID-19. While it's still very difficult to predict the ultimate impacts of COVID-19 on our business, our team viewed several COVID-19 scenarios incorporated what we believe are prudent and reasonable assumptions into our earnings guidance.
Our guidance contemplates the stay-at-home orders currently in effect. As Warner mentioned, the Governor of Missouri lifted the statewide stay-at-home order on May 4, although St. Louis City and County will begin lifting in their orders on May 18. While these restrictions are being lifted in May, our guidance assumes limited business activity during the entire second quarter, which will significantly impact commercial and industrial sales, while favorably impacting residential sales. As the year goes on, we expect to see commercial and industrial sales improve in the third and fourth quarters, but never fully recovering by year-end. We also expect residential sales to taper off as the year goes on, especially in the fall when schools reopen. As a result, our guidance assumes a gradual recovery.
As we sit here today, we expect lower sales in Missouri due to COVID-19 to reduce earnings approximately $0.10 per share compared to 2019 weather-normalized sales. For the year, we expect total weather-normalized sales to be down approximately 2.5%. Broken down by class, we expect 2020 commercial sales to decline approximately 7%, industrial to decline approximately 4% and residential to increase approximately 2.5%.
Before moving on, I would note that Ameren Missouri customer sales for April, excluding the impact of colder-than-normal weather, were down approximately 7%, reflecting the negative impact from COVID-19 compared to the prior year. Broken down by class and compared to the prior year, preliminary Ameren Missouri April weather-normalized commercial and industrial sales declined approximately 15% and 10%, respectively, which more than offset the margins on increased weather-normalized sales to residential customers of approximately 6%. Similar to March, April and May are mild weather months. As a result, our annual earnings have less exposure to large percentage changes in residential and commercial sales than in those months.
Moving on to other guidance considerations. Despite the extensive federal actions being taken to provide COVID-19 relief to individual and businesses across the country as well as the energy assistance funding that Ameren is providing, we understand that some customers will still face challenges in paying their bills, and we incorporated an increase in bad debt expense into our guidance for the balance of the year.
Today's guidance also incorporates an estimated 2020 allowed ROE for Ameren Illinois electric distribution of 7.3%, which reflects a 30-year treasury yield of approximately 1.5% as well as an increase in parent interest expense associated with the accelerated $800 million note issuance at Ameren Corp., which I'll touch on more in a moment.
On the positive side, we've incorporated the final terms of the Ameren Missouri Electric rate review settlement, which we'll discuss later as well. In addition, as Warner mentioned, we've already taken certain actions, put in place other actions to reduce cost to help mitigate the expected negative financial impacts of COVID-19. Rest assured, we will remain very disciplined in managing our costs for the remainder of the year. Finally, select earnings considerations by quarter for the balance of the year are listed on this page. 
Moving now to Page 17 for a discussion of Ameren Missouri regulatory matters. In March, the PSC approved a stipulation and agreement that resolved the Ameren Missouri rate review. As many of you know, the agreement was a black box settlement, and therefore, the final order does not provide certain specific details. Effective April 1, base electric revenues were decreased by $32 million annually or a decrease of approximately 1%, 80% of which we expect to realize this year. Concurrently, net base energy costs, which will be the basis used for prospective changes to the fuel adjustment clause rider, decreased by approximately $115 million annually. In addition, net regulatory asset and liability amortization expenses and the base level of expenses for regulatory tracking mechanisms reduced by approximately $50 million annually.
The agreement did not specify an allowed ROE at rate base level or a common equity ratio. However, the PSC determined that an implicit ROE in the range of 9.4% to 9.8% is reasonable. In the absence of a stated ROE, our goal continues to be earn as close to 9.6%, the midpoint of the ROE range as possible. The agreement also called for a continued use of a 9.53% ROE to calculate allowance for funds used during construction. Finally, the approved agreement provided for a continuation of key trackers and riders, including the fuel adjustment clause, where the sharing percentage of 95%-5% was affirmed by the commission in April. 
Looking ahead, we will continue to assess the timing of our next Missouri rate review. In making this determination, we will take into account consideration of the constructive rate settlement of this recent rate review; the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 on our customers and our business; our capital expenditures, including the planned wind acquisitions coupled with the flexibility provided by Senate Bill 564 Plan and Service Accounting and other cost of service considerations.
Turning to Page 18 for a financing and liquidity update. We feel very good about our liquidity and financial position today, in particular, after taking a number of steps in March and early April to access the capital markets. On March 20, Ameren Missouri issued $465 million of 2.95% first mortgage bond due in 2030. This tied for the lowest rate for a 10-year bond issuance in Ameren Missouri's history, which helps keep customers rates low as proceeds were used to repay short-term debt, including short-term debt incurred to repay a maturity in a $85 million of 5% senior unsecured notes that matured on February 1.
Additionally, on April 3, Ameren Corp. issued $800 million of 3.5% senior unsecured notes due in 2031. These proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including to repay short-term debt and to fund the repayment of Ameren Corp.'s 2.7% senior notes due November 15, which is the only maturity remaining in 2020.
We decided to accelerate the holding company debt offering to secure our liquidity position during an uncertain time in the credit markets. We continue to expect to issue long-term debt at Ameren Missouri later this year to fund a portion of the wind generation investments expected to be in-service by the end of 2020. And I would note there are no long-term debt maturities in 2021.
In December, we also increased the capacity of our credit facilities by $200 million and extended the maturity dates out to December 2024. Ameren's available liquidity on April 30 was approximately $2.5 billion. This includes the $2.3 billion of combined credit facilities available and approximately $150 million of cash on hand at the end of the month. There are no outstanding credit facility or commercial paper borrowings as of April 30. In addition, we also expect to receive between $540 million and $550 million upon the physical settlement of the August 2019 forward sale agreement on or before March 31, 2021, which is expected to be used to fund a portion of the Ameren Missouri's wind generation investments. Finally, I'm pleased to report that last month, both Moody's and S&P affirmed their credit rating outlooks of stable.
Moving now to Page 19 for an update on Ameren Illinois regulatory matters. Last month, we made a required annual electric distribution formula rate update filing requesting a $45 million base rate decrease. Under Illinois formula ratemaking, Ameren Illinois is required to make an annual rate updates to systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost of service and to true-up any prior period over or under recoveries of such costs. If approved, as requested, all-in 2021 residential electric rates for customers taking delivery and energy supply from Ameren Illinois would be down by approximately 1% since formula ratemaking began in 2012. The ICC will review the matter in the months ahead with a decision expected in December of this year and new rates effective in January of next year. This along with our natural gas rate review remain on track.
Finally, turning to Page 20, I'll summarize. We have a strong team and are well positioned to continue executing on our plan during these unprecedented times. We continue to expect to deliver strong earnings growth in 2020 as we successfully execute our strategy. As we look to the longer term, we continue to expect strong earnings per share growth driven by robust rate base growth and disciplined cost management. Further, we believe this growth compares very favorably with the growth of our regulated utility peers. And Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we have an attractive total shareholder return story that compares very favorably to our peers.
This concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

We didn't guide to a specific number, we just said that we were going to be higher. Obviously, you have these headwinds that are occurring in the first quarter.

So look, I think, at the end of the day, really no decision has been made at this time. But clearly, when you think about your next rate case filing, there are several things you have to think about. And certainly, the wind projects, right, which we've talked about on the call, but we also have to be mindful of the implications and impacts of COVID-19. And so those coupled with the fact that we just completed our last rate review, and those are some of the things that you would put on the list in terms of making a final determination there.
And Marty, I know that you're on, anything that you would add to some of the things that you and your team are kicking around?"

Of course, Senate Bill 564, the Plan and Service Accounting, has really provided us some better flexibility on capital expenditures and the ability to be able to defer depreciation, return and get full recovery, so that's a consideration.
But as Warner said, we feel good about the constructive rate settlement that we just had in this past rate review. I think that puts us in a good position to really think about the timing going forward. COVID-19, obviously, having impacts on our customers and our business, as Warner mentioned. And so all of those will be considerations as well as other cost of service considerations that will go into it. So I think all of that considered just means that we'll be thinking about really the best timing for this next rate review."

But as we step back and look at and going back to '08, '09, you're right, I think that's a great place for us to spend some time. I mean we've done a nice job of driving down bad debt expense over time. We're probably at about $8 million today in bad debt expense. If you think about '08, '09 time frame, you're probably closer to $14 million, $15 million.

And I think that range accommodates a number of things, which I think Warner maybe even referred to earlier. I mean it refers potential treasury outcomes, certainly rate case outcomes, the timing of CapEx, other things. I mean there are a number of levers that can be pulled over time.
I would remind you a couple of, I think, key data points just to keep in mind. I mean for every 50 basis points move in that distribution business, it's worth about -- it's an impact of about $0.035. And the other thing to keep in mind, too, is, I mean, as you think about how we're allocating capital today and where rate base growth is going over time, I mean, you get out to 2024, that Illinois distribution business is only about 18% of the overall rate base.

So maybe I'll add then a little bit more color because you had a specific question around how we might think about our investments in Illinois. So look, we're mindful of the fact that our return on equity in Illinois is below industry averages. And I mean, that's why we're supporting legislation that's going to add 100 basis points to the current 580 basis points to the 30-year treasury. And so at the same time, too, we recognized that we're currently in an, frankly, unprecedented period in our country's history that's obviously driving historically low interest rates.
And so what I would say is that, look, we're not going to have a knee-jerk reaction to our investment strategy because the investments that we've been making in Illinois have been delivering value to both our customers and shareholders. But look, we're also going to continue to monitor the situation. And at the same time, Rich and his team, they're going to be relentless and  trying to make sure we pass what we think is really good legislation for our customers, the state of Illinois and certainly for our shareholders. And in so doing, we're going to continue to advocate for fair returns on those infrastructure investments.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This morning, I'm going to begin our presentation by providing a COVID-19 update and, in particular, highlighting some of the key efforts we are taking for the safety and security of our coworkers and customers during this difficult time, while providing the central electric and natural gas service. I will then touch on our first quarter results and 2020 earnings guidance. Finally, I will discuss our long-term growth prospects while highlighting some important strategic matters that will position Ameren for future success.
Before I jump into the details, I hope that you, your families and colleagues are safe and healthy during this unprecedented time. As our world works to address COVID-19, many things are uncertain. But the Ameren's commitment to safety of our coworkers, our customers and our communities remains constant. At Ameren, we never compromise on safety, it is one of our core values.
I want to express my profound appreciation for those who are on the front lines battling this virus. To the health care workers, first responders, grocery store workers, local leaders, community workers and, of course, all utility workers across our nation, thank you. In particular, I want to express my sincere appreciation to my Ameren coworkers, who remain focused every day on delivering safe, reliable power and natural gas to millions of people in Missouri and Illinois.
To ensure that we could continue to deliver safe and reliable service, we took swift action in January and assembled a cross-functional crisis management response team following reports about threats related to COVID-19. Since January, our team has been planning and implementing a pandemic response, consistent with established guidelines and industry best practices as well as in consultation with world-class health experts and state and local government leaders. We quickly restricted domestic and international travel and implemented from -- work-from-home policies for anyone that could to limit exposure of our coworkers. Of course, our coworkers are crucial to the execution of our mission and many continue to be out in our communities and in our energy centers every day, keeping the lights on and the natural gas flowing for millions of customers in Missouri and Illinois.
Our actions to continue safe operations also included securing and supplying personal protective equipment, separating work crews, adjusting more schedules, performing robust health screenings at home and on-site and of course, practicing social distancing with coworkers and customers. Our transition to our new work practices went very well. Not only were we able to quickly take significant actions to protect the safety of our coworkers and customers, we have been able to continue executing our projects and strategic plan across our entire business.
We also recognize this is a difficult time for many of our customers, who are struggling financially due to lost wages and other circumstances related to COVID-19. That's why we currently have voluntarily suspended all electric and gas disconnects for nonpayment and waived all late payment fees for customers unable to pay their energy bill on time. In addition, we have contributed $1 million in energy assistance and nearly $1 million to fund other COVID-19 relief efforts to help families and businesses in our Illinois and Missouri communities, and we're not done helping our customers and our communities.
As part of our Ameren Missouri rate review settlement, we are working with Missouri Office of the Public Counsel to provide another $3.5 million in energy assistance funds for Missouri residential customers in need. Our proposal is pending approval from Missouri Public Service Commission. In addition, we live and work in our communities. And we want to go beyond keeping the lights on and natural gas flowing for our millions of customers. As a result, we recently launched an Ameren Cares initiative, whereby our leadership team, Board of Directors and all Ameren coworkers can contribute to COVID-19 relief efforts, including energy assistance for our customers.
Operationally, we are exercising financial discipline and taking several actions to mitigate the expected financial impacts of COVID-19 on our business. Those actions include, among other things, stringent hiring restrictions, managing spending on outside of consultants, significantly restricting travel and modifying the scope of our energies and our maintenance outages, in large part, to enhance the safety of our coworkers. In addition, we have taken several actions to strengthen our already solid liquidity position. Those steps included proactively accessing the capital markets earlier this year. Michael will share some of those details with you a bit later.
Looking ahead, we are putting the final touches on the first phase of our return to facilities transition plan for our coworkers that are working remotely. Safety will remain at the top of our mind, and this transition will be done in a very measured and thoughtful way. We will also continue to work with state and local leaders as well as with the health care community to support reopening of regional economy in a safe, measured and timely fashion. Stay-at-home orders in Missouri were lifted on May 4. On the St. Louis area, those orders will be lifting on May 18. In Illinois, the stay-at-home motor remains in place through May 30.
Of course, we expect restrictions on economic and social activity will continue in all of our communities for some time. Since we are an essential business, these orders should not limit our operations or the execution of our strategic plan beyond the safety measures we have implemented for the protection of our coworkers and customers. I am very proud of our work that our coworkers have done over the last several months. Having said that, we are not letting our guard down. We will continue to be relentlessly focused on safety and delivering on our mission to power the quality of life for our customers and communities and managing through this unprecedented period of time.
With that, let's now turn to Page 5 for an update on first quarter results and 2020 earnings guidance. Yesterday, we announced first quarter 2020 earnings of $0.59 per share compared to $0.78 per share earned in 2019. This slide outlines some of the key drivers that impacted earnings in the first quarter. While we had some items that drove earnings down compared to last year, I am pleased to tell you that we continue to effectively execute all elements of our strategic plan. In addition, due to the actions we have taken to mitigate the expected financial impacts of COVID-19, which I described earlier, combined with the constructive outcome in our Missouri rate review, which benefited all stakeholders, we remain on track to deliver within our 2020 earnings guidance range or $3.40 per share to $3.60 per share.
In affirming our 2020 guidance, we have assessed several economic scenarios and taken into consideration expectations associated with lower Missouri total electric sales, the potential for higher bad debt expenses and lower returns in our Illinois electric distribution business due to lower interest rates, among other things. Michael will discuss our first quarter earnings, 2020 earnings guidance and other related items in more detail later.
Turning now to Page 6. Yesterday, we also affirmed our expectation to deliver 6% to 8% compound annual earnings per share growth from 2020 to 2024, driven by robust compound annual rate base growth of approximately 9%. Simply put, we continue to believe our strategy to deliver strong, long-term earnings growth remains intact. This outlook accommodates several factors, including the range of treasury rates, sales growth, spending levels, regulatory developments and impacts of COVID-19. And of course, earnings growth in any individual year will be impacted by the timing of capital expenditures, regulatory rate reviews and sales volumes, including those driven by weather, impacts from COVID-19 and other factors.
Moving to Page 7. Here, we reiterate our strategic plan. The first pillar of our strategy stresses investing in and operating our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. This has driven our multiyear focus on investing in energy infrastructure for the long-term benefit of customers. As a result, and as you can see on the right side of this page, during the first 3 months of this year, we invested significant capital in each of our business segments, and the pipeline remains robust. In addition, we remain on track to achieve our capital expenditure target for 2020.
Regarding regulatory matters, I am pleased to report that in March the Missouri Public Service Commission approved a constructive settlement in Ameren Missouri's electric rate review that included a $32 million annual revenue decrease. It incorporates lower fuel and transportation costs, taxes and regulatory asset amortization expenses, while providing for recovery of significant infrastructure investments as well as an opportunity to earn within the implicit range of 9.4% to 9.8% return on equity on a growing Missouri rate base. This decrease marks the second consecutive decrease since 2018 when customers received a 6% rate cut as a result of the federal corporate income tax reduction and our Smart Energy Plan.
In Illinois last month, we made our required annual electric distribution formula rate update filing, requesting a $45 million base rate decrease. If we're approved as requested, all-in 2021 residential electric rates for customers taking delivery and energy supply from Ameren Illinois would be down approximately 1% since formula ratemaking began in 2012. As you can see with these rate decreases, we are clearly focused on keeping our customers cost competitive and affordable through continuous improvement and disciplined cost management, while we make significant investments in energy infrastructure to deliver long-term value. Michael will provide more detail about the electric and natural gas rate reviews in a moment.
Turning now to Page 8 and the second pillar of our strategy, enhancing regulatory frameworks and advocating for responsible energy and economic policies, beginning with Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution. The Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act legislation was filed in February. This important legislation would allow Ameren Illinois to make significant investments in solar energy and battery storage to improve reliability as well as to make investments in transportation electrification in order to benefit customers and the economy across Central and Southern Illinois. In addition, this legislation would modify the allowed return on equity formula to increase the basis point adder to the average 30-year treasury rate from 580 basis points to 680 basis points and would also extend electric formula ratemaking to 2032.
The Downstate Clean energy Affordability Act will move the state of Illinois closer to reaching its goal of 100% clean energy by 2050, and builds on Ameren Illinois' efforts to modernize the energy grid under a transparent and stable regulatory framework that has supported significant investment to modernize the energy grid, while improving reliability and creating jobs, all while keeping rates well below the Midwest and national averages. With all these benefits in mind, we are focused on working with key stakeholders to get this important legislation passed.
Prior to adjournment of the Illinois General Assembly in mid-March due to COVID-19, the House Bill had advanced to the Public Utilities Committee and a Senate Bill still awaited assignment to the Energy and Public Utilities Committee. In light of the challenges that exist with COVID-19, it's unclear whether these bills will advance in the spring session, which is currently set to end May 31, that's extended by the leadership in the Illinois House and Senate. If not past the spring, these bills could also be addressed in a veto session or potentially other special sessions later this year.
Turning to Page 9 for an update on FERC regulatory matters. In terms of the FERC's November 2019 order and its subsequent order to extend time to reconsider hearing requests, I do not have any significant updates. However, the FERC did recently take some constructive actions that could further support investment in transmission. In particular, in March, the FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on electric transmission ROE incentives.
In the notice, the FERC proposed several changes to ROE incentives, including an increase in the regional transmission organization, or RTO, participation adder from 50 basis points to 100 basis points. For perspective, every 50 basis point change in our FERC ROE impacts annual earnings per share by approximately $0.04. The notice also proposes incentives on new projects by considering the benefits rather than the risks of a project. We are pleased with the direction the FERC has taken with this notice. It suggests that the FERC understands the importance of incentivizing transmission investment to both upgrade and replace the aging infrastructure and to also enable the transition to more renewable generation across the country. We expect to file comments by the July 1st deadline. Of course, we are unable to predict the ultimate timing or impact of these FERC matters as the FERC is under no time line to issue a decision.
Moving now to Page 10 for an update on the third pillar of our strategy, creating and capitalizing on opportunities for investment for the benefit of our customers, shareholders and the environment. Here, we provide an update on our wind generation investment plans to achieve compliance with Missouri's renewable energy standard and continue to transition our generation portfolio. We've received all regulatory approvals to acquire 700 megawatts of new wind generation at 2 sites in Missouri. Construction is well underway and continues at both wind generation facilities. We continue to work closely with the developers for both projects to monitor the timely manufacturing, shipment and installation of facility components, which are coming from various parts of the world.
We continue to expect the 400-megawatt facility to be in service by the end of 2020. However, the 300-megawatt facility is facing greater challenges, given that this project was originally scheduled to be completed later in the year. The developer continues to work towards completing the entire project in 2020. However, manufacturing, shipping and other supply chain issues have negatively impacted the schedule on this project. While we have not received formal notice from the developer that any portion of this project will be delayed beyond December 31, 2020, at this time, our discussions with the developer indicate that completion of a portion of the project representing approximately $100 million of investment may go in service in the first quarter of 2021.
While we would be disappointed that this entire project is not completed in 2020, it is important to keep some key factors in mind. First, if only this portion of this project is not completed in 2020, we would still be closing on approximately $1.1 billion or 92% of our planned 2020 wind generation investment of $1.2 billion. In addition, for any portion of the project completed in 2021, we have contractual protections to pay a reduced amount to account for the potential loss of production tax credits, subject to an obligation to later pay the original contracted amount should Ameren be entitled to receive those credits. 
Finally, late last week, U.S. Department of the Treasury indicated plans to modify the wind production tax credit rules, which is expected to result in a 1-year extension of in-service criteria. The bottom line is, we expect to deliver on the vast majority of our wind generation investment in 2020. We believe these investments will deliver clear, long-term benefits to our customers, the communities we serve and the environment.
Finally, consistent with our goal to meet our customers' long-term energy needs in a responsible manner, we will assess additional renewable generation opportunities in the context of our next integrated resource plan, which will be filed in September of this year. This comprehensive stakeholder process is well underway to evaluate our future customer demand as well as generation resources needed over the next 20 years and beyond. We continue to work with key stakeholders in this process and are committed to transitioning Ameren Missouri's generation to a cleaner, more diverse portfolio in a responsible fashion for our customers, our shareholders and the environment.
Moving to Page 11. Looking ahead through the end of this decade, we have a robust pipeline of investments of over $36 billion that will deliver significant value to all of our stakeholders by making our energy grid stronger, smarter and cleaner. These investment opportunities exclude any potential new renewable generation from the next Missouri integrated resource plan, which, as I just noted, will be filed in September as well as any potential new multi-value transmission projects. Of course, our investment opportunities will not only create a stronger and cleaner energy grid to meet our customers' needs and exceed their expectations, but they will also create thousands of jobs for local economies. Needless to say, this is very important for our country and the communities we serve at this time.
Maintaining constructive energy policies that support robust investment in energy infrastructure will be critical to meeting our customers -- country's future energy needs and delivering on our customers' expectations. 
Moving to Page 12. To sum up our value proposition, while the current environment is challenging, we are optimistic about the future. The consistent execution of our strategy over many years and on many fronts has positioned us well for future success. We remain firmly convinced that the execution of this same strategy in 2020 and over the next decade will deliver superior value to our customers, shareholders and the environment. We believe the expectation of a 6% to 8% earnings per share compound annual growth rate from 2020 through 2024 driven by strong rate base growth compares very favorably with our regulated utility peers. I am confident in our ability to execute our investment plans and strategies across all 4 of our business segments as we have an experienced and dedicated team to get it done.
Further, our shares continue to offer investors a solid dividend. Our strong earnings growth expectations outlined today position us well for future dividend growth. Of course, future dividend decisions will be driven by earnings growth in addition to cash flows and other business conditions. Together, we believe our strong earnings growth outlook, combined with our solid dividend, results in a very attractive total return opportunity for shareholders. 
Before I turn the call over to Michael, I'd like to mention an important report that we recently issued. Just last week, we published the Annual Ameren Sustainability Report. This report outlines how we are effectively managing a wide range of environmental, social and governance matters for the benefit of all stakeholders. I encourage you to read it at amereninvestors.com.
Again, thank you all for joining us today. I'll now turn the call over to Michael."
373264,664345768,2017311,"Ameren Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 12, 2020",2020-05-12,"Earnings Calls","Ameren Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Warner, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 14 of our presentation. Today, we reported first quarter 2020 earnings of $0.59 per share compared to earnings of $0.78 per share for the year ago quarter. The key factors that drove the over",2419,"Thanks, Warner, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 14 of our presentation. Today, we reported first quarter 2020 earnings of $0.59 per share compared to earnings of $0.78 per share for the year ago quarter. The key factors that drove the overall $0.19 per share decrease are highlighted by segment on this page.
Earnings from Missouri, our largest segment, were down $0.20 per share. The results reflected lower electric retail sales, primarily driven by mild winter temperatures in 2020 compared to colder-than-normal temperatures in the year ago period as well as the absence of energy efficiency performance incentives in the first quarter of 2020, which, combined, reduced earnings by $0.11 per share. In addition, earnings were impacted by higher operations and maintenance expenses, which reduced earnings by $0.08 per share. This increase in operation and maintenance expense was primarily driven by changes in the cash surrender value of our company-owned life insurance. Finally, under terms of the Missouri rate review settlement in order, we recognized a onetime charitable contributions in the first quarter, which reduced earnings by $0.02 per share.
Earnings for Ameren Illinois natural gas were slightly lower due to higher operation and maintenance expenses, also due to change in the cash surrender value of COLI, mostly offset by increased investments in infrastructure. Ameren Illinois electric distribution earnings were flat, reflecting increased investments in infrastructure, offset by a lower allowed return on equity. Ameren transmission earnings were $0.01 per share higher due to an increased investments in infrastructure, partially offset by a lower allowed return on equity.
Finally, Ameren Parent and Other results also increased $0.01 per share, driven primarily by the timing of income tax expense, which is not expected to impact full year earnings, offset by reduced tax benefits associated with share-based compensation.
Before moving on, let me briefly cover electric sales trends for our Missouri and Ameren Illinois electric distribution for the first 3 months of this year compared to the first 3 months of last year. While we did see an impact on electric margins for Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois electric distribution due to COVID-19, the impact was not material in the first quarter due in part to the timing of the stay-at-home orders in Illinois that began March 21 and the stay-at-home orders in the city -- St. Louis City and St. Louis County that began March 23. In addition, March is a solar month. As a result, we tend to have less earnings exposure to large percentage changes in sales than we would otherwise have in the winter or summer months.
Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Missouri residential customers increased 2.5%, excluding the effects of our Missouri Energy Efficiency Plan under MEEIA. Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Missouri commercial and industrial customers decreased 1.5% and 2%, respectively, after excluding the effects of our energy efficiency plan. We exclude MEEIA effects because the plan provides rate recovery to ensure that earnings are not affected by the reduced electric sales resulting from our energy efficiency efforts.
Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois residential customers increased about 1% and weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois commercial and industrial customers decreased 1.5% and 2%, respectively. Recall that changes in electric sales in Illinois, no matter the cause, do not affect our earnings since we have full revenue decoupling. I'll touch a bit more on sales expectations for the second quarter and the balance of the year in a moment.
Turning to Page 15. As you think about the financial uncertainties for the remainder of the year due to COVID-19, this page lays out the regulatory mechanisms available in our business segments to mitigate certain COVID-19 uncertainties, including lower sales revenues, higher bad debt and pension expense. As you can see on this slide, we have constructive regulatory mechanisms to address these uncertainties for business segments that accounted for approximately 50% of our 2019 earnings. We have limited exposure to changes in sales in Illinois as we are fully decoupled in our electric distribution business as well as for residential and small nonresidential natural gas sales. 
In addition, any variance in bad debt expense in Illinois are recovered through the electric and gas uncollectible adjustment riders. Also, formula rates in our Ameren transmission business provide for a recovery of any variance in revenues, bad debt expense or pension expense. In Missouri, we currently do not have any -- have a regulatory mechanism to mitigate the financial impacts of changes in sales volume or bad debt expense.
For perspective, approximately 50% of our annual Missouri electric margins are residential, 40% are commercial and 10% are industrial. The earnings impact of a 1% change in annual sales in 2020 by class is approximately $0.03 for residential, $0.02 for commercial and $0.005 for industrial. It should be noted that we have seasonal electric rates in Missouri. Because of seasonal rates, approximately 50% of our electric margins are typically realized from June through September, assuming normal weather. We are mining the financial impacts of COVID-19 and have the ability to seek an accounting authority order from the Missouri PSC to track such impacts for recovery in a future rate review. Finally, any variance in pension expense from Missouri is recovered through a pension tracker.
With that in mind, turning to Page 16, I'd like to briefly touch on key drivers impacting our 2020 earnings guidance. As Warner stated, we continue to expect 2020 diluted earnings to be in the range of $3.40 to $3.60 per share. This guidance range assumes normal weather in the remaining 9 months of the year as well as reflects several other updates from our February call, primarily related to COVID-19. While it's still very difficult to predict the ultimate impacts of COVID-19 on our business, our team viewed several COVID-19 scenarios incorporated what we believe are prudent and reasonable assumptions into our earnings guidance.
Our guidance contemplates the stay-at-home orders currently in effect. As Warner mentioned, the Governor of Missouri lifted the statewide stay-at-home order on May 4, although St. Louis City and County will begin lifting in their orders on May 18. While these restrictions are being lifted in May, our guidance assumes limited business activity during the entire second quarter, which will significantly impact commercial and industrial sales, while favorably impacting residential sales. As the year goes on, we expect to see commercial and industrial sales improve in the third and fourth quarters, but never fully recovering by year-end. We also expect residential sales to taper off as the year goes on, especially in the fall when schools reopen. As a result, our guidance assumes a gradual recovery.
As we sit here today, we expect lower sales in Missouri due to COVID-19 to reduce earnings approximately $0.10 per share compared to 2019 weather-normalized sales. For the year, we expect total weather-normalized sales to be down approximately 2.5%. Broken down by class, we expect 2020 commercial sales to decline approximately 7%, industrial to decline approximately 4% and residential to increase approximately 2.5%.
Before moving on, I would note that Ameren Missouri customer sales for April, excluding the impact of colder-than-normal weather, were down approximately 7%, reflecting the negative impact from COVID-19 compared to the prior year. Broken down by class and compared to the prior year, preliminary Ameren Missouri April weather-normalized commercial and industrial sales declined approximately 15% and 10%, respectively, which more than offset the margins on increased weather-normalized sales to residential customers of approximately 6%. Similar to March, April and May are mild weather months. As a result, our annual earnings have less exposure to large percentage changes in residential and commercial sales than in those months.
Moving on to other guidance considerations. Despite the extensive federal actions being taken to provide COVID-19 relief to individual and businesses across the country as well as the energy assistance funding that Ameren is providing, we understand that some customers will still face challenges in paying their bills, and we incorporated an increase in bad debt expense into our guidance for the balance of the year.
Today's guidance also incorporates an estimated 2020 allowed ROE for Ameren Illinois electric distribution of 7.3%, which reflects a 30-year treasury yield of approximately 1.5% as well as an increase in parent interest expense associated with the accelerated $800 million note issuance at Ameren Corp., which I'll touch on more in a moment.
On the positive side, we've incorporated the final terms of the Ameren Missouri Electric rate review settlement, which we'll discuss later as well. In addition, as Warner mentioned, we've already taken certain actions, put in place other actions to reduce cost to help mitigate the expected negative financial impacts of COVID-19. Rest assured, we will remain very disciplined in managing our costs for the remainder of the year. Finally, select earnings considerations by quarter for the balance of the year are listed on this page. 
Moving now to Page 17 for a discussion of Ameren Missouri regulatory matters. In March, the PSC approved a stipulation and agreement that resolved the Ameren Missouri rate review. As many of you know, the agreement was a black box settlement, and therefore, the final order does not provide certain specific details. Effective April 1, base electric revenues were decreased by $32 million annually or a decrease of approximately 1%, 80% of which we expect to realize this year. Concurrently, net base energy costs, which will be the basis used for prospective changes to the fuel adjustment clause rider, decreased by approximately $115 million annually. In addition, net regulatory asset and liability amortization expenses and the base level of expenses for regulatory tracking mechanisms reduced by approximately $50 million annually.
The agreement did not specify an allowed ROE at rate base level or a common equity ratio. However, the PSC determined that an implicit ROE in the range of 9.4% to 9.8% is reasonable. In the absence of a stated ROE, our goal continues to be earn as close to 9.6%, the midpoint of the ROE range as possible. The agreement also called for a continued use of a 9.53% ROE to calculate allowance for funds used during construction. Finally, the approved agreement provided for a continuation of key trackers and riders, including the fuel adjustment clause, where the sharing percentage of 95%-5% was affirmed by the commission in April. 
Looking ahead, we will continue to assess the timing of our next Missouri rate review. In making this determination, we will take into account consideration of the constructive rate settlement of this recent rate review; the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 on our customers and our business; our capital expenditures, including the planned wind acquisitions coupled with the flexibility provided by Senate Bill 564 Plan and Service Accounting and other cost of service considerations.
Turning to Page 18 for a financing and liquidity update. We feel very good about our liquidity and financial position today, in particular, after taking a number of steps in March and early April to access the capital markets. On March 20, Ameren Missouri issued $465 million of 2.95% first mortgage bond due in 2030. This tied for the lowest rate for a 10-year bond issuance in Ameren Missouri's history, which helps keep customers rates low as proceeds were used to repay short-term debt, including short-term debt incurred to repay a maturity in a $85 million of 5% senior unsecured notes that matured on February 1.
Additionally, on April 3, Ameren Corp. issued $800 million of 3.5% senior unsecured notes due in 2031. These proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including to repay short-term debt and to fund the repayment of Ameren Corp.'s 2.7% senior notes due November 15, which is the only maturity remaining in 2020.
We decided to accelerate the holding company debt offering to secure our liquidity position during an uncertain time in the credit markets. We continue to expect to issue long-term debt at Ameren Missouri later this year to fund a portion of the wind generation investments expected to be in-service by the end of 2020. And I would note there are no long-term debt maturities in 2021.
In December, we also increased the capacity of our credit facilities by $200 million and extended the maturity dates out to December 2024. Ameren's available liquidity on April 30 was approximately $2.5 billion. This includes the $2.3 billion of combined credit facilities available and approximately $150 million of cash on hand at the end of the month. There are no outstanding credit facility or commercial paper borrowings as of April 30. In addition, we also expect to receive between $540 million and $550 million upon the physical settlement of the August 2019 forward sale agreement on or before March 31, 2021, which is expected to be used to fund a portion of the Ameren Missouri's wind generation investments. Finally, I'm pleased to report that last month, both Moody's and S&P affirmed their credit rating outlooks of stable.
Moving now to Page 19 for an update on Ameren Illinois regulatory matters. Last month, we made a required annual electric distribution formula rate update filing requesting a $45 million base rate decrease. Under Illinois formula ratemaking, Ameren Illinois is required to make an annual rate updates to systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost of service and to true-up any prior period over or under recoveries of such costs. If approved, as requested, all-in 2021 residential electric rates for customers taking delivery and energy supply from Ameren Illinois would be down by approximately 1% since formula ratemaking began in 2012. The ICC will review the matter in the months ahead with a decision expected in December of this year and new rates effective in January of next year. This along with our natural gas rate review remain on track.
Finally, turning to Page 20, I'll summarize. We have a strong team and are well positioned to continue executing on our plan during these unprecedented times. We continue to expect to deliver strong earnings growth in 2020 as we successfully execute our strategy. As we look to the longer term, we continue to expect strong earnings per share growth driven by robust rate base growth and disciplined cost management. Further, we believe this growth compares very favorably with the growth of our regulated utility peers. And Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we have an attractive total shareholder return story that compares very favorably to our peers.
This concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

How do you think about those cascading through the course of the year and into '21? I imagine much of it like weather and onetime contributions are pretty limited to 1Q '20. But separately from focusing on higher expense, how do you think about the totality of O&M opportunities to offset the details that you provided on the lower 2.5% sales altogether?"

So I'll take a stab at this and then certainly Warner can add anything as well. But I mean, if I heard you right, you broke up a little bit there, but in terms of the higher costs that we saw in the first quarter, clearly, we're impacted by this company-owned life insurance, which we indicated in there, so that obviously provided a headwind.
As you think back in terms of where we were at the beginning of the year, we talked about O&M costs being higher in general. We didn't guide to a specific number, we just said that we were going to be higher. Obviously, you have these headwinds that are occurring in the first quarter. As we think about all these COVID-related issues that we outlined in terms of what's going on with sales and bad debt, we are clearly focused on guiding to a lower O&M number today.
And so hopefully, it gives you some context, not giving you the specifics of it. But clearly, we were higher O&M going into the year, got these headwinds. We've taken a number of actions, as Warner said, in terms of just managing headcount, obviously travel, conferences, watching overtime where we can, all those kind of things to make sure that we can keep a firm grasp on this."

Of course, Senate Bill 564, the Plan and Service Accounting, has really provided us some better flexibility on capital expenditures and the ability to be able to defer depreciation, return and get full recovery, so that's a consideration.
But as Warner said, we feel good about the constructive rate settlement that we just had in this past rate review. I think that puts us in a good position to really think about the timing going forward. COVID-19, obviously, having impacts on our customers and our business, as Warner mentioned. And so all of those will be considerations as well as other cost of service considerations that will go into it. So I think all of that considered just means that we'll be thinking about really the best timing for this next rate review."

And I think that range accommodates a number of things, which I think Warner maybe even referred to earlier. I mean it refers potential treasury outcomes, certainly rate case outcomes, the timing of CapEx, other things. I mean there are a number of levers that can be pulled over time.
I would remind you a couple of, I think, key data points just to keep in mind. I mean for every 50 basis points move in that distribution business, it's worth about -- it's an impact of about $0.035. And the other thing to keep in mind, too, is, I mean, as you think about how we're allocating capital today and where rate base growth is going over time, I mean, you get out to 2024, that Illinois distribution business is only about 18% of the overall rate base.

So maybe I'll add then a little bit more color because you had a specific question around how we might think about our investments in Illinois. So look, we're mindful of the fact that our return on equity in Illinois is below industry averages. And I mean, that's why we're supporting legislation that's going to add 100 basis points to the current 580 basis points to the 30-year treasury. And so at the same time, too, we recognized that we're currently in an, frankly, unprecedented period in our country's history that's obviously driving historically low interest rates.
And so what I would say is that, look, we're not going to have a knee-jerk reaction to our investment strategy because the investments that we've been making in Illinois have been delivering value to both our customers and shareholders. But look, we're also going to continue to monitor the situation. And at the same time, Rich and his team, they're going to be relentless and  trying to make sure we pass what we think is really good legislation for our customers, the state of Illinois and certainly for our shareholders.

Before I jump into our presentation, I'll start by saying that I hope you, your families and colleagues are safe and healthy during this challenging time. 
This morning, I will begin our presentation by providing a COVID-19 update and in particular, highlight the actions we have taken to support our customers, communities and coworkers. I will then touch on our second quarter results and 2020 earnings guidance, and finish with a discussion of several key elements of our strategy that we continue to execute very well, which will position us to continue delivering strong, long-term value for our customers and shareholders. 
Turning now to Slide 4 and COVID-19. Our strong commitment to the safety of our coworkers, customers and communities remains constant. So too is our strong focus on delivering safe, reliable and affordable electric and natural gas service during this unprecedented time. 
We recognize that mains of customers in Missouri and Illinois are depending on us. I can't express enough appreciation to my coworkers who have shown great agility, innovation, determination and a keen focus on safety and delivering on our mission to power the quality of life. We also recognize that our mission goes beyond this during this challenging time. We recognized that our customers and communities have significant needs. That is why we are working directly with our customers on special payment plans for their utility bills. We are also working closely with many dedicated community partners and have contributed approximately $15 million for energy assistance and COVID-19 support to our customers in Missouri and Illinois. 
And I'm very pleased to tell you that our correctly engaged in this effort to our [indiscernible] Womancare Power Giving Program. Together, these programs are helping our residential, small business and [indiscernible] in addition, we are tirelessly working with our customers to help them gain access to a host of federal support programs, including low-income energy assistance funds. Our customers are at the center of our strategy, and we will continue to take steps to help them during this unprecedented time. Throughout this 
challenging period, I'm also pleased to say that we have been effectively executing on our strategy across all of our businesses. The key element of our strategy is to invest in energy infrastructure to benefit our customers and in so doing, provide important jobs to support the local economy as well as local suppliers at a time when they are needed most. 
Looking ahead, we recognize that we will need to be managing the impacts of COVID-19 for some time. With safety and delivering on our mission and strategy at the top of our minds, we plan to continue managing our business under our current COVID-19 protocols, which includes having a significant portion of our workforce working remotely for at least the end of this year. 
We also continue to carefully monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our electric supply chain. To date, [indiscernible] these impacts have been manageable and in line [indiscernible]. At the same time, we remain focused on exercising potential impacts of COVID-19, while capitalizing on some key opportunities that we have identified during this crisis, including benefits we are realizing from our digital transformation investments and streamlined operating practices. 
Turning now to Page 5 for an update on the second quarter results and 2020 earnings guidance. Yesterday, we announced second quarter 2020 earnings of $0.98 per share compared to $0.72 per share earned in 2019. 
A summary of the key drivers of the year-over-year increase of $0.26 per share is provided on this page, which Mike will discuss in more detail in a moment. The strong execution of our strategic plan drove strong quarterly earnings results and enabled us to affirm our 2020 earnings guidance range of $3.40 per share to $3.60 per share. 
Moving to Page 6. Here, we reiterate our strategic plan, which as I just mentioned, we've been executing very well throughout the year. We expect our plan to continue delivering significant value for our customers and strong long-term earnings growth for our shareholders. 
The first pillar of our strategy stresses investing in and operating our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. This has driven our multiyear focus on investing in energy infrastructure for the long-term benefit of customers in all of our jurisdictions. As you can see on the right side of this page, during the first half of this year, we invested significant capital in each of our business segments to best serve our customers. Most notably, Ameren Transmission, where we effectively managed a nearly 25% increase in infrastructure investment compared to the first half of 2019. These investments are delivering value to our customers and community. 
Our energy grid is becoming more reliable, resilient and secure. And our digital investments are enhancing our customers' experience. Of course, we are not done. Looking ahead, we continue to see the need for robust energy infrastructure investments to meet our customers' energy needs and exceed their expectations while keeping rates affordable. Our electric rates in both Missouri and Illinois continue to be well below the Midwest and national averages. As we discussed in our first quarter earnings call, new electric rates went into effect on April 1 of this year as a result of a constructive settlement in Ameren Missouri's electric rate review. 
The settlement included a $32 million annual revenue decrease, which marks the second consecutive decrease since 2018. Its customer rates have decreased by 7% while at the same time, we have continued to make significant investments in energy infrastructure to benefit [indiscernible] As Michael will cover in more detail later, we have also been very busy managing our electric and natural gas regulatory proceedings in Illinois. We expect a final decision in the electric proceeding by December of this year and a final decision in the gas proceeding by January of next year. 
Finally, another important element of the first pillar of our strategy has been and remains our relentless focus on continuous improvement and disciplined cost management to keep rates affordable. 
Moving to the second pillar of our strategy, which includes enhancing regulatory frameworks for the benefit. As you know, we continue to support the proposed downstate Clean Energy Affordability act in Illinois. This is important to make significant investments in solar energy and battery storage to improve reliability as well as make investments in transportation electrification in order to benefit customers in the economy across Central and Southern Illinois. 
In addition, it would help address depressing energy policy challenges for [indiscernible] based in the state, including the need for additional renewable sources and better electric vehicle charging infrastructure. This bill will help address these challenges and move the State of Illinois closer to reaching this goal of 100% clean energy by 2050. 
In addition, this legislation would modify the allowed return on equity formula to increase the basis point adder to the average 30-year treasury rate from 580 to 680 and will also extend the electric performance-based rate making framework through 2032. Importantly, this legislation builds on Ameren Illinois' efforts to modernize the energy grid under a transparent and stable regulatory framework that has supported significant investment to modernize the energy grid, while improving reliability and creating approximately 1,400 jobs, all while keeping rates well below the Midwest and national averages. 
In fact, all-in residential rates in 2020 are down 1% compared to 2012, the first year of performance-based rates. Simply put, the performance-based grid monetization legislation that was passed in 2011 and extended twice by the Illinois legislature under different administrations has been an overwhelming success for Illinois. 
With all these benefits in mind, we remain focused on working with key stakeholders to get this important legislation passed. 
Turning now to Page 7. I'll provide an update on FERC regulatory matters. In May, the FERC issued an order on the rehearing request related to its November 2019 order addressing 2 complaint cases that reduced MISO's base return on equity. 
The order established a new base return on equity methodology using 3 models: risk premium model, capital asset pricing metal and the discounted cash flow model. The revised order sets a base return on equity of 10.02% for transmission projects for the first complaint case period and effective as of September 28, 2016. This results in a return on equity of 10.52% for Ameren Transmission and part of MISO. 
[indiscernible] We are pleased with the order and believe it is to be constructed. Strategy expands the range of reasonableness used to assess whether current returns on equity are just and reasonable. The FERC also issued a notice of proposed rule-making in March. 
Overall, we believe that the policies outlined in the proposed rulemaking are constructive. As a result, we, along with the other MISO Transmission owners, filed comments in June in support of the proposed increase [indiscernible] liability and benefit based incentives and the ROE cap. We are unable to predict the ultimate timing or impact of these matters as the FERC is under no timeline to issue a decision. 
Moving now to Page 8 for an update on the third pillar of our strategy, creating and capitalizing on opportunities for investment for the benefit of our customers, shareholders and the environment. Here, we provide an update on our $1.2 billion wind generation investment plan to achieve compliance with Missouri's renewable energy standard through the acquisition of 700 megawatts of new wind generation at 2 sites in Missouri. 
In short, there has been no significant change to the project schedules from what we discussed on our first quarter call in May. Construction is well underway at both facilities. We are working closely with the developers for both projects to monitor the timing of manufacturing, shipment and installation of facility components. We continue to expect the 400-megawatt facility to be in service by the end of 2020. 
Regarding the 300-megawatt facility, we expect it to be substantially in service by the end of 2020. However, as a result of certain delays we discussed on our first quarter earnings call in May, we expect the portion of the project representing approximately $100 million of investment to be placed in service in the first quarter of 2021. We expect no reduction in production tax credits because of the recent rule changes made by the U.S. Department of the Treasury to extend the in-service criteria by 1 year to December 31, 2021. 
Furthermore, we will continue to explore additional renewable energy investment opportunities that will drive long-term value for our customers [indiscernible] Ameren Missouri is in the process of finalizing its next integrated [indiscernible] 2 months, we have been working closely with key shareholders in developing our plan. 
We are carefully looking at several approaches to best meet our customers' future energy needs and effectively transition our generation to a cleaner, more diverse portfolio in a responsible fashion. We'll be finalizing our plan over the next 45 days and plan to file our IRP with the Missouri PSC by September 30. 
We are excited about the benefits that our current wind generation projects will deliver to all stakeholders, as well as the prospects for additional renewable energy needs in the future. 
Moving to Page 9. Clicking ahead through the end of this decade, we have a robust pipeline of investment 
[Audio Gap] 
billion dollars that will deliver significant value to all of our stakeholders by making our energy grid stronger, smarter and cleaner. These investment opportunities exclude any potential new renewable generation from the Missouri Integrated Resource Plan as well as any potential new multivalue transmission projects that will increase the reliability and resiliency of the energy grid as well as enable additional renewable generation projects. 
Of course, our investment opportunities will not only create a stronger and cleaner energy grid to meet our customers' needs and exceed their expectations. But they will also create thousands of jobs for local economies. Maintaining constructive energy policies that support robust investment in energy infrastructure will be critical to meeting our country's future energy needs and delivering on our customers' expectations. 
Moving to Page 10. To sum up our value proposition, the consistent execution of our strategy over many years and on many fronts has positioned us well for future success. We remain firmly convinced that the execution of this strategy in 2020 and beyond will deliver superior value to our customers, shareholders and the environment. 
In May, we affirmed our 5-year growth plan, which included our expectation of 6% to 8% compound annual earnings per share growth for 2020 through 2024 period using the 2020 EPS guidance range midpoint as the base. This earnings growth is primarily driven by our approximate 9% compound annual rate base growth in 2019 through 2024 and compares very favorably with our regulated utility peers. I am confident in our ability to execute our investment plans and strategies across all 4 of our business segments, as we have an experienced and dedicated team to get it done. 
Further, our shares continue to offer investors a solid dividend. Our strong earnings growth expectations position us well for future dividend growth. Of course, future dividend decisions will be driven by earnings growth, in addition to cash flows and other business conditions. Together, we believe our strong earnings growth outlook, combined with our solid dividend, results in a very attractive total return opportunity for shareholders. 
Again, thank you all for joining us today. And I'll now turn the call over to Michael. Michael?"

The key factors by segment tha",1009,"Thanks, Warner, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 12 of our presentation. Yesterday, we reported second quarter 2020 earnings of $0.98 per share compared to earnings of $0.72 per share for the year ago quarter. The key factors by segment that drove the overall $0.26 per share increase are highlighted on this page. 
Ameren Missouri, our largest segment, reported increased earnings of $0.18 per share. The [indiscernible] and maintenance expenses, including a and maintenance outage, favorable market returns, which together increased earnings by $0.15 per share. The year-over-year improvement also reflected new electric service rates effective April 1, driven in part by increased infrastructure investments. 
The year-over-year impact from electric sales was flat as the $0.05 per share benefit from near-normal temperatures in the second quarter compared to milder than normal temperatures in the previous year were offset by a $0.05 per share reduction from lower weather normalized sales, primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19. 
Moving now to Ameren Transmission. Earnings per share were up $0.07. This increase reflected the impact of the FERC order on the MISO-based allowed return on equity, which increased earnings $0.04 per share as well as increased infrastructure investments. 
Earnings for Ameren Illinois Natural Gas were up $0.03 per share due to increased infrastructure investments and lower operations and maintenance expenses. Ameren Illinois electric distribution earnings were down $0.01 per share, reflecting a lower expected allowed return on equity under performance-based REIT making, partially offset by increased infrastructure investments. 
And finally, Ameren Parent and other results also [indiscernible] resulting from the long-term debt issuance in early April. 
Moving now to Page 13 of our presentation impacting our 2020 earnings guidance. As Warner stated, we continue to expect 2020 diluted earnings to be in the range of $3.40 to $3.60 per share. This guidance range assumes normal weather in the remaining 6 months of the year as well as reflect sales updates from our first quarter earnings call in May, primarily related to COVID-19. 
On our call in May, we estimated COVID-19-related sales impacts in Ameren Missouri would reduce our 2020 earnings per share expectations by approximately $0.10 per share, and we believe this continues to be a solid estimate. 
For the year, we still expect total weather-normalized sales to be on approximately 2.5%. Broken down by customer class, we expect 2020 commercial sales to decline approximately 7.5%. Industrial sales declined approximately 4.5% and residential sales to increase approximately 4%. 
While we've seen a slight change in the relative mix of sales, overall, our update today is largely [indiscernible] on May in terms of both total sales and EPS impacts for 2020 due to COVID-19. 
Before moving on, [indiscernible] June, excluding the impact of warmer-than-normal weather, we're down approximately 0.2% compared to the prior year, reflecting the impact of COVID-19. Broken down by customer class and compared to the prior year, Ameren Missouri June weather-normalized commercial and industrial sales declined approximately 9.5% and 3%, respectively, which were largely offset by an increased weather-normalized sales to residential customers of approximately 11%. These statistics are notable, given they represent the first full month of sales after the state homeowners were lifted. 
Before moving on, let me briefly cover electric sales trends for Ameren Illinois electric distribution for the first 6 months of this year compared to the first 6 months of last year. Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois residential customers increased about 4%, and weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois commercial and industrial customers decreased approximately 7% and 8%, respectively. 
Recall that changes in electric sales in Illinois, no matter the cause, do not affect earnings since we have full revenue decoupling. Moving on to other guidance considerations. Select earnings considerations by quarter for the balance of the year are listed on this page. 
Our 2020 earnings guidance range also incorporates an estimated 2020 allowed ROE for Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution of 7.2%, which reflects a 30-year treasury yield of approximately 1.4%. 
Finally, we also remain very focused on making disciplined cost management for the remainder of the year. Moving now to Page 14 for other regulatory matters. 
In April, we made our required annual electric distribution rate update filing. Under Illinois performance-based rate making, our utilities are required to file annual updates to systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost of service and to drip any prior period over or under recoveries of such costs. 
In late June, the ICC staff recommended a $53 million base rate decrease compared to our request of a $45 million base rate decrease. Decision is expected in December with new rates expected to be effective in January 2021. 
Earlier, there's an annual increase in MREL natural gas distribution rates using a 2021 future test year and have since updated our request in our July rebuttal testimony. 
In June, the ICC staff and other interveners, including the Citizens Utility Board and the Illinois Industrial Energy Consumers, filed rebuttal testimony in the rate review. Our original request, as well as our July rebuttal testimony, incorporated at 10.5% return on equity, while staff and other interveners have recommended a 9.32% and 9.2% return on equity, respectively. Circa 54% equity ratio compare [indiscernible] compared to the ICC staff and other interveners recommendation of [indiscernible] respectively. 
A decision is expected by January 2021, February of 2021. Finally, turning to Page 15, I will summarize. We have a strong team and are well positioned to continue executing our plan. We continue to expect to deliver strong earnings growth in 2020, and we're successfully executing our strategy and navigate the impacts of COVID-19. 
As we look to the longer term, we continue to expect strong earnings per share growth driven by robust rate base growth and disciplined cost management. Further, we believe this growth compares very favorably to the growth of our utility peers. And Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. 
In total, we have an attractive total shareholder return story that converges very favorably to our peers. And now I'll turn it back over to Warner."

All we has spent a great deal of time this morning talking about how we are effectively addressing issues associated with COVID-19 and delivering strong results for our customers and shareholders. I think it's important to note that another matter is at the top of our minds. That matter is the level of profound racial prejudice, injustice and intolerance that we still have in this country and in our own community, especially against black people. 
We have recently seen too many sizzle tests of African Americans. And to be clear, there is absolutely no place for racism injustice or hatred of any kind at Ameren, in our community, in our country or anywhere in the world. We must challenge such behavior when we witness it and take steps to drive positive changes to eliminate it, and that is exactly what we're doing at Ameren. At Ameren, diversity, equity and inclusion is a core value. While we have been recognized by Diversity, Inc. as one of the top utilities in the country for our diversity, equity and inclusion practices, we are not standing still. 
In fact, we recently conducted a Virtual Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Summit in St. Louis. The theme of the Summit was the Courage to Live your Values. Ameren leaders, community leaders and national leaders came together to begin listening to each other more thoughtfully and to begin taking even more steps to address this critical issue. We have made the entire program available on our website. I encourage you to take time and listen to the amazing stories of courage and passion for diversity, equity and inclusion. 
We're now ready to take your questions."

I mean our digital investments have really been a step change, not just for our current workforce, but how we engage and work with others.

We see opportunities there. That's just not going to be necessary prospectively because reality is we can work very effectively remotely.

So as opposed to doing a piecemeal, we'll be better served for everybody when we roll out the plan to be able to really talk about it in a comprehensive fashion. And so we'll be in a good position to do that certainly during our third quarter conference call. And as we move into EEI, that will be a great topic of conversation just as it was in 2017, when we announced our 700 megawatts of wind generation and 100 megawatts of solar.

And Richard, Mark and his team have continue to work very hard to have conversations virtually, of course, with the key stakeholders and not just legislators of stakeholders. 
So a couple of things to think about there. In terms of energy policy, I think energy policy broadly in the State of Illinois is still at the top of a lot of folks' minds, and rightfully so, because energy policy is so important. That's why, as we said, as part of our talking points as well as what you've heard us say before, that's why we support so strongly the Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act because it really addresses many of the key issues that the State of Illinois is focused on. More renewable energy resources, more investments in electrification as well as grid modernization. These are things that have been really important for the State of Illinois and will continue to be. 
And so we continue to have conversations with key stakeholders around that particular piece of legislation that we still support. Having said that, as you know, there's been a lot of dialogue and some concerns raised as a result of the Commonwealth Edison federal investigation, so we understand that. 
And so consequently, as we think ahead, what we're going to do is continue to double down on our efforts to work with stakeholders collaboratively, listen to the concerns, but make sure that we point out the value of the current regulatory framework and our proposal. And at the end of the day, our focus is going to continue to be to try and find a solution that gives us the ability, collectively in the State of Illinois to invest in critical infrastructure and give us the ability to earn a fair return and deliver values to our customers in the State of Illinois. 
Now in terms of timing, and I've learned a long time ago that I don't predict when things will be addressed by any legislature or when things will ultimately get done. And obviously, things are a little bit more complicated as we approach this upcoming veto session. In light of a lot of the activities, my best perspective, and Rich and I have talked a lot about this, whether something gets done in the veto session around the Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act, I would tell you, it's, from my perspective, a challenge was, I like to use sports analogies, I call it a long pot, right, to get done in the veto session. 
So that's our best perspective on it in terms of what we think may still happen this year. Importantly, where we're going to continue to focus our efforts on."

Yes, clearly, we've seen the governor and other groups come out and say they oppose the existing framework that's out there. And look, the thing that we think is important, recognizing a lot of that may be. And so I'm speculating a bit, just surrounding the issues with Commonwealth Edison and the investigations and how it was linked to when performance-based rate making was put in place many years ago. Our job, and Rich and his team, they do a terrific job at this, we're just going to sit down and just make sure we meet with stakeholders in a collaborative way, and just sit there and explain what this framework has really done. And that's really what we should do, it's been some open and transparent framework that essentially every year, the Illinois Commerce Commission takes a look at what we're doing. 
And you've heard me say and espouse the benefits of this particular framework. And the real winner has been the State of Illinois and our customers. It's been an overwhelming success in so many ways. And so it's just important that we make sure we level set everybody. At the same time, now we're going to be at the table, listening to their concerns. And if they have legitimate concerns, we'll see what ways we can try to bridge whatever gaps there may be. And so that's just how we will continue to do business. 
And as I said a moment ago, really, the key from our perspective is sitting at the table and really to put in place constructive energy policies. They're going to support investment in infrastructure, energy infrastructure in particular, gives us the ability to earn a fair return on those investments, but also to deliver significant value our customers in the State of Illinois and create thousands of jobs. 
So we think there's opportunities to and there will be opportunities to sit down and talk with these stakeholders, and make sure we have a good understanding of what's been done and what we think can be done prospectively. And so there is a lot of noise. 
Look, we recognize that creates challenges, I get it. But at the same time, just because there's noise doesn't mean that we're not going to sit down and have a collaborative approach with these key stakeholders."

Before I jump into our presentation, I'll start by saying that I hope you, your families and colleagues are safe and healthy during this challenging time. 
This morning, I will begin our presentation by providing a COVID-19 update and in particular, highlight the actions we have taken to support our customers, communities and coworkers. I will then touch on our second quarter results and 2020 earnings guidance, and finish with a discussion of several key elements of our strategy that we continue to execute very well, which will position us to continue delivering strong, long-term value for our customers and shareholders. 
Turning now to Slide 4 and COVID-19. Our strong commitment to the safety of our coworkers, customers and communities remains constant. So too is our strong focus on delivering safe, reliable and affordable electric and natural gas service during this unprecedented time. 
We recognize that millions of customers in Missouri and Illinois are depending on us. I can't express enough appreciation to my coworkers who have shown great agility, innovation, determination and a keen focus on safety and delivering on our mission to power the quality of life. While we are focused on delivering safe, reliable and affordable service, we also recognize that our mission goes beyond this during this challenging time. We recognized that our customers and communities have significant needs. That is why we are working directly with our customers on special payment plans for their utility bills. We are also working closely with many dedicated community partners and have contributed approximately $15 million for energy assistance and COVID-19 support to our customers in Missouri and Illinois. 
And I'm very pleased to tell you that our coworkers and Board of Directors are directly engaged in this effort through our AmerenCares ""Power of Giving"" for COVID-19. Together, these programs are helping our residential, small business and small business and not-for-profit customers meet their needs. In addition, we are tirelessly working with our customers to help them gain access to a host of federal support programs, including low-income energy assistance funds. Our customers are at the center of our strategy, and we will continue to take steps to help them during this unprecedented time. Throughout this challenging period, I'm also pleased to say that we have been effectively executing on our strategy across all of our businesses. The key element of our strategy is to invest in energy infrastructure to benefit our customers and in so doing, provide important jobs to support the local economy as well as local suppliers at a time when they are needed most. 
Looking ahead, we recognize that we will need to be managing the impacts of COVID-19 for some time. With safety and delivering on our mission and strategy at the top of our minds, we plan to continue managing our business under our current COVID-19 protocols, which includes having a significant portion of Ameren workforce working remotely for at least the end of this year. 
We also continue to carefully monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our electric sales, liquidity and supply chain. To date, these impacts have been manageable and in line with our expectations. At the same time, we remain focused on exercising financial discipline to mitigate the potential impacts of COVID-19, while capitalizing on some key opportunities that we have identified during this crisis, including benefits we are realizing from our digital transformation investments and streamlined operating practices. 
Turning now to Page 5 for an update on the second quarter results and 2020 earnings guidance. Yesterday, we announced second quarter 2020 earnings of $0.98 per share compared to $0.72 per share earned in 2019. 
A summary of the key drivers of the year-over-year increase of $0.26 per share is provided on this page, which Mike will discuss in more detail in a moment. The strong execution of our strategic plan drove strong quarterly earnings results and enabled us to affirm our 2020 earnings guidance range of $3.40 per share to $3.60 per share. 
Moving to Page 6. Here, we reiterate our strategic plan, which as I just mentioned, we've been executing very well throughout the year. We expect our plan to continue delivering significant value for our customers and strong long-term earnings growth for our shareholders. 
The first pillar of our strategy stresses investing in and operating our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. This has driven our multiyear focus on investing in energy infrastructure for the long-term benefit of customers in all of our jurisdictions. As you can see on the right side of this page, during the first half of this year, we invested significant capital in each of our business segments to best serve our customers. Most notably, Ameren Transmission, where we effectively managed a nearly 25% increase in infrastructure investment compared to the first half of 2019. These investments are delivering value to our customers and community. 
Our energy grid is becoming more reliable, resilient and secure. And our digital investments are enhancing our customers' experience. Of course, we are not done. Looking ahead, we continue to see the need for robust energy infrastructure investments to meet our customers' energy needs and exceed their expectations while keeping rates affordable. Our electric rates in both Missouri and Illinois continue to be well below the Midwest and national averages. As we discussed in our first quarter earnings call, new electric rates went into effect on April 1 of this year as a result of a constructive settlement in Ameren Missouri's electric rate review. 
The settlement included a $32 million annual revenue decrease, which marks the second consecutive decrease since 2018. Since Ameren Missouri's last electric weight review in 2017, its customer rates have decreased by 7% while at the same time, we have continued to make significant investments in energy infrastructure to benefit our customers. As Michael will cover in more detail later, we have also been very busy managing our electric and natural gas regulatory proceedings in Illinois. We expect a final decision in the electric proceeding by December of this year and a final decision in the gas proceeding by January of next year. 
Finally, another important element of the first pillar of our strategy has been and remains our relentless focus on continuous improvement and disciplined cost management to keep rates affordable. 
Moving to the second pillar of our strategy, which includes enhancing regulatory frameworks for the benefits of all stakeholders. As you know, we continue to support the proposed Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act in Illinois. This is important legislation would allow Ameren Illinois to make significant investments in solar energy and battery storage to improve reliability as well as to make investments in transportation electrification in order to benefit customers in the economy across Central and Southern Illinois. 
In addition, it would help address depressing energy policy challenges for challenges facing the state, including the need for additional renewable sources and better electric vehicle charging infrastructure. This bill will help address these challenges and move the State of Illinois closer to reaching this goal of 100% clean energy by 2050. 
In addition, this legislation would modify the allowed return on equity formula to increase the basis point adder to the average 30-year treasury rate from 580 to 680 and will also extend the electric performance-based rate making framework through 2032. Importantly, this legislation builds on Ameren Illinois' efforts to modernize the energy grid under a transparent and stable regulatory framework that has supported significant investment to modernize the energy grid, while improving reliability and creating approximately 1,400 jobs, all while keeping rates well below the Midwest and national averages. 
In fact, all-in residential rates in 2020 are down 1% compared to 2012, the first year of performance-based rates. Simply put, the performance-based grid monetization legislation that was passed in 2011 and extended twice by the Illinois legislature under different administrations has been an overwhelming success for Illinois. 
With all these benefits in mind, we remain focused on working with key stakeholders to get this important legislation passed. 
Turning now to Page 7. I'll provide an update on FERC regulatory matters. In May, the FERC issued an order on the rehearing request related to its November 2019 order addressing 2 complaint cases that reduced MISO's base return on equity. 
The order established a new base return on equity methodology using 3 models: the risk premium model, capital asset pricing metal and the discounted cash flow model. The revised order sets a base return on equity of 10.02% for transmission projects for the first complaint case period and effective as of September 28, 2016. This results in a return on equity of 10.52% for Ameren Transmission, including the 50 basis point adder for being a part of MISO. 
The FERC also dismissed the second complaint case. We are pleased with the order and believe it to be constructive as the new 3 model methodology expands the range of reasonableness used to assess whether current returns on equity are just and reasonable. The FERC also issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in March. Overall, we believe that the policies outlined in the Proposed Rulemaking are constructive. As a result, we, along with the other MISO transmission owners filed comments in June in support of the proposed increase to the RTO adder, reliability 
 and benefit based incentives and the ROE cap. We are unable to predict the ultimate timing or impact of these matters as the FERC is under no timeline to issue a decision. 
Moving now to Page 8 for an update on the third pillar of our strategy, creating and capitalizing on opportunities for investment for the benefit of our customers, shareholders and the environment. Here, we provide an update on our $1.2 billion wind generation investment plan to achieve compliance with Missouri's renewable energy standard through the acquisition of 700 megawatts of new wind generation at 2 sites in Missouri. 
In short, there has been no significant change to the project schedules from what we discussed on our first quarter call in May. Construction is well underway at both facilities. We are working closely with the developers for both projects to monitor the timing of manufacturing, shipment and installation of facility components. We continue to expect the 400-megawatt facility to be in service by the end of 2020. 
Regarding the 300-megawatt facility, we expect it to be substantially in service by the end of 2020. However, as a result of certain delays we discussed on our first quarter earnings call in May, we expect the portion of the project representing approximately $100 million of investment to be placed in service in the first quarter of 2021. We expect no reduction in production tax credits because of the recent rule changes made by the U.S. Department of the Treasury to extend the in-service criteria by 1 year to December 31, 2021. 
Furthermore, we will continue to explore additional renewable energy investment opportunities that will drive long-term value for our customers and shareholders. Right now, Ameren Missouri is in the process of finalizing its next integrated resource plan. For several months, we have been working closely with key stakeholders in developing our plan. We are carefully looking at several approaches to best meet our customers' future energy needs and effectively transition our generation to a cleaner, more diverse portfolio in a responsible fashion. We'll be finalizing our plan over the next 45 days and plan to file our IRP with the Missouri PSC by September 30. We are excited about the benefits that our current wind generation projects will deliver to all stakeholders as well as the prospects for additional renewable generation resources to meet our customers' energy needs in the future. Moving to Page 9. Clicking ahead through the end of this decade, we have a robust pipeline of investment opportunities, or over $36 billion that will deliver significant value to all of our stakeholders by making our energy grid stronger, smarter and cleaner. These investment opportunities exclude any potential new renewable generation for the Missouri integrated resource plan as well as any potential new multi value transmission projects that will increase the reliability and resiliency of the energy grid as well as enable additional renewable generation projects. 
Of course, our investment opportunities will not only create a stronger and cleaner energy grid to meet our customers' needs and exceed their expectations. But they will also create thousands of jobs for local economies. Maintaining constructive energy policies that support robust investment in energy infrastructure will be critical to meeting our country's future energy needs and delivering on our customers' expectations. 
Moving to Page 10. To sum up our value proposition, the consistent execution of our strategy over many years and on many fronts has positioned us well for future success. We remain firmly convinced that the execution of this strategy in 2020 and beyond will deliver superior value to our customers, shareholders and the environment. 
In May, we affirmed our 5-year growth plan, which included our expectation of 6% to 8% compound annual earnings per share growth for the 2020 through 2024 period using the 2020 EPS guidance range midpoint as the base. This earnings growth is primarily driven by our approximate 9% compound annual rate base growth in 2019 through 2024 and compares very favorably with our regulated utility peers. I am confident in our ability to execute our investment plans and strategies across all 4 of our business segments, as we have an experienced and dedicated team to get it done. 
Further, our shares continue to offer investors a solid dividend. Our strong earnings growth expectations position us well for future dividend growth. Of course, future dividend decisions will be driven by earnings growth, in addition to cash flows and other business conditions. Together, we believe our strong earnings growth outlook, combined with our solid dividend, results in a very attractive total return opportunity for shareholders. 
Again, thank you all for joining us today. And I'll now turn the call over to Michael. Michael?"

The key factors by segment tha",1097,"Thanks, Warner, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 12 of our presentation. Yesterday, we reported second quarter 2020 earnings of $0.98 per share compared to earnings of $0.72 per share for the year ago quarter. The key factors by segment that drove the overall $0.26 per share increase are highlighted on this page. 
Ameren Missouri, our largest segment, reported increased earnings of $0.18 per share. The increase in earnings was driven by lower operations and maintenance expenses, including the absence of a scheduled Callaway Energy Center refueling and maintenance outage as well as disciplined cost management and favorable market -- favorable market returns on company-owned life insurance investments, which together increased earnings by $0.15 per share. The year-over-year improvement also reflected new electric service rates effective April 1, driven in part by increased infrastructure investments. 
The year-over-year impact from electric sales was flat as the $0.05 per share benefit from near-normal temperatures in the second quarter compared to milder than normal temperatures in the previous year were offset by a $0.05 per share reduction from lower weather normalized sales, primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19. 
Moving now to Ameren Transmission. Earnings per share were up $0.07. This increase reflected the impact of the FERC order on the MISO base allowed return on equity, which increased earnings $0.04 per share as well as increased infrastructure investments. 
Earnings for Ameren Illinois Natural Gas were up $0.03 per share due to increased infrastructure investments and lower operations and maintenance expenses. Ameren Illinois electric distribution earnings were down $0.01 per share, reflecting a lower expected allowed return on equity under performance-based REIT making, partially offset by increased infrastructure investments. 
And finally, Ameren Parent and other results also decreased $0.01 per share, primarily due to increased interest expense resulting from the long-term debt issuance in early April. Moving now to Page 13 of our presentation. I'd like to briefly touch on key drivers impacting our 2020 earnings guidance. As Warner stated, we continue to expect 2020 diluted earnings to be in the range of $3.40 to $3.60 per share. This guidance range assumes normal weather in the remaining 6 months of the year as well as reflect sales updates from our first quarter earnings call in May, primarily related to COVID-19. 
On our call in May, we estimated COVID-19-related sales impacts in Ameren Missouri would reduce our 2020 earnings per share expectations by approximately $0.10 per share, and we believe this continues to be a solid estimate. 
For the year, we still expect total weather-normalized sales to be on approximately 2.5%. Broken down by customer class, we expect 2020 commercial sales to decline approximately 7.5%. Industrial sales declined approximately 4.5% and residential sales to increase approximately 4%. 
While we've seen a slight change in the relative mix of sales, overall, our update today is largely consistent with our expectations outlined in our call in May in terms of both total sales and EPS impacts for 2020 due to COVID 19. Before moving on, I would note that Ameren Missouri customer sales for June, excluding the impact of warmer than normal weather, we're down approximately 0.2% compared to the prior year, reflecting the impact of COVID-19. Broken down by customer class and compared to the prior year, Ameren Missouri June weather-normalized commercial and industrial sales declined approximately 9.5% and 3%, respectively, which were largely offset by an increased weather-normalized sales to residential customers of approximately 11%. These statistics are notable, given they represent the first full month of sales after the state homeowners were lifted. 
Before moving on, let me briefly cover electric sales trends for Ameren Illinois electric distribution for the first 6 months of this year compared to the first 6 months of last year. Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois residential customers increased about 4%, and weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois commercial and industrial customers decreased approximately 7% and 8%, respectively. 
Recall that changes in electric sales in Illinois, no matter the cause, do not affect earnings since we have full revenue decoupling. Moving on to other guidance considerations. Select earnings considerations by quarter for the balance of the year are listed on this page. 
Our 2020 earnings guidance range also incorporates an estimated 2020 allowed ROE for Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution of 7.2%, which reflects a 30-year treasury yield of approximately 1.4%. 
Finally, we also remain very focused on maintaining disciplined cost management for the remainder of the year. Moving now to Page 14 for other regulatory matters. 
In April, we made our required annual electric distribution rate update filing. Under Illinois performance-based rate making, our utilities are required to file annual updates to systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost of service and to true-up any prior period over or under recoveries of such costs. 
In late June, the ICC staff recommended a $53 million base rate decrease compared to our request of a $45 million base rate decrease. Decision is expected in December with new rates expected to be effective in January 2021. 
Earlier this year, we also filed with the ICC for an annual increase in Ameren Illinois Natural Gas distribution rates using a 2021 future test year and have since updated our request in our July rebuttal testimony. In June, the ICC staff and other interveners, including the Citizens Utility Board and the Illinois Industrial Energy Consumers filed a rebuttal testimony in the rate review. Our original request as well as our July rebuttal testimony, incorporated a 10.5% return on equity, while staff and other interveners have recommended a 9.32% and 9.2% return on equity, respectively. We continue to seek a 54% equity ratio compared to the ICC staff's and other interveners recommendation of 50.43% and 50%, respectively. A decision is expected by January 2021 with new rates expected to be effective in February of 2021. Finally, turning to Page 15, I will summarize. We have a strong team and are well positioned to continue executing our plan. We continue to expect to deliver strong earnings growth in 2020, and we're successfully executing our strategy and navigate the impacts of COVID-19. 
As we look to the longer term, we continue to expect strong earnings per share growth driven by robust rate base growth and disciplined cost management. Further, we believe this growth compares very favorably to the growth of our utility peers. And Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. 
In total, we have an attractive total shareholder return story that converges very favorably to our peers. And now I'll turn it back over to Warner."

All we has spent a great deal of time this morning talking about how we are effectively addressing issues associated with COVID-19 and delivering strong results for our customers and shareholders. I think it's important to note that another matter is at the top of our minds. That matter is the level of profound racial prejudice, injustice and intolerance that we still have in this country and in our own community, especially against black people. 
We have recently seen too many senseless deaths of African Americans. And to be clear, there is absolutely no place for racism, injustice or hatred of any kind at Ameren, in our community, in our country, or anywhere in the world. We must challenge such behavior when we witness it and take steps to drive positive changes to eliminate it, and that is exactly what we're doing at Ameren. At Ameren, diversity, equity and inclusion is a core value. While we have been recognized by Diversity, Inc. as one of the top utilities in the country for our diversity, equity and inclusion practices, we are not standing still. 
In fact, we recently conducted a virtual Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Summit in St. Louis. The theme of the summit was, the courage to live your values. Ameren leaders, community leaders and national leaders came together to begin listening to each other more thoughtfully and to begin taking even more steps to address this critical issue. We have made the entire program available on our website. I encourage you to take time and listen to the amazing stories of courage and passion for diversity, equity and inclusion. 
We're now ready to take your questions."

Just wondering if something could get done in the veto session in November? Or is it more likely to get pushed into next year?"

So a couple of things to thi",458,"Sure. Let me try and take that in several pieces. And Richard, Mark and his team have continue to work very hard to have conversations virtually, of course, with the key stakeholders and not just legislators of stakeholders. 
So a couple of things to think about there. In terms of energy policy, I think energy policy broadly in the State of Illinois is still at the top of a lot of folks' minds, and rightfully so, because energy policy is so important. That's why, as we said, as part of our talking points as well as what you've heard us say before, that's why we support so strongly the Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act because it really addresses many of the key issues that the State of Illinois is focused on. More renewable energy resources, more investments in electrification as well as grid modernization. These are things that have been really important for the State of Illinois and will continue to be. 
And so we continue to have conversations with key stakeholders around that particular piece of legislation that we still support. Having said that, as you know, there's been a lot of dialogue and some concerns raised as a result of the Commonwealth Edison federal investigation, so we understand that. 
And so consequently, as we think ahead, what we're going to do is continue to double down on our efforts to work with stakeholders collaboratively, listen to the concerns, but make sure that we point out the value of the current regulatory framework and our proposal. And at the end of the day, our focus is going to continue to be to try and find a solution that gives us the ability, collectively in the State of Illinois to invest in critical infrastructure and give us the ability to earn a fair return and deliver values to our customers in the State of Illinois. 
Now in terms of timing, and I've learned a long time ago that I don't predict when things will be addressed by any legislature or when things will ultimately get done. And obviously, things are a little bit more complicated as we approach this upcoming veto session. In light of a lot of the activities, my best perspective, and Rich and I have talked a lot about this, whether something gets done in the veto session around the Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act, I would tell you, it's, from my perspective, a challenge was, I like to use sports analogies, I call it a long put, right, to get done in the veto session. 
So that's our best perspective on it in terms of what we think may still happen this year. Importantly, where we're going to continue to focus our efforts on."

Yes, clearly, we've seen the governor and other groups come out and say they oppose the existing framework that's out there. And look, the thing that we think is important, recognizing a lot of that may be. And so I'm speculating a bit, just simply surrounding the issues with Commonwealth Edison and the investigations and how it was linked to when performance-based rate making was put in place many years ago. Our job, and Rich and his team, they do a terrific job at this, we're just going to sit down and just make sure we meet with stakeholders in a collaborative way, and just sit there and explain what this framework has really done. And that's really what we should do, it's been some open and transparent framework that essentially every year, the Illinois Commerce Commission takes a look at what we're doing. 
And you've heard me say and espouse the benefits of this, this particular framework. And the real winner has been the State of Illinois and our customers. It's been an overwhelming success in so many ways. And so it's just important that we make sure we level set everybody. At the same time, now we're going to be at the table, listening to their concerns. And if they have legitimate concerns, we'll see what ways we can try to bridge whatever gaps there may be. And so that's just how we will continue to do business. 
And as I said a moment ago, really, the key from our perspective is sitting at the table and really to put in place constructive energy policies. They're going to support investment in infrastructure, energy infrastructure in particular, gives us the ability to earn a fair return on those investments, but also to deliver significant value our customers in the State of Illinois and create thousands of jobs. 
So we think there's opportunities to and there will be opportunities to sit down and talk with these stakeholders, and make sure we have a good understanding of what's been done and what we think can be done prospectively. And so there is a lot of noise. 
Look, we recognize that creates challenges, I get it. But at the same time, just because there's noise doesn't mean that we're not going to sit down and have a collaborative approach with these key stakeholders."

Before I jump into our presentation, I'll start by saying that I hope you, your families and colleagues are safe and healthy during this challenging time. 
This morning, I will begin our presentation by providing a COVID-19 update and in particular, highlight the actions we have taken to support our customers, communities and coworkers. I will then touch on our second quarter results and 2020 earnings guidance, and finish with a discussion of several key elements of our strategy that we continue to execute very well, which will position us to continue delivering strong, long-term value for our customers and shareholders. 
Turning now to Slide 4 and COVID-19. Our strong commitment to the safety of our coworkers, customers and communities remains constant. So too is our strong focus on delivering safe, reliable and affordable electric and natural gas service during this unprecedented time. 
We recognize that millions of customers in Missouri and Illinois are depending on us. I can't express enough appreciation to my coworkers who have shown great agility, innovation, determination and a keen focus on safety and delivering on our mission to power the quality of life. While we are focused on delivering safe, reliable and affordable service, we also recognize that our mission goes beyond this during this challenging time. We recognized that our customers and communities have significant needs. That is why we are working directly with our customers on special payment plans for their utility bills. We are also working closely with many dedicated community partners and have contributed approximately $15 million for energy assistance and COVID-19 support to our customers in Missouri and Illinois. 
And I'm very pleased to tell you that our coworkers and Board of Directors are directly engaged in this effort through our AmerenCares ""Power of Giving"" for COVID-19. Together, these programs are helping our residential, small business and small business and not-for-profit customers meet their needs. In addition, we are tirelessly working with our customers to help them gain access to a host of federal support programs, including low-income energy assistance funds. Our customers are at the center of our strategy, and we will continue to take steps to help them during this unprecedented time. Throughout this challenging period, I'm also pleased to say that we have been effectively executing on our strategy across all of our businesses. The key element of our strategy is to invest in energy infrastructure to benefit our customers and in so doing, provide important jobs to support the local economy as well as local suppliers at a time when they are needed most. 
Looking ahead, we recognize that we will need to be managing the impacts of COVID-19 for some time. With safety and delivering on our mission and strategy at the top of our minds, we plan to continue managing our business under our current COVID-19 protocols, which includes having a significant portion of Ameren workforce working remotely for at least the end of this year. 
We also continue to carefully monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our electric sales, liquidity and supply chain. To date, these impacts have been manageable and in line with our expectations. At the same time, we remain focused on exercising financial discipline to mitigate the potential impacts of COVID-19, while capitalizing on some key opportunities that we have identified during this crisis, including benefits we are realizing from our digital transformation investments and streamlined operating practices. 
Turning now to Page 5 for an update on the second quarter results and 2020 earnings guidance. Yesterday, we announced second quarter 2020 earnings of $0.98 per share compared to $0.72 per share earned in 2019. 
A summary of the key drivers of the year-over-year increase of $0.26 per share is provided on this page, which Mike will discuss in more detail in a moment. The strong execution of our strategic plan drove strong quarterly earnings results and enabled us to affirm our 2020 earnings guidance range of $3.40 per share to $3.60 per share. 
Moving to Page 6. Here, we reiterate our strategic plan, which as I just mentioned, we've been executing very well throughout the year. We expect our plan to continue delivering significant value for our customers and strong long-term earnings growth for our shareholders. 
The first pillar of our strategy stresses investing in and operating our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. This has driven our multiyear focus on investing in energy infrastructure for the long-term benefit of customers in all of our jurisdictions. As you can see on the right side of this page, during the first half of this year, we invested significant capital in each of our business segments to best serve our customers. Most notably, Ameren Transmission, where we effectively managed a nearly 25% increase in infrastructure investment compared to the first half of 2019. These investments are delivering value to our customers and community. 
Our energy grid is becoming more reliable, resilient and secure. And our digital investments are enhancing our customers' experience. Of course, we are not done. Looking ahead, we continue to see the need for robust energy infrastructure investments to meet our customers' energy needs and exceed their expectations while keeping rates affordable. Our electric rates in both Missouri and Illinois continue to be well below the Midwest and national averages. As we discussed in our first quarter earnings call, new electric rates went into effect on April 1 of this year as a result of a constructive settlement in Ameren Missouri's electric rate review. 
The settlement included a $32 million annual revenue decrease, which marks the second consecutive decrease since 2018. Since Ameren Missouri's last electric weight review in 2017, its customer rates have decreased by 7% while at the same time, we have continued to make significant investments in energy infrastructure to benefit our customers. As Michael will cover in more detail later, we have also been very busy managing our electric and natural gas regulatory proceedings in Illinois. We expect a final decision in the electric proceeding by December of this year and a final decision in the gas proceeding by January of next year. 
Finally, another important element of the first pillar of our strategy has been and remains our relentless focus on continuous improvement and disciplined cost management to keep rates affordable. 
Moving to the second pillar of our strategy, which includes enhancing regulatory frameworks for the benefits of all stakeholders. As you know, we continue to support the proposed Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act in Illinois. This is important legislation would allow Ameren Illinois to make significant investments in solar energy and battery storage to improve reliability as well as to make investments in transportation electrification in order to benefit customers in the economy across Central and Southern Illinois. 
In addition, it would help address depressing energy policy challenges for challenges facing the state, including the need for additional renewable sources and better electric vehicle charging infrastructure. This bill will help address these challenges and move the State of Illinois closer to reaching this goal of 100% clean energy by 2050. 
In addition, this legislation would modify the allowed return on equity formula to increase the basis point adder to the average 30-year treasury rate from 580 to 680 and will also extend the electric performance-based rate-making framework through 2032. Importantly, this legislation builds on Ameren Illinois' efforts to modernize the energy grid under a transparent and stable regulatory framework that has supported significant investment to modernize the energy grid, while improving reliability and creating approximately 1,400 jobs, all while keeping rates well below the Midwest and national averages. 
In fact, all-in residential rates in 2020 are down 1% compared to 2012, the first year of performance-based rates. Simply put, the performance-based grid monetization legislation that was passed in 2011 and extended twice by the Illinois legislature under different administrations has been an overwhelming success for Illinois. 
With all these benefits in mind, we remain focused on working with key stakeholders to get this important legislation passed. 
Turning now to Page 7. I'll provide an update on FERC regulatory matters. In May, the FERC issued an order on the rehearing request related to its November 2019 order addressing 2 complaint cases that reduced MISO's base return on equity. 
The order established a new base return on equity methodology using 3 models: the risk premium model, capital asset pricing metal and the discounted cash flow model. The revised order sets a base return on equity of 10.02% for transmission projects for the first complaint case period and effective as of September 28, 2016. This results in a return on equity of 10.52% for Ameren Transmission, including the 50 basis point adder for being a part of MISO. 
The FERC also dismissed the second complaint case. We are pleased with the order and believe it to be constructive as the new 3 model methodology expands the range of reasonableness used to assess whether current returns on equity are just and reasonable. The FERC also issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in March. Overall, we believe that the policies outlined in the Proposed Rulemaking are constructive. As a result, we, along with the other MISO transmission owners, filed comments in June in support of the proposed increase to the RTO adder, reliability and benefit-based incentives and the ROE cap. We are unable to predict the ultimate timing or impact of these matters as the FERC is under no timeline to issue a decision. 
Moving now to Page 8 for an update on the third pillar of our strategy, creating and capitalizing on opportunities for investment for the benefit of our customers, shareholders and the environment. Here, we provide an update on our $1.2 billion wind generation investment plan to achieve compliance with Missouri's renewable energy standard through the acquisition of 700 megawatts of new wind generation at 2 sites in Missouri. 
In short, there has been no significant change to the project schedules from what we discussed on our first quarter call in May. Construction is well underway at both facilities. We are working closely with the developers for both projects to monitor the timing of manufacturing, shipment and installation of facility components. We continue to expect the 400-megawatt facility to be in service by the end of 2020. 
Regarding the 300-megawatt facility, we expect it to be substantially in service by the end of 2020. However, as a result of certain delays we discussed on our first quarter earnings call in May, we expect the portion of the project representing approximately $100 million of investment to be placed in service in the first quarter of 2021. We expect no reduction in production tax credits because of the recent rule changes made by the U.S. Department of the Treasury to extend the in-service criteria by 1 year to December 31, 2021. 
Furthermore, we will continue to explore additional renewable energy investment opportunities that will drive long-term value for our customers and shareholders. Right now, Ameren Missouri is in the process of finalizing its next integrated resource plan. For several months, we have been working closely with key stakeholders in developing our plan. We are carefully looking at several approaches to best meet our customers' future energy needs and effectively transition our generation to a cleaner, more diverse portfolio in a responsible fashion. We'll be finalizing our plan over the next 45 days and plan to file our IRP with the Missouri PSC by September 30. We are excited about the benefits that our current wind generation projects will deliver to all stakeholders as well as the prospects for additional renewable generation resources to meet our customers' energy needs in the future. Moving to Page 9. Clicking ahead through the end of this decade, we have a robust pipeline of investment opportunities, or over $36 billion that will deliver significant value to all of our stakeholders by making our energy grid stronger, smarter and cleaner. These investment opportunities exclude any potential new renewable generation for the Missouri integrated resource plan as well as any potential new multi-value transmission projects that will increase the reliability and resiliency of the energy grid as well as enable additional renewable generation projects. 
Of course, our investment opportunities will not only create a stronger and cleaner energy grid to meet our customers' needs and exceed their expectations. But they will also create thousands of jobs for local economies. Maintaining constructive energy policies that support robust investment in energy infrastructure will be critical to meeting our country's future energy needs and delivering on our customers' expectations. 
Moving to Page 10. To sum up our value proposition, the consistent execution of our strategy over many years and on many fronts has positioned us well for future success. We remain firmly convinced that the execution of this strategy in 2020 and beyond will deliver superior value to our customers, shareholders and the environment. 
In May, we affirmed our 5-year growth plan, which included our expectation of 6% to 8% compound annual earnings per share growth for the 2020 through 2024 period using the 2020 EPS guidance range midpoint as the base. This earnings growth is primarily driven by our approximate 9% compound annual rate base growth in 2019 through 2024 and compares very favorably with our regulated utility peers. I am confident in our ability to execute our investment plans and strategies across all 4 of our business segments, as we have an experienced and dedicated team to get it done. 
Further, our shares continue to offer investors a solid dividend. Our strong earnings growth expectations position us well for future dividend growth. Of course, future dividend decisions will be driven by earnings growth, in addition to cash flows and other business conditions. Together, we believe our strong earnings growth outlook, combined with our solid dividend, results in a very attractive total return opportunity for shareholders. 
Again, thank you all for joining us today. And I'll now turn the call over to Michael. Michael?"

Yesterday, we reported second quarter 2020 earnings of $0.98 per share compared to earnings of $0.72 per share for the year ago quarter. The key factors by segment that drove the overall $0.26 per share increase are highlighted on this page. 
Ameren Missouri, our largest segment, reported increased earnings of $0.18 per share. The increase in earnings was driven by lower operations and maintenance expenses, including the absence of a scheduled Callaway Energy Center refueling and maintenance outage as well as disciplined cost management and favorable market -- favorable market returns on company-owned life insurance investments, which together increased earnings by $0.15 per share. The year-over-year improvement also reflected new electric service rates effective April 1, driven in part by increased infrastructure investments. 
The year-over-year impact from electric sales was flat as the $0.05 per share benefit from near-normal temperatures in the second quarter compared to milder than normal temperatures in the previous year were offset by a $0.05 per share reduction from lower weather normalized sales, primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19. 
Moving now to Ameren Transmission. Earnings per share were up $0.07. This increase reflected the impact of the FERC order on the MISO base allowed return on equity, which increased earnings $0.04 per share as well as increased infrastructure investments. 
Earnings for Ameren Illinois Natural Gas were up $0.03 per share due to increased infrastructure investments and lower operations and maintenance expenses. Ameren Illinois electric distribution earnings were down $0.01 per share, reflecting a lower expected allowed return on equity under performance-based REIT making, partially offset by increased infrastructure investments. 
And finally, Ameren Parent and other results also decreased $0.01 per share, primarily due to increased interest expense resulting from the long-term debt issuance in early April. Moving now to Page 13 of our presentation. I'd like to briefly touch on key drivers impacting our 2020 earnings guidance. As Warner stated, we continue to expect 2020 diluted earnings to be in the range of $3.40 to $3.60 per share. This guidance range assumes normal weather in the remaining 6 months of the year as well as reflect sales updates from our first quarter earnings call in May, primarily related to COVID-19. 
On our call in May, we estimated COVID-19-related sales impacts in Ameren Missouri would reduce our 2020 earnings per share expectations by approximately $0.10 per share, and we believe this continues to be a solid estimate. 
For the year, we still expect total weather-normalized sales to be on approximately 2.5%. Broken down by customer class, we expect 2020 commercial sales to decline approximately 7.5%. Industrial sales declined approximately 4.5% and residential sales to increase approximately 4%. 
While we've seen a slight change in the relative mix of sales, overall, our update today is largely consistent with our expectations outlined in our call in May in terms of both total sales and EPS impacts for 2020 due to COVID 19. Before moving on, I would note that Ameren Missouri customer sales for June, excluding the impact of warmer than normal weather, we're down approximately 0.2% compared to the prior year, reflecting the impact of COVID-19. Broken down by customer class and compared to the prior year, Ameren Missouri June weather-normalized commercial and industrial sales declined approximately 9.5% and 3%, respectively, which were largely offset by an increased weather-normalized sales to residential customers of approximately 11%. These statistics are notable, given they represent the first full month of sales after the state homeowners were lifted. 
Before moving on, let me briefly cover electric sales trends for Ameren Illinois electric distribution for the first 6 months of this year compared to the first 6 months of last year. Weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales to Illinois residential customers increased about 4%, and weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales to Illinois commercial and industrial customers decreased approximately 7% and 8%, respectively. 
Recall that changes in electric sales in Illinois, no matter the cause, do not affect earnings since we have full revenue decoupling. Moving on to other guidance considerations. Select earnings considerations by quarter for the balance of the year are listed on this page. 
Our 2020 earnings guidance range also incorporates an estimated 2020 allowed ROE for Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution of 7.2%, which reflects a 30-year treasury yield of approximately 1.4%. 
Finally, we also remain very focused on maintaining disciplined cost management for the remainder of the year. Moving now to Page 14 for other regulatory matters. 
In April, we made our required annual electric distribution rate update filing. Under Illinois performance-based rate-making, our utilities are required to file annual updates to systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost of service and to true-up any prior period over- or under-recoveries of such costs. 
In late June, the ICC staff recommended a $53 million base rate decrease compared to our request of a $45 million base rate decrease. Decision is expected in December with new rates expected to be effective in January 2021. 
Earlier this year, we also filed with the ICC for an annual increase in Ameren Illinois Natural Gas distribution rates using a 2021 future test year and have since updated our request in our July rebuttal testimony. In June, the ICC staff and other interveners, including the Citizens Utility Board and the Illinois Industrial Energy Consumers filed a rebuttal testimony in the rate review. Our original request as well as our July rebuttal testimony, incorporated a 10.5% return on equity, while staff and other interveners have recommended a 9.32% and 9.2% return on equity, respectively. We continue to seek a 54% equity ratio compared to the ICC staff's and other interveners' recommendation of 50.43% and 50%, respectively. A decision is expected by January 2021 with new rates expected to be effective in February of 2021. Finally, turning to Page 15, I will summarize. We have a strong team and are well positioned to continue executing our plan. We continue to expect to deliver strong earnings growth in 2020, and we're successfully executing our strategy and navigate the impacts of COVID-19. 
As we look to the longer term, we continue to expect strong earnings per share growth driven by robust rate base growth and disciplined cost management. Further, we believe this growth compares very favorably to the growth of our utility peers. And Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. 
In total, we have an attractive total shareholder return story that converges very favorably to our peers. And now I'll turn it back over to Warner."

All we has spent a great deal of time this morning talking about how we are effectively addressing issues associated with COVID-19 and delivering strong results for our customers and shareholders. I think it's important to note that another matter is at the top of our minds. That matter is the level of profound racial prejudice, injustice and intolerance that we still have in this country and in our own community, especially against black people. 
We have recently seen too many senseless deaths of African Americans. And to be clear, there is absolutely no place for racism, injustice or hatred of any kind at Ameren, in our community, in our country, or anywhere in the world. We must challenge such behavior when we witness it and take steps to drive positive changes to eliminate it, and that is exactly what we're doing at Ameren. At Ameren, diversity, equity and inclusion is a core value. While we have been recognized by Diversity, Inc. as one of the top utilities in the country for our diversity, equity and inclusion practices, we are not standing still. 
In fact, we recently conducted a virtual Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Summit in St. Louis. The theme of the summit was, the courage to live your values. Ameren leaders, community leaders and national leaders came together to begin listening to each other more thoughtfully and to begin taking even more steps to address this critical issue. We have made the entire program available on our website. I encourage you to take time and listen to the amazing stories of courage and passion for diversity, equity and inclusion. 
We're now ready to take your questions."

But I can tell you, the conversations have been constructive. The insight is great. And we look forward to submitting that integrated resource plan. And as you heard in my talking points, we've -- we look at a lot of things in this integrated resource plan. We certainly look at the technology, which is out there, and we've certainly seen renewable energy technology and their related costs continue to come down, take a careful look at our coal-fired and energy centers and the useful lives of those plants, and we really think about what's really going to deliver value to our customers in the state of Missouri.

Obviously, where we have opportunities on -- because of reduced load, there's reduced maintenance cost, obviously, from a travel, entertainment perspective, being very thoughtful there. And so I think the team's done a nice job, continue to help offset some of these things going in 2020. In terms of sort of what we retain and what is recurring. I mean Warner can certainly touch on 2021. But at the moment, we're just going to continue to watch this closely. It's helping us offset some of these sales headwinds that we have.

And Richard, Mark and his team have continue to work very hard to have conversations virtually, of course, with the key stakeholders and not just legislators of stakeholders. 
So a couple of things to think about there. In terms of energy policy, I think energy policy broadly in the State of Illinois is still at the top of a lot of folks' minds, and rightfully so, because energy policy is so important. That's why, as we said, as part of our talking points as well as what you've heard us say before, that's why we support so strongly the Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act because it really addresses many of the key issues that the State of Illinois is focused on. More renewable energy resources, more investments in electrification as well as grid modernization. These are things that have been really important for the State of Illinois and will continue to be. 
And so we continue to have conversations with key stakeholders around that particular piece of legislation that we still support. Having said that, as you know, there's been a lot of dialogue and some concerns raised as a result of the Commonwealth Edison federal investigation, so we understand that. 
And so consequently, as we think ahead, what we're going to do is continue to double down on our efforts to work with stakeholders collaboratively, listen to the concerns, but make sure that we point out the value of the current regulatory framework and our proposal. And at the end of the day, our focus is going to continue to be to try and find a solution that gives us the ability, collectively in the State of Illinois to invest in critical infrastructure and give us the ability to earn a fair return and deliver values to our customers in the State of Illinois. 
Now in terms of timing, and I've learned a long time ago that I don't predict when things will be addressed by any legislature or when things will ultimately get done. And obviously, things are a little bit more complicated as we approach this upcoming veto session. In light of a lot of the activities, my best perspective, and Rich and I have talked a lot about this, whether something gets done in the veto session around the Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act, I would tell you, it's, from my perspective, a challenge was, I like to use sports analogies, I call it a long put, right, to get done in the veto session. 
So that's our best perspective on it in terms of what we think may still happen this year. Importantly, where we're going to continue to focus our efforts on."

Yes, clearly, we've seen the governor and other groups come out and say they oppose the existing framework that's out there.

Our job, and Rich and his team, they do a terrific job at this, we're just going to sit down and just make sure we meet with stakeholders in a collaborative way, and just sit there and explain what this framework has really done. And that's really what we should do, it's been some open and transparent framework that essentially every year, the Illinois Commerce Commission takes a look at what we're doing. 
And you've heard me say and espouse the benefits of this, this particular framework. And the real winner has been the State of Illinois and our customers. It's been an overwhelming success in so many ways. And so it's just important that we make sure we level set everybody. At the same time, now we're going to be at the table, listening to their concerns. And if they have legitimate concerns, we'll see what ways we can try to bridge whatever gaps there may be. And so that's just how we will continue to do business. 
And as I said a moment ago, really, the key from our perspective is sitting at the table and really to put in place constructive energy policies. They're going to support investment in infrastructure, energy infrastructure in particular, gives us the ability to earn a fair return on those investments, but also to deliver significant value our customers in the State of Illinois and create thousands of jobs. 
So we think there's opportunities to and there will be opportunities to sit down and talk with these stakeholders and make sure we have a good understanding of what's been done and what we think can be done prospectively. And so there is a lot of noise. 
Look, we recognize that creates challenges, I get it. But at the same time, just because there's noise doesn't mean that we're not going to sit down and have a collaborative approach with these key stakeholders."

Before I jump into our presentation, I'll start by saying that I hope you, your families and colleagues are safe and healthy during this challenging time. 
This morning, I will begin our presentation by providing a COVID-19 update and in particular, highlight the actions we have taken to support our customers, communities and coworkers. I will then touch on our second quarter results and 2020 earnings guidance, and finish with a discussion of several key elements of our strategy that we continue to execute very well, which will position us to continue delivering strong, long-term value for our customers and shareholders. 
Turning now to Slide 4 and COVID-19. Our strong commitment to the safety of our coworkers, customers and communities remains constant. So too is our strong focus on delivering safe, reliable and affordable electric and natural gas service during this unprecedented time. 
We recognize that millions of customers in Missouri and Illinois are depending on us. I can't express enough appreciation to my coworkers who have shown great agility, innovation, determination and a keen focus on safety and delivering on our mission to power the quality of life. While we are focused on delivering safe, reliable and affordable service, we also recognize that our mission goes beyond this during this challenging time. We recognized that our customers and communities have significant needs. That is why we are working directly with our customers on special payment plans for their utility bills. We are also working closely with many dedicated community partners and have contributed approximately $15 million for energy assistance and COVID-19 support to our customers in Missouri and Illinois. 
And I'm very pleased to tell you that our coworkers and Board of Directors are directly engaged in this effort through our AmerenCares ""Power of Giving"" for COVID-19. Together, these programs are helping our residential, small business and small business and not-for-profit customers meet their needs. In addition, we are tirelessly working with our customers to help them gain access to a host of federal support programs, including low-income energy assistance funds. Our customers are at the center of our strategy, and we will continue to take steps to help them during this unprecedented time. Throughout this challenging period, I'm also pleased to say that we have been effectively executing on our strategy across all of our businesses. The key element of our strategy is to invest in energy infrastructure to benefit our customers and in so doing, provide important jobs to support the local economy as well as local suppliers at a time when they are needed most. 
Looking ahead, we recognize that we will need to be managing the impacts of COVID-19 for some time. With safety and delivering on our mission and strategy at the top of our minds, we plan to continue managing our business under our current COVID-19 protocols, which includes having a significant portion of Ameren workforce working remotely for at least the end of this year. 
We also continue to carefully monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our electric sales, liquidity and supply chain. To date, these impacts have been manageable and in line with our expectations. At the same time, we remain focused on exercising financial discipline to mitigate the potential impacts of COVID-19, while capitalizing on some key opportunities that we have identified during this crisis, including benefits we are realizing from our digital transformation investments and streamlined operating practices. 
Turning now to Page 5 for an update on the second quarter results and 2020 earnings guidance. Yesterday, we announced second quarter 2020 earnings of $0.98 per share compared to $0.72 per share earned in 2019. 
A summary of the key drivers of the year-over-year increase of $0.26 per share is provided on this page, which Mike will discuss in more detail in a moment. The strong execution of our strategic plan drove strong quarterly earnings results and enabled us to affirm our 2020 earnings guidance range of $3.40 per share to $3.60 per share. 
Moving to Page 6. Here, we reiterate our strategic plan, which as I just mentioned, we've been executing very well throughout the year. We expect our plan to continue delivering significant value for our customers and strong long-term earnings growth for our shareholders. 
The first pillar of our strategy stresses investing in and operating our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. This has driven our multiyear focus on investing in energy infrastructure for the long-term benefit of customers in all of our jurisdictions. As you can see on the right side of this page, during the first half of this year, we invested significant capital in each of our business segments to best serve our customers. Most notably, Ameren Transmission, where we effectively managed a nearly 25% increase in infrastructure investment compared to the first half of 2019. These investments are delivering value to our customers and community. 
Our energy grid is becoming more reliable, resilient and secure. And our digital investments are enhancing our customers' experience. Of course, we are not done. Looking ahead, we continue to see the need for robust energy infrastructure investments to meet our customers' energy needs and exceed their expectations while keeping rates affordable. Our electric rates in both Missouri and Illinois continue to be well below the Midwest and national averages. As we discussed in our first quarter earnings call, new electric rates went into effect on April 1 of this year as a result of a constructive settlement in Ameren Missouri's electric rate review. 
The settlement included a $32 million annual revenue decrease, which marks the second consecutive decrease since 2018. Since Ameren Missouri's last electric weight review in 2017, its customer rates have decreased by 7% while at the same time, we have continued to make significant investments in energy infrastructure to benefit our customers. As Michael will cover in more detail later, we have also been very busy managing our electric and natural gas regulatory proceedings in Illinois. We expect a final decision in the electric proceeding by December of this year and a final decision in the gas proceeding by January of next year. 
Finally, another important element of the first pillar of our strategy has been and remains our relentless focus on continuous improvement and disciplined cost management to keep rates affordable. 
Moving to the second pillar of our strategy, which includes enhancing regulatory frameworks for the benefits of all stakeholders. As you know, we continue to support the proposed Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act in Illinois. This is important legislation would allow Ameren Illinois to make significant investments in solar energy and battery storage to improve reliability as well as to make investments in transportation electrification in order to benefit customers in the economy across Central and Southern Illinois. 
In addition, it would help address depressing energy policy challenges for challenges facing the state, including the need for additional renewable sources and better electric vehicle charging infrastructure. This bill will help address these challenges and move the State of Illinois closer to reaching this goal of 100% clean energy by 2050. 
In addition, this legislation would modify the allowed return on equity formula to increase the basis point adder to the average 30-year treasury rate from 580 to 680 and will also extend the electric performance-based rate-making framework through 2032. Importantly, this legislation builds on Ameren Illinois' efforts to modernize the energy grid under a transparent and stable regulatory framework that has supported significant investment to modernize the energy grid, while improving reliability and creating approximately 1,400 jobs, all while keeping rates well below the Midwest and national averages. 
In fact, all-in residential rates in 2020 are down 1% compared to 2012, the first year of performance-based rates. Simply put, the performance-based grid monetization legislation that was passed in 2011 and extended twice by the Illinois legislature under different administrations has been an overwhelming success for Illinois. 
With all these benefits in mind, we remain focused on working with key stakeholders to get this important legislation passed. 
Turning now to Page 7. I'll provide an update on FERC regulatory matters. In May, the FERC issued an order on the rehearing request related to its November 2019 order addressing 2 complaint cases that reduced MISO's base return on equity. 
The order established a new base return on equity methodology using 3 models: the risk premium model, capital asset pricing metal and the discounted cash flow model. The revised order sets a base return on equity of 10.02% for transmission projects for the first complaint case period and effective as of September 28, 2016. This results in a return on equity of 10.52% for Ameren Transmission, including the 50 basis point adder for being a part of MISO. 
The FERC also dismissed the second complaint case. We are pleased with the order and believe it to be constructive as the new 3 model methodology expands the range of reasonableness used to assess whether current returns on equity are just and reasonable. The FERC also issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in March. Overall, we believe that the policies outlined in the Proposed Rulemaking are constructive. As a result, we, along with the other MISO transmission owners, filed comments in June in support of the proposed increase to the RTO adder, reliability and benefit-based incentives and the ROE cap. We are unable to predict the ultimate timing or impact of these matters as the FERC is under no timeline to issue a decision. 
Moving now to Page 8 for an update on the third pillar of our strategy, creating and capitalizing on opportunities for investment for the benefit of our customers, shareholders and the environment. Here, we provide an update on our $1.2 billion wind generation investment plan to achieve compliance with Missouri's renewable energy standard through the acquisition of 700 megawatts of new wind generation at 2 sites in Missouri. 
In short, there has been no significant change to the project schedules from what we discussed on our first quarter call in May. Construction is well underway at both facilities. We are working closely with the developers for both projects to monitor the timing of manufacturing, shipment and installation of facility components. We continue to expect the 400-megawatt facility to be in service by the end of 2020. 
Regarding the 300-megawatt facility, we expect it to be substantially in service by the end of 2020. However, as a result of certain delays we discussed on our first quarter earnings call in May, we expect the portion of the project representing approximately $100 million of investment to be placed in service in the first quarter of 2021. We expect no reduction in production tax credits because of the recent rule changes made by the U.S. Department of the Treasury to extend the in-service criteria by 1 year to December 31, 2021. 
Furthermore, we will continue to explore additional renewable energy investment opportunities that will drive long-term value for our customers and shareholders. Right now, Ameren Missouri is in the process of finalizing its next integrated resource plan. For several months, we have been working closely with key stakeholders in developing our plan. We are carefully looking at several approaches to best meet our customers' future energy needs and effectively transition our generation to a cleaner, more diverse portfolio in a responsible fashion. We'll be finalizing our plan over the next 45 days and plan to file our IRP with the Missouri PSC by September 30. We are excited about the benefits that our current wind generation projects will deliver to all stakeholders as well as the prospects for additional renewable generation resources to meet our customers' energy needs in the future. Moving to Page 9. Clicking ahead through the end of this decade, we have a robust pipeline of investment opportunities, or over $36 billion that will deliver significant value to all of our stakeholders by making our energy grid stronger, smarter and cleaner. These investment opportunities exclude any potential new renewable generation for the Missouri integrated resource plan as well as any potential new multi-value transmission projects that will increase the reliability and resiliency of the energy grid as well as enable additional renewable generation projects. 
Of course, our investment opportunities will not only create a stronger and cleaner energy grid to meet our customers' needs and exceed their expectations. But they will also create thousands of jobs for local economies. Maintaining constructive energy policies that support robust investment in energy infrastructure will be critical to meeting our country's future energy needs and delivering on our customers' expectations. 
Moving to Page 10. To sum up our value proposition, the consistent execution of our strategy over many years and on many fronts has positioned us well for future success. We remain firmly convinced that the execution of this strategy in 2020 and beyond will deliver superior value to our customers, shareholders and the environment. 
In May, we affirmed our 5-year growth plan, which included our expectation of 6% to 8% compound annual earnings per share growth for the 2020 through 2024 period using the 2020 EPS guidance range midpoint as the base. This earnings growth is primarily driven by our approximate 9% compound annual rate base growth in 2019 through 2024 and compares very favorably with our regulated utility peers. I am confident in our ability to execute our investment plans and strategies across all 4 of our business segments, as we have an experienced and dedicated team to get it done. 
Further, our shares continue to offer investors a solid dividend. Our strong earnings growth expectations position us well for future dividend growth. Of course, future dividend decisions will be driven by earnings growth, in addition to cash flows and other business conditions. Together, we believe our strong earnings growth outlook, combined with our solid dividend, results in a very attractive total return opportunity for shareholders. 
Again, thank you all for joining us today. And I'll now turn the call over to Michael. Michael?"

The key factors by segment tha",1093,"Thanks, Warner, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 12 of our presentation. Yesterday, we reported second quarter 2020 earnings of $0.98 per share compared to earnings of $0.72 per share for the year ago quarter. The key factors by segment that drove the overall $0.26 per share increase are highlighted on this page. 
Ameren Missouri, our largest segment, reported increased earnings of $0.18 per share. The increase in earnings was driven by lower operations and maintenance expenses, including the absence of a scheduled Callaway Energy Center refueling and maintenance outage as well as disciplined cost management and favorable market -- favorable market returns on company-owned life insurance investments, which together increased earnings by $0.15 per share. The year-over-year improvement also reflected new electric service rates effective April 1, driven in part by increased infrastructure investments. 
The year-over-year impact from electric sales was flat as the $0.05 per share benefit from near-normal temperatures in the second quarter compared to milder than normal temperatures in the previous year were offset by a $0.05 per share reduction from lower weather normalized sales, primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19. 
Moving now to Ameren Transmission. Earnings per share were up $0.07. This increase reflected the impact of the FERC order on the MISO base allowed return on equity, which increased earnings $0.04 per share as well as increased infrastructure investments. 
Earnings for Ameren Illinois Natural Gas were up $0.03 per share due to increased infrastructure investments and lower operations and maintenance expenses. Ameren Illinois electric distribution earnings were down $0.01 per share, reflecting a lower expected allowed return on equity under performance-based REIT making, partially offset by increased infrastructure investments. 
And finally, Ameren Parent and other results also decreased $0.01 per share, primarily due to increased interest expense resulting from the long-term debt issuance in early April. Moving now to Page 13 of our presentation. I'd like to briefly touch on key drivers impacting our 2020 earnings guidance. As Warner stated, we continue to expect 2020 diluted earnings to be in the range of $3.40 to $3.60 per share. This guidance range assumes normal weather in the remaining 6 months of the year as well as reflect sales updates from our first quarter earnings call in May, primarily related to COVID-19. 
On our call in May, we estimated COVID-19-related sales impacts in Ameren Missouri would reduce our 2020 earnings per share expectations by approximately $0.10 per share, and we believe this continues to be a solid estimate. 
For the year, we still expect total weather-normalized sales to be on approximately 2.5%. Broken down by customer class, we expect 2020 commercial sales to decline approximately 7.5%. Industrial sales declined approximately 4.5% and residential sales to increase approximately 4%. 
While we've seen a slight change in the relative mix of sales, overall, our update today is largely consistent with our expectations outlined in our call in May in terms of both total sales and EPS impacts for 2020 due to COVID 19. Before moving on, I would note that Ameren Missouri customer sales for June, excluding the impact of warmer than normal weather, we're down approximately 0.2% compared to the prior year, reflecting the impact of COVID-19. Broken down by customer class and compared to the prior year, Ameren Missouri June weather-normalized commercial and industrial sales declined approximately 9.5% and 3%, respectively, which were largely offset by an increased weather-normalized sales to residential customers of approximately 11%. These statistics are notable, given they represent the first full month of sales after the state homeowners were lifted. 
Before moving on, let me briefly cover electric sales trends for Ameren Illinois electric distribution for the first 6 months of this year compared to the first 6 months of last year. Weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales to Illinois residential customers increased about 4%, and weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales to Illinois commercial and industrial customers decreased approximately 7% and 8%, respectively. 
Recall that changes in electric sales in Illinois, no matter the cause, do not affect earnings since we have full revenue decoupling. Moving on to other guidance considerations. Select earnings considerations by quarter for the balance of the year are listed on this page. 
Our 2020 earnings guidance range also incorporates an estimated 2020 allowed ROE for Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution of 7.2%, which reflects a 30-year treasury yield of approximately 1.4%. 
Finally, we also remain very focused on maintaining disciplined cost management for the remainder of the year. Moving now to Page 14 for other regulatory matters. 
In April, we made our required annual electric distribution rate update filing. Under Illinois performance-based rate-making, our utilities are required to file annual updates to systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost of service and to true-up any prior period over- or under-recoveries of such costs. 
In late June, the ICC staff recommended a $53 million base rate decrease compared to our request of a $45 million base rate decrease. Decision is expected in December with new rates expected to be effective in January 2021. 
Earlier this year, we also filed with the ICC for an annual increase in Ameren Illinois Natural Gas distribution rates using a 2021 future test year and have since updated our request in our July rebuttal testimony. In June, the ICC staff and other interveners, including the Citizens Utility Board and the Illinois Industrial Energy Consumers filed a rebuttal testimony in the rate review. Our original request as well as our July rebuttal testimony, incorporated a 10.5% return on equity, while staff and other interveners have recommended a 9.32% and 9.2% return on equity, respectively. We continue to seek a 54% equity ratio compared to the ICC staff's and other interveners' recommendation of 50.43% and 50%, respectively. A decision is expected by January 2021 with new rates expected to be effective in February of 2021. Finally, turning to Page 15, I will summarize. We have a strong team and are well positioned to continue executing our plan. We continue to expect to deliver strong earnings growth in 2020, and we're successfully executing our strategy and navigate the impacts of COVID-19. 
As we look to the longer term, we continue to expect strong earnings per share growth driven by robust rate base growth and disciplined cost management. Further, we believe this growth compares very favorably to the growth of our utility peers. And Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. 
In total, we have an attractive total shareholder return story that converges very favorably to our peers. And now I'll turn it back over to Warner."

All we has spent a great deal of time this morning talking about how we are effectively addressing issues associated with COVID-19 and delivering strong results for our customers and shareholders. I think it's important to note that another matter is at the top of our minds. That matter is the level of profound racial prejudice, injustice and intolerance that we still have in this country and in our own community, especially against black people. 
We have recently seen too many senseless deaths of African Americans. And to be clear, there is absolutely no place for racism, injustice or hatred of any kind at Ameren, in our community, in our country, or anywhere in the world. We must challenge such behavior when we witness it and take steps to drive positive changes to eliminate it, and that is exactly what we're doing at Ameren. At Ameren, diversity, equity and inclusion is a core value. While we have been recognized by Diversity, Inc. as one of the top utilities in the country for our diversity, equity and inclusion practices, we are not standing still. 
In fact, we recently conducted a virtual Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Summit in St. Louis. The theme of the summit was, the courage to live your values. Ameren leaders, community leaders and national leaders came together to begin listening to each other more thoughtfully and to begin taking even more steps to address this critical issue. We have made the entire program available on our website. I encourage you to take time and listen to the amazing stories of courage and passion for diversity, equity and inclusion. 
We're now ready to take your questions."

We certainly look at the technology, which is out there, and we've certainly seen renewable energy technology and their related costs continue to come down, take a careful look at our coal-fired and energy centers and the useful lives of those plants, and we really think about what's really going to deliver value to our customers in the state of Missouri.

The team is working hard on manning costs down where we can, being very careful about headcount. Obviously, where we have opportunities on -- because of reduced load, there's reduced maintenance cost, obviously, from a travel, entertainment perspective, being very thoughtful there. And so I think the team's done a nice job, continue to help offset some of these things going in 2020. In terms of sort of what we retain and what is recurring. I mean Warner can certainly touch on 2021. But at the moment, we're just going to continue to watch this closely. It's helping us offset some of these sales headwinds that we have. And it's across the board, too. I know we focus a lot on the Missouri side because that's where it hits the bottom line, but it is across Ameren Illinois Distribution, Ameren Illinois Natural Gas as well."

Well, the different perspective in terms of the consultants that we have to bring in to work with this and how they can work remotely. I mean our digital investments have really been a step-change not just for our current workforce but how we engage and work with others. 
You think about real estate too, and facilities costs, we've had to explore because of our digital team and the investments that we're making, we're exploring other facilities to delease in the future because we're simply growing what we currently have. We see opportunities there. That's just not going to be necessary prospectively because reality is we can work very effectively remotely. And so that, coupled with some really, I said in my talking points how the team has really done some innovative things and been agile out in the field in terms of our work practices. Not only are they safer than they are, I mean they're going to give us the ability to work more effectively and productively. And that coupled with that digital investments, I think these are the types of things that we are already and put in our playbook, not just for this year, but for many years ahead. So stay tuned.

So a couple of things to thi",458,"Sure. Let me try and take that in several pieces. And Richard, Mark and his team have continue to work very hard to have conversations virtually, of course, with the key stakeholders and not just legislators of stakeholders. 
So a couple of things to think about there. In terms of energy policy, I think energy policy broadly in the State of Illinois is still at the top of a lot of folks' minds, and rightfully so, because energy policy is so important. That's why, as we said, as part of our talking points as well as what you've heard us say before, that's why we support so strongly the Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act because it really addresses many of the key issues that the State of Illinois is focused on. More renewable energy resources, more investments in electrification as well as grid modernization. These are things that have been really important for the State of Illinois and will continue to be. 
And so we continue to have conversations with key stakeholders around that particular piece of legislation that we still support. Having said that, as you know, there's been a lot of dialogue and some concerns raised as a result of the Commonwealth Edison federal investigation, so we understand that. 
And so consequently, as we think ahead, what we're going to do is continue to double down on our efforts to work with stakeholders collaboratively, listen to the concerns, but make sure that we point out the value of the current regulatory framework and our proposal. And at the end of the day, our focus is going to continue to be to try and find a solution that gives us the ability, collectively in the State of Illinois to invest in critical infrastructure and give us the ability to earn a fair return and deliver values to our customers in the State of Illinois. 
Now in terms of timing, and I've learned a long time ago that I don't predict when things will be addressed by any legislature or when things will ultimately get done. And obviously, things are a little bit more complicated as we approach this upcoming veto session. In light of a lot of the activities, my best perspective, and Rich and I have talked a lot about this, whether something gets done in the veto session around the Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act, I would tell you, it's, from my perspective, a challenge was, I like to use sports analogies, I call it a long put, right, to get done in the veto session. 
So that's our best perspective on it in terms of what we think may still happen this year. Importantly, where we're going to continue to focus our efforts on."

Yes, clearly, we've seen the governor and other groups come out and say they oppose the existing framework that's out there. And look, the thing that we think is important, recognizing a lot of that may be. And so I'm speculating a bit, just simply surrounding the issues with Commonwealth Edison and the investigations and how it was linked to when performance-based rate-making was put in place many years ago. Our job, and Rich and his team, they do a terrific job at this, we're just going to sit down and just make sure we meet with stakeholders in a collaborative way, and just sit there and explain what this framework has really done. And that's really what we should do, it's been some open and transparent framework that essentially every year, the Illinois Commerce Commission takes a look at what we're doing. 
And you've heard me say and espouse the benefits of this, this particular framework. And the real winner has been the State of Illinois and our customers. It's been an overwhelming success in so many ways. And so it's just important that we make sure we level set everybody. At the same time, now we're going to be at the table, listening to their concerns. And if they have legitimate concerns, we'll see what ways we can try to bridge whatever gaps there may be. And so that's just how we will continue to do business. 
And as I said a moment ago, really, the key from our perspective is sitting at the table and really to put in place constructive energy policies. They're going to support investment in infrastructure, energy infrastructure in particular, gives us the ability to earn a fair return on those investments, but also to deliver significant value our customers in the State of Illinois and create thousands of jobs. 
So we think there's opportunities to and there will be opportunities to sit down and talk with these stakeholders and make sure we have a good understanding of what's been done and what we think can be done prospectively. And so there is a lot of noise. 
Look, we recognize that creates challenges, I get it. But at the same time, just because there's noise doesn't mean that we're not going to sit down and have a collaborative approach with these key stakeholders."

The a summary of the key drivers is provided on this page, which Mike will discuss in more detail in a moment. I am pleased to report that we remain on track to deliver solid earnings growth in 2020 over 2019. Yesterday, we also announced that we narrowed our 2020 earnings guidance range [ of ] $3.40 per share to $3.55 per share. That compares to our initial guidance range of $3.40 per share to $3.60 per share. 
Moving to Page 5. Here, we reiterate our strategic plan, which we've been executing very well throughout the year. We expect our plan will continue delivering significant value for our customers and strong long-term earnings growth for our shareholders. The first pillar of our strategy stresses investing in and operating our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. This has driven our multiyear focus on investing in energy infrastructure for the long-term benefit of customers in all 4 of our jurisdictions. 
As I've said many times in the past, our customers are at the center of our strategy. Our customers have been clear. They want safe, reliable and cleaner energy, all at an affordable price. Our goal is to meet our customers' energy needs and exceed their expectations. 
As you can see on the right side of this page, during the first 9 months of this year, we invested significant capital in each of our business segments to achieve [indiscernible] for our customers, and we are delivering results. 
Our energy grid is becoming more reliable, resilient and secure. We are implementing and enabling cleaner energy through our renewable energy and transmission investments. And our customers' electric rates remain among the lowest in the country at approximately 20% below additional average. Of course, we're not done. We will continue to make critical investments across our businesses to modernize the energy grid. 
In addition, we will continue to transition our generation portfolio to a cleaner, more diverse portfolio and a responsible fad. That transition will include significant investments in renewable energy, which I will cover in more detail in a moment, and we will continue to invest in innovative technologies, including digital technologies to meet and exceed our customers' rising expectations. 
Consistent with Ameren Missouri Smart Energy plan, we are putting meaningful dollars to work to modernize the energy grid and to serve our customers better. 
I am pleased to report that in July, Ameren Missouri began installing the first of 1.2 million electric smart meters for customers. The installation of these smart meters over the next several years will enhance reliability and provide more visibility and choices for our customers to control their energy usage. 
Our Ameren Illinois electric and gas distribution customers are already seeing these benefits as we completed the installation of over 1.2 million electric [indiscernible] meters and over 830,000 gas modules in 2019. We have also been working hard in the regulatory arena to earn fair returns on our investments. As we discussed on our first and second quarter earnings calls, new electric rates went into effect on April 1 this year as a result of a constructive settlement in Ameren Missouri's electric rate review. 
In addition, as Michael will cover in more detail later, we will continue to progress through our electric and natural gas regulatory proceedings in Illinois. We expect a final decision in the elective proceeding by December of this year and a final division in the gas proceeding by January of next year. From an operational perspective, the Callaway energy center began its scheduled refueling and maintenance outage in early October. The outage is progressing safely and on schedule. Finally, another important element of the first pillar of our strategy has been and remains our relentless focus on continuous improvement and disciplined cost management to keep rates affordable. 
Moving to Page 6 and the second pillar of our strategy, which includes enhancing regulatory frameworks for the benefit of all stakeholders. In Illinois, we continue to support the proposed Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act. This important legislation would allow Ameren Illinois to make significant investments in solar energy and battery storage to improve reliability as well as to make investments in transportation electrification in order to benefit customers in the economy across central and Southern Illinois. In addition, it would help address energy policy challenge facing the state including the need for additional renewable sources and better electric vehicle charging infrastructure. 
This bill will help address these challenges, move the state of Illinois closer to reaching this goal of 100% clean energy by 2050. This legislation also continued to support important investments in the energy grid to meet our customers' expectations for more reliable and resilient energy grid. 
In addition, this legislation would modify the allowed return on equity formula and then also extend the electric performance-based rate making framework through 2032. We have been actively participating in energy policy discussions including the governors and senate working group meetings. 
As noted on this slide, a veto session is currently scheduled for certain days in November and December. Consistent with the views that we addressed during our second quarter call, we do not expect comprehensive energy legislation to be addressed during the veto session in 2020. Looking ahead, we will continue to engage with key stakeholders in an open and transparent fashion to better understand their views and advocate constructive energy policies that support investment in critical infrastructure. Moving to Ameren Missouri regulatory matters. On October 16, we have filed requests with the Missouri Public Service Commission to track and defer in a regulatory asset certain COVID-19 related costs incurred [indiscernible] any COVID-19 realized cost savings. Through September 30, 2020, we have accumulated approximately $9 million of net costs, and we've requested additional true-ups next year. 
If our requests are approved by the Missouri PSC, the recovery and timing of recovery of these costs will be determined as part of the next electric and gas rate reviews. The PSC is under no deadline to issue orders, and we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this manner. 
Speaking of future rate reviews. And as we discussed during our second quarter conference call, we continue to expect to file next Ameren Missouri electric rate review in the first half of 2021. The in addition, we also expect to file an Ameren Missouri Natural Gas rate review during the first half of 2021 as well. 
Turning now to Page 7 in Missouri's integrated resource plan. In late September, we announced a transformative preferred plan that will accelerate our transition to a cleaner and more diverse generation portfolio while carefully balancing 2 important needs for our customers, reliability and affordability. Our plan is clearly transformational as it significantly accelerates our carbon emission reduction goals from those that we established in 2017. 
In particular, the plan targets a 50% reduction in carbon emissions below [ 2005 ] levels by 2030 and an 85% reduction by 2040. 
And by 2015, our goal is to achieve net 0 carbon emissions across all of Ameren. 
We plan to achieve these goals by making significant investments in renewable generation. Under our preferred plan, we would add 3,100 megawatts of wind and solar to our portfolio, representing approximately $4.5 billion of investment by 2030. 
By 2040, in total, 5,400 megawatts of wind and solar would be added for a total investment of approximately $8 billion. These renewable generation additions include our wind generation investment of $1.2 billion for 700 megawatts that we expect will be substantially complete this year. The plan also advances the retirement of 2 of our coal-fired energy centers with all of our coal-fired energy centers retired by 2042. 
It is important to note that our plan does not include the addition of any combined cycle natural gas plants. Further, we expect to seek an extension of the operating license of our carbon-free Callaway nuclear energy center beyond the current expiration date of 2044. And we will continue to implement robust energy efficiency and demand response programs. Importantly, our plan represents a responsible transition of our portfolio that takes into consideration environmental stewardship, system reliability and customer affordability. 
Our plan leverages the very low-cost generation that our customers enjoy today and used it as a bridge to enable us to add greater levels of intermittent resources in the future while ensuring system reliability. Our plan also intends to leverage important research and development investments by the public and private sectors and incorporate advances in clean energy technologies over time to achieve our net 0 carbon emissions goal. 
We are very excited about this transformational plan and are already taking steps to implement it. In September, we issued a request for proposal that will enable us to assess and take the appropriate next steps on solar and wind projects that will deliver the best value to our customers, consistent with our IRP. Responses to our requests have been robust, and we are in the process of assessing those proposals as we speak. 
We will provide an update on our assessment as well as our 5-year capital plan for 2021 to 2025 during our year-end conference call in February. Consistent with our approach in the past, we will consider a variety of factors before we include such major projects into our plan. 
Having said that, one thing is clear. Our IRP includes significant incremental investment opportunities, including approximately $3 billion by 2030. 
As I said before, we are very excited about our transformational plan as well as how Ameren and our industry are leading the country and the world and executing responsible and achievable plans to significantly reduce carbon emissions and in so doing, creating a cleaner and sustainable energy future. 
Speaking of creating a cleaner and sustainable energy future, let's move now to Page 8 for an update on our $1.2 billion wind generation investment plan to achieve compliance with Missouri's renewable energy standard through the acquisition of 700 megawatts of new wind generation at 2 sites in Missouri. 
Good progress continues to be made at both facilities. All of the construction and related installation of key components for the 400-megawatt facility have been completed and testing of the units will be completed over the next several weeks. As a result, we expect the 400-megawatt facility to be in service by the end of 2020. 
For the 300-megawatt facility, we are working closely with the developer to monitor the shipment and installation of remaining facility components. As we discussed on prior earnings calls this year, we have experienced some delays in the project due to several factors, including those related to challenges in the global supply chain due to COVID-19 as well as in the transportation of certain components. 
As a result, we expect a portion of the project of approximately $200 million of investment to be placed in service in the first quarter of 2021. We do not expect this to have a significant economic consequences or reduce the production tax credits for this project because of the recent rule changes made by the U.S. Department of the treasury, extending in service criteria by 1 year to December 31, 2021. 
Moving to Page 9. Looking ahead through the end of this decade, we have a robust pipeline of investment opportunities of over $39 billion that will deliver significant value to all of our stakeholders by making our energy goods stronger, smarter and cleaner. 
This robust pipeline now includes the new renewable generation proposed and the preferred plan of the Missouri Integrated Resource Plan, which added approximately $3 billion of incremental investment opportunities in 2020 to 2029. 
Importantly, these investment opportunities exclude any new regionally beneficial transmission projects that would increase the reliability, resiliency of the energy grid as well as enable additional renewable generation projects. 
Of course, our investment opportunities not only create a stronger and cleaner energy grid to meet our customers' needs and exceed their expectations but they will also create thousands of jobs for local economies. 
Maintaining constructive energy policies to support robust investment in energy infrastructure will be critical to meeting our customers' future engineers. And delivering on our customers' expectations. 
Moving to Page 10. A few moments ago, I mentioned that we are focused on delivering a sustainable energy future for our customers, communities and our country. Consistent with that focus, we recently published a stakeholder presentation called leading the way to a sustainable energy future, which is Ameren's vision statement. 
This presentation demonstrates how we have been effectively integrating our focus on environmental, social, governance and sustainability matters into our corporate strategy. This slide summarizes our sustainability value proposition for environmental, social and governance matters. We have a strong environmental focus, which is, in part, demonstrated by the Missouri Integrated Resource plan I discussed earlier. 
Importantly, the preferred plan discussed earlier is consistent with the objectives of the Paris agreement in limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Emissions from our coal-fired energy centers are well below state and federal limits and our natural gas pipeline system has no cast or rod iron pipes. 
We also have a strong long-term commitment to our customers and communities to be socially responsible and economically impactful. There has never been a more important time than now to be a leader in this area. 
In terms of COVID-19 relief, we have been tirelessly working to help our customers in need, including implementing disconnection moratoriums, providing special bill payment plans and providing over $15 million of critical funds for energy assistance and other basic themes. And we have set up and spoken out against racial injustice and discrimination and have taken actions to enable our company and community to further embrace diversity, equity and inclusion. 
And we were honored to again be recognized by Diversity, Inc. as one of the top utilities in the country for diversity, equity and inclusion. Finally, our strong corporate governance is led by a diverse Board of Directors focused on strong oversight that's aligned with ESG matters. And our executive compensation practices include performance metrics that are tied to sustainable long-term performance and progress towards a cleaner, sustainable energy future. 
I encourage you to take some time to read more about our sustainability value proposition. You can find this presentation at amereninvestors.com. Moving to Page 11. To sum up our value proposition the consistent execution of our strategy over many years and on many fronts has positioned us well for future success. We remain firmly convinced that the execution of this strategy in 2020 and beyond will deliver superior value to our customers, shareholders and the environment. 
In May, we affirmed our 5-year growth plan, which included our expectation of 6% to 8% compound annual earnings per share growth for the 2020 through 2024 period. This earnings growth is primarily driven by our approximate 9% compound annual rate base growth from 2019 to 2024 and compares very favorably with our regulated utility peers. 
I am confident in our ability to execute our investment plans and strategies across all 4 of our business segments and has been experienced and dedicated team to get it done. 
In addition, we will continue to advocate for constructive regulatory frameworks and energy policies to support these important investments for future. Further, our shares continue to offer investors a solid dividend. 
Last month, Ameren's Board of Directors expressed its confidence in our long-term growth plan by increasing the dividend by 4%, seventh consecutive year with a dividend increase. 
Given the midpoint of our 2020 earnings guidance range that I discussed earlier, our dividend payout ratio is approximately 59%, which is towards the lower end of our company's targeted dividend payout ratio range of 55% to 70%. 
This factor, combined with our strong earnings growth expectations [ positions ] us well for future dividend growth. Of course, future dividend decisions will be driven by earnings growth, in addition to cash flows and other business conditions. 
Together, we believe our strong earnings growth outlook, combined with our solid dividend results in an attractive total return opportunity for shareholders. Again, thank you all for joining us today. And I'll now turn the call over to Michael."
373264,691159079,2130957,"Ameren Corporation, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2020",2020-11-05,"Earnings Calls","Ameren Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Warner, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 13 of our presentation. Yesterday, we reported third quarter 2020 earnings of $1.47 per share compared to earnings of $1.47 per share for the year ago quarter. The key factors by segment that",1445,"Thanks, Warner, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 13 of our presentation. Yesterday, we reported third quarter 2020 earnings of $1.47 per share compared to earnings of $1.47 per share for the year ago quarter. The key factors by segment that drove the year-over-year results are highlighted on this page. 
Ameren transmission in Ameren Illinois Natural Gas earnings were up $0.03 and $0.02 per share, respectively, reflecting increased infrastructure investments. Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution earnings increased $0.01 per share, reflecting increased infrastructure and energy efficiency investments, partially offset by a lower expected allowed return equity under performance-based rate making. And Missouri, our largest segment, reported earnings that declined $0.02 per share compared to the prior year. The comparison was primarily driven by a lower electric sales of $0.08 per share due to both milder-than-normal temperatures in the third quarter compared to warmer-than-normal temperatures in the previous year as well as lower weather normalized sales, primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19. 
[Audio Gap] as Warner stated, we narrowed our 2020 earnings guidance to a range of $3.40 to $3.55 per share from $3.40 to $3.60 per share. This guidance range assumes normal weather in the remaining 3 months of the year as well as reflect sales updates since our second quarter earnings call in August, primarily related to COVID-19. 
For the year, we expect total weather-normalized sales and inventory to be down approximately 2%. Broken down by customer class, we now expect 2020 commercial sales decline approximately 6.5%, industrial sales to decline approximately 3%, and residential sales to increase approximately 3.5%. Overall, our update today is largely consistent with our expectations outlined on our call in May in terms of both total sales and EPS impacts for 2020 due to COVID-19. Before moving on, let me briefly cover electric sales trend, Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution for the first 9 months of this year compared to the first 9 months of last year. 
Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois residential customers increased a little over 2.5%, and weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois commercial and industrial customers decreased 6.5% and nearly 8%, respectively. 
Recall that changes in electric sales in Illinois no matter the cause do not affect our earnings since we have full revenue decoupling. 
Moving on to other guidance considerations. Select earnings considerations for the balance of the year are listed on this page. As Warner mentioned earlier, we remain very focused on maintaining disciplined cost management for the remainder of the year. 
Our focus in this area has enabled us to effectively address the headwinds we have faced from COVID-19 to date. Moving now to Page 15 for an update Ameren Illinois regulatory matters. In April, we made our required annual electric distribution rate update filing. 
Under Illinois performance-based ratemaking, we are required to file annual rate updates to systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost of service and to true-up any prior period over and under-recovery of such cost. 
In late September, the ICC staff recommended a $49 million base rate decrease compared to our -- compared to our request of a $45 million base rate decrease. A decision is expected by December, with new rates expected to be effective in January 2021. 
Earlier this year, we also filed with the ICC for an annual increase in Ameren Illinois Natural Gas distribution rates using a 2021 future test year and has since updated our requests to in September [indiscernible] testimony. 
We're requesting a rate increase of $97 million, while the ICC staff has recommend an increase of $69 million. A decision is expected by January 2021 with new rates expected to be effective in February 2021. 
Turning now to Page 16 for an update on financing activities. I'd like to highlight an important milestone recently reached for our wind generation investments. 
On October 9, Ameren Missouri issued $550 million or 2.625% green first mortgage bonds due in 2051. This  issuance marked the first green bond offering for the company is the lowest coupon in Ameren Missouri or any Ameren Missouri has secured on 30-year debt. At the time of issuance, it was also the fifth lowest 30-year coupon ever in the power and utility industry. Proceeds from the issuance will be used to fund a portion of the 700-megawatt wind generation investment. 
We also expect to settle a portion of the equity forward sale agreement before the end of this year with proceeds also used to fund a portion of the wind generation investment. We expect to settle the remainder of the equity forward sale agreement when the 300-megawatt wind project is completed in the first quarter of 2021. 
Finally, on October 15, Ameren Corporation redeemed $350 million of 2.7% senior unsecured debt at par that was mature on November 15. A portion of the proceeds from the $800 million issuance by Ameren Corporation in early April was used to fund the repayment. 
Before moving on, I'd also like to mention that we expect Ameren Illinois to issue long-term debt this year to repay short-term debt. Moving now to Page 17. We plan to provide 2021 earnings guidance when we release fourth quarter results in February next year. 
Using our 2020 year-to-date results and guidance as a reference point, we have listed on this page select items to consider as you think about the earnings outlook for next year. Beginning with Missouri, as previously noted, the 700 megawatts of wind generation are expected to be substantially in service by the end of 2020 with a portion of the 300-megawatt facility expected to be in service in the first quarter of 2021. 
As a result, we expect to see contributions to earnings from these investments beginning in 2021. The 2021 earnings comparison is also expected to be favorably impacted in the first quarter next year by the increase in Missouri electric service rates that took effect April 1, 2020. 
We also expect higher weather-normalized electric sales in 2021 compared to 2020 reflecting the continual improvement in economic activities since the COVID-19 lockdowns in the second quarter of this year. 
Further, we expect to return to normal weather in 2021 will increase Ameren Missouri earnings by approximately $0.04 compared to 2020 results through the third quarter, assuming normal weather in the last quarter of this year. As a result of the Missouri PSC approval of our requested change in the way we account for Callaway scheduled refueling and maintenance expenses, we expect the amortization expenses associated with the fall 2020 outage to be approximately $0.07 per share higher in 2021 than the amortization expense expected to be realized in 2020. The fall 2020 outage is expected to cost approximately $0.11 per share and will be amortized over approximately 18 months starting in December of this year. 
Moving on. Earnings from our FERC-regulated electric transmission activities are expected to benefit from additional investments in Ameren Illinois and [ ATXI ] projects made under forward-looking formula rate making. 
For Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution, earnings are expected to benefit in 2021 compared to 2020 from additional infrastructure investments made under the Illinois performance-based rate making. The allowed ROE under the form will be the average of the 2021 30-year treasury yield plus 5.8%, which applied to year-end rate base. For Ameren Illinois Natural Gas, earnings are expected to benefit from higher delivery service rates based on a 2021 future test year and from infrastructure investments qualifying for rider treatment. Finally, the issuance of common shares under the forward sale agreement to fund a portion of our wind generation investments and under our dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans as well as additional equity of approximately $150 million in 2021 are expected to unfavorably impact earnings per share. Of course, in 2021, we will seek to manage all of our businesses to earn as close to our ROE returns as possible while being mindful of operating in other business teams. 
Finally, turning to Page 18. I will summarize. We have a strong team in a well-positioned to continue executing our plan. We continue to expect to deliver solid earnings growth in 2020 as we successfully execute our strategy and navigate the impacts of COVID-19. 
As we look to the longer term, we continue to expect strong earnings per share growth driven by robust rate base growth and disciplined cost management. Further, we believe the growth compares very favorably with the growth of our utility peers. And Ameren shares continued to offer investors a solid dividend. In total, we have attractive total shareholder return story that compares very favorably to our peers. 
This concludes my prepared remarks. With that, now we'll invite your questions."

And we are obviously modeling a recovery to continue into 2021, and we're looking hard within each of those sectors. And obviously, you've seen the strong piece on the residential side.

But we clearly do continue to see the recovery continuing, now all of that is premised on the fact that we wouldn't go back in any shelter-in-place orders. 
And for the most part, where we're impacted by earnings here in Missouri, we're pretty well opened up. I mean you do have certain sectors operating at some limited capacity, restaurants, [indiscernible] retail, those kind of things. And so we're assuming that some of that continues to come back.

So that's clearly a driver. Always an opportunity to true-up costs and sales. Those will obviously be drivers as well. 
But to say there'll be any significant variations at this point in time, that would be premature. Marty and his team are diligently putting together that rate review, as we said, we'll put together in the first half of next year.

That's not keeping -- not lose focus on the fact that we're making significant investments in Missouri. So those would be some key drivers to be looking towards, and we'll be able to give you a better update when we file that plan sometime in the first half of next year."

And so that's already out there. So we not only filed the IRP, but we're taking steps to execute elements of that plan. And, of course, an RFP and our ability to assess those projects from that RFP will be important consideration that we'll look at. And of course, there are regulatory factors. It's always -- we want to be thoughtful in terms of when we do these things, looking at the nature of the projects, the regulatory approvals that will be required. All those things go into to our determination and when we actually put it in there.

And I can't ultimately predict that. But the point is that we try to execute our strategy and position ourselves for a solid dividend growth and perhaps even greater dividend growth in the future.

And obviously, we're very focused on things that are new in the southern part of the state. So because of that, I do expect energy legislation to be a topic of discussion in the next session.

All I can say is that Richard, Mark and his team are are advocating for the Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act for all the right reasons because we believe it will deliver significant value for our customers, certainly for the state of Illinois.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before I jump into our discussion of third quarter results and other key business manners, I will start with a few comments on COVID-19.
To begin, I hope you, your families and colleagues are safe and healthy during this challenging time. While COVID-19 has driven a great deal of change, I can assure you that one thing that remains constant in Ameren is our strong commitment to the safety of our coworkers, customers and communities. So too is our strong focus on delivering safe, reliable, cleaner and affordable electric and natural gas service during this unprecedented time. We recognize that millions of customers in Missouri and Illinois are depending on us. I can't express enough appreciation to my coworkers who've shown great agility, innovation, determination and a keen focus on safety while delivering on our mission to power the quality of life.
We continue to carefully monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our electric sales, liquidity and supply chain. To date, these impacts have been manageable and are largely in line with our expectations. In addition, our team continues to successfully execute our strategy across the entire business.
Looking ahead, we remain focused on executing our strategy, including employing our strong safety practices as well as continue to exercise financial discipline to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19. At the same time, we will look to capitalize on key opportunities that we have identified during the last several months, including benefits we are realizing from our digital investments and other efficiencies in our operations.
Turning now to Page 4 for an update on third quarter results and 2020 earnings guidance. Yesterday, we announced third quarter 2020 earnings of $1.47 per share compared to $1.47 per share earned in 2019. A summary of the key drivers is provided on this page, which Mike will discuss in more detail in a moment.
I am pleased to report that we remain on track to deliver solid earnings growth in 2020 over 2019. Yesterday, we also announced that we narrowed our 2020 earnings guidance range to $3.40 per share to $3.55 per share. That compares to our initial guidance range of $3.40 per share to $3.60 per share.
Moving to Page 5. Here, we reiterate our strategic plan, which we've been executing very well throughout the year. We expect our plan will continue delivering significant value for our customers and strong long-term earnings growth for our shareholders. The first pillar of our strategy stresses investing in and operating our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. This has driven our multiyear focus on investing in energy infrastructure for the long-term benefit of customers in all 4 of our jurisdictions.
As I've said many times in the past, our customers are epicenter of our strategy. Our customers have been clear. They want safe, reliable and cleaner energy, all at an affordable price.
Our goal is to meet our customers' energy needs and exceed their expectations. As you can see on the right side of this page, during the first 9 months of this year, we invested significant capital in each of our business segments to achieve our goal for our customers, and we are delivering results. Our energy grid is becoming more reliable, resilient and secure. We are implementing and enabling clean energy through our renewable energy and transmission investments. And our customers' electric rates remain among the lowest in the country at approximately 20% below the national average.
Of course, we're not done. We will continue to make critical investments across our businesses to modernize the energy grid. In addition, we will continue to transition our generation portfolio to a cleaner and more diverse portfolio in a responsible fashion. That transition will include significant investments in renewable energy, which I will cover in more detail in a moment.
And we will continue to invest in innovative technologies, including digital technologies to meet and exceed our customers' rising expectations. Consistent with the Ameren Missouri Smart Energy Plan, we are putting meaningful dollars to work, to modernize the energy grid and to serve our customers better.
I am pleased to report that in July, Ameren Missouri began selling the first of 1.2 million electric smart meters for customers. The installation of these smart meters over the next several years will enhance reliability and provide more visibility and choices for our customers to control their energy usage.
Our Ameren Illinois electric and gas distribution customers are already seeing these benefits as we completed the installation of over 1.2 million electric smart meters and over 830,000 gas modules in 2019. We have also been working hard in the regulatory arena to earn fair returns on our investments.
As we discussed in our first and second quarter earnings calls, new electric rates went into effect on April 1 of this year as a result of a constructive settlement in Ameren Missouri's electric rate review. In addition, as Michael will cover in more detail later, we will continue to progress through our electric and natural gas regulatory proceedings in Illinois. We expect a final decision in the electric proceeding by December of this year and a final decision in the gas proceeding by January of next year.
From an operational perspective, the Callaway Energy Center began its scheduled refueling and maintenance outage in early October. The outage is progressing safely and on schedule.
Finally, another important element of the first pillar of our strategy has been and remains a relentless focus on continuous improvement and disciplined cost management to keep rates affordable.
Moving to Page 6, and the second pillar of our strategy, which includes enhancing regulatory frameworks for the benefit of all stakeholders. In Illinois, we continue to support the proposed Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act. This important legislation would allow Ameren Illinois to make significant investments in solar energy and battery storage to improve reliability as well as to make investments in transportation electrification in order to benefit customers and the economy across Central and Southern Illinois.
In addition, it would help address energy policy challenges facing the state, including the need for additional renewable sources and better electric vehicle charging infrastructure. This bill will help address these challenges and move the state of Illinois closer to reaching its goal of 100% clean energy by 2050. This legislation also continues to support important investments in the energy grid to meet our customers' expectations for more reliable and resilient energy grid.
In addition, this legislation will modify the allowed return on equity formula and will also extend the electric performance-based rate-making framework through 2032. We have been actively participating in energy policy discussions  including the Governors and Senate working group meetings. As noted on this slide, a veto session is currently scheduled for certain days in November and December.
Consistent with the views that we expressed during our second quarter call, we do not expect comprehensive energy legislation to be addressed during the veto session in 2020. Looking ahead, we will continue to engage with key stakeholders in an open and transparent fashion to better understand their views and advocate constructive energy policies that support investment in critical infrastructure.
Moving to Ameren Missouri regulatory matters. On October 16, we filed requests with the Missouri Public Service Commission to track and defer in a regulatory asset showing COVID-19-related costs incurred [ net of ] any COVID-19 realized cost savings.
Through September 30, 2020, we have accumulated approximately $9 million of net costs, and we've requested additional true-ups next year. If our requests are approved by the Missouri PSC, recovery and timing of recovery of these costs will be determined as part of the next electric and gas rate reviews. The PSC is under no deadline to issue orders and we cannot predict the ultimate outcome in this manner.
Speaking of future rate reviews and as we discussed during our second quarter conference call, we continue to expect to file the next Ameren Missouri electric rate review in the first half of 2021. In addition, we also expect to file an Ameren Missouri natural gas rate review during the first half of 2021 as well.
Turning now to Page 7, and Missouri's Integrated Resource Plan. In late September, we announced a transformative preferred plan that will accelerate our transition to a cleaner and more diverse generation portfolio, while carefully balancing 2 important needs for our customers, reliability and affordability. Our plan is clearly transformational as it significantly accelerates our carbon emission reduction goals from those that we established in 2017. In particular, the plan targets a 50% reduction in carbon emissions below 2005 levels by 2030 and an 85% reduction by 2040. And by 2050, our goal is to achieve net 0 carbon emissions across all of Ameren.
We plan to achieve these goals by making significant investments in renewable generation. Under our preferred plan, we would add 3,100 megawatts of wind and solar to our portfolio representing approximately $4.5 billion of investment by 2030.
By 2040, in total, 5,400 megawatts of wind and solar would be added for a total investment of approximately $8 billion. These renewable generation additions include our wind generation investment of $1.2 billion for 700 megawatts that we expect will be substantially complete this year. The plan also advances the retirement of 2 of our coal-fired energy centers with all of our coal-fired energy centers retired by 2042. It is important to note that our plan does not include the addition of any combined cycle natural gas plants.
Further, we expect to seek an extension of the operating license of our carbon-free Callaway Nuclear Energy Center beyond the current expiration date of 2044. And we will continue to implement robust energy efficiency and demand response programs. Importantly, our plan represents a responsible transition of our portfolio that takes into consideration environmental stewardship, system reliability and customer affordability.
Our plan leverages the very low-cost generation that our customers enjoy today and uses it as a bridge to enable us to add greater levels of intermittent resources in the future while ensuring system reliability. Our plan also intends to leverage important research and development investments by the public and private sectors and incorporate advances in clean energy technologies over time to achieve our net 0 carbon emissions goal. We are very excited about this transformational plan and are already taking steps to implement it.
In September, we issued a request for proposal that will enable us to assess and take the appropriate next steps on solar and wind projects that will deliver the best value to our customers, consistent with our IRP. Responses to our requests have been robust, and we are in the process of assessing those proposals as we speak. We will provide an update on our assessment as well as our 5-year capital plan for 2021 to 2025 during our year-end conference call in February.
Consistent with our approach in the past, we will consider a variety of factors before we include such major projects into our plan. Having said that, one thing is clear, our IRP includes significant incremental investment opportunities, including approximately $3 billion by 2030.
As I said before, we are very excited about our transformational plan as well as how Ameren and our industry are leading the country and the world and executing responsible and achievable plans to significantly reduce carbon emissions and in so doing, creating a cleaner and sustainable energy future.
Speaking of creating a cleaner and sustainable energy future, let's move now to Page 8 for an update on our $1.2 billion wind generation investment plan to achieve compliance with Missouri's renewable energy standard through the acquisition of 700 megawatts of new wind generation at 2 sites in Missouri.
Good progress continues to be made at both facilities. All of the construction and related installation of key components for the 400-megawatt facility have been completed and testing of the units will be completed over the next several weeks. As a result, we expect the 400-megawatt facility to be in service by the end of 2020.
For the 300-megawatt facility, we are working closely with the developer to monitor the shipment and installation of remaining facility components. As we discussed on prior earnings calls this year, we have experienced some delays in the project due to several factors, including those related to challenges in the global supply chain due to COVID-19 as well as in the transportation of certain components.
As a result, we expect a portion of the project of approximately $200 million of investment to be placed in service in the first quarter of 2021. We do not expect this to have a significant economic consequences or reduce the production tax credits for this project because of the recent rule changes made by the U.S. Department of Treasury to extend the in-service criteria by 1 year to December 31, 2021.
Moving to Page 9. Looking ahead through the end of this decade, we have a robust pipeline of investment opportunities of over $39 billion that will deliver significant value to all of our stakeholders by making our energy goods stronger, smarter and cleaner.
This robust pipeline now includes the new renewable generation proposed and the preferred plan of the Missouri Integrated Resource Plan, which added approximately $3 billion of incremental investment opportunities in 2020 to 2029. Importantly, these investment opportunities exclude any new regionally beneficial transmission projects that would increase the reliability and resiliency of the energy grid as well as enable additional renewable generation projects.
Of course, our investment opportunities not only create a stronger and cleaner energy grid to meet our customers' needs and exceed their expectations, but they will also create thousands of jobs for local economies. Maintaining constructive energy policies to support robust investment in energy infrastructure will be critical to meeting our customers' future energy needs and delivering on our customers' expectations.
Moving to Page 10. A few moments ago, I mentioned that we are focused on delivering a sustainable energy future for our customers, communities and our country. Consistent with that focus, we recently published a stakeholder presentation called leading the way to a sustainable energy future, which is Ameren's vision statement. This presentation demonstrates how we have been effectively integrating our focus on environmental, social, governance and sustainability matters into our corporate strategy. This slide summarizes our sustainability value proposition for environmental, social and governance matters. We have a strong environmental focus, which is, in part, demonstrated by the Missouri Integrated Resource plan I discussed earlier.
Importantly, the preferred plan discussed earlier is consistent with the objectives of the Paris Agreement in limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Emissions from our coal-fired energy centers are well below state and federal limits and our natural gas pipeline system has no cast or wrought iron pipes. We also have a strong long-term commitment to our customers and communities to be socially responsible and economically impactful. There has never been a more important time than now to be a leader in this area.
In terms of COVID-19 relief, we have been tirelessly working to help our customers in need, including implementing disconnection moratoriums, providing special bill payment plans and providing over $15 million of critical funds for energy assistance and other basic things. And we have set up and spoken out against racial injustice and discrimination and have taken actions to enable our company and community to further embrace diversity, equity and inclusion.
And we were honored to again be recognized by DiversityInc as one of the top utilities in the country for diversity, equity and inclusion.
Finally, our strong corporate governance is led by a diverse Board of Directors focused on strong oversight that's aligned with ESG matters. And our executive compensation practices include performance metrics that are tied to sustainable long-term performance and progress towards a cleaner, sustainable energy future. I encourage you to take some time to read more about our sustainability value proposition. You can find this presentation at amereninvestors.com.
Moving to Page 11. To sum up our value proposition, the consistent execution of our strategy over many years and on many fronts has positioned us well for future success. We remain firmly convinced that the execution of this strategy in 2020 and beyond will deliver superior value to our customers, shareholders and the environment.
In May, we affirmed our 5-year growth plan, which included our expectation of 6% to 8% compound annual earnings per share growth for the 2020 through 2024 period. This earnings growth is primarily driven by our approximate 9% compound annual rate base growth from 2019 to 2024 and compares very favorably with our regulated utility peers. I am confident in our ability to execute our investment plans and strategies across all 4 of our business segments as we have an experienced and dedicated team to get it done.
In addition, we will continue to advocate for constructive regulatory frameworks and energy policies to support these important investments for the future. Further, our shares continue to offer investors a solid dividend. Last month, Ameren's Board of Directors expressed its confidence in our long-term growth plan by increasing the dividend by 4%, the seventh consecutive year with a dividend increase.
Given the midpoint of our 2020 earnings guidance range that I discussed earlier, our dividend payout ratio is approximately 59%, which is towards the lower end of our company's targeted dividend payout ratio range of 55% to 70%. This factor, combined with our strong earnings growth expectations, positions us well for future dividend growth. Of course, future dividend decisions will be driven by earnings growth, in addition to cash flows and other business conditions.
Together, we believe our strong earnings growth outlook, combined with our solid dividend results in an attractive total return opportunity for shareholders.
Again, thank you all for joining us today. And I'll now turn the call over to Michael."

The key factors by segment that",1574,"Thanks, Warner, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 13 of our presentation. Yesterday, we reported third quarter 2020 earnings of $1.47 per share compared to earnings of $1.47 per share for the year ago quarter. The key factors by segment that drove the year-over-year results are highlighted on this page.
Ameren Transmission and Ameren Illinois Natural Gas earnings were up $0.03 and $0.02 per share, respectively, reflecting increased infrastructure investments. Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution earnings increased $0.01 per share, reflecting increased infrastructure and energy efficiency investments, partially offset by a lower expected allowed return equity under performance-based rate making. And Missouri, our largest segment, reported earnings that declined $0.02 per share compared to the prior year. The comparison was primarily driven by a lower electric sales of $0.08 per share due to both milder-than-normal temperatures in the third quarter compared to warmer-than-normal temperatures in the previous year as well as lower weather normalized sales, primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19.
And Missouri's earnings also reflected lower MEEIA performance incentives of $0.03 per share compared to the year ago period. These unfavorable factors were partially offset by new electric service rates effective April 1, which increased earnings by $0.08 per share compared to the year ago period as well as lower operations and maintenance expenses, reflecting disciplined cost management, which increased earnings by $0.04 per share.
And finally, Ameren parent and other results decreased $0.04 per share, primarily due to the timing of income tax expense, which is not expected to impact full year earnings and increased interest expense resulting from higher long-term debt outstanding.
Moving now to Page 14 of our presentation. I'd like to briefly touch on key drivers impacting our 2020 earnings guidance. As Warner stated, we narrowed our 2020 earnings guidance to a range of $3.40 to $3.55 per share from $3.40 to $3.60 per share. This guidance range assumes normal weather in the remaining 3 months of the year as well as reflect sales updates since our second quarter earnings call in August primarily related to COVID-19.
For the year, we expect total weather-normalized sales and inventory to be down approximately 2%. Broken down by customer class, we now expect 2020 commercial sales decline approximately 6.5%, industrial sales to decline approximately 3%, and residential sales to increase approximately 3.5%. Overall, our update today is largely consistent with our expectations outlined on our call in May in terms of both total sales and EPS impacts for 2020 due to COVID-19.
Before moving on, let me briefly cover electric sales trends for Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution for the first 9 months of this year compared to the first 9 months of last year. Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois residential customers increased a little over 2.5%, and weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois commercial and industrial customers decreased 6.5% and nearly 8%, respectively. Recall that changes in electric sales in Illinois no matter the cause do not affect our earnings since we have full revenue decoupling.
Moving on to other guidance considerations. Select earnings considerations for the balance of the year are listed on this page. As Warner mentioned earlier, we remain very focused on maintaining disciplined cost management for the remainder of the year. Our focus in this area has enabled us to effectively address the headwinds we have faced from COVID-19 to date.
Moving now to Page 15 for an update on the Ameren Illinois regulatory matters. In April, we made our required annual electric distribution rate update filing. Under Illinois performance-based ratemaking, we are required to file annual rate updates to systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost of service and to true-up any prior period over and under-recovery of such cost.
In late September, the ICC staff recommended a $49 million base rate decrease compared to our rate -- compared to our request of a $45 million base rate decrease. A decision is expected by December, with new rates expected to be effective in January 2021.
Earlier this year, we also filed with the ICC for an annual increase in Ameren Illinois Natural Gas distribution rates using a 2021 future test year and has since updated our request to -- in September [indiscernible] testimony. We're requesting a rate increase of $97 million, while the ICC staff has recommend an increase of $69 million. A decision is expected by January 2021 with new rates expected to be effective in February 2021.
Turning now to Page 16 for an update on financing activities. I'd like to highlight an important milestone recently reached for our wind generation investments. On October 9, Ameren Missouri issued $550 million or 2.625% green first mortgage bonds due in 2051. This issuance marked the first green bond offering for the company is the lowest coupon in Ameren Missouri or any Ameren Missouri has secured on 30-year debt. At the time of issuance, it was also the fifth lowest 30-year coupon ever in the power and utility industry. Proceeds from the issuance will be used to fund a portion of the 700-megawatts of wind generation investment.
We also expect to settle a portion of the equity forward sale agreement before the end of this year with proceeds also used to fund a portion of the wind generation investment. We expect to settle the remainder of the equity forward sale agreement when the 300-megawatt wind project is completed in the first quarter of 2021.
Finally, on October 15, Ameren Corporation redeemed $350 million of 2.7% senior unsecured debt at par that would mature on November 15. A portion of the proceeds from the $800 million issuance by Ameren Corporation in early April was used to fund the repayment.
Before moving on, I'd also like to mention that we expect Ameren Illinois to issue long-term debt this year to repay short-term debt. 
Moving now to Page 17. We plan to provide 2021 earnings guidance when we release fourth quarter results in February next year. Using our 2020 year-to-date results and guidance as a reference point, we have listed on this page select items to consider as you think about the earnings outlook for next year. Beginning with Missouri, as previously noted, the 700 megawatts of wind generation are expected to be substantially in service by the end of 2020 with a portion of the 300-megawatt facility expected to be in service in the first quarter of 2021.
As a result, we expect to see contributions to earnings from these investments beginning in 2021. The 2021 earnings comparison is also expected to be favorably impacted in the first quarter next year by the increase in Missouri electric service rates that took effect April 1, 2020. We also expect higher weather-normalized electric sales in 2021 compared to 2020 reflecting the continual improvement in economic activities since the COVID-19 lockdowns in the second quarter of this year.
Further, we expect to return to normal weather in 2021, will increase Ameren Missouri earnings by approximately $0.04 compared to 2020 results through the third quarter, assuming normal weather in the last quarter of this year. As a result of the Missouri PSC approval of our requested change in the way we account for Callaway scheduled refueling and maintenance expenses, we expect the amortization expenses associated with the fall 2020 outage to be approximately $0.07 per share higher in 2021 than the amortization expense expected to be realized in 2020. The fall 2020 outage is expected to cost approximately $0.11 per share and will be amortized over approximately 18 months starting in December of this year.
Moving on. Earnings from our FERC-regulated electric transmission activities are expected to benefit from additional investments in Ameren Illinois and ATXI projects made under forward-looking formula rate making.
For Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution, earnings are expected to benefit in 2021 compared to 2020 from additional infrastructure investments made under the Illinois performance-based rate making. The allowed ROE under the formula will be the average of the 2021 30-year treasury yield plus 5.8%, which are applied to year-end rate base. For Ameren Illinois Natural Gas, earnings are expected to benefit from higher delivery service rates based on a 2021 future test year and from infrastructure investments qualifying for rider treatment.
Finally, the issuance of common shares under the forward sale agreement to fund a portion of our wind generation investments and under our dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans as well as additional equity of approximately $150 million in 2021 are expected to unfavorably impact earnings per share. Of course, in 2021, we will seek to manage all of our businesses to earn as close to our [indiscernible] return as possible while being mindful of operating in other business needs.
Finally, turning to Page 18. I will summarize. We have a strong team and they're well positioned to continue executing our plan. We continue to expect to deliver solid earnings growth in 2020 as we successfully execute our strategy and navigate the impacts of COVID-19.
As we look to the longer term, we continue to expect strong earnings per share growth driven by robust rate base growth and disciplined cost management. Further, we believe the growth compares very favorably with the growth of our utility peers. And Ameren shares continue to offer investors a solid dividend. In total, we have attractive total shareholder return story that compares very favorably to our peers.
This concludes my prepared remarks. With that, now we'll invite your questions."

As you think about 2021, I mean, we're doing a lot of different scenarios, Jeremy, and we're thinking about how this recovery is going to continue. And we are obviously modeling a recovery to continue into 2021, and we're looking hard within each of those sectors. And obviously, you've seen the strong piece on the residential side. Industrial has come back for the most part. Commercial is the area we're spending a lot of time on, just really trying to understand what that impact will be for retail, et cetera.
Yes. So we haven't obviously provided what we're going to exactly see for 2021 because we want to really see where 2020 continues to finish out here, being really thoughtful about it. I mean to be honest, I'm not seeing a lot of scenarios where we would gain all of that back. I mean, I'll be honest about that. But we clearly do continue to see the recovery continue in place. Now all of that is premised on the fact that we wouldn't go back in any shelter-in-place orders. And for the most part, where we're impacted by earnings here in Missouri, we're pretty well opened up. I mean, you do have certain sectors operating at some limited capacity, restaurants, retail, those kind of things. And so we're assuming that some of that continues to come back. But again, all that's premised on the fact that we wouldn't have any significant sort of shelter-in-place at the moment."

But to say there'll be any significant variations at this point in time, that would be premature. Marty and his team are diligently putting together that rate review, and as we said, we'll put together in the first half of next year. And so I think the best thing to say is that, obviously, the wind generation is a big portion of it as well as the smart energy plan, right?

So at the same time, I think as you pointed out, we've seen the dividend payout ratio now come lower than our overall range. And so that factor, coupled with our strong earnings per share growth expectations of 6% to 8%, it really positions us well for future dividend growth. And I can't ultimately predict that. But the point is that we try to execute our strategy and position ourselves for a solid dividend growth and perhaps even greater dividend growth in the future. And so you saw our Board of Directors just increased it 4% just recently. I think that's evidence of their belief in our overall strategic plan and their confidence in it.

I will just say this that there -- stakeholders are absolutely engaged on energy legislation in a lot of various forms, including the Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act, right? That is continuing to be a topic of conversation as well as comprehensive energy legislation to address items and issues that are being addressed up in the northern part of the state and obviously, we're very focused on things that are new in the southern part of the state.
So because of that, I do expect energy legislation to be a topic of discussion in the next session. But I certainly can't predict when and what form it will take at this time. All I can say is that Richard, Mark and his team are advocating for the Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act for all the right reasons because we believe it will deliver significant value for our customers, certainly for the state of Illinois and we believe, too, it will continue to deliver long-term value for not just customers, but also for shareholders.

There's nothing that precludes us from taking any of those steps before the commission actually rules on the integrated resource plan in the way that I mentioned."
