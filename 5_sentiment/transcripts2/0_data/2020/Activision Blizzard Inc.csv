Our fourth quarter results exceeded our prior outlook for both revenues and earnings per share. As we continue to transform the company, we've remained focused on the delivery of epic entertainment",744,"Thank you, Chris, and thank you all for joining us today. Our fourth quarter results exceeded our prior outlook for both revenues and earnings per share. As we continue to transform the company, we've remained focused on the delivery of epic entertainment that connects and engages the world. We believe we can do this with greater speed and efficiency while maintaining our long-standing commitment to quality and excellence and providing superior returns to our shareholders. 
We ended the year with over 400 million monthly active users, strong year-over-year engagement and significant potential in monetization. We're in the privileged position of having a direct digital connection with hundreds of millions of players to whom we deliver some of the world's best professionally produced content. And we have the ability to provide our audiences with a variety of ways to enjoy our content with monetization through subscriptions, premium digital purchases, digital native advertising and a variety of other player investment mechanisms. Each of our large brand franchises as well as our new potential franchises have greater opportunities than ever before. Using Call of Duty as an example, with the introduction of Call of Duty Mobile, we grew our player base from 40 million to 100 million players in less than a year, and we expect significant growth in the call of Duty franchise in 2020 as compared to 2019 as a result of this and from other unannounced Call of Duty initiatives. 
Mobile, in fact, is now our leading platform. The business model for Call of Duty Mobile is free-to-play, which enables the rapid development of a large community of players with the option to purchase digital items and services as well as our ability to generate advertising revenues. Franchises like Call of Duty offer advertisers a very difficult to reach target and today, the ad load is extremely low as we're experimenting with the best advertising solutions for our players and our advertising partners. 
We successfully developed great games for mobile. Our franchises have the power to attract far bigger audiences than previously. We're hard at work on high-quality mobile games for all of our most important franchises. 
And with respect to esports, 2 weeks ago, we debuted the Call of Duty League with 12 city-based teams. Working closely with our experienced team owners and globally recognized sponsors, we're thrilled to celebrate our players and inspire our community with professional call of duty esports. And with our new strategic broadcast relationship with YouTube, over 200 million game reviewers now have access to our world-class esports content for both Call of Duty League and Overwatch. 
Across console, PC, mobile and touch points like esports, the momentum for Call of Duty could not be stronger. And this success illustrates the larger opportunities we have across our diverse and large wholly owned library of titles dating back to our founding [ 40  ] years ago. Having our franchises on all platforms in all geographies with a constant flow of content and leveraging the additional touch points we have available to us like esports and advertising continues to be our focus. 
Another great example of our franchise transformation is what happened with Warcraft. We doubled the size of the active World of Warcraft community in the second half of 2019 by adding classic to the WoW subscription offering. The remarkable growth of the WoW community represents an important proof point of the value and potential of our established franchise, and it has energized our development team as we develop new content for all of our key franchises. These franchises form the basis for large engaged communities of players and spectators with whom we take our responsibility to deliver high-quality content very seriously. 
Prioritization of opportunity and access to more talent are our challenges, but we are meeting these challenges with improved execution, and we expect to grow audiences, engagement and monetization and provide superior shareholder returns as we have for the last 30 years. 
As a final note, we wanted to acknowledge the tragedy of Kobe Bryant's untimely death. Kobe was a longtime friend of the company, starring in commercials for Guitar Hero and Call of Duty. He was entirely supporter of our veteran employment initiatives and always made himself available for all of our veterans events and activities. He will be greatly missed by all of us, and our thoughts and prayers are with his family. 
And now Coddy will review the highlights of our operations with you."

Strong execution in 2019 on our strategy enabled Activision Blizzard to exceed our fourth quarter outlook and enter 2020 with momentum. That momentum was created by the increased investment and focus on the creative and commercial resources",1525,"Thanks, Bobby. Strong execution in 2019 on our strategy enabled Activision Blizzard to exceed our fourth quarter outlook and enter 2020 with momentum. That momentum was created by the increased investment and focus on the creative and commercial resources of our biggest franchises and allowed us to accelerate progress against our 4 key growth pillars. And our first growth pillar, driving a consistent cadence of major new content to grow our reach. Our expanded Call of Duty development team launched a very successful Modern Warfare, with unit sales in Q4 increasing by a double-digit percentage versus the prior year across console and PC combined. 
And the team followed up with great execution on our second growth pillar, live operations for in-game content, services, features and events to drive engagement, recurring revenues. Modern Warfare's first season of follow-on content will hit our new, more engaging system, which drove both engagement and net bookings up significantly year-over-year. Similarly, the World of Warcraft team followed up on the remarkable Q3 launch of WoW Classic with substantial content updates that kept the community engaged and the subscriber base well above pre-Classic levels. In Hearthstone, we've seen increased engagement on the launch of latest expansion and the rollout of the new in Q4. 
As for our third pillar, extending our claim to console and PC franchises Mobile, the October launch of Call of Duty Mobile, one the most successful in industry history, driving Activision publishing to record among the active users. It also highlighted the opportunity for our other large franchises to reach hundreds of millions of [indiscernible] players once they expand on the mobile. And finally, as we build a new engagement models for our franchises, our advertising business again grew rapidly, further strengthening our [indiscernible]. We expect to build on this momentum in 2020, with each of these pillars driving net bookings growth for the company this year. 
I'll now provide more detail on our Q4 results and recent developments across our franchises. Starting with Activision. Q4 was a fantastic quarter. Monthly active users tripled in Q3 to reach 128 million. Call of Duty continued its leadership on console with Modern Warfare driving year-on-year sell-through growth and generating more upfront console sales than any other franchise worldwide, a feat the franchise has now accomplished for 10 of the last 11 years. Modern Warfare also saw strong growth in full game downloads, with console digital mix at almost 15%. And we ended Q4 with the retail channel at its tightest level in many years, positioning us well for ongoing catalog sales in 2020. 
Franchise also expanded its audience on PC, with Q4 PC sell-through on growing 50% year-over-year. This growing cross-platform Call of Duty Community received in early December the largest free content offering in franchise history, alongside a new system for player investment. And as a result, Q4 in-game net bookings grew by a double-digit percentage year-over-year despite a later launch of the in-game system and despite the removal of the season pass. Our second Modern Warfare follow-on content launches next week, and the team has more great experiences and surprises in store, both for that season and throughout 2020, which we expect to drive strong in-game net bookings growth year-over-year. And of course, the Call of Duty franchise saw breakout success in Q4 with the launch of Call of Duty Mobile. The game has received widespread acclaim and with over $150 million has brought a huge number of new players into the franchise, and given existing players, a new way to experience of Call of Duty. Engagement is strong, with the teams from Activision and [indiscernible] studio intend to sustain for the long-term with a substantial pipeline of features, events and content. Benefiting from over 15 years of Call of Duty releases.  The title outperformed our net bookings expectations in Q4, ranking in the top 15 [indiscernible] in app stores. And the third season is already well underway and tracking well. 
So across console, PC, mobile and esports, the Call of Duty franchise has never been better positioned for growth, and there's more to come, including entirely new experiences within the Modern Warfare universe. And then, of course, in Q4 of this year, a new premium Call of Duty release, which is already generating excitement in our play tests. 
Finally, across the Activision portfolio, we are honored to see the team's focus on high-quality, world-class content recognized by the industry of the 2019 Game Awards, Call of Duty Mobile won Mobile Game of the Year. Crash Team Racing won Best Game in the Sports and Racing category and second that twice won Game of the Year. 
Turning to Blizzard. Monthly active users were 32 million in the fourth quarter. World of Warcraft monthly active users were higher sequentially, reflecting the sustained engagement of players following the August launch of WoW classic, Blizzard's recreation of the original WoW from 15 years ago. As you may remember, in Q3, WoW added more monthly or longer-term subscription plans than in any prior quarter in franchise history. That momentum continued into Q4. Then Blizzard's sustained engagement with robust slate of content for both modern and classic WoW and exited the year with an active community more than twice the size of its Q2 ending level. A strong cadence of content will continue in 2020 with a great series of in-game releases for classic and a strong Shadowlands expansion coming from Modern Warfare in the second half of the year. Shadowlands [indiscernible] to explore new ways to customize characters and our revamped leveling system of onboard new players. 
Hearthstone, the competitive environment remains intense, but we did see sustained improvement engagements signed their lease of the expansion and in new Battlegrounds out of [indiscernible] Q4. Q4 net bookings were lower year-over-year grew sequentially, and the Hearthstone team continues to iterate quickly. They launched a new game store in December and will release a number of new content in in 2020. 
Q4 also saw the launch of Overwatch on Nintendo Switch further expanding a community that has now surpassed 50 million players since the 2016 launch and thus began the Overwatch League returns at 20 teams from around the world competing in the home format for the first time. [indiscernible], as you know, are working on the broadest pipeline in its history, including Overwatch 2 and Diablo IV for PC and console. And Diablo [indiscernible], a mobile game developed in partnership with continues to make good progress and will move into the testing phase with its first regional tests planned for the middle of the year. 
Turning to King. Monthly active users were 249 million, increasing 2 million from the third quarter. On a year-over-year basis, we saw declines in web and smaller mobile titles. But importantly, Candy mobile reach was little changed and benefited from growth in King's largest title, Candy Crush Saga. In the second half of 2019, King introduced new initiatives to grow payer conversion targeting lapsed payers as well as converting new payers into the ecosystem, and these initiatives led to encouraging payer engagement trends in the last 2 quarters. While these initiatives dampened in-game net bookings in Q4 and will continue to do so in Q1, we believe a broader and more engaged payer base positions the franchise for growth over the medium and long term. And even with these actions, Candy Crush Saga remained the top grossing title in the U.S. app stores, and the wider cat franchise was once again #1. 
King's advertising business grew net bookings over 80% year-over-year, with strong growth in active users volume and pricing. Both direct and indirect sales grew sharply for the full year ad bookings exceeded $150 million with the business set for robust growth again in 2020. Throughout this year, King will continue to optimize the economy within Candy, launching ongoing features, services and events to drive player engagement and investment. And having previously narrowed its pipeline focused on the highest potential projects, King is investing in several promising new titles, including content based on beloved catalog IP. Regional testing of some of these new titles will begin in 2020. 
So in conclusion, our strategy to focus on our growth pillars and investment creative and commercial resources and initiatives of our biggest franchises is delivering results. In 2020, we will continue that focus with the releases and pipeline initiatives highlighted today to further expand our reach engagement and player investment and to extend our largest IP across new platforms, geographies and business models. We plan to reach more players on the platforms in more regions than ever before. To do so, we'll also further increase investment in our technology capabilities, technology platforms and data analytics. We'll fund these investments with an ongoing focus on efficiency and organizational optimization to leverage our scale across the business. We know that some of our investments, won't bear fruit until next year later, but we're confident in our growth trajectory this year and our growth plan, and we enter 2020 with momentum. 
I'll now hand the call over to Dennis to discuss our Q4 and full year financial results and outlook. Dennis?"

Today, I will review our Q4 2019 results as well as our outlook for 2020 and the first quarter. 
Q4 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS were ahead of our prior outlook, reflecting better-than-expected results for Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and a lower tax rate. To review the quarter, I'll start with our Q4 segment results. 
Activision revenue was $1.43 billion, led by Call of Duty growth in both upfront and in-game revenues on console and PC and the addition of Call of Duty Mobile. Operating income was $696 million with an operating margin of 49%. As expected, Call of Duty Mobile was not a material contributor to operating income in Q4 despite a great launch as we invested to build our player base and position the title for long-term success. 
Blizzard's revenue was $595 million, lower year-over-year as growth for World of Warcraft and Overwatch was offset by a decline for Hearthstone and Diablo. Operating income was $260 million, with the revenue decline more than offset by lower costs. Blizzard's operating margin was 44%, significantly higher year-over-year due to mix and lower costs. 
King revenue of $503 million was flat sequentially and lower year-over-year, driven primarily by King's actions to prioritize mobile payer engagement in the quarter as well as year-over-year decline in web titles. The ads business grew more than 80% year-over-year. Operating income was $197 million, with an operating margin of 39%, 1 point higher year-over-year, driven by high incremental margins from advertising. Across our segments, in-game net bookings were $1.1 billion. 
Now let's turn to our consolidated results. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be referencing non-GAAP figures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. For the quarter, we generated Q4 GAAP revenues of $2.0 billion, $174 million above our November guidance. This includes the net deferrals of $722 million. Net bookings of $2.7 billion were $62 million above our November outlook. We incurred GAAP-only restructuring and related charges of $30 million and we generated Q4 GAAP EPS of $0.68 and Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $0.62, which was $0.19 above guidance. These figures include the net deferrals of $0.61. 
For the year, we generated GAAP revenues of $6.5 billion. This includes the net recognition of deferrals of $101 million. Net bookings were $6.4 billion. We incurred GAAP-only restructuring and related charges of $137 million and generated GAAP EPS of $1.95 and non-GAAP EPS of $2.31. These figures include the net recognition of deferrals of $0.06. From a cash flow perspective, our business delivered Q4 operating cash flow of $918 million. Annual operating cash flow was $1.8 billion, higher year-over-year due to lower working capital and cash taxes. Our cash and investments at the end of December was approximately $5.9 billion, and we ended the year with a net cash position of approximately $3.2 billion. 
Turning to capital allocation. We entered 2020 with a strong balance sheet and significant flexibility. As always, we continue to take a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation. And with this in mind, our Board has authorized an 11% increase in our annual dividend to $0.41 per share payable in May. As we look back over the last year, we are pleased with the company's operating discipline, commercial execution and content delivery during a period where we refocused the business and increased investment in key franchises to position us for future growth. 
Now let's look forward to our outlook for 2020. First, regarding our slate and plans for each business unit. 
Activision enters the year with strong momentum for Call of Duty across upfront sales in game, mobile and esports. Along with a tight retail channel that should benefit catalog sales, this positions us for strong growth in the franchise, particularly in the first half of the year. In Q4, we plan to launch the next premium release of Call of Duty. We can't wait to unveil what our teams have been working on, and we feel great about the content. Although, as is customary, we are prudently assuming lower sell-in for Q4 versus Modern Warfare this past year. 
Turning to Blizzard, which just last week released Warcraft III [indiscernible]. Blizzard will build on World of Warcraft momentum with ongoing content for classic and the Shadowlands expansion in the second half of the year. The Hearthstone and Overwatch teams will support their communities with ongoing content and services that drive engagement and player investment. And as Coddy mentioned, Diablo Immortal is planned to enter a regional testing towards the middle of the year, though we don't have any material revenue from that title in our guidance. 
King will continue to release content, features, services and events across its portfolio, with an ongoing focus on optimizing reach, engagement and player investment for Candy. And the advertising business is set to deliver another year of strong net bookings growth. At the same time, King will continue to invest in several promising new titles in its pipeline. And although we expect regional play testing for certain titles, similar to Diablo Immortal, our outlook does not include material revenue from these titles. 
In addition, our business units will continue to tap into our portfolio of beloved IP to bring several remastered and reimagined experiences to our players in 2020, which we will announce closer to launch. Bringing all this together, our outlook reflects 5% year-over-year growth in net bookings. We expect Activision to experience the strongest net bookings growth amongst our segments, both in dollar terms and on a percentage basis. We expect solid net bookings growth from Blizzard for the year, and our outlook reflects the flattish performance again, with year-over-year trends improving in the second half of the year. From a margin perspective, our outlook reflects GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin increasing year-over-year. 
Now let's turn to the numbers. On a GAAP basis for 2020, we expect revenues of $6.45 billion, including net deferrals of $275 million. We expect net bookings of $6.73 billion; product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 22%; operating expenses including software amortization of 50%; and a GAAP-only restructuring charge of approximately $50 million. We expect a tax rate of 19%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of $778 million and GAAP EPS of $1.85. For 2020, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 23%; operating expenses, including software amortization of 44%. We expect a tax rate of 19% and non-GAAP EPS of $2.22, including net deferrals of $0.13. 
Now let's turn to our Q1 outlook. On a GAAP basis for Q1, we expect revenues of $1.64 billion, including the net recognition of deferrals of $365 million. We expect net bookings of $1.28 billion; product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 21%; operating expenses including software amortization of 48%; and a GAAP-only restructuring charge of approximately $35 million. We expect a tax rate of 17%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 775 million and GAAP EPS of $0.55. For Q1, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 21% and operating expenses including software amortization, of 31%. We expect a tax rate of 17% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.66, which includes the net recognition of deferrals of $0.31. 
In closing, in 2019, we have come a long way in refocusing the business on our biggest franchises and opportunities. The momentum for World of Warcraft, Call of Duty and our new engagement models highlights the growth potential for our broader portfolio of durable, fully owned franchises when we apply our top creative talent and commercial talent against our biggest opportunities. We are encouraged by our 2019 results. And as we return to growth in 2020, the opportunity set for our business across platforms, geographies and business models has never been greater. Going forward, we will maintain our operating discipline and focus as we execute against a great content lineup this year and a pipeline that includes Overwatch 2, Diablo IV and Diablo Immortal and multiple unannounced initiatives, including several mobile titles. We remain confident that ongoing execution against our plan will position us to deliver growth to our shareholders over the long term.

I think before I touch on season pass, specifically, it's important that we kind of step back for a second and look at some of the macro changes that we made, and season pass is one of them. Our intent was just to create a better overall experience for our player community, and we think we've done that. The first big thing we did was bring in cross play and cross progression, enabling friends to play together no matter what platform they're on. In the case of Modern Warfare, it's just great to see players come back together after so many years of experiencing franchise in the past. 
Now with season pass, it kind of played a similar role, right? So instead of certain portion of the audience having certain content, we're focused now on free content for the entire community to drive engagement with the overall community. And I'd say the last big change that we made was really focusing on the new battle pass and item shop system in the game, giving players kind of more transparency to the content thereafter and obviously focusing more on cosmetic content. And I suppose the best way to judge all of it is just what's the player behavior and what's the community is saying. And when we look at engagement and you look at daily average unique, our engagement is up significantly year-over-year, and that's really great for us to see so many people enjoying and playing this fantastic game. 
And then on the player investment side, I'd say fans certainly seem to be appreciating the new system quite a bit. We mentioned kind of the growth year-on-year. But one other thing I might add is that we're also seeing increased attach rates in-game to the new system, which I think is a very, very positive sign for us. And for us, this all signals to a really healthy ecosystem within Modern Warfare, one that we think we can build on and create momentum with our community. It's really on us from now to really build great content, which we intend to do for the long haul on this game. A great pipeline of content is coming, starting with season 2 next week, and we have some surprises in the store beyond that. 
So I'd say, overall, what we expect is a healthier Call of Duty in 2020 versus the previous year, and we look forward to sharing more in the future. But thanks for the question."

So overall growth is impacted by some of our smaller panels and the web platform. We also had a number of initiatives more recently in the driving payer conversion and bringing back lapsed payers, and that presented a near-term trade-off, but it's the right thing to do for the medium term and beyond. And we'll continue to see some of those trade-offs in Q1. 
But with all that said, when I look forward, I see a number of growth areas for King. First and foremost, is Candy. Candy continues to be an incredibly durable franchise, and we see growth just through the slate of new features, all the services we're releasing and the in-game events that we hold. More recently, we're also thinking quite a bit about our social features. We've seen that really work in different panels and in different genres. And when I think about how that could be in Candy and the size of Candy, that could be a big unlock for us. 
Another thing that's really locked for growth is our advertising business. So as you heard, that's really coming along really nicely. And we built a really large and high-margin business, and I see growth there. 
And then additionally, I see growth in our pipeline. We reset our pipeline recently, and we're starting to see some really good results in our prototypes, and we will start doing some regional testing on some of those this year. So when I put all that together, I look to the medium term and beyond and I think we have some really good growth opportunities here."

So as a reminder, when we designed the model for World of Warcraft plastic, it was important that players have a single existing subscription to support both games. And when we think about the WoW community supporting both even though Classic and Modern are very distinct experiences. And we're committed to kind of continuing to support both of those experiences over the long term. 
Given the content updates for Modern WoW and the cadence that we have for classic, we exited our year with the subscriber base that was double what it was at the end of Q2. And we also see players remaining engaged in both versions of the game. We launched Visions of [indiscernible], which is a content patch for Modern WoW in January. 
Engagement with Classic has been particularly strong in the east, and we see very high levels of player retention there. And our next update for Classic is going to be Phase 3, which is Blackwing layer. It's one of my favorites, and we're planning on launching that on February 13. 
Concerning Warcraft III: Reforged, honestly, it's been a bit of a hard week, and our community has come to expect really amazing things from us. And we've heard from them that we did not achieve that bar. But we stand behind our games and have consistently shown that not only do we support them, but we continue to build on them even after launch, and we're committed to doing that here as well. And so we're going to continue to update the game, and we'll continue to update the community with our plans going forward."

Obviously, we do view a strong balance sheet as a really important strategic asset for the company. And having that gives us considerable flexibility to invest in the business, do buybacks and return capital or pursue M&A when we see attractive opportunities. And our track record probably somewhat speaks for itself as you look at that over a long period of time. We borrowed, I'd say,  very fortuitously to finance our Vivendi transaction, our King transaction and then subsequently paid down that debt. So we paid down more than $4 billion since we financed those transactions and actually have climbed our way up the investment grade ratings grid. And then we've returned over the last decade, more than -- I guess, around $10 billion of capital back to our shareholders, about $8 billion through share repurchases. And we still do have our $1.5 billion authorization, and then about $2 billion over that time period in dividends, which has increased double digits, I'd say, probably on average over the course of that period and again, this year with the $0.41 dividend, which we announced today. 
M&A is always something we keep our eye on. And as we have our rate architectures up and we always look at lot of things, but we -- I'd like to think we're pretty disciplined about our process. We do have a pretty rigorous process, and we try to look for a few criteria things when we are considering it. We're always trying to find great franchises or technology that could add to our portfolio and make our business and our franchise portfolio stronger. We'd like to see a track record of profitability or path to profitability, a strong leadership team that's aligned around growing the business. And then lastly, and this one has been more challenging is finding things in -- at a valuation that makes sense. So it's not easy to find all those things and so you have to be very disciplined and patient as you think about those inorganic opportunities. So that gives you a little bit of an overview in terms of how we've approached it. I think our past track record and philosophy on this is probably the best indicator of how we think about it and how we'll all capital in the future."

And the results are encouraging. We're getting ready to move to the next phase of development with some regional alpha testing later this year. Player feedback is invaluable. And as we continue to work on building the game, we'll be looking at that feedback to make sure that we're making really a great deal experience. When we think about -- when I think about mobile overall for Blizzard, we have our roots in PC gaming. And we're going to continue to be deeply committed to the PC. But we do think there are opportunities for additional experiences and in different ways for powers to engage on different kinds of devices. And we see mobile is also a way to attract players that we don't currently reach on PC and console, so we think the mobile opportunity for Blizzard overall is very substantial. And Diablo Immortal will be our first release as a mobile-first game, and we continue to work on multiple mobile initiatives across Blizzard in addition to the PC and console games."

I mean to say, first, as Bobby mentioned earlier today on an interview, we had a long-standing relationship with Google. It's been great. We are thrilled to formalize that into a deeper partnership over multiple years. And as you said, there's really 2 big pieces to it that this is on sort of the global IT infrastructure. And then the second is on what really is just a fantastic content platform in YouTube. 
On the first piece, what we have the opportunity to do now is have a more efficient and better delivery of the back-end services and infrastructure handled by a partner, where that is their great expertise. And what it allows us to do is it frees up our resources and developers and mind share to focus on what we do best, which is making the content and getting it out into the hands of our players at a faster cadence. That is a great balance of trade for us, and we feel really good about the depth of that partnership and how it will carry us going forward. 
On the content side on YouTube, there's 200 million game reviewers on YouTube, and it's just a tremendous opportunity to bring our platform to new audiences there. We think not only just in a way that players can experience it today with new modes and formats and also YouTube is a great on-demand viewing platform. And we think viewers might be increasingly interested in viewing our content that way. There are other pieces to this deal where there's real value, we think, in terms of how we utilize their platforms and how they help us build more reach and engagement in our ecosystem. Not in this deal and you mentioned it is Stadia. There's cloud game streaming experiences that are directly to the consumer. We continue to watch with interest and will make appropriate assessments as we go forward to figure out our own next steps there. But I think what it points to is just as a last thought, a broader point, which is over the last 2 years, we've been talking about these large technology players that are coming to our space at scale. What we've said is we see this tremendous opportunity as a content provider, to take advantage of where we sit in the space and this Google deal is an example. It has a large amount of value for us as we go forward. And we think we're only even better positioned for other partnerships as we take next steps."

Thanks for the question. Let me start with the last part of your question on the key learnings, and I apologize for being a little redundant on this, but I think a key theme throughout our call is that I think what we learned more anything else is that the market is certainly ready for our franchises on mobile. When we make a great game and kind of stay true to the core tenants and what made the franchise great in the first place and we execute on that, now we can reach just millions and millions of people around the globe that may have never experienced our franchise before. And that's just -- that's very exciting for us as an organization because that obviously is true not just for just Call of Duty but also for the many great franchises that we have in the organization. If I were to turn back and talk about Call of Duty Mobile a little bit in terms of engagement and retention, like you asked, look, I'd say it's still in the early days, but we've seen a number of encouraging signs. Obviously, the installs at the beginning, which we reported on, have been fantastic. But also in terms of our daily engagement, are looking at our doubts, Mobile hit levels that were multiples higher than any other title in franchise history. So that engagement base is really, really exciting for us to work from. 
Now for us, the content now becomes on the content pipeline to sustain and build on that. In mobile, we have a game and a platform essentially that we want to build on for a really long time to come. So we're hyper-focused on our content pipeline, our monthly, weekly and daily events as they come into the game to make sure we drive the best possible experience for our player community there. We're in the middle of season 3 right now, and that's tracking really well. And I think what you're going to see is we're learning a lot real time, and the learnings are great. And you'll see us adjusting our content and continuing to make the best possible experience we can for our fans as we move forward in the future. 
So I'd say, right now, we're off to really a nice start and -- that I'm excited about, and we'll be reporting on our progress as we head into the future."

We really built a durable business here, and it's a high-margin one. And the way I think about it is, with our scale of monthly, it really allows us to get the benefit of having such a large audience, as you know, a small fraction of the our in-game economy. So now it's become a needle mover for us. We crossed $150 million in net bookings in 2019. And it's really a testament to a great collaboration between the product teams and the game teams the advertising team and really all of them thinking about what's a great player experience and how do we deliver something very differentiated for our advertisers. And so when I look to 2020 and beyond, I see continued growth. There are many avenues of that growth. First and foremost, we're going to continue to roll out advertising to more and more of our players. And then I think the teams will continue to innovate there. We're already, as I said, have an incredibly differentiated product that advertisers are really attaching to, but we can continue to make it better. A good example of this was in Q4 was some of the -- what we delivered to Sony Pictures on the Jumanji film launch. And there, we not only had our flagship rewarded video product, but we did something truly differentiated in the marketplace, where we put an in-game integration. We put some of the game characters -- film characters in our game. It was greatly engaging for our players, and it delivered tens of millions of views to Jumanji and really moved the needle for them, too. So I think about continuing to move down that journey. And as we do that, we unlock more demand, and we are working pretty closely with our agencies. While we also continue to build our direct sales team and continue to build kind of the infrastructure around it. 
So all in all, I think kind of that strategy that's been working continues to bear fruit for us. And I think there's plenty of growth ahead of us and good runway."

It's Bobby. When -- I think one of the things that we found with the launch of Call of Duty Mobile with games like Hearthstone, our designers and developers have gotten a lot more excited about reaching bigger, broader audiences. And we've seen that across the whole company. And so I think what you're going to continue to see is a commitment to innovation on all of our franchises. And that now includes commitment to innovation with mobile devices. And I think that as long as we can deliver new innovative game play with great user experiences on mobile devices, you'll see more franchises taking advantage of that as a platform. I think the other thing we've seen is that people want to reach more customers in more countries and especially when you look at some of the things that we're doing in esports, being able to build these big inclusive communities around the world. And today, our mobile games are played in almost 200 countries. That's been a real catalyst for us to really rethink the way that we're approaching our franchise development. 
So you can, in fact, as Jay pointed out, obviously, as Humam can attest to and as we've even seen the Activision business with the success of call of Duty Mobile, mobile is now our largest platform, and you'll continue to see us with not just mobile touch points but all the other important touch points that we've now added into the business, expanding the reach of our franchises, the engagement of our franchises and the monetization of our franchises. So we couldn't be more enthusiastic about the prospects that we have going forward. We've talked a little bit about the challenges, which is prioritization of opportunity and making sure that we have the right talent along with those opportunities. But those are challenges we managed for a long time. So it's a great question, and I think you can expect that all of our franchises are investing in all of these new opportunities."

We believe we can do this with greater speed and efficiency while maintaining our long-standing commitment to quality and excellence and providing superior returns to our shareholders. 
We ended the year with over 400 million monthly active users, strong year-over-year engagement, and significant potential in monetization. We're in the privileged position of having a direct digital connection with hundreds of millions of players to whom we deliver some of the world's best professionally produced content. And we have the ability to provide our audiences with a variety of ways to enjoy our content with monetization through subscriptions, premium digital purchases, digital native advertising and a variety of other player investment mechanisms. Each of our large brand franchises as well as our new potential franchises have greater opportunities than ever before. Using Call of Duty as an example, with the introduction of Call of Duty Mobile, we grew our player base from 40 million to 100 million players in less than a year, and we expect significant growth in the call of Duty franchise in 2020 as compared to 2019 as a result of this and from other unannounced Call of Duty initiatives. Mobile, in fact, is now our leading platform. 
The business model for Call of Duty Mobile is free-to-play, which enables the rapid development of a large community of players, with the option to purchase digital items and services as well as our ability to generate advertising revenues. Franchises like Call of Duty offer advertisers a very difficult to reach target, and today, the ad load is extremely low as we're experimenting with the best advertising solutions for our players and our advertising partners. 
We successfully developed great games for mobile. Our franchises have the power to attract far bigger audiences than previously. We're hard at work on high-quality mobile games for all of our most important franchises. 
And with respect to esports, 2 weeks ago, we debuted the Call of Duty League with 12 city-based teams. Working closely with our experienced team owners and globally recognized sponsors, we're thrilled to celebrate our players and inspire our community with professional Call of Duty esports. And with our new strategic broadcast relationship with YouTube, over 200 million game reviewers now have access to our world-class esports content for both Call of Duty League and Overwatch League. 
Across console, PC, mobile and touch points like esports, the momentum for Call of Duty could not be stronger, and this success illustrates the larger opportunities we have across our diverse and large wholly-owned library of titles dating back to our founding 40 years ago. Having our franchises on all platforms in all geographies with a constant flow of content, and leveraging the additional touch points we have available to us like esports and advertising, continues to be our focus. 
Another great example of our franchise transformation is what happened with Warcraft. We doubled the size of the active World of Warcraft community in the second half of 2019 by adding classic to the WoW subscription offering. The remarkable growth of the WoW community represents an important proof point of the value and potential of our established franchise, and it has energized our development team as we develop new content for all of our key franchises. These franchises form the basis for large, engaged communities of players and spectators, with whom we take our responsibility to deliver high-quality content very seriously. 
Prioritization of opportunity and access to more talent are our challenges, but we are meeting these challenges with improved execution, and we expect to grow audiences, engagement and monetization and provide superior shareholder returns as we have for the last 30 years. 
As a final note, we wanted to acknowledge the tragedy of Kobe Bryant's untimely death. Kobe was a longtime friend of the company, starring masterfully in commercials for Guitar Hero and Call of Duty. He was a tireless supporter of our veteran employment initiatives and always made himself available for all of our veterans events and activities. He will be greatly missed by all of us, and our thoughts and prayers are with his family. 
And now Coddy will review the highlights of our operations with you."

Strong execution in 2019 on our strategy enabled Activision Blizzard to exceed our fourth quarter outlook and enter 2020 with momentum. That momentum was created by the increased investment and focus on the creative and commercial resources of our biggest franchises and allowed us to accelerate progress against our 4 key growth pillars. 
In our first growth pillar, driving a consistent cadence of major new content to grow our reach, our expanded Call of Duty development team launched a very successful Modern Warfare, with unit sales in Q4 increasing by a double-digit percentage versus the prior year across console and PC combined.  And the team followed up with great execution on our second growth pillar, live operations for in-game content, services, features and events to drive engagement and recurring revenues. Modern Warfare's first season of follow-on content rolled out our new, more engaging in-game system, which drove both engagement and net bookings up significantly year-over-year.  Similarly, the World of Warcraft team followed up on the remarkable Q3 launch of WoW Classic with substantial content updates that kept the community engaged and the subscriber base well above pre-Classic levels. 
In Hearthstone, we've seen increased engagement upon the launch of Blizzard's latest expansion and the rollout of the new Battlegrounds games mode in Q4. 
As for our third pillar, extending our acclaimed console and PC franchises to mobile, the October launch of Call of Duty Mobile, one the most successful in industry history, driving Activision publishing to record monthly the active users. It also highlighted the opportunity for our other large franchises to reach hundreds of millions of new players once they expand on the mobile. And finally, as we build and enhance engagement models for our franchises, our advertising business again grew rapidly, and further strengthened our leadership in esports. We expect to build on this momentum in 2020, with each of these pillars driving net bookings growth for the company this year. 
I'll now provide more detail on our Q4 results and recent developments across our franchises. Starting with Activision, Q4 was a fantastic quarter. Monthly active users tripled in Q3 to reach 128 million. Call of Duty continued its leadership on console, with Modern Warfare driving year-on-year sell-through growth and generating more upfront console sales than any other franchise worldwide, a feat the franchise has now accomplished for 10 of the last 11 years. Modern Warfare also saw strong growth in full game downloads, with console and digital mix at almost 50%. And we ended Q4 with the retail channel at its tightest level in many years, positioning us well for ongoing catalog sales in 2020. 
The franchise also expanded its audience on PC, with Q4 PC sell-through on Battle.net growing 50% year-over-year. This growing cross-platform Call of Duty Community received in early December the largest free content offering in franchise history, alongside a new system for player investment. And as a result, Q4 in-game net bookings grew by double-digit percentage year-over-year despite a later launch of the in-game system and despite the removal of Season Pass. We have a second Modern Warfare follow-on content launches next week, and the team has more great experiences and surprises in store, both for that season and throughout 2020, which we expect to drive strong in-game net bookings growth year-over-year. And of course, the Call of Duty franchise saw a breakout success in Q4 with the launch of Call of Duty Mobile. The game has received widespread acclaim. And with over $150 million, has brought a huge number of new players into the franchise and given existing players a new way to experience of Call of Duty. Engagement is strong, which the teams from Activision and Tencent Games Timi Studios intends to sustain for the long-term with a substantial pipeline of features, events and content benefiting from over 15 years of Call of Duty releases.  The title outperformed our net bookings expectations in Q4, ranking in the top 15 grossing games in U.S. app stores. And the third season is already well underway and tracking well. 
So across console, PC, mobile and esports, the Call of Duty franchise has never been better positioned for growth, and there's more to come, including entirely new experiences within the Modern Warfare universe. And then, of course, in Q4 of this year, a new premium Call of Duty release, which is already generating excitement in our play tests. 
Finally, across the Activision portfolio, we are honored to see the team's focus on high-quality, world-class content recognized by the industry at the 2019 Game Awards. Call of Duty Mobile won Mobile Game of the Year. Crash Team Racing won Best Game in the Sports and Racing category. And FromSoftware's Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, won Game of the Year. 
Turning to Blizzard. Monthly active users were 32 million in the fourth quarter. World of Warcraft monthly active users were higher sequentially, reflecting the sustained engagement of players following the August launch of WoW Classic, Blizzard's recreation of the original WoW from 15 years ago. As you may remember, in Q3, WoW added more monthly or longer-term subscription plans than in any prior quarter in franchise history. That momentum continued into Q4. Then Blizzard's sustained engagement with robust slate of content for both modern and Classic WoW and exited the year with an active community more than twice the size of its Q2 ending level. A strong cadence of content will continue in 2020 with a great series of in-game releases for Classic and a strong Shadowlands expansion coming from modern WoW in the second half of the year. Shadowlands will have new [ freedoms ] to explore, new ways to customize characters and a revamped leveling system to onboard new players.
Hearthstone, the competitive environment remains intense, but we did see sustained improvement engagements following the release of the Descent of Dragon expansion and the new Battlegrounds auto battler mode in Q4. Q4 net bookings were lower year-over-year, but grew sequentially, and the Hearthstone team continues to iterate quickly. They launched a new game store in December and will release a number of new content and engagement model enhancements in 2020. 
Q4 also saw the launch of Overwatch on Nintendo Switch, further expanding a community that has now surpassed 50 million players since the 2016 launch.   And as that begins, the Overwatch League returns at 20 teams from around the world, competing in the home stand format for the first time.  [indiscernible]  teams as you know, are working on their broadest pipeline in its history, including Overwatch 2 and Diablo IV on PC and console. And Diablo Immortal, a mobile game developed in partnership with NetEase, continues to make good progress and will move into the testing phase with its first regional tests planned for the middle of the year. 
Turning to King. Monthly active users were 249 million, increasing 2 million from the third quarter. On a year-over-year basis, we saw declines in web and smaller mobile titles. But importantly, Candy mobile reach was little changed and benefited from growth in King's largest title, Candy Crush Saga. In the second half of 2019, King introduced new initiatives to grow payer conversion, targeting lapsed payers as well as converting new payers into the ecosystem, and these initiatives led to encouraging payer engagement trends in the last 2 quarters. While these initiatives dampened in-game net bookings in Q4 and will continue to do so in Q1, we believe a broader and more engaged payer base positions the franchise for growth over the medium and long term. And even with these actions, Candy Crush Saga remained the top grossing title in the U.S. app stores, and the wider Candy franchise was once again #1. 
King's advertising business grew net bookings over 80% year-over-year, with strong growth in ad-enabled users, volume and pricing. Both direct and indirect sales grew sharply. For the full year, ad net bookings exceeded $150 million, with the business set for robust growth again in 2020. Throughout this year, King will continue to optimize the economy within Candy, launching ongoing features, services and events to drive player engagement and investment. And having previously narrowed its pipeline focused on the highest potential projects, King is investing in several promising new titles, including content based on Activision's beloved catalog IP. Regional testing of some of these new titles will begin in 2020. 
So in conclusion, our strategy to focus on our growth pillars and invest in creative and commercial resources and initiatives of our biggest franchises is delivering results. In 2020, we will continue that focus with the releases and pipeline initiatives highlighted today to further expand our reach, engagement and player investment, and to extend our largest IP across new platforms, geographies and business models. We plan to reach more players on the platforms in more regions than ever before. 
To do so, we'll also further increase investment in our technology capabilities, technology platforms and data analytics. We'll fund these investments with an ongoing focus on efficiency and organizational optimization to leverage our scale across the business. And we know that some of our investments won't bear fruit until next year later, but we're confident in our growth trajectory this year and our growth plan, and we enter 2020 with momentum. 
I'll now hand the call over to Dennis to discuss our Q4 and full year financial results and outlook. Dennis?"

Today, I will review our Q4 2019 results as well as our outlook for 2020 and the first quarter. 
Q4 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS were ahead of our prior outlook, reflecting better-than-expected results for Call of Duty and World of Warcraft and a lower tax rate. To review the quarter, I'll start with our Q4 segment results. 
Activision revenue was $1.43 billion, led by Call of Duty growth in both upfront and in-game revenues on console and PC and the addition of Call of Duty Mobile. Operating income was $696 million with an operating margin of 49%. As expected, Call of Duty Mobile was not a material contributor to operating income in Q4 despite a great launch as we invested to build our player base and position the title for long-term success. 
Blizzard's revenue was $595 million, lower year-over-year as growth for World of Warcraft and Overwatch was offset by a decline for Hearthstone and Diablo. Operating income was $260 million, with the revenue decline more than offset by lower costs. Blizzard's operating margin was 44%, significantly higher year-over-year due to mix and lower costs. 
King revenue of $503 million was flat sequentially and lower year-over-year, driven primarily by King's actions to prioritize mobile payer engagement in the quarter as well as year-over-year decline in web titles. The ads business grew more than 80% year-over-year. Operating income was $197 million, with an operating margin of 39%, 1 point higher year-over-year, driven by high incremental margins from advertising. Across our segments, in-game net bookings were $1.1 billion. 
Now let's turn to our consolidated results. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be referencing non-GAAP figures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. 
For the quarter, we generated Q4 GAAP revenues of $2.0 billion, $174 million above our November guidance. This includes the net deferrals of $722 million. Net bookings of $2.7 billion were $62 million above our November outlook. We incurred GAAP-only restructuring and related charges of $30 million, and we generated Q4 GAAP EPS of $0.68 and Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $0.62, which was $0.19 above guidance. These figures include the net deferrals of $0.61. 
For the year, we generated GAAP revenues of $6.5 billion. This includes the net recognition of deferrals of $101 million. Net bookings were $6.4 billion. We incurred GAAP-only restructuring and related charges of $137 million, and generated GAAP EPS of $1.95 and non-GAAP EPS of $2.31. These figures include the net recognition of deferrals of $0.06. From a cash flow perspective, our business delivered Q4 operating cash flow of $918 million. Annual operating cash flow was $1.8 billion, higher year-over-year due to lower working capital and cash taxes. Our cash and investments at the end of December was approximately $5.9 billion, and we ended the year with a net cash position of approximately $3.2 billion. 
Turning to capital allocation. We entered 2020 with a strong balance sheet and significant flexibility. As always, we continue to take a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation. And with this in mind, our Board has authorized an 11% increase in our annual dividend to $0.41 per share payable in May. As we look back over the last year, we are pleased with the company's operating discipline, commercial execution and content delivery during a period where we refocused the business and increased investment in key franchises to position us for future growth. 
Now let's look forward to our outlook for 2020. First, regarding our slate and plans for each business unit. 
Activision enters the year with strong momentum for Call of Duty across upfront sales, in-game, mobile and esports. Along with a tight retail channel that should benefit catalog sales, this positions us for strong growth in the franchise, particularly in the first half of the year. In Q4, we plan to launch the next premium release of Call of Duty. We can't wait to unveil what our teams have been working on, and we feel great about the content. Although, as is customary, we are prudently assuming lower sell-in for Q4 versus Modern Warfare this past year. 
Turning to Blizzard, which just last week released Warcraft III: Reforged. Blizzard will build on World of Warcraft momentum with ongoing content for classic and the Shadowlands expansion in the second half of the year. The Hearthstone and Overwatch teams will support their communities with ongoing content and services that drive engagement and player investment. And as Coddy mentioned, Diablo Immortal is planned to enter a regional testing towards the middle of the year, though we don't have any material revenue from that title in our guidance. 
King will continue to release content, features, services and events across its portfolio, with an ongoing focus on optimizing reach, engagement and player investment for Candy. And the advertising business is set to deliver another year of strong net bookings growth. At the same time, King will continue to invest in several promising new titles in its pipeline. And although we expect regional play testing for certain titles, similar to Diablo Immortal, our outlook does not include material revenue from these titles. 
In addition, our business units will continue to tap into our portfolio of beloved IP to bring several remastered and reimagined experiences to our players in 2020, which we will announce closer to launch. Bringing all this together, our outlook reflects 5% year-over-year growth in net bookings. We expect Activision to experience the strongest net bookings growth amongst our segments, both in dollar terms and on a percentage basis. We expect solid net bookings growth from Blizzard for the year, and our outlook reflects a flattish performance again, with year-over-year trends improving in the second half of the year. From a margin perspective, our outlook reflects GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin increasing year-over-year. 
Now let's turn to the numbers. On a GAAP basis for 2020, we expect revenues of $6.45 billion, including net deferrals of $275 million. We expect net bookings of $6.73 billion; product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 22%; operating expenses, including software amortization of 50%; and a GAAP-only restructuring charge of approximately $50 million. We expect a GAAP -- a tax rate of 19%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of $778 million and GAAP EPS of $1.85. For 2020, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 23%; operating expenses, including software amortization of 44%. We expect a tax rate of 19% and non-GAAP EPS of $2.22, including net deferrals of $0.13. 
Now let's turn to our Q1 outlook. On a GAAP basis for Q1, we expect revenues of $1.64 billion, including the net recognition of deferrals of $365 million. We expect net bookings of $1.28 billion; product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 21%; operating expenses including software amortization of 48%; and a GAAP-only restructuring charge of approximately $35 million. We expect a tax rate of 17%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 775 million, and GAAP EPS of $0.55. For Q1, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 21%, and operating expenses, including software amortization, of 31%. We expect a tax rate of 17% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.66, which includes the net recognition of deferrals of $0.31. 
In closing, in 2019, we have come a long way in refocusing the business on our biggest franchises and opportunities. The momentum for World of Warcraft, Call of Duty and our new engagement models highlights the growth potential for our broader portfolio of durable, fully owned franchises when we apply our top creative talent and commercial talent against our biggest opportunities. We are encouraged by our 2019 results. And as we return to growth in 2020, the opportunity set for our business across platforms, geographies and business models, has never been greater. Going forward, we will maintain our operating discipline and focus as we execute against a great content lineup this year and a pipeline that includes Overwatch 2, Diablo IV, Diablo Immortal and multiple unannounced initiatives, including several mobile titles. We remain confident that ongoing execution against our plan will position us to deliver growth to our shareholders over the long term.

I think before I touch on Season Pass specifically, it's important that we kind of step back for a second and look at some of the macro changes that we made, and Season Pass was one of them. Our intent was just to create a better overall experience for our player community, and we think we've done that. The first big thing we did was bring in cross play and cross progression, enabling friends who play together no matter what platform they're on. In the case of Modern Warfare, it's just great to see players come back together after so many years of experiencing the franchise in the past. 
Now with Season Pass, it kind of played a similar role, right? So instead of certain portion of the audience having certain content, we're focused now on free content for the entire community to drive engagement with the overall community. And I'd say the last big change that we made was really focusing on the new Battle Pass and item shop system in the game, giving players kind of more transparency to the content thereafter and obviously focusing more on cosmetic content. And I suppose the best way to judge all of it is just what's the player behavior and what's the community saying. And when you look at engagement and you look at daily average unique, our engagement is up significantly year-over-year, and that's really great for us to see so many people enjoying and playing this fantastic game. 
And then on the player investment side, I'd say fans certainly seem to be appreciating the new system quite a bit. We mentioned kind of the growth year-on-year. But one other thing I might add is that we're also seeing increased attach rates in-game to the new system, which I think is a very, very positive sign for us. And for us, this all signals to a really healthy ecosystem within Modern Warfare, one that we think we can build on and create momentum with our community. It's really on us from now to really build great content, which we intend to do for the long haul on this game. A great pipeline of content is coming, starting with season 2 next week, and we have some surprises in store beyond that. 
So I'd say, overall, what we expect is a healthier Call of Duty in 2020 versus the previous year, and we look forward to sharing more in the future. But thanks for the question."

And we'll continue to see some of those trade-offs in Q1. 
But with all that said, when I look forward, I see a number of growth areas with King. First and foremost, is Candy. Candy continues to be an incredibly durable franchise, and we see growth just through the slate of new features, all the services we're releasing, and the in-game events that we hold. More recently, we're also thinking quite a bit about our social features. We've seen that really work in different panels and in different genres. And when I think about how that could be in Candy and the size of Candy, that could be a big unlock for us. 
Another thing that's really I look to for growth is our advertising business. So as you heard, that's really coming along really nicely. And we built a really large and high-margin business, and I see growth there. And then additionally, I see growth in our pipeline. We reset our pipeline recently, and we're starting to see some really good results in our prototypes, and we will start doing some regional testing on some of those this year. So when I put all that together, I look to the medium term and beyond, and I think we have some really good growth opportunities here."

And we think about the WoW community as supporting both even though Classic and Modern are very distinct experiences. And we're committed to kind of continuing to support both of those experiences over the long term. 
Given the content updates for Modern WoW and the cadence that we have for Classic, we exited our year with the subscriber base that was double what it was at the end of Q2. And we also see players remaining engaged in both versions of the game. We launched Visions of N'zoth, which is a content patch for Modern WoW in January. 
Engagement with Classic has been particularly strong in the east, and we see very high levels of player retention there. And our next update for Classic is going to be Phase 3, which is Blackwing Lair. It's one of my favorites. And we're planning on launching that on February 13. 
Concerning Warcraft III: Reforged, honestly, it's been a bit of a hard week. Our community has come to expect really amazing things from us, and we've heard from them that we did not achieve that bar. But we stand behind our games and have consistently shown that not only do we support them, but we continue to build on them even after launch, and we're committed to doing that here as well.

Obviously, we do view a strong balance sheet as a really important strategic asset for the company. And having that gives us considerable flexibility to invest in the business, do buybacks and return capital or pursue M&A",391,"Yes. No, thanks for the question. Obviously, we do view a strong balance sheet as a really important strategic asset for the company. And having that gives us considerable flexibility to invest in the business, do buybacks and return capital or pursue M&A when we see attractive opportunities. And our track record probably somewhat speaks for itself as you look at that over a long period of time. We borrowed, I'd say, very fortuitously to finance our Vivendi transaction and our King transaction and then subsequently paid down that debt. So we paid down more than $4 billion since we financed those transactions and actually have climbed our way up the investment grade ratings grid. And then we've returned, over the last decade, more than -- I guess, around $10 billion of capital back to our shareholders, about $8 billion through share repurchases. And we still do have our $1.5 billion authorization, and then about $2 billion over that time period in dividends, which has increased double digits, I'd say, probably on average over the course of that period. And again, this year with the $0.41 dividend, which we announced today. 
M&A is always something we keep our eye on. And as we have our rate architectures up and we always look at lot of things, but we -- I'd like to think we're pretty disciplined about our process. We do have a pretty rigorous process, and we try to look for a few criteria of things when we are considering it. We're always trying to find great franchises or technology that could add to our portfolio and make our business and our franchise portfolio stronger. We'd like to see a track record of profitability or path to profitability, a strong leadership team that's aligned around growing the business. And then lastly, and this one's been more challenging is finding things in -- at a valuation that makes sense. So it's not easy to find all those things, and so you have to be very disciplined and patient as you think about those inorganic opportunities. 
So that gives you a little bit of an overview in terms of how we've approached it. I think our past track record and philosophy on this is probably the best indicator of how we think about it and how we'll allocate capital in the future."

So as you know, we've been working closely with NetEase on the development of the game, and our goal is to deliver an authentic and deep Diablo experience for mobile.

And the results are encouraging. We're getting ready to move to the next phase of development with some regional alpha testing later this year. Player feedback is invaluable. And as we continue to work on building the game, we'll be looking to that feedback to make sure that we're making really a great Diablo experience. 
When we think about -- when I think about mobile overall for Blizzard, we have our roots in PC gaming. And we're going to continue to be deeply committed to the PC. But we do think there are opportunities for additional experiences and in different ways for players to engage on different kinds of devices. And we see mobile as also a way to attract players that we don't currently reach on PC and console. So we think the mobile opportunity for Blizzard overall is very substantial. And Diablo Immortal will be our first release as a mobile-first game, and we continue to work on multiple mobile initiatives across Blizzard in addition to the PC and console games."

I mean, I'd say, first, as Bobby mentioned earlier today on an interview, we've had a long-standing relationship with Google. It's been great. We are thrilled to formalize that into a deeper partnership over multiple years. And as you said, there's really 2 big pieces to it. The first is on sort of the global IT infrastructure. And then the second is on what really is just a fantastic content platform in YouTube. 
On the first piece, what we have the opportunity to do now is have a more efficient and better delivery of the back-end services and infrastructure handled by a partner where that is their great expertise. And what it allows us to do is it frees up our resources and developers and mind share to focus on what we do best, which is making the content and getting it out into the hands of our players at a faster cadence. That is a great balance of trade for us, and we feel really good about the depth of that partnership and how it will carry us going forward. 
On the content side, on YouTube, there's 200 million game reviewers on YouTube, and it's just a tremendous opportunity to bring our platform to new audiences there. We think not only just in a way that players can experience it today, but with new modes and formats. And also, YouTube is a great on-demand viewing platform, and we think viewers might be increasingly interested in viewing our content that way. There are other pieces to this deal where there's real value, we think, in terms of how we utilize their platforms and how they help us build more reach and engagement in our ecosystem. Not in this deal, and you mentioned it, is Stadia. There's cloud game streaming experiences that are directly to the consumer. We continue to watch with interest and we'll make appropriate assessments as we go forward to figure out our own next steps there. But I think what it points to is just as a last thought, a broader point, which is over the last 2 years, we've been talking about these large technology players that are coming to our space at scale. What we've said is we see this tremendous opportunity as a content provider, to take advantage of where we sit in the space, and this Google deal is an example. It drives a large amount of value for us as we go forward. And we think we're only even better positioned for other partnerships as we take next steps."

Let me start with the last part of your question on the key learnings, and I apologize for being a little redundant on this. But I think a key theme throughout our call is that I think what we learned more anything else is that the market is certainly ready for our franchises on mobile. When we make a great game and kind of stay true to the core tenants of what made the franchise great in the first place, and we execute on that, now we can reach just millions and millions of people around the globe that may have never experienced our franchise before. And that's just -- that's very exciting for us as an organization because that obviously is true not just for just Call of Duty but also for the many great franchises that we have in the organization. 
If I were to turn back and talk about Call of Duty Mobile a little bit, in terms of engagement and retention, like you asked, look, I'd say it's still in the early days, but we've seen a number of encouraging signs. Obviously, the installs at the beginning, which we reported on, have been fantastic. But also in terms of our daily engagement, are looking at our doubts, Mobile hit levels that were multiples higher than any other title in franchise history. So that engagement base is really, really exciting for us to work from. 
Now for us, the content now becomes on the content pipeline to sustain and build on that. In mobile, we have a game and a platform essentially that we want to build on for a really long time to come. So we're hyper-focused on our content pipeline, our monthly, weekly and daily events as they come into the game, to make sure we drive the best possible experience for our player community there. We're in the middle of season 3 right now, and that's tracking really well. And I think what you're going to see is we're learning a lot real time, and the learnings are great. And you'll see us adjusting our content and continuing to make the best possible experience we can for our fans as we move forward in the future. 
So I'd say, right now, we're off to really a nice start and -- that I'm excited about, and we'll be reporting on our progress as we head into the future."

We've really built a durable business here, and it's a high-margin one. And the way I think about it is with our scale of monthly, it really allows us to get the benefit of having such a large audience. As you know, a small fraction of them [ whitespace ] in our in-game economy. So now it's become a needle mover for us. We crossed 150 million in net bookings in 2019. And it's really a testament to a great collaboration between the product teams and the game teams, the advertising team, and really all of them thinking about what's a great player experience and how do we deliver something very differentiated for our advertisers. 
And so when I look to 2020 and beyond, I see continued growth. There are many avenues of that growth. First and foremost, we're going to continue to roll out advertising to more and more of our players. And then I think the teams will continue to innovate there. We already, as I said, have an incredibly differentiated product that advertisers are really attaching to, but we can continue to make it better. A good example of this was in Q4 was some of the -- what we delivered to Sony Pictures on the Jumanji film launch. And there, we not only had our flagship rewarded video product, but we did something truly differentiated in the marketplace, where we put an in-game integration. We put some of the game -- film characters in our game. It was greatly engaging for our players, and it delivered tens of millions of views to Jumanji and it's really moved the needle for them, too. So I think about continuing to move down that journey. And as we do that, we unlock more demand, and we are working pretty closely with our agencies. While we also continue to build our direct sales team and continue to build kind of the infrastructure around it. 
So all in all, I think kind of that strategy that's been working continues to bear fruit for us. And I think there's plenty of growth ahead of us and some good runway."

It's Bobby. When -- I think one of the things that we found with the launch of Call of Duty Mobile, with games like Hearthstone, our designers and developers have gotten a lot more excited about reaching bigger, broader audiences. And we've seen that across the whole company. And so I think what you're going to continue to see is a commitment to innovation on all of our franchises. And that now includes commitment to innovation with mobile devices. And I think that as long as we can deliver new innovative game play with great user experiences on mobile devices, you'll see more franchises taking advantage of that as a platform. 
I think the other thing we've seen is that people want to reach more customers in more countries and especially when you look at some of the things that we're doing in esports. Being able to build these big inclusive communities around the world, and today, our mobile games are played in almost 200 countries. That's been a real catalyst for us to really rethink the way that we're approaching our franchise development. 
So you can expect, as Jay pointed out, obviously, as Humam can attest to, and as we've even seen the Activision business with the success of Call of Duty Mobile, mobile is now our largest platform, and you'll continue to see us with not just mobile touch points, but all the other important touch points that we've now added into the business, expanding the reach of our franchises, the engagement of our franchises and the monetization of our franchises. So we couldn't be more enthusiastic about the prospects that we have going forward. We've talked a little bit about the challenges, which is prioritization of opportunity and making sure that we have the right talent along with those opportunities. But those are challenges we managed for a long time. 
So it's a great question, and I think you can expect that all of our franchises are investing in all of these new opportunities."

Our fourth quarter results exceeded our prior outlook for both revenues and earnings per share.

Our fourth quarter results exceeded our prior outlook for both revenues and earnings per share. As we continue to transform the company, we've remained focused on the delivery of epic entertainment that connects and engages the world. We believe we can do this with greater speed and efficiency while maintaining our long-standing commitment to quality and excellence and providing superior returns to our shareholders. 
We ended the year with over 400 million monthly active users, strong year-over-year engagement, and significant potential in monetization. We're in the privileged position of having a direct digital connection with hundreds of millions of players to whom we deliver some of the world's best professionally produced content. And we have the ability to provide our audiences with a variety of ways to enjoy our content with monetization through subscriptions, premium digital purchases, digital native advertising and a variety of other player investment mechanisms. Each of our large brand franchises as well as our new potential franchises have greater opportunities than ever before. Using Call of Duty as an example, with the introduction of Call of Duty Mobile, we grew our player base from 40 million to 100 million players in less than a year, and we expect significant growth in the Call of Duty franchise in 2020 as compared to 2019 as a result of this and from other unannounced Call of Duty initiatives. Mobile, in fact, is now our leading platform. 
The business model for Call of Duty Mobile is free-to-play, which enables the rapid development of a large community of players, with the option to purchase digital items and services as well as our ability to generate advertising revenues. Franchises like Call of Duty offer advertisers a very difficult to reach target, and today, the ad load is extremely low as we're experimenting with the best advertising solutions for our players and our advertising partners. 
We successfully developed great games for mobile. Our franchises have the power to attract far bigger audiences than previously. We're hard at work on high-quality mobile games for all of our most important franchises. 
And with respect to esports, 2 weeks ago, we debuted the Call of Duty League with 12 city-based teams. Working closely with our experienced team owners and globally recognized sponsors, we're thrilled to celebrate our players and inspire our community with professional Call of Duty esports. And with our new strategic broadcast relationship with YouTube, over 200 million game reviewers now have access to our world-class esports content for both Call of Duty League and Overwatch League. 
Across console, PC, mobile and touch points like esports, the momentum for Call of Duty could not be stronger, and this success illustrates the larger opportunities we have across our diverse and large wholly-owned library of titles dating back to our founding 40 years ago. Having our franchises on all platforms in all geographies with a constant flow of content, and leveraging the additional touch points we have available to us like esports and advertising, continues to be our focus. 
Another great example of our franchise transformation is what happened with Warcraft. We doubled the size of the active World of Warcraft community in the second half of 2019 by adding classic to the WoW subscription offering. The remarkable growth of the WoW community represents an important proof point of the value and potential of our established franchise, and it has energized our development team as we develop new content for all of our key franchises. These franchises form the basis for large, engaged communities of players and spectators, with whom we take our responsibility to deliver high-quality content very seriously. 
Prioritization of opportunity and access to more talent are our challenges, but we are meeting these challenges with improved execution, and we expect to grow audiences, engagement and monetization and provide superior shareholder returns as we have for the last 30 years. 
As a final note, we wanted to acknowledge the tragedy of Kobe Bryant's untimely death. Kobe was a longtime friend of the company, starring masterfully in commercials for Guitar Hero and Call of Duty. He was a tireless supporter of our veteran employment initiatives and always made himself available for all of our veterans events and activities. He will be greatly missed by all of us, and our thoughts and prayers are with his family. 
And now Coddy will review the highlights of our operations with you."

Strong execution in 2019 on our strategy enabled Activision Blizzard to exceed our fourth quarter outlook and enter 2020 with momentum. That momentum was created by the increased investment and focus on the creative and commercial resources",1566,"Thanks, Bobby. Strong execution in 2019 on our strategy enabled Activision Blizzard to exceed our fourth quarter outlook and enter 2020 with momentum. That momentum was created by the increased investment and focus on the creative and commercial resources of our biggest franchises and allowed us to accelerate progress against our 4 key growth pillars. 
In our first growth pillar, driving a consistent cadence of major new content to grow our reach, our expanded Call of Duty development team launched a very successful Modern Warfare, with unit sell through in Q4 increasing by a double-digit percentage versus the prior year across console and PC combined.  And the team followed up with great execution on our second growth pillar, live operations for in-game content, services, features and events to drive engagement and recurring revenues. Modern Warfare's first season of follow-on content rolled out our new, more engaging in-game system, which drove both engagement and net bookings up significantly year-over-year.  Similarly, the World of Warcraft team followed up on the remarkable Q3 launch of WoW Classic with substantial content updates that kept the community engaged and the subscriber base well above pre-Classic levels. 
In Hearthstone, we've seen increased engagement upon the launch of Blizzard's latest expansion and the rollout of the new Battlegrounds games mode in Q4. 
As for our third pillar, extending our acclaimed console and PC franchises to mobile, the October launch of Call of Duty Mobile, one of the most successful in industry history, driving Activision publishing to record monthly active users. It also highlighted the opportunity for our other large franchises to reach hundreds of millions of new players once they expand on the mobile. And finally, as we build and enhance engagement models for our franchises, our advertising business again grew rapidly, and further strengthened our leadership in esports. We expect to build on this momentum in 2020, with each of these pillars driving net bookings growth for the company this year. 
I'll now provide more detail on our Q4 results and recent developments across our franchises. Starting with Activision, Q4 was a fantastic quarter. Monthly active users tripled in Q3 to reach 128 million. Call of Duty continued its leadership on console, with Modern Warfare driving year-on-year sell-through growth and generating more upfront console sales than any other franchise worldwide, a feat the franchise has now accomplished for 10 of the last 11 years. Modern Warfare also saw strong growth in full game downloads, with console and digital mix at almost 50%. And we ended Q4 with the retail channel at its tightest level in many years, positioning us well for ongoing catalog sales in 2020. 
The franchise also expanded its audience on PC, with Q4 PC sell-through on Battle.net growing 50% year-over-year. This growing cross-platform Call of Duty Community received in early December the largest free content offering in franchise history, alongside a new system for player investment. And as a result, Q4 in-game net bookings grew by double-digit percentage year-over-year despite a later launch of the in-game system and despite the removal of Season Pass. We have a second season of Modern Warfare follow-on content launches next week, and the team has more great experiences and surprises in store, both for that season and throughout 2020, which we expect to drive strong in-game net bookings growth year-over-year. And of course, the Call of Duty franchise saw a breakout success in Q4 with the launch of Call of Duty Mobile. The game has received widespread acclaim. And with over $150 million installs, has brought a huge number of new players into the franchise and given existing players a new way to experience Call of Duty. Engagement is strong, which the teams from Activision and Tencent Games Timi Studios intends to sustain for the long-term with a substantial pipeline of features, events and content benefiting from over 15 years of Call of Duty releases.  The title outperformed our net bookings expectations in Q4, ranking in the top 15 grossing games in U.S. app stores. And the third season is already well underway and tracking well. 
So across console, PC, mobile and esports, the Call of Duty franchise has never been better positioned for growth, and there's more to come, including entirely new experiences within the Modern Warfare universe. And then, of course, in Q4 of this year, a new premium Call of Duty release, which is already generating excitement in our play tests. 
Finally, across the Activision portfolio, we are honored to see the team's focus on high-quality, world-class content recognized by the industry at the 2019 Game Awards. Call of Duty Mobile won Mobile Game of the Year. Crash Team Racing won Best Game in the Sports and/or Racing category. And FromSoftware's Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, won Game of the Year. 
Turning to Blizzard. Monthly active users were 32 million in the fourth quarter. World of Warcraft monthly active users were higher sequentially, reflecting the sustained engagement of players following the August launch of WoW Classic, Blizzard's recreation of the original WoW from 15 years ago. As you may remember, in Q3, WoW added more monthly or longer-term subscription plans than in any prior quarter in franchise history. That momentum continued into Q4. Then Blizzard's sustained engagement with robust slate of content for both modern and Classic WoW and exited the year with an active community more than twice the size of its Q2 ending level. A strong cadence of content will continue in 2020 with a great series of in-game releases for Classic and a strong Shadowlands expansion coming from modern WoW in the second half of the year. Shadowlands will have new regions to explore, new ways to customize characters and a revamped leveling system to onboard new players.
Hearthstone, the competitive environment remains intense, but we did see sustained improvement engagements following the release of the Descent of Dragon expansion and the new Battlegrounds auto battler mode in Q4. Q4 net bookings were lower year-over-year, but grew sequentially, and the Hearthstone team continues to iterate quickly. They launched a new game store in December and will release a number of new content and engagement model enhancements in 2020. 
Q4 also saw the launch of Overwatch on Nintendo Switch, further expanding a community that has now surpassed 50 million players since the 2016 launch.   And next weekend, the Overwatch League returns with 20 teams from around the world competing in the home stand format for the first time. Blizzard's teams as you know, are working on their broadest pipeline in its history, including Overwatch 2 and Diablo IV on PC and console. And Diablo Immortal, a mobile game developed in partnership with NetEase, continues to make good progress and will move into the testing phase with its first regional tests planned for the middle of the year. 
Turning to King. Monthly active users were 249 million, increasing 2 million from the third quarter. On a year-over-year basis, we saw declines in web and smaller mobile titles. But importantly, Candy mobile reach was little changed and benefited from growth in King's largest title, Candy Crush Saga. In the second half of 2019, King introduced new initiatives to grow payer conversion, targeting lapsed payers as well as converting new payers into the ecosystem, and these initiatives led to encouraging payer engagement trends in the last 2 quarters. While these initiatives dampened in-game net bookings in Q4 and will continue to do so in Q1, we believe a broader and more engaged payer base positions the franchise for growth over the medium and long term. And even with these actions, Candy Crush Saga remained the top grossing title in the U.S. app stores, and the wider Candy franchise was once again #1. 
King's advertising business grew net bookings over 80% year-over-year, with strong growth in ad-enabled users, volume and pricing. Both direct and indirect sales grew sharply. For the full year, ad net bookings exceeded $150 million, with the business set for robust growth again in 2020. Throughout this year, King will continue to optimize the economy within Candy, launching ongoing features, services and events to drive player engagement and investment. And having previously narrowed its pipeline focused on the highest potential projects, King is investing in several promising new titles, including content based on Activision's beloved catalog IP. Regional testing of some of these new titles will begin in 2020. 
So in conclusion, our strategy to focus on our growth pillars and invest in creative and commercial resources and initiatives of our biggest franchises is delivering results. In 2020, we will continue that focus with the releases and pipeline initiatives highlighted today to further expand our reach, engagement and player investment, and to extend our largest IP across new platforms, geographies and business models. We plan to reach more players on the platforms in more regions than ever before. 
To do so, we'll also further increase investment in our technology capabilities, technology platforms and data analytics. We'll fund these investments with an ongoing focus on efficiency and organizational optimization to leverage our scale across the business. And we know that some of our investments won't bear fruit until next year or later, but we're confident in our growth trajectory this year and our growth plan, and we enter 2020 with momentum. 
I'll now hand the call over to Dennis to discuss our Q4 and full year financial results and outlook. Dennis?"

Today, I will review our Q4 2019 results as well as our outlook for 2020 and the first quarter. 
Q4 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS were ahead of our prior outlook, reflecting better-than-expected results for Call of Duty and World of Warcraft and a lower tax rate. To review the quarter, I'll start with our Q4 segment results. 
Activision revenue was $1.43 billion, led by Call of Duty growth in both upfront and in-game revenues on console and PC and the addition of Call of Duty Mobile. Operating income was $696 million with an operating margin of 49%. As expected, Call of Duty Mobile was not a material contributor to operating income in Q4 despite a great launch as we invested to build our player base and position the title for long-term success. 
Blizzard's revenue was $595 million, lower year-over-year as growth for World of Warcraft and Overwatch was offset by a decline for Hearthstone and Diablo. Operating income was $260 million, with the revenue decline more than offset by lower costs. Blizzard's operating margin was 44%, significantly higher year-over-year due to mix and lower costs. 
King revenue of $503 million was flat sequentially and lower year-over-year, driven primarily by King's actions to prioritize mobile payer engagement in the quarter as well as year-over-year decline in web titles. The ads business grew more than 80% year-over-year. Operating income was $197 million, with an operating margin of 39%, 1 point higher year-over-year, driven by high incremental margins from advertising. Across our segments, in-game net bookings were $1.1 billion. 
Now let's turn to our consolidated results. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be referencing non-GAAP figures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. 
For the quarter, we generated Q4 GAAP revenues of $2.0 billion, $174 million above our November guidance. This includes the net deferrals of $722 million. Net bookings of $2.7 billion were $62 million above our November outlook. We incurred GAAP-only restructuring and related charges of $30 million, and we generated Q4 GAAP EPS of $0.68 and Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $0.62, which was $0.19 above guidance. These figures include the net deferrals of $0.61. 
For the year, we generated GAAP revenues of $6.5 billion. This includes the net recognition of deferrals of $101 million. Net bookings were $6.4 billion. We incurred GAAP-only restructuring and related charges of $137 million, and generated GAAP EPS of $1.95 and non-GAAP EPS of $2.31. These figures include the net recognition of deferrals of $0.06. From a cash flow perspective, our business delivered Q4 operating cash flow of $918 million. Annual operating cash flow was $1.8 billion, higher year-over-year due to lower working capital and cash taxes. Our cash and investments at the end of December was approximately $5.9 billion, and we ended the year with a net cash position of approximately $3.2 billion. 
Turning to capital allocation. We entered 2020 with a strong balance sheet and significant flexibility. As always, we continue to take a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation. And with this in mind, our Board has authorized an 11% increase in our annual dividend to $0.41 per share payable in May. As we look back over the last year, we are pleased with the company's operating discipline, commercial execution and content delivery during a period where we refocused the business and increased investment in key franchises to position us for future growth. 
Now let's look forward to our outlook for 2020. First, regarding our slate and plans for each business unit. 
Activision enters the year with strong momentum for Call of Duty across upfront sales, in-game, mobile and esports. Along with a tight retail channel that should benefit catalog sales, this positions us for strong growth in the franchise, particularly in the first half of the year. In Q4, we plan to launch the next premium release of Call of Duty. We can't wait to unveil what our teams have been working on, and we feel great about the content. Although, as is customary, we are prudently assuming lower sell-in for Q4 versus Modern Warfare this past year. 
Turning to Blizzard, which just last week released Warcraft III: Reforged. Blizzard will build on World of Warcraft momentum with ongoing content for classic and the Shadowlands expansion in the second half of the year. The Hearthstone and Overwatch teams will support their communities with ongoing content and services that drive engagement and player investment. And as Coddy mentioned, Diablo Immortal is planned to enter a regional testing towards the middle of the year, though we don't have any material revenue from that title in our guidance. 
King will continue to release content, features, services and events across its portfolio, with an ongoing focus on optimizing reach, engagement and player investment for Candy. And the advertising business is set to deliver another year of strong net bookings growth. At the same time, King will continue to invest in several promising new titles in its pipeline. And although we expect regional play testing for certain titles, similar to Diablo Immortal, our outlook does not include material revenue from these titles. 
In addition, our business units will continue to tap into our portfolio of beloved IP to bring several remastered and reimagined experiences to our players in 2020, which we will announce closer to launch. Bringing all this together, our outlook reflects 5% year-over-year growth in net bookings. We expect Activision to experience the strongest net bookings growth amongst our segments, both in dollar terms and on a percentage basis. We expect solid net bookings growth from Blizzard for the year, and our outlook reflects a flattish performance at King, with year-over-year trends improving in the second half of the year. From a margin perspective, our outlook reflects GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin increasing year-over-year. 
Now let's turn to the numbers. On a GAAP basis for 2020, we expect revenues of $6.45 billion, including net deferrals of $275 million. We expect net bookings of $6.73 billion; product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 22%; operating expenses, including software amortization of 50%; and a GAAP-only restructuring charge of approximately $50 million. We expect a GAAP -- a tax rate of 19%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of $778 million and GAAP EPS of $1.85. For 2020, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 23%; operating expenses, including software amortization of 44%. We expect a tax rate of 19% and non-GAAP EPS of $2.22, including net deferrals of $0.13. 
Now let's turn to our Q1 outlook. On a GAAP basis for Q1, we expect revenues of $1.64 billion, including the net recognition of deferrals of $365 million. We expect net bookings of $1.28 billion; product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 21%; operating expenses including software amortization of 48%; and a GAAP-only restructuring charge of approximately $35 million. We expect a tax rate of 17%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 775 million, and GAAP EPS of $0.55. For Q1, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 21%, and operating expenses, including software amortization, of 41%. We expect a tax rate of 17% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.66, which includes the net recognition of deferrals of $0.31. 
In closing, in 2019, we have come a long way in refocusing the business on our biggest franchises and opportunities. The momentum for World of Warcraft, Call of Duty and our new engagement models highlights the growth potential for our broader portfolio of durable, fully owned franchises when we apply our top creative talent and commercial talent against our biggest opportunities. We are encouraged by our 2019 results. And as we return to growth in 2020, the opportunity set for our business across platforms, geographies and business models, has never been greater. Going forward, we will maintain our operating discipline and focus as we execute against a great content lineup this year and a pipeline that includes Overwatch 2, Diablo IV, Diablo Immortal and multiple unannounced initiatives, including several mobile titles. We remain confident that ongoing execution against our plan will position us to deliver growth to our shareholders over the long term.

I think before I touch on Season Pass specifically, it's important that we kind of step back for a second and look at some of the macro changes that we made, and Season Pass was one of them. Our intent was just to create a better overall experience for our player community, and we think we've done that. The first big thing we did was bring in cross play and cross progression, enabling friends to play together no matter what platform they're on. In the case of Modern Warfare, it's just great to see players come back together after so many years of experiencing the franchise in the past. 
Now with Season Pass, it kind of played a similar role, right? So instead of certain portion of the audience having certain content, we're focused now on free content for the entire community to drive engagement with the overall community. And I'd say the last big change that we made was really focusing on the new Battle Pass and item shop system in the game, giving players kind of more transparency to the content they are after and obviously focusing more on cosmetic content. And I suppose the best way to judge all of it is just what's the player behavior and what's the community saying. And when you look at engagement and you look at daily average unique, our engagement is up significantly year-over-year, and that's really great for us to see so many people enjoying and playing this fantastic game. 
And then on the player investment side, I'd say fans certainly seem to be appreciating the new system quite a bit. We mentioned kind of the growth year-on-year. But one other thing I might add is that we're also seeing increased attach rates in-game to the new system, which I think is a very, very positive sign for us. And for us, this all signals to a really healthy ecosystem within Modern Warfare, one that we think we can build on and create momentum with our community. It's really on us from now to really build great content, which we intend to do for the long haul on this game. A great pipeline of content is coming, starting with season 2 next week, and we have some surprises in store beyond that. 
So I'd say, overall, what we expect is a healthier Call of Duty in 2020 versus the previous year, and we look forward to sharing more in the future. But thanks for the question."

So overall growth is impacted by some of our smaller titles and the web platform. We also had a number of initiatives more recently in the driving payer conversion and bringing back lapsed payers, and that presented a near-term trade-off, but it's the right thing to do for the medium term and beyond. And we'll continue to see some of those trade-offs in Q1. 
But with all that said, when I look forward, I see a number of growth areas with King. First and foremost, is Candy. Candy continues to be an incredibly durable franchise, and we see growth just through the slate of new features, all the services we're releasing, and the in-game events that we hold. More recently, we're also thinking quite a bit about our social features. We've seen that really work in different panels and in different genres. And when I think about how that could be in Candy and the size of Candy, that could be a big unlock for us. 
Another thing that's really I look to for growth is our advertising business. So as you heard, that's really coming along really nicely. And we built a really large and high-margin business, and I see growth there. And then additionally, I see growth in our pipeline. We reset our pipeline recently, and we're starting to see some really good results in our prototypes, and we will start doing some regional testing on some of those this year. So when I put all that together, I look to the medium term and beyond, and I think we have some really good growth opportunities here."

So as a reminder, when we designed the model for World of Warcraft Classic, it was important that players have a single existing subscription to support both games. And we think about the WoW community as supporting both even though Classic and Modern are very distinct experiences. And we're committed to kind of continuing to support both of those experiences over the long term. 
Given the content updates for Modern WoW and the cadence that we have for Classic, we exited our year with the subscriber base that was double what it was at the end of Q2. And we also see players remaining engaged in both versions of the game. We launched Visions of N'zoth, which is a content patch for Modern WoW in January. 
Engagement with Classic has been particularly strong in the east, and we see very high levels of player retention there. And our next update for Classic is going to be Phase 3, which is Blackwing Lair. It's one of my favorites. And we're planning on launching that on February 13. 
Concerning Warcraft III: Reforged, honestly, it's been a bit of a hard week. Our community has come to expect really amazing things from us, and we've heard from them that we did not achieve that bar. But we stand behind our games and have consistently shown that not only do we support them, but we continue to build on them even after launch, and we're committed to doing that here as well. And so we're going to continue to update the game, and we'll continue to update the community with our plans going forward."

Obviously, we do view a strong balance sheet as a really important strategic asset for the company. And having that gives us considerable flexibility to invest in the business, do buybacks and return capital or pursue M&A when we see attractive opportunities. And our track record probably somewhat speaks for itself as you look at that over a long period of time. We borrowed, I'd say, very fortuitously to finance our Vivendi transaction and our King transaction and then subsequently paid down that debt. So we paid down more than $4 billion since we financed those transactions and actually have climbed our way up the investment grade ratings grid. And then we've returned, over the last decade, more than -- I guess, around $10 billion of capital back to our shareholders, about $8 billion through share repurchases. And we still do have our $1.5 billion authorization, and then about $2 billion over that time period in dividends, which has increased double digits, I'd say, probably on average over the course of that period. And again, this year with the $0.41 dividend, which we announced today. 
M&A is always something we keep our eye on. And as we have our radar detectors up and we always look at lot of things, but we -- I'd like to think we're pretty disciplined about our process. We do have a pretty rigorous process, and we try to look for a few criteria of things when we are considering it. We're always trying to find great franchises or technology that could add to our portfolio and make our business and our franchise portfolio stronger. We'd like to see a track record of profitability or path to profitability, a strong leadership team that's aligned around growing the business. And then lastly, and this one's been more challenging is finding things in -- at a valuation that makes sense. So it's not easy to find all those things, and so you have to be very disciplined and patient as you think about those inorganic opportunities. 
So that gives you a little bit of an overview in terms of how we've approached it. I think our past track record and philosophy on this is probably the best indicator of how we think about it and how we'll allocate capital in the future."

And as we continue to work on building the game, we'll be looking to that feedback to make sure that we're making really a great Diablo experience. 
When we think about -- when I think about mobile overall for Blizzard, we have our roots in PC gaming. And we're going to continue to be deeply committed to the PC. But we do think there are opportunities for additional experiences and in different ways for players to engage on different kinds of devices. And we see mobile as also a way to attract players that we don't currently reach on PC and console. So we think the mobile opportunity for Blizzard overall is very substantial. And Diablo Immortal will be our first release as a mobile-first game, and we continue to work on multiple mobile initiatives across Blizzard in addition to the PC and console games."

I mean, I'd say, first, as Bobby mentioned earlier today on an interview, we've had a long-standing relationship with Google. It's been great. We are thrilled to formalize that into a deeper partnership over multiple years. And as you said, there's really 2 big pieces to it. The first is on sort of the global IT infrastructure. And then the second is on what really is just a fantastic content platform in YouTube. 
On the first piece, what we have the opportunity to do now is have a more efficient and better delivery of the back-end services and infrastructure handled by a partner where that is their great expertise. And what it allows us to do is it frees up our resources and developers and mind share to focus on what we do best, which is making the content and getting it out into the hands of our players at a faster cadence. That is a great balance of trade for us, and we feel really good about the depth of that partnership and how it will carry us going forward. 
On the content side, on YouTube, there's 200 million game reviewers on YouTube, and it's just a tremendous opportunity to bring our platform to new audiences there. We think not only just in a way that players can experience it today, but with new modes and formats. And also, YouTube is a great on-demand viewing platform, and we think viewers might be increasingly interested in viewing our content that way. There are other pieces to this deal where there's real value, we think, in terms of how we utilize their platforms and how they help us build more reach and engagement in our ecosystem. Not in this deal, and you mentioned it, is Stadia. There's cloud game streaming experiences that are directly to the consumer. We continue to watch with interest and we'll make appropriate assessments as we go forward to figure out our own next steps there. But I think what it points to is just as a last thought, a broader point, which is over the last 2 years, we've been talking about these large technology players that are coming to our space at scale. What we've said is we see this tremendous opportunity as a content provider, to take advantage of where we sit in the space, and this Google deal is an example. It drives a large amount of value for us as we go forward. And we think we're only even better positioned for other partnerships as we take next steps."

Let me start with the last part of your question on the key learnings, and I apologize for being a little redundant on this. But I think a key theme throughout our call is that I think what we learned more than anything else is that the market is certainly ready for our franchises on mobile. When we make a great game and kind of stay true to the core tenets of what made the franchise great in the first place, and we execute on that, now we can reach just millions and millions of people around the globe that may have never experienced our franchise before. And that's just -- that's very exciting for us as an organization because that obviously is true not just for just Call of Duty but also for the many great franchises that we have in the organization. 
If I were to turn back and talk about Call of Duty Mobile a little bit, in terms of engagement and retention, like you asked, look, I'd say it's still in the early days, but we've seen a number of encouraging signs. Obviously, the installs at the beginning, which we reported on, have been fantastic. But also in terms of our daily engagement, are looking at our DAUs, Mobile hit levels that were multiples higher than any other title in franchise history. So that engagement base is really, really exciting for us to work from. 
Now for us, the content now becomes on the content pipeline to sustain and build on that. In mobile, we have a game and a platform essentially that we want to build on for a really long time to come. So we're hyper-focused on our content pipeline, our monthly, weekly and daily events as they come into the game, to make sure we drive the best possible experience for our player community there. We're in the middle of season 3 right now, and that's tracking really well. And I think what you're going to see is we're learning a lot real time, and the learnings are great. And you'll see us adjusting our content and continuing to make the best possible experience we can for our fans as we move forward in the future. 
So I'd say, right now, we're off to really a nice start and -- that I'm excited about, and we'll be reporting on our progress as we head into the future."

We've really built a durable business here, and it's a high-margin one. And the way I think about it is with our scale of monthly, it really allows us to get the benefit of having such a large audience. As you know, a small fraction of them want space in our in-game economy. So now it's become a needle mover for us. We crossed 150 million in net bookings in 2019. And it's really a testament to a great collaboration between the product teams and the game teams, the advertising team, and really all of them thinking about what's a great player experience and how do we deliver something very differentiated for our advertisers. 
And so when I look to 2020 and beyond, I see continued growth. There are many avenues of that growth. First and foremost, we're going to continue to roll out advertising to more and more of our players. And then I think the teams will continue to innovate there. We already, as I said, have an incredibly differentiated product that advertisers are really attaching to, but we can continue to make it better. A good example of this was in Q4 was some of the -- what we delivered to Sony Pictures on the Jumanji film launch. And there, we not only had our flagship rewarded video product, but we did something truly differentiated in the marketplace, where we put an in-game integration. We put some of the game -- film characters in our game. It was greatly engaging for our players, and it delivered tens of millions of views to Jumanji and it's really moved the needle for them, too. So I think about continuing to move down that journey. And as we do that, we unlock more demand, and we are working very closely with our agencies. While we also continue to build our direct sales team and continue to build kind of the infrastructure around it. 
So all in all, I think kind of that strategy that's been working continues to bear fruit for us. And I think there's plenty of growth ahead of us and some good runway."

It's Bobby. When -- I think one of the things that we found with the launch of Call of Duty Mobile, with games like Hearthstone, our designers and developers have gotten a lot more excited about reaching bigger, broader audiences. And we've seen that across the whole company. And so I think what you're going to continue to see is a commitment to innovation on all of our franchises. And that now includes commitment to innovation with mobile devices. And I think that as long as we can deliver new innovative game play with great user experiences on mobile devices, you'll see more franchises taking advantage of that as a platform. 
I think the other thing we've seen is that people want to reach more customers in more countries and especially when you look at some of the things that we're doing in esports. Being able to build these big inclusive communities around the world, and today, our mobile games are played in almost 200 countries. That's been a real catalyst for us to really rethink the way that we're approaching our franchise development. 
So you can expect, as Jay pointed out, obviously, as Humam can attest to, and as we've even seen the Activision business with the success of Call of Duty Mobile, mobile is now our largest platform, and you'll continue to see us with not just mobile touch points, but all the other important touch points that we've now added into the business, expanding the reach of our franchises, the engagement of our franchises and the monetization of our franchises. So we couldn't be more enthusiastic about the prospects that we have going forward. We've talked a little bit about the challenges, which is prioritization of opportunity and making sure that we have the right talent aligned with those opportunities. But those are challenges we managed for a long time. 
So it's a great question, and I think you can expect that all of our franchises are investing in all of these new opportunities."

Our fourth quarter results exceeded our prior outlook for both revenues and earnings per share.

Our fourth quarter results exceeded our prior outlook for both revenues and earnings per share. As we continue to transform the company, we've remained focused on the delivery of epic entertainment that connects and engages the world. We believe we can do this with greater speed and efficiency while maintaining our long-standing commitment to quality and excellence and providing superior returns to our shareholders. 
We ended the year with over 400 million monthly active users, strong year-over-year engagement, and significant potential in monetization. We're in the privileged position of having a direct digital connection with hundreds of millions of players to whom we deliver some of the world's best professionally produced content. And we have the ability to provide our audiences with a variety of ways to enjoy our content with monetization through subscriptions, premium digital purchases, digital native advertising and a variety of other player investment mechanisms. Each of our large brand franchises as well as our new potential franchises have greater opportunities than ever before. Using Call of Duty as an example, with the introduction of Call of Duty Mobile, we grew our player base from 40 million to 100 million players in less than a year, and we expect significant growth in the Call of Duty franchise in 2020 as compared to 2019 as a result of this and from other unannounced Call of Duty initiatives. Mobile, in fact, is now our leading platform. 
The business model for Call of Duty Mobile is free-to-play, which enables the rapid development of a large community of players, with the option to purchase digital items and services as well as our ability to generate advertising revenues. Franchises like Call of Duty offer advertisers a very difficult to reach target, and today, the ad load is extremely low as we're experimenting with the best advertising solutions for our players and our advertising partners. 
We successfully developed great games for mobile. Our franchises have the power to attract far bigger audiences than previously. We're hard at work on high-quality mobile games for all of our most important franchises. 
And with respect to esports, 2 weeks ago, we debuted the Call of Duty League with 12 city-based teams. Working closely with our experienced team owners and globally recognized sponsors, we're thrilled to celebrate our players and inspire our community with professional Call of Duty esports. And with our new strategic broadcast relationship with YouTube, over 200 million game reviewers now have access to our world-class esports content for both Call of Duty League and Overwatch League. 
Across console, PC, mobile and touch points like esports, the momentum for Call of Duty could not be stronger, and this success illustrates the larger opportunities we have across our diverse and large wholly-owned library of titles dating back to our founding 40 years ago. Having our franchises on all platforms in all geographies with a constant flow of content, and leveraging the additional touch points we have available to us like esports and advertising, continues to be our focus. 
Another great example of our franchise transformation is what happened with Warcraft. We doubled the size of the active World of Warcraft community in the second half of 2019 by adding classic to the WoW subscription offering. The remarkable growth of the WoW community represents an important proof point of the value and potential of our established franchise, and it has energized our development team as we develop new content for all of our key franchises. These franchises form the basis for large, engaged communities of players and spectators, with whom we take our responsibility to deliver high-quality content very seriously. 
Prioritization of opportunity and access to more talent are our challenges, but we are meeting these challenges with improved execution, and we expect to grow audiences, engagement and monetization and provide superior shareholder returns as we have for the last 30 years. 
As a final note, we wanted to acknowledge the tragedy of Kobe Bryant's untimely death. Kobe was a longtime friend of the company, starring masterfully in commercials for Guitar Hero and Call of Duty. He was a tireless supporter of our veteran employment initiatives and always made himself available for all of our veterans events and activities. He will be greatly missed by all of us, and our thoughts and prayers are with his family. 
And now Coddy will review the highlights of our operations with you."

Strong execution in 2019 on our strategy enabled Activision Blizzard to exceed our fourth quarter outlook and enter 2020 with momentum. That momentum was created by the increased investment and focus on the creative and commercial resources",1566,"Thanks, Bobby. Strong execution in 2019 on our strategy enabled Activision Blizzard to exceed our fourth quarter outlook and enter 2020 with momentum. That momentum was created by the increased investment and focus on the creative and commercial resources of our biggest franchises and allowed us to accelerate progress against our 4 key growth pillars. 
In our first growth pillar, driving a consistent cadence of major new content to grow our reach, our expanded Call of Duty development team launched a very successful Modern Warfare, with unit sell through in Q4 increasing by a double-digit percentage versus the prior year across console and PC combined.  And the team followed up with great execution on our second growth pillar, live operations for in-game content, services, features and events to drive engagement and recurring revenues. Modern Warfare's first season of follow-on content rolled out our new, more engaging in-game system, which drove both engagement and net bookings up significantly year-over-year.  Similarly, the World of Warcraft team followed up on the remarkable Q3 launch of WoW Classic with substantial content updates that kept the community engaged and the subscriber base well above pre-Classic levels. 
In Hearthstone, we've seen increased engagement upon the launch of Blizzard's latest expansion and the rollout of the new Battlegrounds games mode in Q4. 
As for our third pillar, extending our acclaimed console and PC franchises to mobile, the October launch of Call of Duty Mobile, one of the most successful in industry history, driving Activision publishing to record monthly active users. It also highlighted the opportunity for our other large franchises to reach hundreds of millions of new players once they expand on the mobile. And finally, as we build and enhance engagement models for our franchises, our advertising business again grew rapidly, and further strengthened our leadership in esports. We expect to build on this momentum in 2020, with each of these pillars driving net bookings growth for the company this year. 
I'll now provide more detail on our Q4 results and recent developments across our franchises. Starting with Activision, Q4 was a fantastic quarter. Monthly active users tripled in Q3 to reach 128 million. Call of Duty continued its leadership on console, with Modern Warfare driving year-on-year sell-through growth and generating more upfront console sales than any other franchise worldwide, a feat the franchise has now accomplished for 10 of the last 11 years. Modern Warfare also saw strong growth in full game downloads, with console and digital mix at almost 50%. And we ended Q4 with the retail channel at its tightest level in many years, positioning us well for ongoing catalog sales in 2020. 
The franchise also expanded its audience on PC, with Q4 PC sell-through on Battle.net growing 50% year-over-year. This growing cross-platform Call of Duty Community received in early December the largest free content offering in franchise history, alongside a new system for player investment. And as a result, Q4 in-game net bookings grew by double-digit percentage year-over-year despite a later launch of the in-game system and despite the removal of Season Pass. We have a second season of Modern Warfare follow-on content launches next week, and the team has more great experiences and surprises in store, both for that season and throughout 2020, which we expect to drive strong in-game net bookings growth year-over-year. And of course, the Call of Duty franchise saw a breakout success in Q4 with the launch of Call of Duty Mobile. The game has received widespread acclaim. And with over $150 million installs, has brought a huge number of new players into the franchise and given existing players a new way to experience Call of Duty. Engagement is strong, which the teams from Activision and Tencent Games Timi Studios intends to sustain for the long-term with a substantial pipeline of features, events and content benefiting from over 15 years of Call of Duty releases.  The title outperformed our net bookings expectations in Q4, ranking in the top 15 grossing games in U.S. app stores. And the third season is already well underway and tracking well. 
So across console, PC, mobile and esports, the Call of Duty franchise has never been better positioned for growth, and there's more to come, including entirely new experiences within the Modern Warfare universe. And then, of course, in Q4 of this year, a new premium Call of Duty release, which is already generating excitement in our play tests. 
Finally, across the Activision portfolio, we are honored to see the team's focus on high-quality, world-class content recognized by the industry at the 2019 Game Awards. Call of Duty Mobile won Mobile Game of the Year. Crash Team Racing won Best Game in the Sports and/or Racing category. And FromSoftware's Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, won Game of the Year. 
Turning to Blizzard. Monthly active users were 32 million in the fourth quarter. World of Warcraft monthly active users were higher sequentially, reflecting the sustained engagement of players following the August launch of WoW Classic, Blizzard's recreation of the original WoW from 15 years ago. As you may remember, in Q3, WoW added more monthly or longer-term subscription plans than in any prior quarter in franchise history. That momentum continued into Q4. Then Blizzard's sustained engagement with robust slate of content for both modern and Classic WoW and exited the year with an active community more than twice the size of its Q2 ending level. A strong cadence of content will continue in 2020 with a great series of in-game releases for Classic and a strong Shadowlands expansion coming from modern WoW in the second half of the year. Shadowlands will have new regions to explore, new ways to customize characters and a revamped leveling system to onboard new players.
Hearthstone, the competitive environment remains intense, but we did see sustained improvement engagements following the release of the Descent of Dragon expansion and the new Battlegrounds auto battler mode in Q4. Q4 net bookings were lower year-over-year, but grew sequentially, and the Hearthstone team continues to iterate quickly. They launched a new game store in December and will release a number of new content and engagement model enhancements in 2020. 
Q4 also saw the launch of Overwatch on Nintendo Switch, further expanding a community that has now surpassed 50 million players since the 2016 launch.   And next weekend, the Overwatch League returns with 20 teams from around the world competing in the home stand format for the first time. Blizzard's teams as you know, are working on their broadest pipeline in its history, including Overwatch 2 and Diablo IV on PC and console. And Diablo Immortal, a mobile game developed in partnership with NetEase, continues to make good progress and will move into the testing phase with its first regional tests planned for the middle of the year. 
Turning to King. Monthly active users were 249 million, increasing 2 million from the third quarter. On a year-over-year basis, we saw declines in web and smaller mobile titles. But importantly, Candy mobile reach was little changed and benefited from growth in King's largest title, Candy Crush Saga. In the second half of 2019, King introduced new initiatives to grow payer conversion, targeting lapsed payers as well as converting new payers into the ecosystem, and these initiatives led to encouraging payer engagement trends in the last 2 quarters. While these initiatives dampened in-game net bookings in Q4 and will continue to do so in Q1, we believe a broader and more engaged payer base positions the franchise for growth over the medium and long term. And even with these actions, Candy Crush Saga remained the top grossing title in the U.S. app stores, and the wider Candy franchise was once again #1. 
King's advertising business grew net bookings over 80% year-over-year, with strong growth in ad-enabled users, volume and pricing. Both direct and indirect sales grew sharply. For the full year, ad net bookings exceeded $150 million, with the business set for robust growth again in 2020. Throughout this year, King will continue to optimize the economy within Candy, launching ongoing features, services and events to drive player engagement and investment. And having previously narrowed its pipeline focused on the highest potential projects, King is investing in several promising new titles, including content based on Activision's beloved catalog IP. Regional testing of some of these new titles will begin in 2020. 
So in conclusion, our strategy to focus on our growth pillars and invest in creative and commercial resources and initiatives of our biggest franchises is delivering results. In 2020, we will continue that focus with the releases and pipeline initiatives highlighted today to further expand our reach, engagement and player investment, and to extend our largest IP across new platforms, geographies and business models. We plan to reach more players on the platforms in more regions than ever before. 
To do so, we'll also further increase investment in our technology capabilities, technology platforms and data analytics. We'll fund these investments with an ongoing focus on efficiency and organizational optimization to leverage our scale across the business. And we know that some of our investments won't bear fruit until next year or later, but we're confident in our growth trajectory this year and our growth plan, and we enter 2020 with momentum. 
I'll now hand the call over to Dennis to discuss our Q4 and full year financial results and outlook. Dennis?"

Today, I will review our Q4 2019 results as well as our outlook for 2020 and the first quarter.

Today, I will review our Q4 2019 results as well as our outlook for 2020 and the first quarter. 
Q4 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS were ahead of our prior outlook, reflecting better-than-expected results for Call of Duty and World of Warcraft and a lower tax rate. To review the quarter, I'll start with our Q4 segment results. 
Activision revenue was $1.43 billion, led by Call of Duty growth in both upfront and in-game revenues on console and PC and the addition of Call of Duty Mobile. Operating income was $696 million with an operating margin of 49%. As expected, Call of Duty Mobile was not a material contributor to operating income in Q4 despite a great launch as we invested to build our player base and position the title for long-term success. 
Blizzard's revenue was $595 million, lower year-over-year as growth for World of Warcraft and Overwatch was offset by a decline for Hearthstone and Diablo. Operating income was $260 million, with the revenue decline more than offset by lower costs. Blizzard's operating margin was 44%, significantly higher year-over-year due to mix and lower costs. 
King revenue of $503 million was flat sequentially and lower year-over-year, driven primarily by King's actions to prioritize mobile payer engagement in the quarter as well as year-over-year decline in web titles. The ads business grew more than 80% year-over-year. Operating income was $197 million, with an operating margin of 39%, 1 point higher year-over-year, driven by high incremental margins from advertising. Across our segments, in-game net bookings were $1.1 billion. 
Now let's turn to our consolidated results. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be referencing non-GAAP figures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. 
For the quarter, we generated Q4 GAAP revenues of $2.0 billion, $174 million above our November guidance. This includes the net deferrals of $722 million. Net bookings of $2.7 billion were $62 million above our November outlook. We incurred GAAP-only restructuring and related charges of $30 million, and we generated Q4 GAAP EPS of $0.68 and Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $0.62, which was $0.19 above guidance. These figures include the net deferrals of $0.61. 
For the year, we generated GAAP revenues of $6.5 billion. This includes the net recognition of deferrals of $101 million. Net bookings were $6.4 billion. We incurred GAAP-only restructuring and related charges of $137 million, and generated GAAP EPS of $1.95 and non-GAAP EPS of $2.31. These figures include the net recognition of deferrals of $0.06. From a cash flow perspective, our business delivered Q4 operating cash flow of $918 million. Annual operating cash flow was $1.8 billion, higher year-over-year due to lower working capital and cash taxes. Our cash and investments at the end of December was approximately $5.9 billion, and we ended the year with a net cash position of approximately $3.2 billion. 
Turning to capital allocation. We entered 2020 with a strong balance sheet and significant flexibility. As always, we continue to take a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation. And with this in mind, our Board has authorized an 11% increase in our annual dividend to $0.41 per share payable in May. As we look back over the last year, we are pleased with the company's operating discipline, commercial execution and content delivery during a period where we refocused the business and increased investment in key franchises to position us for future growth. 
Now let's look forward to our outlook for 2020. First, regarding our slate and plans for each business unit. 
Activision enters the year with strong momentum for Call of Duty across upfront sales, in-game, mobile and esports. Along with a tight retail channel that should benefit catalog sales, this positions us for strong growth in the franchise, particularly in the first half of the year. In Q4, we plan to launch the next premium release of Call of Duty. We can't wait to unveil what our teams have been working on, and we feel great about the content. Although, as is customary, we are prudently assuming lower sell-in for Q4 versus Modern Warfare this past year. 
Turning to Blizzard, which just last week released Warcraft III: Reforged. Blizzard will build on World of Warcraft momentum with ongoing content for classic and the Shadowlands expansion in the second half of the year. The Hearthstone and Overwatch teams will support their communities with ongoing content and services that drive engagement and player investment. And as Coddy mentioned, Diablo Immortal is planned to enter a regional testing towards the middle of the year, though we don't have any material revenue from that title in our guidance. 
King will continue to release content, features, services and events across its portfolio, with an ongoing focus on optimizing reach, engagement and player investment for Candy. And the advertising business is set to deliver another year of strong net bookings growth. At the same time, King will continue to invest in several promising new titles in its pipeline. And although we expect regional play testing for certain titles, similar to Diablo Immortal, our outlook does not include material revenue from these titles. 
In addition, our business units will continue to tap into our portfolio of beloved IP to bring several remastered and reimagined experiences to our players in 2020, which we will announce closer to launch. Bringing all this together, our outlook reflects 5% year-over-year growth in net bookings. We expect Activision to experience the strongest net bookings growth amongst our segments, both in dollar terms and on a percentage basis. We expect solid net bookings growth from Blizzard for the year, and our outlook reflects a flattish performance at King, with year-over-year trends improving in the second half of the year. From a margin perspective, our outlook reflects GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin increasing year-over-year. 
Now let's turn to the numbers. On a GAAP basis for 2020, we expect revenues of $6.45 billion, including net deferrals of $275 million. We expect net bookings of $6.73 billion; product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 22%; operating expenses, including software amortization of 50%; and a GAAP-only restructuring charge of approximately $50 million. We expect a GAAP -- a tax rate of 19%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of $778 million and GAAP EPS of $1.85. For 2020, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 23%; operating expenses, including software amortization of 44%. We expect a tax rate of 19% and non-GAAP EPS of $2.22, including net deferrals of $0.13. 
Now let's turn to our Q1 outlook. On a GAAP basis for Q1, we expect revenues of $1.64 billion, including the net recognition of deferrals of $365 million. We expect net bookings of $1.28 billion; product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 21%; operating expenses including software amortization of 48%; and a GAAP-only restructuring charge of approximately $35 million. We expect a tax rate of 17%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 775 million, and GAAP EPS of $0.55. For Q1, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 21%, and operating expenses, including software amortization, of 41%. We expect a tax rate of 17% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.66, which includes the net recognition of deferrals of $0.31. 
In closing, in 2019, we have come a long way in refocusing the business on our biggest franchises and opportunities. The momentum for World of Warcraft, Call of Duty and our new engagement models highlights the growth potential for our broader portfolio of durable, fully owned franchises when we apply our top creative talent and commercial talent against our biggest opportunities. We are encouraged by our 2019 results. And as we return to growth in 2020, the opportunity set for our business across platforms, geographies and business models, has never been greater. Going forward, we will maintain our operating discipline and focus as we execute against a great content lineup this year and a pipeline that includes Overwatch 2, Diablo IV, Diablo Immortal and multiple unannounced initiatives, including several mobile titles. We remain confident that ongoing execution against our plan will position us to deliver growth to our shareholders over the long term.

I think before I touch on Season Pass specifically, it's important that we kind of step back for a second and look at some of the macro changes that we made, and Season Pass was one of them. Our intent was just to create a better overall experience for our player community, and we think we've done that. The first big thing we did was bring in cross play and cross progression, enabling friends to play together no matter what platform they're on. In the case of Modern Warfare, it's just great to see players come back together after so many years of experiencing the franchise in the past. 
Now with Season Pass, it kind of played a similar role, right? So instead of certain portion of the audience having certain content, we're focused now on free content for the entire community to drive engagement with the overall community. And I'd say the last big change that we made was really focusing on the new Battle Pass and item shop system in the game, giving players kind of more transparency to the content they are after and obviously focusing more on cosmetic content. And I suppose the best way to judge all of it is just what's the player behavior and what's the community saying. And when you look at engagement and you look at daily average unique, our engagement is up significantly year-over-year, and that's really great for us to see so many people enjoying and playing this fantastic game. 
And then on the player investment side, I'd say fans certainly seem to be appreciating the new system quite a bit. We mentioned kind of the growth year-on-year. But one other thing I might add is that we're also seeing increased attach rates in-game to the new system, which I think is a very, very positive sign for us. And for us, this all signals to a really healthy ecosystem within Modern Warfare, one that we think we can build on and create momentum with our community. It's really on us from now to really build great content, which we intend to do for the long haul on this game. A great pipeline of content is coming, starting with season 2 next week, and we have some surprises in store beyond that. 
So I'd say, overall, what we expect is a healthier Call of Duty in 2020 versus the previous year, and we look forward to sharing more in the future. But thanks for the question."

So overall growth is impacted by some of our smaller titles and the web platform. We also had a number of initiatives more recently in the driving payer conversion and bringing back lapsed payers, and that presented a near-term trade-off, but it's the right thing to do for the medium term and beyond. And we'll continue to see some of those trade-offs in Q1. 
But with all that said, when I look forward, I see a number of growth areas with King. First and foremost, is Candy. Candy continues to be an incredibly durable franchise, and we see growth just through the slate of new features, all the services we're releasing, and the in-game events that we hold. More recently, we're also thinking quite a bit about our social features. We've seen that really work in different panels and in different genres. And when I think about how that could be in Candy and the size of Candy, that could be a big unlock for us. 
Another thing that's really I look to for growth is our advertising business. So as you heard, that's really coming along really nicely. And we built a really large and high-margin business, and I see growth there. And then additionally, I see growth in our pipeline. We reset our pipeline recently, and we're starting to see some really good results in our prototypes, and we will start doing some regional testing on some of those this year. So when I put all that together, I look to the medium term and beyond, and I think we have some really good growth opportunities here."

So as a reminder, when we designed the model for World of Warcraft Classic, it was important that players have a single existing subscription to support both games. And we think about the WoW community as supporting both even though Classic and Modern are very distinct experiences. And we're committed to kind of continuing to support both of those experiences over the long term. 
Given the content updates for Modern WoW and the cadence that we have for Classic, we exited our year with the subscriber base that was double what it was at the end of Q2. And we also see players remaining engaged in both versions of the game. We launched Visions of N'zoth, which is a content patch for Modern WoW in January. 
Engagement with Classic has been particularly strong in the east, and we see very high levels of player retention there. And our next update for Classic is going to be Phase 3, which is Blackwing Lair. It's one of my favorites. And we're planning on launching that on February 13. 
Concerning Warcraft III: Reforged, honestly, it's been a bit of a hard week. Our community has come to expect really amazing things from us, and we've heard from them that we did not achieve that bar. But we stand behind our games and have consistently shown that not only do we support them, but we continue to build on them even after launch, and we're committed to doing that here as well. And so we're going to continue to update the game, and we'll continue to update the community with our plans going forward."

Obviously, we do view a strong balance sheet as a really important strategic asset for the company. And having that gives us considerable flexibility to invest in the business, do buybacks and return capital or pursue M&A when we see attractive opportunities. And our track record probably somewhat speaks for itself as you look at that over a long period of time. We borrowed, I'd say, very fortuitously to finance our Vivendi transaction and our King transaction and then subsequently paid down that debt. So we paid down more than $4 billion since we financed those transactions and actually have climbed our way up the investment grade ratings grid. And then we've returned, over the last decade, more than -- I guess, around $10 billion of capital back to our shareholders, about $8 billion through share repurchases. And we still do have our $1.5 billion authorization, and then about $2 billion over that time period in dividends, which has increased double digits, I'd say, probably on average over the course of that period. And again, this year with the $0.41 dividend, which we announced today. 
M&A is always something we keep our eye on. And as we have our radar detectors up and we always look at lot of things, but we -- I'd like to think we're pretty disciplined about our process. We do have a pretty rigorous process, and we try to look for a few criteria of things when we are considering it. We're always trying to find great franchises or technology that could add to our portfolio and make our business and our franchise portfolio stronger. We'd like to see a track record of profitability or path to profitability, a strong leadership team that's aligned around growing the business. And then lastly, and this one's been more challenging is finding things in -- at a valuation that makes sense. So it's not easy to find all those things, and so you have to be very disciplined and patient as you think about those inorganic opportunities. 
So that gives you a little bit of an overview in terms of how we've approached it. I think our past track record and philosophy on this is probably the best indicator of how we think about it and how we'll allocate capital in the future."

And as we continue to work on building the game, we'll be looking to that feedback to make sure that we're making really a great Diablo experience. 
When we think about -- when I think about mobile overall for Blizzard, we have our roots in PC gaming. And we're going to continue to be deeply committed to the PC. But we do think there are opportunities for additional experiences and in different ways for players to engage on different kinds of devices. And we see mobile as also a way to attract players that we don't currently reach on PC and console. So we think the mobile opportunity for Blizzard overall is very substantial.

I mean, I'd say, first, as Bobby mentioned earlier today on an interview, we've had a long-standing relationship with Google. It's been great. We are thrilled to formalize that into a deeper partnership over multiple years. And as you said, there's really 2 big pieces to it. The first is on sort of the global IT infrastructure. And then the second is on what really is just a fantastic content platform in YouTube. 
On the first piece, what we have the opportunity to do now is have a more efficient and better delivery of the back-end services and infrastructure handled by a partner where that is their great expertise. And what it allows us to do is it frees up our resources and developers and mind share to focus on what we do best, which is making the content and getting it out into the hands of our players at a faster cadence. That is a great balance of trade for us, and we feel really good about the depth of that partnership and how it will carry us going forward. 
On the content side, on YouTube, there's 200 million game reviewers on YouTube, and it's just a tremendous opportunity to bring our platform to new audiences there. We think not only just in a way that players can experience it today, but with new modes and formats. And also, YouTube is a great on-demand viewing platform, and we think viewers might be increasingly interested in viewing our content that way. There are other pieces to this deal where there's real value, we think, in terms of how we utilize their platforms and how they help us build more reach and engagement in our ecosystem. Not in this deal, and you mentioned it, is Stadia. There's cloud game streaming experiences that are directly to the consumer. We continue to watch with interest and we'll make appropriate assessments as we go forward to figure out our own next steps there. But I think what it points to is just as a last thought, a broader point, which is over the last 2 years, we've been talking about these large technology players that are coming to our space at scale. What we've said is we see this tremendous opportunity as a content provider, to take advantage of where we sit in the space, and this Google deal is an example. It drives a large amount of value for us as we go forward. And we think we're only even better positioned for other partnerships as we take next steps."

Thanks for the question. Let me start with the last part of your question on the key learnings, and I apologize for being a little redundant on this.

Let me start with the last part of your question on the key learnings, and I apologize for being a little redundant on this. But I think a key theme throughout our call is that I think what we learned more than anything else is that the market is certainly ready for our franchises on mobile. When we make a great game and kind of stay true to the core tenets of what made the franchise great in the first place, and we execute on that, now we can reach just millions and millions of people around the globe that may have never experienced our franchise before. And that's just -- that's very exciting for us as an organization because that obviously is true not just for just Call of Duty but also for the many great franchises that we have in the organization. 
If I were to turn back and talk about Call of Duty Mobile a little bit, in terms of engagement and retention, like you asked, look, I'd say it's still in the early days, but we've seen a number of encouraging signs. Obviously, the installs at the beginning, which we reported on, have been fantastic. But also in terms of our daily engagement, are looking at our DAUs, Mobile hit levels that were multiples higher than any other title in franchise history. So that engagement base is really, really exciting for us to work from. 
Now for us, the content now becomes on the content pipeline to sustain and build on that. In mobile, we have a game and a platform essentially that we want to build on for a really long time to come. So we're hyper-focused on our content pipeline, our monthly, weekly and daily events as they come into the game, to make sure we drive the best possible experience for our player community there. We're in the middle of season 3 right now, and that's tracking really well. And I think what you're going to see is we're learning a lot real time, and the learnings are great. And you'll see us adjusting our content and continuing to make the best possible experience we can for our fans as we move forward in the future. 
So I'd say, right now, we're off to really a nice start and -- that I'm excited about, and we'll be reporting on our progress as we head into the future."

We've really built a durable business here, and it's a high-margin one. And the way I think about it is with our scale of monthly, it really allows us to get the benefit of having such a large audience. As you know, a small fraction of them want space in our in-game economy. So now it's become a needle mover for us. We crossed 150 million in net bookings in 2019. And it's really a testament to a great collaboration between the product teams and the game teams, the advertising team, and really all of them thinking about what's a great player experience and how do we deliver something very differentiated for our advertisers. 
And so when I look to 2020 and beyond, I see continued growth. There are many avenues of that growth. First and foremost, we're going to continue to roll out advertising to more and more of our players. And then I think the teams will continue to innovate there. We already, as I said, have an incredibly differentiated product that advertisers are really attaching to, but we can continue to make it better. A good example of this was in Q4 was some of the -- what we delivered to Sony Pictures on the Jumanji film launch. And there, we not only had our flagship rewarded video product, but we did something truly differentiated in the marketplace, where we put an in-game integration. We put some of the game -- film characters in our game. It was greatly engaging for our players, and it delivered tens of millions of views to Jumanji and it's really moved the needle for them, too. So I think about continuing to move down that journey. And as we do that, we unlock more demand, and we are working very closely with our agencies. While we also continue to build our direct sales team and continue to build kind of the infrastructure around it. 
So all in all, I think kind of that strategy that's been working continues to bear fruit for us. And I think there's plenty of growth ahead of us and some good runway."

It's Bobby. When -- I think one of the things that we found with the launch of Call of Duty Mobile, with games like Hearthstone, our designers and developers have gotten a lot more excited about reaching bigger, broader audiences. And we've seen that across the whole company. And so I think what you're going to continue to see is a commitment to innovation on all of our franchises. And that now includes commitment to innovation with mobile devices. And I think that as long as we can deliver new innovative game play with great user experiences on mobile devices, you'll see more franchises taking advantage of that as a platform. 
I think the other thing we've seen is that people want to reach more customers in more countries and especially when you look at some of the things that we're doing in esports. Being able to build these big inclusive communities around the world, and today, our mobile games are played in almost 200 countries. That's been a real catalyst for us to really rethink the way that we're approaching our franchise development. 
So you can expect, as Jay pointed out, obviously, as Humam can attest to, and as we've even seen the Activision business with the success of Call of Duty Mobile, mobile is now our largest platform, and you'll continue to see us with not just mobile touch points, but all the other important touch points that we've now added into the business, expanding the reach of our franchises, the engagement of our franchises and the monetization of our franchises. So we couldn't be more enthusiastic about the prospects that we have going forward. We've talked a little bit about the challenges, which is prioritization of opportunity and making sure that we have the right talent aligned with those opportunities. But those are challenges we managed for a long time. 
So it's a great question, and I think you can expect that all of our franchises are investing in all of these new opportunities."

Let me first convey our sympathies to those who have suffered during this difficult time. While very few of our own team members have contracted COVID-19, a number of our employees have been impacted by the illness and the passing of family members. Our thoughts and prayers are with them and everyone else affected by the pandemic. 
Finally, I've been awestruck during the last 2 months by the strength of our employees and their families, managing through unprecedented challenges from health care to child care. Our teams around the world have shown ingenuity and incredible resilience. And even faced with so many difficulties, our employees still ensured that the joy, the social connection and the unexpected benefits of gaming as a way to keep our 400 million players around the world connected and engaged and safely at home has continued without interruption. 
Our employees and their families have shown incredible empathy for those affected by the pandemic in their communities and across the world. They've organized meal deliveries, care for the elderly, even the use of their own 3D printers to create high-quality facial protection for their colleagues. Our teams have shown unwavering support for the first responders, nurses, doctors and medical professionals working tirelessly in unimaginable conditions. Our corporate social responsibility initiatives have been expanded to support programs to provide health care professionals with a variety of resources, including faster, more effective testing and the use of tools like convalescent blood transfusion as a possible method of immunization. We've also increased our direct support for military families by millions of dollars. 
Through our team's dedication and incredibly hard work under very difficult circumstances, we delivered results significantly above our outlook for the first quarter, and this momentum will likely continue for the second quarter. I've conducted almost 100 earnings calls and none was under a backdrop of so much uncertainty for the future. Our mission to connect and engage the world through epic entertainment has never been more meaningful than it is today. At a time when so many forms of social interactions and entertainment experiences have been shut down, we're providing entertainment with positive impact for hundreds of millions of people through our games. Our content and connecting members of our communities around the world is critically important. 
Our development and commercial teams quickly adapted to this new work environment, and as of now, we're on track to deliver compelling new content, including the World of Warcraft Shadowlands expansion and the next premium Call of Duty release, both of which are planned for the second half of the year. Our esports organization as quickly pivoted to remote production and continues to deliver live esports for both the Call of Duty League and the Overwatch league, a direct result of the hard work and flexibility of our team owners and our sponsors. 
In the face of unprecedented circumstances, our extraordinary teams also delivered extremely strong first quarter financial results. We significantly exceeded our outlook for both revenue and earnings per share. We reached new highs for first quarter net bookings across each of mobile, console and PC, and we exited the quarter with accelerating engagement and momentum across the business as people around the world turn to our content for entertainment and connection. 
Performance in the quarter was led by Call of Duty, which is achieving tremendous scale and momentum across platforms, geographies and business models. Following industry-leading launches for Call of Duty Mobile and Modern Warfare in the fourth quarter of 2019, the franchise raised the bar even higher with the launch of Warzone in March. With a free-to-play business model and cross-platform play, Warzone expanded Modern Warfare's reach, engagement and player investment. Warzone to date has brought in over 50 million players since its launch. 
The exceptional results for Call of Duty reflect our team's remarkable execution as they innovate and take on new commercial challenges to grow and better serve our community. Their success demonstrates that free-to-play experiences across mobile console and PC not only extend the reach of a franchise but can also lead to strong in-game monetization and sales of premium content. Call of Duty success highlights the great potential across our portfolio as we continue to focus on extending our fully owned intellectual property to new platforms, new geographies and new business models. 
Blizzard also recorded strong growth in the first quarter, led by World of Warcraft. After doubling in the second half of 2019, the WoW active community grew further in Q1. Blizzard is seeing strong increases in engagement across our franchises as people around the world stay home, adding to business momentum as our game teams execute against the strongest pipeline of content in Blizzard's history. 
At King, Candy Crush was again the top grossing game franchise across U.S. app stores with engagement increasing sharply towards the end of the quarter. To enable our community to play even more as a part of the stay-at-home initiative, in late March, King offered unlimited free lives across many of their titles, resulting in the number of game rounds played in a single day, shattering all prior records. Momentum continued to increase in April with strong year-over-year growth in reach, engagement and player investment. 
As we build on our strong first quarter results and our continuing momentum, I'm excited to introduce our new President and Chief Operating Officer, Daniel Alegre. From his long tenure at Google, Daniel brings deep experience building direct digital relationships with consumers, fostering strategic relationships with key industry partners and driving rapid growth internationally and in early-stage businesses. His expertise and commitment to excellence and execution will be his focus. 
I'd also like to thank Coddy Johnson for his extraordinary contributions to the continued success of the company during his 12-year tenure and for being a truly, truly valued friend. 
Of course, our strong business performance wouldn't be possible without the efforts of our dedicated, talented and truly empathic teams around the world. We are so grateful for the work we're doing under extremely challenging circumstances. We're also appreciative of the continued support of our shareholders, partners and players, and we wish you and your families health and safety through what remains a difficult time. And now Daniel will review the highlights of our operations with you."

I'm really proud to be part of a company so deeply connected to its mission during this really challenging time. I want to start by first expressing my deepest sympathies to all those affected by the health crisis and expressing thanks on behalf of the entire company to all those on the front lines of the battle against the COVID pandemic. I would also like to thank our employees for their commitment to our players and to each other, particularly under such a unique and difficult environment we are currently living in. 
But before I discuss our recent operational highlights, I'd like to share with you my focus and priorities. They are simple: execution, execution and execution. We have great franchises, and we will get back to what we are known for: superb execution. 
As Bobby said, the health and safety of our employees and their families remains our priority. I'd like to expand on the measures we are taking to keep our employees and their families safe and address our expectations for our development pipeline for the remainder of the year. All our offices had moved to work from home environments by mid-March, and we are fortunate to have had very few cases of COVID-19 across the company. Now we are ensuring our employees and their family members are receiving the best possible care, and we're covering all costs of testing and treatment for affected employees and their families. We have increased access to telehealth resources and contracted private doctors and medical support in regions where employees live and work. We have had additional services to our already best-in-class health benefits and ensured that employees have access to the mental and physical well-being and support they need well at home. And we are continuing to find other ways to support our employees and their families, including services to help families balance work and home life. 
Now turning to development. The digital nature of our content means our creative talent can continue to work on our product pipeline from home. Although the shift to remote working does add complexity and challenges in some areas of the game development process, including creative collaboration, motion capture, voice over work, localization and quality assurance, we are implementing mitigation measures to each and to address each of these areas. 
Importantly, based on the work to date, we still expect to deliver a robust slate of content over the remainder of the year. This includes the next premium release of Call of Duty, 2 titles based on library IP from Activision; the World of Warcraft Shadowlands expansion; regional testing for new mobile titles; and ongoing live operations across our key franchises. 
Regardless of location, our teams remain focused on executing against our 4 strategic growth pillars, as Bobby has laid out: first, delivering a strong, consistent cadence of major new content releases; second, driving live operations with ongoing in-game content, services, features and events; third, expanding King's industry-leading mobile success and extending our acclaimed console and PC franchises to mobile; and finally, building new engagement models around our franchises, including advertising, esports and consumer products. Now more than ever, players new and existing are looking for connection through Epic Entertainment. And our mission is to make that available to them in whatever form they find most convenient. 
Now turning to our first quarter results. We significantly exceeded our outlook driven primarily by overperformance for Call of Duty Modern Warfare throughout the quarter, including a highly successful start for our new free-to-play Call of Duty: Warzone. We also continued -- saw continued momentum for World of Warcraft and better-than-expected results for other key franchises in the second half of March as populations sheltering at home in many of our key regions turned to our content for entertainment and social connection. These trends have continued so far in the second quarter with business performance accelerating further in April. 
Now starting with Activision, now has more than doubled over the prior year, reaching $102 million as Call of Duty delivered remarkable growth across multiple vectors. As we've discussed on prior calls, we made significant changes with the launch of Call of Duty Modern Warfare to enhance the player experience, expand the community and deepen engagement. We added cross-platform play, introduced a new in-game content system and removed the season pass to keep our players closer together. Modern Warfare entered the year with strong momentum, achieving substantial year-over-year growth in engagement, premium game sales and in-game net bookings in both January and February. 
And the launch of Warzone on console and PC on March 10 really took the franchise to new highs. Warzone is a massive free-to-play experience, where up to 150 players compete in a range of modes on a vast map, featuring cross play and in-game system entirely integrated with the Modern Warfare battle pass.  Warzone adds yet more compelling content for our modern warfare community and also enables an entirely new set of players around the world to experience Call of Duty for free. This response has been incredible. Warzone has brought in more than 60 million players since the launch, including many on the PC platform and in countries beyond Call of Duty's traditional regions. We are seeing the free-to-play experience driving strong incremental sales on the premium Modern Warfare title, adding to its sales momentum entering the year and rising demand from stay and home conditions. 
Modern Warfare sell-through in Q1 was the highest ever for a call of duty title outside of the launch quarter. Life to date, Modern Warfare has sold through more units and has more players than any prior Call of Duty title at this point after its release. Warzone also contributed to a further acceleration in Modern Warfare's in-game net bookings which more than doubled year-over-year versus the prior game in Q1 and even with the removal of the season pass. And this momentum has only strengthened. The third season of in-game content launched in April and is Call of Duty's best-performing to date for both engagement and player investment. 
With the new free-to-play experience contributing to a massively expanded audience, unprecedented momentum in premium game sales and robust in-game growth, we expect Modern Warfare's net bookings this year to be the highest for a Call of Duty game in the year after launch. And looking ahead, the next premium release for Call of Duty already looks great and remains on track for release later this year. 
On the mobile platform, the Call of Duty Mobile team continued to build on last October's breakout launch with new content, features and events aimed at optimizing engagement, retention and player investment. The team started to deliver an accelerated cadence of content in March, launching new seasonal events every 4 weeks, twice as frequently as previously. The combination of increasingly compelling content and events and stay-at-home dynamics drove the growth in reach and engagement in March, and player investment has followed with April's season 5 delivering the highest monthly in-game net bookings since season 1. With deep engagement, substantial content in the pipeline and opportunities to further refine the in-game system, we expect Call of Duty Mobile to be an increasing contributor over time. 
Q1 also saw the launch of the inaugural season of the professional Call of Duty League. Originally planned in a local city-based home stand format, we quickly pivoted all matches to online play and remote production for the remainder of the regular season to keep our players and fans safe while still delivering premium esports content to a global audience. With the Call of Duty demonstrating the power of our franchise model across platforms, geographies and business model and premium content on track for the fall, we really couldn't be more excited about the growth trajectory for 2020 and beyond. 
Now turning to Blizzard. MAUs were 32 million in Q1 with each of Blizzard's key franchises experiencing a month-on-month increase in reach in March.  World of Warcraft continued its strong momentum in the quarter as the team continued to deliver more content between expansions than ever before. Having doubled its active community in the second half of last year, the number of players on monthly or longer-term subscription plans increased further in Q1. Reach and engagement were particularly strong as regions introduced shelter at home measures through the quarter with momentum increasing further in April. The community continues to engage deeply in classic, a recreation of our original WoW from 15 years ago, which has delivered substantial content drops in recent months and has much more to come later in the year. Reach and engagement also increased for modern WoW, which again received a major content drop in Q1. And this increased activity drove accelerating presales of Shadowlands, the next expansion for WoW, which is slated for the second half of the year. 
Hearthstone continued to deliver improved engagement trends in the first quarter, driven by the launch of the new Battlegrounds auto battler in November and strong execution in live operations. Overwatch also experienced a meaningful increase in engagement in March as its latest seasonal event coincided with stay-at-home effects. And fans continue to engage with the franchise through the Overwatch league, which successfully moved to online play and remote production during the quarter. And finally, Diablo Immortal is shaping up very well. We remain on track to begin regional testing for the game in the middle of the year. 
At King, MAUs were 273 million increasing 10% from the fourth quarter. MAUs grew month-on-month in January and February and then accelerated further in March as shelter in home conditions came into effect. King's key franchises -- franchise Candy Crush grew MAUs year-over-year in each month of the quarter with double-digit growth in March. And within the Candy franchise, the community played more rounds of games in any quarter since the 2016 acquisition. Now in terms of player investment, Candy Crush Saga remained the top grossing title across U.S. app stores and the wider Candy franchise was once again #1. 
We previously discussed King's initiatives to bring back lapsed payers and attract new payers into the ecosystem, positioning the business for stronger growth over the medium and long term. And as expected, these initiatives dampened in-game net bookings again in Q1, but they contributed to ongoing improvement in payer trends in January and February, the for payers numbers -- payer numbers stepped up further in both March and April. And with strengthening engagement and payer trends, we've seen King's in-game net bookings grow by low double-digit percentage year-over-year April. 
While we saw improving trends in King's in-game business, which represents a significant majority of the segment's net bookings, the advertising business slowed towards the end of the quarter. Advertising grew over 75% year-over-year for the first quarter then moderated a bit in April against the backdrop of a sudden decline in demand across the digital advertising sector, albeit still growing over 20% year-on-year in April. While we assume the environment will remain challenging, we do expect growth for the full year as we roll out more ads to more players, enhance our infrastructure to deliver the highest value adds to each player and broaden both our base of advertisers and demand partners. 
I also note that the combination of King's strong in-game trends in the current situation in the ad market is creating more opportunities for the business to cost effectively bring players into the network, expanding its audience and further boosting its MAU trajectory. The same is true across our other business units. 
So in summary, we entered the year with strong momentum in some of our biggest franchises, which only increased further through the quarter.

Today, I will review our Q1 2020 results as well as our outlook for 2020 and the second quarter. But before I start, I'd just like to echo Daniel and Bobby's sentiments about the unique environment we're in and share my sincerest sympathies to those who have been affected directly by it as well as my thanks and gratitude to all our teams and employees who have so seamlessly transitioned into this new work environment we find ourselves in. 
Our digitally native business model, both on the production and the distribution side of our business, makes us well positioned to deliver world-class content and experiences for our players. Our teams take our mission and our responsibility to deliver fun and social engagement to our players in this tough time very seriously. They really didn't miss a beat during all this transition, and you can see the strong results of those efforts in our Q1 results and increased full year guidance. 
Our first quarter revenue and earnings were well ahead of our prior outlook primarily driven by our investment in creative and commercial initiatives for Call of Duty delivering better-than-expected results throughout the quarter. In addition, World of Warcraft continued to overdeliver, and other key franchises and catalog sales also exceeded our outlook, benefiting from stronger demand towards the end of the quarter as consumers sheltered at home in many of our key regions. 
To review the quarter, I will start with our segment results. Activision revenue was $519 million, growing 64% year-over-year. Growth was driven by Call of Duty Modern Warfare and Warzone in-game revenues, strong game sales of premium Modern Warfare and the addition of Call of Duty Mobile. Operating income was $184 million with an operating margin of 35%, 12 percentage points higher year-over-year. Blizzard revenue was $452 million, increasing 31% year-over-year, reflecting strong growth for World of Warcraft and the release of Warcraft III Reforged in the quarter. Operating income was $197 million. Blizzard's operating margin was 44%, significantly higher year-over-year, primarily due to strong revenue growth. King's revenue of $498 million was roughly flat sequentially and lower year-over-year, driven primarily by King's actions to prioritize mobile payer engagement in the quarter. The ads business grew over 75% year-over-year. Operating income was $156 million with an operating margin of 31%, lower than a year ago due to lower revenues and higher operating expenses as King made disciplined investments in expanding its player network. Across our segments, in-game net bookings grew 20% year-over-year to $956 million. 
Now let's turn to our overall consolidated results. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be referencing non-GAAP figures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP non-GAAP reconciliations. 
For the quarter, we generated Q1 GAAP revenues of $1.79 billion, $148 million above our February guidance. This includes the net recognition of deferrals of $266 million. Net bookings of $1.52 billion were $247 million above our February outlook. We incurred GAAP-only restructuring and related charges of $23 million, and we generated Q1 GAAP EPS of $0.65 and Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $0.76, which was $0.10 above guidance. These figures include the net recognition of deferrals of $0.18. 
In terms of cash flow, the increasingly digital, recurring and cash-generative nature of our business remains one of our fundamental strengths. This powers a strong balance sheet, which continues to be an important strategic asset for the company, especially now. In Q1, we delivered operating cash flow of $148 million, lower year-over-year despite higher operating income due to cash payments for tax settlements and working capital timing. Our cash and investments at the end of March were approximately $6 billion, and we ended the quarter with a net cash position of approximately $3.3 billion. And as previously announced, this week, we will pay an annual dividend of $0.41 per share, 11% higher year-over-year. 
Now let's turn to our outlook for Q2 and the full year. In Q2, Activision plans to deliver 2 seasons of in-game content for Modern Warfare and Warzone versus 1 season in the first quarter. Season 3 has already launched very successfully in April. Activision also released Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 remastered on PC and Xbox One following the PS4 release in late Q1, and they plan to continue delivering new features, events and seasons for Call of Duty Mobile. In April, Blizzard launched its latest Hearthstone expansion, Ashes of Outland, and through the quarter, we'll continue to support other key franchises with Indian content. And King will continue to deliver innovative features, events and Live Ops across its portfolio. 
Turning to the second half of the year. Our planned slate includes new Call of Duty premium title, 2 releases based on our extensive library of IP from Activision and Blizzard's Shadowlands expansion for World of Warcraft. We will also continue to deliver in-game experiences for our other key franchises across our portfolio, and we continue to expect to begin regional play testing for Diablo Immortal and certain other mobile titles, although as discussed last quarter, we don't include any material revenue from these new mobile titles in our guidance. 
Before I discuss the specifics of our outlook, I'll provide some context. The full extent of the impact of the pandemic on our financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to fully predict at this time. While we have seen a positive impact on demand, there are also risks related to global economic weakness, rising unemployment, pressures on retail channel, pricing and other factors where we have limited visibility currently. We have tried to be prudent in our guidance to account for these effects, and we believe there is a potential for overperformance if these risks do not materialize. 
Now the addition of the Warzone free-to-play experience has further increased the reach, engagement and player investment in Call of Duty, building on existing strength for Modern Warfare and creating a strong foundation for future financial performance. As discussed, we are also seeing increased demand for our other franchises as interest in gaming grows. 
The current environment creates the potential for a structural opportunity to bring more players into our communities who we can then engage and retain for the long term and to accelerate the continuing shift towards digital sales in our business. We have attempted to be conservative in our assumptions around the impact of these trends beyond the second quarter, but the backdrop does create greater potential for operating overperformance later this year. 
Since we provided our initial guidance in February, the strengthening dollar has resulted in an additional FX headwind to full year net bookings of approximately $100 million, and the combination of FX and lower interest income from declining interest rates represent, in aggregate, approximately $0.08 of headwind to our full year GAAP and non-GAAP EPS versus our prior outlook. Overall, though, with strong momentum across the business, we are raising our outlook for net bookings, revenue and EPS for the year. And in the case of EPS, we are raising by an amount greater than our first quarter over performance despite the FX and interest rate headwinds I just described. 
Now let me get into specifics. For Q2, on a GAAP basis, we now expect revenues of $1.69 billion, including the net recognition of deferrals of $15 million. We expect net bookings of $1.68 billion; product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 19%; and operating expenses including software amortization of 48%; and a GAAP-only restructuring charge of approximately $20 million. We expect a tax rate of 21%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 776 million and EPS of $0.54. For Q2 on a non-GAAP basis, we now expect product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 19% and operating expenses, including software amortization, of 43%. We expect a tax rate of 19% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.64, including net deferrals of $0.01. On a GAAP basis for 2020, we now expect revenues of $6.8 billion, including net deferrals of $100 million. We now expect net bookings of $6.9 billion for the year; product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 19%; operating expenses, including software amortization of 48%; and a GAAP-only restructuring charge of approximately $50 million. We now expect a GAAP tax rate of 20%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 778 million and GAAP EPS of $2.22. For 2020, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 20%; and operating expenses, including software amortization, of 42%. We expect a tax rate of 19% and non-GAAP EPS of $2.62, including the net recognition of deferrals of $0.02. 
So in closing, our business has accelerating momentum from the dual tailwinds of strong execution in our largest franchises following last year's investments and increased development capacity and expanded reach and engagement as people turn to our interactive content as they shelter at home. We are humbled that so many people are turning to our content for solace, joy and connection in this challenging time, and we'll continue to stay focused on delivering the high-quality experiences that they have come to expect from us. Now Bobby, Daniel and our business leaders, Rob, Humam and Jay, and I are happy to answer your questions. Operator?"

I think the short answer to the question is that Warzone has definitely been accretive to the franchise. And it's become and it is a really important part of the overall franchise ecosystem that we're creating. And I think it's worth just talking about that a bit. Since the last few calls, we've been discussing, bringing our community together through a number of player-focused initiatives, and that started with cross plays, so all the friends can just get together no matter what platform you're on. It was about the free content to our community at the same time. And it was about kind of the new deterministic content system we put in the game. And of course, in the backdrop here, you have Modern Warfare, which has been just a fantastic game that gets better over time. And then what we really did is amplified all this with the launch of Warzone, our massive scale experience. And when you look at Warzone, it was definitely built to provide endless fun on its own and to stand on its own as a great game, but Warzone and Modern Warfare are also obviously connected in many ways, including through shared progression systems, game systems and content offerings. And what we're seeing right now in Warzone is a large number of players choosing to upgrade to the premium Modern Warfare game and experience everything that the Modern Warfare universe has offered. And so far, the number of upgrades to premium that we're seeing are definitely above our initial expectations, and that's really great to see. And also, across this universe, Modern Warfare universe, from an engagement perspective, we're also seeing franchise highs now in daily average unique players, peak and current players and overall player investment has been indicated on the call so far. So regarding the future of Warzone, we know how much the community is loving it. I mean, how much they're enjoying the experience so far. So we're going to continue to invest in this significantly in terms of content events, new modes, new ways to play and really just a ton more in the future. 
And to follow-up on the last part of your question, I think what I would say is, yes, we believe it has the potential to positively impact future premium games as well, and so we're excited about that opportunity. And before I jump off, I would also just like to thank all our Activision publishing, development teams and all our employees for keeping all of our critical projects on track. This shift to work from home has been a massive logistical exercise across the organization, and the teams have done just an outstanding job, and I just wanted to close this question by a big thank you to them. But again, Mario, thanks for the question. I appreciate it."

Clearly, it's obviously a scenario we'd all love to see, which is life returning to back to normal as soon as possible. But the reality is that we really don't know what that new normal will look like once that comes to pass. It does seem like that there is a likelihood that even once shelter at home ends, that there may be -- it may be a fair amount of time before people are really returning to normal as we know it. So we do think that there is potentially an acceleration to the structural change that we've seen in consumer entertainment, consumption patterns that we've already been seen in gaming, and that trend could persist for the long term, which would obviously benefit social -- yet socially distant categories like gaming. We've already seen this with the younger generation of consumers where gaming is more an integrated part of their social and entertainment fabric. And times like these will make that activity, we believe, even more mainstream. We're obviously trying to lean into this and welcome as many players into our ecosystem as possible and bring more gamers into our communities and give them a compelling experience that hopefully turns them into long-term fans. 
We don't really have any great data points right now on what happens to consumption when people return from shelter at home. But we have seen in Asia that the strong momentum continues even as they started to transition back. So we hope that's a sign of the similar opportunity we may have in other parts of the world as they start to return to normal as well. So generally speaking, we think there's a pretty big opportunity here to see an acceleration in the long-term structural shifts that we've already seen from the existing heightened engagement. But as usual, we're always trying to be prudent in how we model that because we know there are still so many unknowns at this time."

Thank you for the question. Before I answer, I would like to take a step back and just say, we're really thankful that our games are able to play a part in helping bring people together during what's really an unprecedented and challenging time for us all. World of Warcraft is a very -- it's been fortunate to be able to engineer it as a very social experience, and that's as true today as the day we launched. Over time, we listened to feedback from the community, and the game has evolved to what we now call the modern game, which has really expanded the breadth and the depth of game play as well as making it easier to kind of find friends, group up, make progress or play alone, all within the social environment. At the same time, we've seen a lot of good work and returning experience where players are turning to the classic WoW experience. So today, we think about World of Warcraft as a single community under one subscription where players can enjoy both WoW classic and modern wow, and we released a steady stream of content for both. In a variety of different experiences, that has always been a strength of the game, and it's been good to see players resonate -- that resonate with players as they see a lot of what they're looking for in World of Warcraft. We've seen particularly strong engagement with classic in the East, and the momentum has continued in those regions even as they have started to come back to work. And we saw Western subscribers grow in March, driven by players returning to modern primarily, and this has contributed to strong presales for Shadowlands. The momentum we saw in March across both modes continues with active community growing faster than it ever has and that outside of an expansion launch period. 
On the development side, our teams have done a really good job in shifting to work from home. We're able to welcome select players into the closed off for Shadowlands last month. And thanks to the hard work of the team, Shadowlands is on track to launch in Q4 this year. 
And lastly, before I hand off the call -- and I'll hand off to the next question, I really want to thank all the -- during this difficult time. It's been really amazing to kind of see everyone come together in a positive way."

Thanks so much for the question. So we exited 2019, as you heard, with strong momentum in the ads business, and that's continued in Q1 where we saw in the quarter that we delivered over 75% year-on-year growth. And as you mentioned in",542,"Doug, this is Humam. Thanks so much for the question. So we exited 2019, as you heard, with strong momentum in the ads business, and that's continued in Q1 where we saw in the quarter that we delivered over 75% year-on-year growth. And as you mentioned in the question, we saw deceleration towards the end of March within the broader advertising ecosystem, but the business did grow 20% year-on-year in April or over 20% in April. 
So let me answer your question by talking a little bit of what we're doing is going forward. I think about the things that we're already doing and what not to continue. And that's about rolling out more ads to more players, broadening our advertiser base and working with more partners as we continue to build our tech infrastructure. But now we're actually increasing some focus areas that we see as kind of in the short and medium term will provide opportunities. So we're going to the brand advertisers and doubling down on the relationships in those sectors that aren't experiencing slowdowns, and they are experiencing actually sustained demand for their products. So the team is quite active there. We're also starting to leverage quite a bit of advertiser interest and very differentiated products like the sponsorship product that we have, which was new to our ecosystem and seeing some very nice advertiser interest, and that really amplifies the value proposition of the King network in this environment. And then we are rolling out a new technology in our games, and that's become the focus. That allows us to really optimize our demand and get higher CPMs for the ads that we are showing. And that's been a focus in this quarter and continues to be for the year. 
So if you add that, plus you look at our network, which is truly global and international, what we're doing is we're looking at it as a pretty diversified set of opportunities. So when regions are starting to experience some recovery before others, we focus our efforts there as the opportunity may sit geographically in some places at a certain point in time. So with all of that, my expectation is that the advertising business does deliver growth this year. 
On your point on acquisition costs, that's the flip side of this. So what we're seeing is while we see that some advertisers are  [indiscernible] at King are seeing an opportunity to bring new players more efficiently than our network. And you couple that with a very different approach, it's good for us for the medium and long term. So when we do that, of course, that reinforces kind of both the app side of the house, the game business and the advertising number as we continue to invest in the network. 
So yes, again, kind of to echo a lot of what my colleagues have said, and before I hand back to the operator, I just want to tell the King team and the employees [indiscernible] came -- were really not missed the beat as we have experienced something quite remarkable in going to work from home pretty quickly. And so a big thanks from me for the team and the incredible work that they're doing."

Obviously, we're in kind of uncharted waters, and there's not really any present for what's going on right now in the economy, which definitely makes us cautious and careful maybe more so than normal. Relatively speaking, however, we do feel pretty good about the value proposition of our content even in tough times. There's not great past precedents, obviously, for where we are. But you can look at least back to the past 2 market dislocations in 2001 and 2008 for at least some directional indication of how gaming has performed in challenging economic times. And what we've seen is the consumer recreational spending in the U.S., for example, was fairly resilient during those downturns. And if you hone in a little more specifically on entertainment, the global gaming industry, gaming industry fared extremely well and actually grew low to mid-single digits in these time periods, whereas broader consumer recreational spending declined low single digits and that we think that's driven by the low cost per hour of gaming, which makes it a great value versus other forms of entertainment. And so if you compare that to the situation we're in now, where other forms of location-based entertainment, like going to movies, concerts, sporting events, whatever those may be, and they may not be available for some time for consumers for some period of time, this may also drive some share shift to gaming from those other categories. And thankfully, in contrast to other forms of media, we're very fortunate that the digital nature of our business enables us to not only distribute content remotely but to produce it remotely. So obviously an advantage for us to keep our content fresh. 
Another point is in those past recessions in 2001 and 2008, gaming has come a long way since then. Obviously, it's much more social and more connected and more mainstream, and our business is much more diversified, too, across platforms, geographies, types of games, which is helpful when times get challenging. On the flip side, there obviously are more freeways for players to play games than there have been. So there could be more engagement with slightly weaker monetization. But in the long term, we kind of view that as an opportunity as well because that usually normalizes itself. So I'd say there's puts and takes across the spectrum, but -- which is why with all this uncertainty in the economy, we tried to reflect these risks as we think about forecasting the business. But the strong momentum we're seeing gives us, obviously, confidence in raising our outlook even with this challenging backdrop."

And if you look at some of the metrics over the last 6 months, that you've seen Q4 and both in Q1, we've crossed over 100 million MAUs and dramatically increasing our player base. And a lot of that has been driven by Mobile and Warzone, of course, as is the ongoing success of Modern Warfare driving that. But through Mobile and Warzone, we're definitely reaching new audiences in new geographies in ways that we just haven't before. And as I look at Call of Duty right now, it's more global today than at any point in time in its history in terms of audience profile, and that's pretty exciting for us to see. 
So a little bit on your question on engagement. And for us, when it comes to engagement, what we've seen really time and time again is that engagement just tends to drive engagement. And so for us, exposure on what platform is driving engagement across other platform and other experiences, so we actually like to see that cross over a lot. And in terms of the investment part of your question, that also is looking additive to us across this ecosystem as well. In the previous question, I talked about Warzone and how we're seeing that as being accretive to the franchise overall. And with respect to CoD Mobile, then specifically, when you take a look at it, we're seeing really great momentum there. It was referenced earlier that season 5 just concluded, it's our best-performing season in terms of engagement and in-game performance since the first season. And Season 6 just launched on May 1. And so that's off to a really strong start as well. So for me, when I look at it, I see the positive trends on mobile as a platform but coming at a time we're having record engagement and record performance across console and PC. And to me, that's a pretty clear indication that what we're seeing on Call of Duty mobile is delivering incremental results for the franchise as well. So the ecosystem, the way we're looking at right now seems to be working incredibly well. 
And in terms of mobile, in terms of our strategy, it remains a critical part of our overall plans going forward and a key investment area for us. And just speaking of the ecosystem, I'd probably just close by, obviously, a very exciting time for everyone on the franchise right now. And our teams are hyper-focused and passionately focused, most importantly, on delivering great new content and seasons and games to our growing community around the world that we're seeing right now. And I guess I would just close by saying we could be more thankful for the incredible and growing community that we're seeing out there around the world for their trust and support, and we look forward to everything that's to come in the future. So thanks for the question."

But so far, and based on what we can see and with true ingenuity and creativity from the teams, we're managing through this as best as we can. And what's really important is we just need to continue to provide our communities with the innovative content and features that they love and that they want to keep playing. So that's why I said in my prepared remarks that we're currently still on track to deliver our key content in the second half of this year, and my primary focus is to ensure that we continue to execute on these top priorities."

So when we think about competition, Blizzard is full of gamers, and we're always excited when new games release. We think new titles are good for players. They bring fresh ideas, and that's really something that everything -- or that's something that everyone benefits from. The industry is big enough for lots of different teams to be successful. And we found that if we are focused on gameplay first, and then we continue to listen to our community feedback, we experience great results. And so I'm really proud of the Hearthstone team and what they've accomplished, especially recently. Under the leadership with an expanded development team, they've delivered larger content updates to players and have really maintained a high-quality bar we set for ourselves. We rolled out the first major new game mode, which was Battleground in November as we've talked about, and we've seen it bring players back and continue to drive renewed engagement in the game. And then last month, we launched the latest expansion, which was Ashes of Outland, and that's the first game that we've launched while we are in a working control environment. And that expansion introduced games first new class, so the first new class have never been added to the game since launch, and brought about were some of the biggest fundamental changes that the game has seen today. The sentiment around the new features and the new content is very positive. And as a result of the steady updates in the game, we saw increased engagement in Q1 versus Q4 or further uptakes in April. The Hearthstone team is looking to build on that momentum with a really good pipeline of content till later to come this year. 
And then one of the things we've learned is the Battleground has proven that new modes can drive meaningful engagement. And so the team is thinking about that as part of their future planning going forward."

So let me first step back and set the context of what we're seeing here in Q1. You heard us talk about it, which is, in the past few quarters, we've been focusing on growing that audience of players and also payers. And so in Q3 and Q4 last year, we grew the Candy player base. And then in Q3, we started introducing initiatives that are aimed at broadening the payer reach across the network, which started improving the payer conversion mechanics in the second half of last year. So back then when we did that, you heard me talk about that there would be a trade-off in the near-term bookings, but we thought that's the right thing to do for the business for the long-term health of that business. So we've seen that through the introduction of the right content and timely offers contextually -- more players start coming into the ecosystem and more payers start coming into the ecosystem. So in Q1, we went further with that approach, both on content and on offer management, and we started broadening our reach of the player investment initiatives. So we started building on top of that momentum at Candy, and we started expanding to all of our network in Q1. And so as that player base started growing steadily in the quarter, we started seeing kind of that momentum build. And in March, we saw even further acceleration. And then on the payer conversion, we started seeing some really encouraging results in Q1, and in fact, kind of in Q1, we saw the strong sequential improvement in payers that we've seen in many years. So the trends have really kind of started looking very favorable, and that's improved in April. So I'm really pleased with how the ecosystem has been building up, not just in Q1, but all the things that we've been doing from a content perspective and from a player engagement mechanics perspective in the past few quarters to get to here. So when I look ahead, you'll expect us to continue to do this. You'll expect content from us. You'll continue to expect more ways that we optimize offerings for different players to kind of go after those broader motivations. And the good news here is that you won't see the drag on Q2 bookings that we would have otherwise expected because of this really strong engagement that we're seeing. And then we add on top of that, that we can grow this network now more efficiently, as I just answered before. 
So I think the combination of all of those really kind of tend to the network. And then where we continue to keep the players active is really about what the King team does incredibly well, which is innovating the content pipeline and the features within what's happening in the game to keep these players engaged and continue to kind of drive towards players and payer numbers increasing over time. So that's kind of, I think, the -- what you're seeing now, but it's kind of the combination of everything that we've been building over the past few quarters."

Let me first convey our sympathies to those who have suffered during this difficult time. While very few of our own team members have contracted COVID-19, a number of our employees have been impacted by the illness and the passing of family members. Our thoughts and prayers are with them and everyone else affected by the pandemic. 
Quite honestly, I've been awestruck during the last 2 months by the strength of our employees and their families, managing through unprecedented challenges from health care to child care. Our teams around the world have shown ingenuity and incredible resilience. And even faced with so many difficulties, our employees still ensured that the joy, the social connection and the unexpected benefits of gaming as a way to keep our 400 million players around the world connected and engaged and safely at home has continued without interruption.
Our employees and their families have shown incredible empathy for those affected by the pandemic in their communities and across the world. They've organized meal deliveries, care for the elderly, even the use of their own 3D printers to create high-quality facial protection for their colleagues. Our teams have shown unwavering support for the first responders, nurses, doctors and medical professionals working tirelessly in unimaginable conditions. 
Our corporate social responsibility initiatives have been expanded to support programs to provide health care professionals with a variety of resources, including faster, more effective testing and the use of tools like convalescent blood transfusion as a possible method of immunization. We've also increased our direct support for military families by millions of dollars. 
Through our team's dedication and incredibly hard work under very difficult circumstances, we delivered results significantly above our outlook for the first quarter, and this momentum will likely continue for the second quarter. I've conducted almost 100 earnings calls, and none was under a backdrop of so much uncertainty for the future. 
Our mission to connect and engage the world through epic entertainment has never been more meaningful than it is today. At a time when so many forms of social interactions and entertainment experiences have been shut down, we're providing entertainment with positive impact for hundreds of millions of people through our games. Our content and connecting members of our communities around the world is critically important. 
Our development and commercial teams quickly adapted to this new work environment, and as of now, we're on track to deliver compelling new content, including the World of Warcraft Shadowlands expansion and the next premium Call of Duty release, both of which are planned for the second half of the year. Our esports organization has quickly pivoted to remote production and continues to deliver live esports for both the Call of Duty League and the Overwatch League, a direct result of the hard work and flexibility of our team owners and our sponsors. 
In the face of unprecedented circumstances, our extraordinary teams also delivered extremely strong first quarter financial results. We significantly exceeded our outlook for both revenue and earnings per share. We reached new heights for first quarter net bookings across each of mobile, console and PC, and we exited the quarter with accelerating engagement and momentum across the business as people around the world turn to our content for entertainment and connection. 
Performance in the quarter was led by Call of Duty, which is achieving tremendous scale and momentum across platforms, geographies and business models. Following industry-leading launches for Call of Duty Mobile and Modern Warfare in the fourth quarter of 2019, the franchise raised the bar even higher with the launch of Warzone in March. With a free-to-play business model and cross-platform play, Warzone expanded Modern Warfare's reach, engagement and player investment. Warzone to date has brought in over 60 million players since its launch. 
The exceptional results for Call of Duty reflect our team's remarkable execution as they innovate and take on new commercial challenges to grow and better serve our community. Their success demonstrates that free-to-play experiences across mobile, console and PC not only extend the reach of a franchise but can also lead to strong in-game monetization and sales of premium content. Call of Duty's success highlights the great potential across our portfolio as we continue to focus on extending our fully owned intellectual property to new platforms, new geographies and new business models. 
Blizzard also recorded strong growth in the first quarter led by World of Warcraft. After doubling in the second half of 2019, the WoW active community grew further in Q1. Blizzard is seeing strong increases in engagement across our franchises as people around the world stay home, adding to business momentum as our game teams execute against the strongest pipeline of content in Blizzard's history. 
At King, Candy Crush was again the top-grossing game franchise across U.S. app stores with engagement increasing sharply towards the end of the quarter. To enable our community to play even more as a part of the stay-at-home initiative, in late March, King offered unlimited free lives across many of their titles, resulting in the number of game rounds played in a single day shattering all prior records. Momentum continued to increase in April with strong year-over-year growth in reach, engagement and player investment. 
As we build on our strong first quarter results and our continuing momentum, I'm excited to introduce our new President and Chief Operating Officer, Daniel Alegre. From his long tenure at Google, Daniel brings deep experience building direct digital relationships with consumers, fostering strategic relationships with key industry partners and driving rapid growth internationally and in early-stage businesses. His expertise and commitment to excellence and execution will be his focus. 
I'd also like to thank Coddy Johnson for his extraordinary contributions to the continued success of the company during his 12-year tenure and for being a truly, truly valued friend. 
Of course, our strong business performance wouldn't be possible without the efforts of our dedicated, talented and truly empathic teams around the world. We are so grateful for the work you're doing under extremely challenging circumstances. We're also appreciative of the continued support of our shareholders, partners and players, and we wish you and your families health and safety through what remains a difficult time. 
And now Daniel will review the highlights of our operations with you."

I'm glad to be with you all for my first earnings call as COO and really proud to be part of a company so deeply connected to its mission during this really challenging time. 
I want to start by first expressing my deepest sympathies to all those affected by this health crisis and expressing thanks on behalf of the entire company to all those on the front lines of the battle against the COVID pandemic. I would also like to thank our employees for their commitment to our players and to each other, particularly under such a unique and difficult environment we are currently living in. 
But before I discuss our recent operational highlights, I'd like to share with you my focus and priorities. They are simple: execution, execution and execution. We have great franchises, and we will get back to what we are known for: superb execution. 
As Bobby said, the health and safety of our employees and their families remains our priority. I'd like to expand on the measures we are taking to keep our employees and their families safe and address our expectations for our development pipeline for the remainder of the year. 
All our offices had moved to work from home environments by mid-March, and we are fortunate to have had very few cases of COVID-19 across the company. Now we are ensuring our employees and their family members are receiving the best possible care, and we're covering all costs of testing and treatment for affected employees and their families. We have increased access to telehealth resources and contracted private doctors and medical support in regions where employees live and work. We have had additional services to our already best-in-class health benefits and ensured that employees have access to the mental and physical well-being and support they need well at home. And we are continuing to find other ways to support our employees and their families, including services to help families balance work and home life. 
Now turning to development. The digital nature of our content means our creative talent can continue to work on our product pipeline from home. Although the shift to remote working does add complexity and challenges in some areas of the game development process, including creative collaboration, motion capture, voice-over work, localization and quality assurance, we are implementing mitigation measures to each and to address each of these areas. Importantly, based on the work to date, we still expect to deliver a robust slate of content over the remainder of the year. This includes the next premium release of Call of Duty, 2 titles based on library IP from Activision, the World of Warcraft Shadowlands expansion, regional testing for new mobile titles and ongoing live operations across our key franchises. 
Regardless of location, our teams remain focused on executing against our 4 strategic growth pillars, as Bobby has laid out: first, delivering a strong, consistent cadence of major new content releases; second, driving live operations with ongoing in-game content, services, features and events; third, expanding King's industry-leading mobile success and extending our acclaimed console and PC franchises to mobile; and finally, building new engagement models around our franchises, including advertising, esports and consumer products. Now more than ever, players new and existing are looking for connection through epic entertainment. And our mission is to make that available to them in whatever form they find most convenient. 
Now turning to our first quarter results. We significantly exceeded our outlook, driven primarily by overperformance for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare throughout the quarter, including a highly successful start for our new free-to-play Call of Duty: Warzone. We also continued -- saw continued momentum for World of Warcraft and better-than-expected results for other key franchises in the second half of March as populations sheltering at home in many of our key regions turned to our content for entertainment and social connection. These trends have continued so far in the second quarter with business performance accelerating further in April. 
Now starting with Activision, MAUs more than doubled over the prior year, reaching 102 million, as Call of Duty delivered remarkable growth across multiple vectors. As we've discussed on prior calls, we made significant changes with the launch of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare to enhance the player experience, expand the community and deepen engagement. We added cross-platform play, introduced a new in-game content system and removed the season pass to keep our players closer together. Modern Warfare entered the year with strong momentum, achieving substantial year-over-year growth in engagement, premium game sales and in-game net bookings in both January and February. 
And the launch of Warzone on console and PC on March 10 really took the franchise to new heights. Warzone is a massive free-to-play experience, where up to 150 players compete in a range of modes on a vast map, featuring cross-play and in-game system entirely integrated with the Modern Warfare Battle Pass. Warzone adds yet more compelling content for our Modern Warfare community and also enables an entirely new set of players around the world to experience Call of Duty for free. This response has been incredible. Warzone has brought in more than 60 million players since the launch, including many on the PC platform and in countries beyond Call of Duty's traditional regions. We are seeing the free-to-play experience driving strong incremental sales on the premium Modern Warfare title, adding to its sales momentum entering the year and rising demand from stay-at-home conditions. 
Modern Warfare sell-through in Q1 was the highest ever for a Call of Duty title outside of the launch quarter. Life to date, Modern Warfare has sold through more units and has more players than any prior Call of Duty title at this point after its release. Warzone also contributed to a further acceleration in Modern Warfare's in-game net bookings, which more than doubled year-over-year versus the prior game in Q1, even with the removal of the Season Pass. And this momentum has only strengthened. The third season of in-game content launched in April and is Call of Duty's best performing to date for both engagement and player investment. 
With the new free-to-play experience contributing to a massively expanded audience, unprecedented momentum in premium game sales and robust in-game growth, we expect Modern Warfare's net bookings this year to be the highest for a Call of Duty game in the year after launch. And looking ahead, the next premium release for Call of Duty already looks great and remains on track for release later this year. 
On the mobile platform, the Call of Duty Mobile team continued to build on last October's breakout launch with new content, features and events aimed at optimizing engagement, retention and player investment. The team started to deliver an accelerated cadence of content in March, launching new seasonal events every 4 weeks, twice as frequently as previously. The combination of increasingly compelling content and events and stay-at-home dynamics drove the growth in reach and engagement in March, and player investment has followed with April's season 5 delivering the highest monthly in-game net bookings since season 1. With deep engagement, substantial content in the pipeline and opportunities to further refine the in-game system, we expect Call of Duty Mobile to be an increasing contributor over time. 
Q1 also saw the launch of the inaugural season of the professional Call of Duty League. Originally planned in a local city-based home stand format, we quickly pivoted all matches to online play and remote production for the remainder of the regular season to keep our players and fans safe while still delivering premium esports content to a global audience. With Call of Duty demonstrating the power of our franchise model across platforms, geographies and business model and premium content on track for the fall, we really couldn't be more excited about the growth trajectory for 2020 and beyond. 
Now turning to Blizzard. MAUs were 32 million in Q1 with each of Blizzard's key franchises experiencing a month-on-month increase in reach in March. 
World of Warcraft continued its strong momentum in the quarter as the team continued to deliver more content between expansions than ever before. Having doubled its active community in the second half of last year, the number of players on monthly or longer-term subscription plans increased further in Q1. Reach and engagement were particularly strong as regions introduced shelter-at-home measures through the quarter with momentum increasing further in April. 
The community continues to engage deeply in Classic, a recreation of our original WoW from 15 years ago, which has delivered substantial content drops in recent months and has much more to come later in the year. Reach and engagement also increased for modern WoW, which again received a major content drop in Q1. And this increased activity drove accelerating presales of Shadowlands, the next expansion for modern WoW, which is slated for the second half of the year. 
Hearthstone continued to deliver improved engagement trends in the first quarter, driven by the launch of the new Battlegrounds auto battler mode in November and strong execution in live operations. 
Overwatch also experienced a meaningful increase in engagement in March as its latest seasonal event coincided with stay-at-home effects. And fans continue to engage with the franchise through the Overwatch League, which successfully moved to online play and remote production during the quarter. 
And finally, Diablo Immortal is shaping up very well. We remain on track to begin regional testing for the game in the middle of the year. 
At King, MAUs were 273 million, increasing 10% from the fourth quarter. MAUs grew month-on-month in January and February and then accelerated further in March as shelter-at-home conditions came into effect. King's key franchises -- franchise, Candy Crush, grew MAUs year-over-year in each month of the quarter with double-digit growth in March. And within the Candy franchise, the community played more rounds of games in any quarter since the 2016 acquisition. Now in terms of player investment, Candy Crush Saga remained the top-grossing title across U.S. app stores, and the wider Candy franchise was once again #1. 
We previously discussed King's initiatives to bring back lapsed payers and attract new payers into the ecosystem, positioning the business for stronger growth over the medium and long term. And as expected, these initiatives dampened in-game net bookings again in Q1, but they contributed to ongoing improvement in payer trends in January and February before payers' numbers -- payer numbers stepped up further in both March and April. And with strengthening engagement and payer trends, we've seen King's in-game net bookings grow by low double-digit percentage year-over-year April. 
While we saw improving trends in King's in-game business, which represents a significant majority of the segment's net bookings, the advertising business slowed towards the end of the quarter. Advertising grew over 75% year-over-year for the first quarter then moderated a bit in April against the backdrop of a sudden decline in demand across the digital advertising sector, albeit still growing over 20% year-on-year in April. While we assume the environment will remain challenging, we do expect growth for the full year as we roll out more ads to more players, enhance our infrastructure to deliver the highest value adds to each player and broaden both our base of advertisers and demand partners. 
I also note that the combination of King's strong in-game trends in the current situation in the ad market is creating more opportunities for the business to cost effectively bring players into the network, expanding its audience and further boosting its MAU trajectory. The same is true across our other business units. 
So in summary, we entered the year with strong momentum in some of our biggest franchises, which only increased further through the quarter. Our employees are showing remarkable dedication as they take on the responsibility of delivering the highest-quality content to our expanded communities. And I couldn't be more excited to be part of this great and dedicated global team. I am focused on executing on our priorities as we deliver against the substantial opportunity to extend our largest IP across new platforms, geographies and business models and work on the strongest pipeline in our company's history. 
I will now hand over the call to Dennis to discuss our Q1 financial results and outlook. Dennis?"

Today, I will review our Q1 2020 results as well as our outlook for 2020 and the second quarter. But before I start, I'd just like to echo Daniel and Bobby's sentiments about the unique environment we're in and share my sincerest sympathies to those who have been affected directly by it as well as my thanks and gratitude to all our teams and employees who have so seamlessly transitioned into this new work environment we find ourselves in. 
Our digitally native business model, both on the production and the distribution side of our business, makes us well positioned to deliver world-class content and experiences for our players. Our teams take our mission and our responsibility to deliver fun and social engagement to our players in this tough time very seriously. They really didn't miss a beat during all this transition, and you can see the strong results of those efforts in our Q1 results and increased full year guidance. 
Our first quarter revenue and earnings were well ahead of our prior outlook primarily driven by our investment in creative and commercial initiatives for Call of Duty delivering better-than-expected results throughout the quarter. In addition, World of Warcraft continued to overdeliver, and other key franchises and catalog sales also exceeded our outlook, benefiting from stronger demand towards the end of the quarter as consumers sheltered at home in many of our key regions. 
To review the quarter, I will start with our segment results. Activision revenue was $519 million, growing 64% year-over-year. Growth was driven by Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and Warzone in-game revenues, strong game sales of premium Modern Warfare and the addition of Call of Duty Mobile. Operating income was $184 million with an operating margin of 35%, 12 percentage points higher year-over-year. 
Blizzard revenue was $452 million, increasing 31% year-over-year, reflecting strong growth for World of Warcraft and the release of Warcraft III Reforged in the quarter. Operating income was $197 million. Blizzard's operating margin was 44%, significantly higher year-over-year, primarily due to strong revenue growth. 
King's revenue of $498 million was roughly flat sequentially and lower year-over-year driven primarily by King's actions to prioritize mobile payer engagement in the quarter. The ads business grew over 75% year-over-year. Operating income was $156 million with an operating margin of 31%, lower than a year ago due to lower revenues and higher operating expenses as King made disciplined investments in expanding its player network. Across our segments, in-game net bookings grew 20% year-over-year to $956 million. 
Now let's turn to our overall consolidated results. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be referencing non-GAAP figures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. 
For the quarter, we generated Q1 GAAP revenues of $1.79 billion, $148 million above our February guidance. This includes the net recognition of deferrals of $266 million. Net bookings of $1.52 billion were $247 million above our February outlook. We incurred GAAP-only restructuring and related charges of $23 million, and we generated Q1 GAAP EPS of $0.65 and Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $0.76, which was $0.10 above guidance. These figures include the net recognition of deferrals of $0.18. 
In terms of cash flow, the increasingly digital, recurring and cash-generative nature of our business remains one of our fundamental strengths. This powers a strong balance sheet, which continues to be an important strategic asset for the company, especially now. In Q1, we delivered operating cash flow of $148 million, lower year-over-year despite higher operating income due to cash payments for tax settlements and working capital timing. Our cash and investments at the end of March were approximately $6 billion, and we ended the quarter with a net cash position of approximately $3.3 billion. And as previously announced, this week, we will pay an annual dividend of $0.41 per share, 11% higher year-over-year. 
Now let's turn to our outlook for Q2 and the full year. In Q2, Activision plans to deliver 2 seasons of in-game content for Modern Warfare and Warzone versus 1 season in the first quarter. Season 3 has already launched very successfully in April. Activision also released Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 remastered on PC and Xbox One following the PS4 release in late Q1, and they plan to continue delivering new features, events and seasons for Call of Duty Mobile. 
In April, Blizzard launched its latest Hearthstone expansion, Ashes of Outland, and through the quarter, we'll continue to support other key franchises with Indian content. And King will continue to deliver innovative features, events and live ops across its portfolio. 
Turning to the second half of the year. Our planned slate includes a new Call of Duty premium title, 2 releases based on our extensive library of IP from Activision and Blizzard's Shadowlands expansion for World of Warcraft. We will also continue to deliver in-game experiences for our other key franchises across our portfolio, and we continue to expect to begin regional playtesting for Diablo Immortal and certain other mobile titles. Although as discussed last quarter, we don't include any material revenue from these new mobile titles in our guidance. 
Before I discuss the specifics of our outlook, I'll provide some context. The full extent of the impact of the pandemic on our financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to fully predict at this time. While we have seen a positive impact on demand, there are also risks related to global economic weakness, rising unemployment, pressures on retail channel, pricing and other factors where we have limited visibility currently. We have tried to be prudent in our guidance to account for these effects, and we believe there is a potential for overperformance if these risks do not materialize. 
Now the addition of the Warzone free-to-play experience has further increased the reach, engagement and player investment in Call of Duty, building on an existing strength for Modern Warfare and creating a strong foundation for future financial performance. As discussed, we are also seeing increased demand for our other franchises as interest in gaming grows. 
The current environment creates the potential for a structural opportunity to bring more players into our communities who we can then engage and retain for the long term and to accelerate the continuing shift towards digital sales in our business. We have attempted to be conservative in our assumptions around the impact of these trends beyond the second quarter, but the backdrop does create greater potential for operating overperformance later this year. 
Since we provided our initial guidance in February, the strengthening dollar has resulted in an additional FX headwind to full year net bookings of approximately $100 million, and the combination of FX and lower interest income from declining interest rates represent, in aggregate, approximately $0.08 of headwind to our full year GAAP and non-GAAP EPS versus our prior outlook. Overall though, with strong momentum across the business, we are raising our outlook for net bookings, revenue and EPS for the year. And in the case of EPS, we are raising by an amount greater than our first quarter overperformance despite the FX and interest rate headwinds I just described. 
Now let me get into specifics. For Q2, on a GAAP basis, we now expect revenues of $1.69 billion, including the net recognition of deferrals of $15 million. We expect net bookings of $1.68 billion; product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 19%; and operating expenses, including software amortization, of 48%; and a GAAP-only restructuring charge of approximately $20 million. We expect a tax rate of 21%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 776 million and EPS of $0.54. 
For Q2 on a non-GAAP basis, we now expect product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 19% and operating expenses, including software amortization, of 43%. We expect a tax rate of 19% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.64, including net deferrals of $0.01. 
On a GAAP basis for 2020, we now expect revenues of $6.8 billion, including net deferrals of $100 million. We now expect net bookings of $6.9 billion for the year; product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 19%; operating expenses, including software amortization, of 48%; and a GAAP-only restructuring charge of approximately $50 million. We now expect a GAAP tax rate of 20%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 778 million and GAAP EPS of $2.22. 
For 2020, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 20%; and operating expenses, including software amortization, of 42%. We expect a tax rate of 19% and non-GAAP EPS of $2.62, including the net recognition of deferrals of $0.02. 
So in closing, our business has accelerating momentum from the dual tailwinds of strong execution in our largest franchises following last year's investments and increased development capacity and expanded reach and engagement as people turn to our interactive content as they shelter at home. We are humbled that so many people are turning to our content for solace, joy and connection in this challenging time, and we'll continue to stay focused on delivering the high-quality experiences that they have come to expect from us.

I think the short answer to the question is that Warzone has definitely been accretive to the franchise. And it's become and it is a really important part of the overall franchise ecosystem that we're creating. And I think it's worth just talking about that a bit. 
Since the last few calls, we've been discussing, bringing our community together through a number of player-focused initiatives, and that started with cross-plays, so all the friends can just get together no matter what platform you're on. It was about the free content to our community at the same time, and it was about kind of the new deterministic content system we put in the game. And of course, in the backdrop here, you have Modern Warfare, which has been just a fantastic game that gets better over time. And then what we really did is amplified all this with the launch of Warzone, our massive-scale battle royale experience. 
And when you look at Warzone, it was definitely built to provide endless fun on its own and to stand on its own as a great game, but Warzone and Modern Warfare are also obviously connected in many ways, including through shared progression systems, game systems and content offerings. And what we're seeing right now in Warzone is a large number of players choosing to upgrade to the premium Modern Warfare game and experience everything that the Modern Warfare universe has offered. And so far, the number of upgrades to premium that we're seeing are definitely above our initial expectations, and that's really great to see. 
And also, across this universe, the Modern Warfare universe, from an engagement perspective, we're also seeing franchise highs now in daily average unique players, peak concurrent players, and overall player investment has been indicated on the call so far. So regarding the future of Warzone, we know how much the community is loving it. We know how much they're enjoying the experience so far. So we're going to continue to invest in this significantly in terms of content, events, new modes, new ways to play and really just a ton more in the future. 
And to follow-up on the last part of your question, I think what I would say is, yes, we believe it has the potential to positively impact future premium games as well, and so we're excited about that opportunity. 
And before I jump off, I would also just like to thank all our Activision publishing, development teams and all our employees for keeping all of our critical projects on track. This shift to work from home has been a massive logistical exercise across the organization, and the teams have done just an outstanding job, and I just wanted to close this question by a big thank you to them. 
But again, Mario, thanks for the question. I appreciate it."

Clearly, it's obviously a scenario we'd all love to see, which is life returning to back to normal as soon as possible. But the reality is that we really don't know what that new normal will look like once that comes to pass. It does seem like that there is a likelihood that even once shelter at home ends, that there may be -- it may be a fair amount of time before people are really returning to normal as we know it. 
So we do think that there is potentially an acceleration to the structural change that we've seen in consumer entertainment, consumption patterns that we've already been seen in gaming, and that trend could persist for the long term, which would obviously benefit social yet socially distant categories like gaming. We've already seen this with the younger generation of consumers, where gaming is more an integrated part of their social and entertainment fabric. And times like these will make that activity, we believe, even more mainstream. We're obviously trying to lean into this and welcome as many players into our ecosystem as possible and bring more gamers into our communities and give them a compelling experience that hopefully turns them into long-term fans. 
We don't really have any great data points right now on what happens to consumption when people return from shelter at home. But we have seen in Asia that the strong momentum continues even as they've started to transition back. So we hope that's a sign of the similar opportunity we may have in other parts of the world as they start to return to normal as well. 
So generally speaking, we think there's a pretty big opportunity here to see an acceleration in the long-term structural shifts that we've already seen from the existing heightened engagement. But as usual, we're always trying to be prudent in how we model that because we know there are still so many unknowns at this time."

Thank you for the question. Before I answer, I want to take a step back and just say we're really thankful that our games are able to play a part in helping bring people together during what's really an unprecedented and challenging time for us all. In World of Warcraft, it was is a very -- it's been [ fortunate to be able to ] engineer it as a very social experience, and that's as true today as the day we launched. Over time, we listened to feedback from the community, and the game has evolved to what we now call the modern game, which has really expanded the breadth and the depth of gameplay as well as making it easier to kind of find friends, group up, make progress or play alone, all within the social environment. At the same time, we've seen a lot of good work [ into returning ] experience for players returning to the classic WoW experience. 
So today, we think about World of Warcraft as a single community under one subscription where players can enjoy both WoW Classic and modern WoW, and we release a steady stream of content for both. The variety of different experiences has always been a strength of the game, and it's been good to see players resonate -- that resonate with players as they see a lot of what they're looking for in World of Warcraft. 
We've seen particularly strong engagement with Classic in the East, and the momentum has continued in those regions even as they have started to come back to work. And we saw Western subscribers grow in March driven by players returning to modern WoW, primarily, and this has contributed to strong presales for Shadowlands. The momentum we saw in March across both modes continues with the active community growing faster than it ever has and outside of an expansion launch period. 
On the development side, our teams have done a really good job in shifting to work from home. We're able to welcome select players into the closed alpha for Shadowlands last month. And thanks to the hard work of the team, Shadowlands is on track to launch in Q4 this year. 
And lastly, before I hand off the call -- or I hand off to the next question, I really want to thank all the Blizzard employees during this difficult time. It's been really amazing to kind of see everyone come together in a positive way."

Thanks so much for the question.

So we exited 2019, as you heard, with strong momentum in the ads business, and that's continued in Q1, where we saw in the quarter that we delivered over 75% year-on-year growth. And as you mentioned in the question, we saw deceleration towards the end of March within the broader advertising ecosystem, but the business did grow 20% year-on-year in April, over 20% in April. 
So let me answer your question by talking a little bit of what we're doing going forward. I think about the things that we're already doing and what not to continue. And that's about rolling out more ads to more players, broadening our advertiser base and working with more partners as we continue to build our tech infrastructure. But now we're actually increasing some focus areas that we see as kind of in the short and medium term will provide opportunities. So we're going to the brand advertisers and doubling down on the relationships in those sectors that aren't experiencing slowdowns and they are experiencing actually sustained demand for their products. So the team is quite active there. 
We're also starting to leverage quite a bit of advertiser interest in very differentiated products like the sponsorship product that we have, which was new to our ecosystem and seeing some really nice advertiser interest, and that really amplifies the value proposition of the King network in this environment. 
And then we are rolling out a new technology in our games, and that's become the focus. That allows us to really optimize our demand and get higher CPMs for the ads that we are showing. And that's been a focus in this quarter and continues to be for the year. 
So if you add that plus you look at our network, which is truly global and international, what we're doing is we're looking at it as a pretty diversified set of opportunities. So when regions are starting to experience some recovery before others, we focus our efforts there as the opportunity may sit geographically in some places at a certain point in time. So with all of that, my expectation is that the advertising business does deliver growth this year. 
On your point on acquisition costs, that's the flip side of this. So what we're seeing is while we see that some advertisers [indiscernible] as King are seeing an opportunity to bring new players more efficiently than ever to our network. And when you couple that with a very different approach, it's great for us for the medium and long term. So when we do that, of course, that reinforces kind of both the in-app side of the house, the game business and the advertising number as we continue to invest in the network. 
So yes, again, kind of to echo a lot of what my colleagues have said, and before I hand back to the operator, I just want to [ thank the global ] King team and the employees across King, who have really not missed a beat as we have experienced something quite remarkable in going to work from home pretty quickly. And so a big thanks from me for the team and the incredible work that they're doing."

And what we've seen is the consumer recreational spending in the U.S., for example, was fairly resilient during those downturns. 
And if you hone in a little more specifically on entertainment, the global gaming industry fared extremely well and actually grew low to mid-single digits in these time periods, whereas broader consumer recreational spending declined low single digits, and that -- we think that's driven by the low cost per hour of gaming, which makes it a great value versus other forms of entertainment. And so if you compare that to the situation we're in now, where other forms of location-based entertainment, like going to movies, concerts, sporting events, whatever those may be, and they may not be available for some time for consumers for some period of time, this may also drive some share shift to gaming from those other categories. And thankfully, in contrast to other forms of media, we're very fortunate that the digital nature of our business enables us to not only distribute content remotely but to produce it remotely. So obviously an advantage for us to keep our content fresh. 
Another point is in those past recessions in 2001 and 2008, gaming has come a long way since then. Obviously, it's much more social and more connected and more mainstream, and our business is much more diversified, too, across platforms, geographies, types of games, which is helpful when times get challenging. On the flip side, there obviously are more free ways for players to play games than there have been. So there could be more engagement with slightly weaker monetization. But in the long term, we kind of view that as an opportunity as well because that usually normalizes itself. 
So I'd say there's puts and takes across the spectrum, but -- which is why with all this uncertainty in the economy, we tried to reflect these risks as we think about forecasting the business. But the strong momentum we're seeing gives us, obviously, confidence in raising our outlook even with this challenging backdrop."

I think it's important to probably first just step back and think about what our goal has been through all this. And the goal has been pretty simple. And what we wanted to do is provide players around the world a real fun, high-quality and, I think importantly, an authentic Call of Duty experience regardless of what platform you play on, where you happen to live or what business model really motivates you to play. And that's exactly what we've delivered across mobile, across console and across PC. 
And if you look at some of the metrics over the last 6 months, have you've seen Q4 and both in Q1, we've crossed over 100 million MAUs and dramatically increasing our player base. And a lot of that has been driven by Mobile and Warzone, of course, as is the ongoing success of Modern Warfare driving that. But through Mobile and Warzone, we're definitely reaching new audiences in new geographies in ways that we just haven't before. And as I look at Call of Duty right now, it's more global today than at any point in time in its history in terms of audience profile, and that's pretty exciting for us to see. 
So a little bit on your question on engagement. And for us, when it comes to engagement, what we've seen really time and time again is that engagement just tends to drive engagement. And so for us, exposure on what platform is driving engagement across other platform and other experiences, so we actually like to see that cross over a lot. 
And in terms of the investment part of your question, that also is looking additive to us across this ecosystem as well. In the previous question, I talked about Warzone and how we're seeing that as being accretive to the franchise overall. And with respect to CoD Mobile then, specifically, when you take a look at it, we're seeing really great momentum there. It was referenced earlier that season 5 just concluded, and it's our best-performing season in terms of engagement and in-game performance since the first season. And Season 6 just launched on May 1. And so that's off to a really strong start as well. 
So for me, when I look at it and I see the positive trends on mobile as a platform but coming at a time we're having record engagement and record performance across console and PC, and to me, that's a pretty clear indication that what we're seeing on Call of Duty Mobile is delivering incremental results for the franchise as well. So the ecosystem the way we're looking at right now seems to be working incredibly well. And in terms of mobile, in terms of our strategy, it remains a critical part of our overall plans going forward and a key investment area for us. 
And just speaking of the ecosystem, I'd probably just close by, obviously, a very exciting time for everyone on the franchise right now. And our teams are hyper-focused and passionately focused, most importantly, on delivering great new content and seasons and games to our growing community around the world that we're seeing right now. 
And I guess I would just close by saying we couldn't be more thankful for the incredible and growing community that we're seeing out there around the world for their trust and support, and we look forward to everything that's to come in the future. So thanks for the question."

Look, the vast majority of our developers, they moved to remote work by mid-March as I mentioned in my opening remarks. And really, just credit to all those involved. It was such a huge undertaking. Multifunctional teams across facilities, IT, HR, security operations and other groups really rallied together to make it all happen. 
And we're really fortunate to be in a truly digital business, where the majority of our content creation really can be performed across any location. So the vast majority of our developers, they took their computers home, plugged into secure access and just kept creating. So in some cases, we've had to move high-end computing and graphic rigs to our developers' homes as well. But we were able to do that relatively quickly. So our development teams working on everything from design to art to engineering to production really had most of what they needed to keep working. 
That being said, it's not easy as there are aspects of building our games that are more challenging via remote work, like collaborative design, in-person user research, motion capture, voice-over and QA. So we've really had to find some creative solutions to work through these, like for record voice-overs, we did that remotely. We've also enabled new secure access systems for some of the functions where large groups are engaging. 
But so far and based on what we can see and with true ingenuity and creativity from the teams, we're managing through this as best as we can. And what's really important is we just need to continue to provide our communities with the innovative content and features that they love and that they want to keep playing. So that's why I said in my prepared remarks that we're currently still on track to deliver our key content in the second half of this year, and my primary focus is to ensure that we continue to execute on these top priorities."

So when we think about competition, Blizzard is full of gamers, and we're always excited when new games release. We think new titles are good for players. They bring fresh ideas, and that's really something that everything -- or that's something that everyone benefits from. The industry is big enough for lots of different teams to be successful. And we found that if we are focused on gameplay first and then we continue to listen to our community feedback, we experience great results. 
And so I'm really proud of the Hearthstone team and what they've accomplished, especially recently. Under the leadership with an expanded development team, they've delivered larger content updates to players and have really maintained a high-quality bar we set for ourselves. 
We rolled out the first major new game mode, which was Battlegrounds in November, as we've talked about, and we've seen it bring players back and continue to drive renewed engagement in the game. 
And then last month, we launched the latest expansion, which was Ashes of Outland, and that's the first game that we've launched while we were in a working-from-home environment. And that expansion introduced the game's first new class, so the first new class that's ever been added to the game since launch, the Demon Hunter, and brought about really some of the biggest fundamental changes that the game has seen today. 
The sentiment around the new features and the new content is very positive. And as a result of the steady updates in the game, we saw increased engagement in Q1 versus Q4 and further uptakes in April. The Hearthstone team is looking to build on that momentum with a really good pipeline of content still later to come this year. 
And then one of the things we've learned is that Battlegrounds has proven that new modes can drive meaningful engagement. And so the team is thinking about that as part of their future planning going forward."

So let me first step back and set the context of what we're seeing here in Q1. You heard us talk about it, which is, in the past few quarters, we've been focusing on growing that audience of players and also payers. And so in Q3 and Q4 last year, we grew the Candy player base. And then in Q3, we started introducing initiatives that are aimed at broadening the payer reach across the network, which started improving the payer conversion mechanics in the second half of last year. So back then when we did that, you heard me talk about that there would be a trade-off in the near-term bookings, but we thought that's the right thing to do for the business for the long-term health of that business. 
So we've seen that through the introduction of the right content and timely offers contextually placed, more players start coming into the ecosystem and more payers start coming into the ecosystem. So in Q1, we went further with that approach, both on content and on offer management, and we started broadening our reach of the player investment initiatives. So we started building on top of that momentum in Candy, and we started expanding to all of our network in Q1. And so as that player base started growing steadily in the quarter, we started seeing kind of that momentum build. And in March, we saw even further acceleration. 
And then on the payer conversion, we started seeing some really encouraging results in Q1, and in fact, kind of in Q1, we saw the strong sequential improvement in payers that we've seen in many years. So the trends have really kind of started looking very favorable, and that's improved in April. So I'm really pleased with how the ecosystem has been building up, not just in Q1 but all the things that we've been doing from a content perspective and from a player engagement mechanics perspective in the past few quarters to get to here. 
So when I look ahead, you'll expect us to continue to do this. You'll expect content from us. You'll continue to expect more ways that we optimize offerings for different players to kind of go after those broader motivations. And the good news here is that you're -- you won't see the drag on Q2 bookings that we would have otherwise expected because of this really strong engagement that we're seeing. And then we add on top of that, that we can grow this network now more efficiently, as I just answered before. 
So I think the combination of all of those really kind of tend to the network. And then where we continue to keep the players active is really about what the King team does incredibly well, which is innovating the content pipeline and the features within what's happening in the game to keep these players engaged and continue to kind of drive towards players and payer numbers increasing over time. So that's kind of, I think, the -- what you're seeing now, but it's kind of the combination of everything that we've been building over the past few quarters."

Let me first convey our sympathies to those who have suffered during this difficult time. While very few of our own team members have contracted COVID-19, a number of our employees have been impacted by the illness and the passing of family members. Our thoughts and prayers are with them and everyone else affected by the pandemic. 
Quite honestly, I've been awestruck during the last 2 months by the strength of our employees and their families, managing through unprecedented challenges from health care to child care. Our teams around the world have shown ingenuity and incredible resilience. And even faced with so many difficulties, our employees still ensured that the joy, the social connection and the unexpected benefits of gaming as a way to keep our 400 million players around the world connected and engaged and safely at home has continued without interruption.
Our employees and their families have shown incredible empathy for those affected by the pandemic in their communities and across the world. They've organized meal deliveries, care for the elderly, even the use of their own 3D printers to create high-quality facial protection for their colleagues. Our teams have shown unwavering support for the first responders, nurses, doctors and medical professionals working tirelessly in unimaginable conditions. 
Our corporate social responsibility initiatives have been expanded to support programs to provide health care professionals with a variety of resources, including faster, more effective testing and the use of tools like convalescent blood transfusion as a possible method of immunization. We've also increased our direct support for military families by millions of dollars. 
Through our team's dedication and incredibly hard work under very difficult circumstances, we delivered results significantly above our outlook for the first quarter, and this momentum will likely continue for the second quarter. I've conducted almost 100 earnings calls, and none was under a backdrop of so much uncertainty for the future. 
Our mission to connect and engage the world through epic entertainment has never been more meaningful than it is today. At a time when so many forms of social interactions and entertainment experiences have been shut down, we're providing entertainment with positive impact for hundreds of millions of people through our games. Our content and connecting members of our communities around the world is critically important. 
Our development and commercial teams quickly adapted to this new work environment, and as of now, we're on track to deliver compelling new content, including the World of Warcraft Shadowlands expansion and the next premium Call of Duty release, both of which are planned for the second half of the year. Our esports organization has quickly pivoted to remote production and continues to deliver live esports for both the Call of Duty League and the Overwatch League, a direct result of the hard work and flexibility of our team owners and our sponsors. 
In the face of unprecedented circumstances, our extraordinary teams also delivered extremely strong first quarter financial results. We significantly exceeded our outlook for both revenue and earnings per share. We reached new heights for first quarter net bookings across each of mobile, console and PC, and we exited the quarter with accelerating engagement and momentum across the business as people around the world turn to our content for entertainment and connection. 
Performance in the quarter was led by Call of Duty, which is achieving tremendous scale and momentum across platforms, geographies and business models. Following industry-leading launches for Call of Duty Mobile and Modern Warfare in the fourth quarter of 2019, the franchise raised the bar even higher with the launch of Warzone in March. With a free-to-play business model and cross-platform play, Warzone expanded Modern Warfare's reach, engagement and player investment. Warzone to date has brought in over 60 million players since its launch. 
The exceptional results for Call of Duty reflect our team's remarkable execution as they innovate and take on new commercial challenges to grow and better serve our community. Their success demonstrates that free-to-play experiences across mobile, console and PC not only extend the reach of a franchise but can also lead to strong in-game monetization and sales of premium content. Call of Duty's success highlights the great potential across our portfolio as we continue to focus on extending our fully owned intellectual property to new platforms, new geographies and new business models. 
Blizzard also recorded strong growth in the first quarter led by World of Warcraft. After doubling in the second half of 2019, the WoW active community grew further in Q1. Blizzard is seeing strong increases in engagement across our franchises as people around the world stay home, adding to business momentum as our game teams execute against the strongest pipeline of content in Blizzard's history. 
At King, Candy Crush was again the top-grossing game franchise across U.S. app stores with engagement increasing sharply towards the end of the quarter. To enable our community to play even more as a part of the stay-at-home initiative, in late March, King offered unlimited free lives across many of their titles, resulting in the number of game rounds played in a single day shattering all prior records. Momentum continued to increase in April with strong year-over-year growth in reach, engagement and player investment. 
As we build on our strong first quarter results and our continuing momentum, I'm excited to introduce our new President and Chief Operating Officer, Daniel Alegre. From his long tenure at Google, Daniel brings deep experience building direct digital relationships with consumers, fostering strategic relationships with key industry partners and driving rapid growth internationally and in early-stage businesses. His expertise and commitment to excellence and execution will be his focus. 
I'd also like to thank Coddy Johnson for his extraordinary contributions to the continued success of the company during his 12-year tenure and for being a truly, truly valued friend. 
Of course, our strong business performance wouldn't be possible without the efforts of our dedicated, talented and truly empathic teams around the world. We are so grateful for the work you're doing under extremely challenging circumstances. We're also appreciative of the continued support of our shareholders, partners and players, and we wish you and your families health and safety through what remains a difficult time. 
And now Daniel will review the highlights of our operations with you."

I want to start by first expressing my deepest sympathies to all those affected by this health crisis and expressing thanks on behalf of the entire company to all those on the front lines of the battle against the COVID pandemic. I would also like to thank our employees for their commitment to our players and to each other, particularly under such a unique and difficult environment we are currently living in.

We have increased access to telehealth resources and contracted private doctors and medical support in regions where employees live and work. We have had additional services to our already best-in-class health benefits and ensured that employees have access to the mental and physical well-being and support they need while at home. And we are continuing to find other ways to support our employees and their families, including services to help families balance work and home life. 
Now turning to development. The digital nature of our content means our creative talent can continue to work on our product pipeline from home. Although the shift to remote working does add complexity and challenges in some areas of the game development process, including creative collaboration, motion capture, voice-over work, localization and quality assurance, we are implementing mitigation measures to each, and to address each of these areas. Importantly, based on the work to date, we still expect to deliver a robust slate of content over the remainder of the year. This includes the next premium release of Call of Duty, 2 titles based on library IP from Activision, the World of Warcraft Shadowlands expansion, regional testing for new mobile titles and ongoing live operations across our key franchises. 
Regardless of location, our teams remain focused on executing against our 4 strategic growth pillars, as Bobby has laid out: first, delivering a strong, consistent cadence of major new content releases; second, driving live operations with ongoing in-game content, services, features and events; third, expanding King's industry-leading mobile success and extending our acclaimed console and PC franchises to mobile; and finally, building new engagement models around our franchises, including advertising, esports and consumer products. Now more than ever, players new and existing are looking for connection through epic entertainment. And our mission is to make that available to them in whatever form they find most convenient. 
Now turning to our first quarter results. We significantly exceeded our outlook, driven primarily by overperformance for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare throughout the quarter, including a highly successful start for our new free-to-play Call of Duty: Warzone. We also continued -- saw continued momentum for World of Warcraft and better-than-expected results for other key franchises in the second half of March as populations sheltering at home in many of our key regions turned to our content for entertainment and social connection. These trends have continued so far in the second quarter with business performance accelerating further in April. 
Now starting with Activision, MAUs more than doubled over the prior year, reaching 102 million, as Call of Duty delivered remarkable growth across multiple vectors. As we've discussed on prior calls, we made significant changes with the launch of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare to enhance the player experience, expand the community and deepen engagement. We added cross-platform play, introduced a new in-game content system and removed the season pass to keep our players closer together. Modern Warfare entered the year with strong momentum, achieving substantial year-over-year growth in engagement, premium game sales and in-game net bookings in both January and February. 
And the launch of Warzone on console and PC on March 10 really took the franchise to new heights. Warzone is a massive free-to-play experience, where up to 150 players compete in a range of modes on a vast map, featuring cross-play and in-game system entirely integrated with the Modern Warfare Battle Pass. Warzone adds yet more compelling content for our Modern Warfare community and also enables an entirely new set of players around the world to experience Call of Duty for free. This response has been incredible. Warzone has brought in more than 60 million players since the launch, including many on the PC platform and in countries beyond Call of Duty's traditional regions. We are seeing the free-to-play experience driving strong incremental sales on the premium Modern Warfare title, adding to its sales momentum entering the year and rising demand from stay-at-home conditions. 
Modern Warfare sell-through in Q1 was the highest ever for a Call of Duty title outside of the launch quarter. Life to date, Modern Warfare has sold through more units and has more players than any prior Call of Duty title at this point after its release. Warzone also contributed to a further acceleration in Modern Warfare's in-game net bookings, which more than doubled year-over-year versus the prior game in Q1, even with the removal of the Season Pass. And this momentum has only strengthened. The third season of in-game content launched in April and is Call of Duty's best performing to date for both engagement and player investment. 
With the new free-to-play experience contributing to a massively expanded audience, unprecedented momentum in premium game sales and robust in-game growth, we expect Modern Warfare's net bookings this year to be the highest for a Call of Duty game in the year after launch. And looking ahead, the next premium release for Call of Duty already looks great and remains on track for release later this year. 
On the mobile platform, the Call of Duty Mobile team continued to build on last October's breakout launch with new content, features and events aimed at optimizing engagement, retention and player investment. The team started to deliver an accelerated cadence of content in March, launching new seasonal events every 4 weeks, twice as frequently as previously. The combination of increasingly compelling content and events and stay-at-home dynamics drove the growth in reach and engagement in March, and player investment has followed with April's season 5 delivering the highest monthly in-game net bookings since season 1. With deep engagement, substantial content in the pipeline and opportunities to further refine the in-game system, we expect Call of Duty Mobile to be an increasing contributor over time. 
Q1 also saw the launch of the inaugural season of the professional Call of Duty League. Originally planned in a local city-based home stand format, we quickly pivoted all matches to online play and remote production for the remainder of the regular season to keep our players and fans safe while still delivering premium esports content to a global audience. With Call of Duty demonstrating the power of our franchise model across platforms, geographies and business model, and premium content on track for the fall, we really couldn't be more excited about the growth trajectory for 2020 and beyond. 
Now turning to Blizzard. MAUs were 32 million in Q1 with each of Blizzard's key franchises experiencing a month-on-month increase in reach in March. 
World of Warcraft continued its strong momentum in the quarter as the team continued to deliver more content between expansions than ever before. Having doubled its active community in the second half of last year, the number of players on monthly or longer-term subscription plans increased further in Q1. Reach and engagement were particularly strong as regions introduced shelter-at-home measures through the quarter, with momentum increasing further in April. 
The community continues to engage deeply in Classic, a recreation of our original WoW from 15 years ago, which has delivered substantial content drops in recent months and has much more to come later in the year. Reach and engagement also increased for modern WoW, which again received a major content drop in Q1. And this increased activity drove accelerating presales of Shadowlands, the next expansion for modern WoW, which is slated for the second half of the year. 
Hearthstone continued to deliver improved engagement trends in the first quarter, driven by the launch of the new Battlegrounds auto battler mode in November and strong execution in live operations. 
Overwatch also experienced a meaningful increase in engagement in March as its latest seasonal event coincided with stay-at-home effects. And fans continue to engage with the franchise through the Overwatch League, which successfully moved to online play and remote production during the quarter. 
And finally, Diablo Immortal is shaping up very well. We remain on track to begin regional testing for the game in the middle of the year. 
At King, MAUs were 273 million, increasing 10% from the fourth quarter. MAUs grew month-on-month in January and February and then accelerated further in March as shelter-at-home conditions came into effect. King's key franchises -- franchise, Candy Crush, grew MAUs year-over-year in each month of the quarter with double-digit growth in March. And within the Candy franchise, the community played more rounds of games in any quarter since the 2016 acquisition. Now in terms of player investment, Candy Crush Saga remained the top-grossing title across U.S. app stores, and the wider Candy franchise was once again #1. 
We previously discussed King's initiatives to bring back lapsed payers and attract new payers into the ecosystem, positioning the business for stronger growth over the medium and long term. And as expected, these initiatives dampened in-game net bookings again in Q1, but they contributed to ongoing improvement in payer trends in January and February before payers' numbers -- payer numbers stepped up further in both March and April. And with strengthening engagement and payer trends, we've seen King's in-game net bookings grow by low double-digit percentage year-over-year April. 
While we saw improving trends in King's in-game business, which represents a significant majority of the segment's net bookings, the advertising business slowed towards the end of the quarter. Advertising grew over 75% year-over-year for the first quarter, then moderated a bit in April against the backdrop of a sudden decline in demand across the digital advertising sector, albeit still growing over 20% year-on-year in April. While we assume the environment will remain challenging, we do expect growth for the full year as we roll out more ads to more players, enhance our infrastructure to deliver the highest value adds to each player and broaden both our base of advertisers and demand partners. 
I also note that the combination of King's strong in-game trends and the current situation in the ad market is creating more opportunities for the business to cost effectively bring players into the network, expanding its audience and further boosting its MAU trajectory. The same is true across our other business units. 
So in summary, we entered the year with strong momentum in some of our biggest franchises, which only increased further through the quarter. Our employees are showing remarkable dedication as they take on the responsibility of delivering the highest-quality content to our expanded communities. And I couldn't be more excited to be part of this great and dedicated global team. I am focused on executing on our priorities as we deliver against the substantial opportunity to extend our largest IP across new platforms, geographies and business models and work on the strongest pipeline in our company's history. 
I will now hand over the call to Dennis to discuss our Q1 financial results and outlook. Dennis?"

Today, I will review our Q1 2020 results as well as our outlook for 2020 and the second quarter. But before I start, I'd just like to echo Daniel and Bobby's sentiments about the unique environment we're in and share my sincerest sympathies to those who have been affected directly by it as well as my thanks and gratitude to all our teams and employees who have so seamlessly transitioned into this new work environment we find ourselves in. 
Our digitally native business model, both on the production and the distribution side of our business, makes us well positioned to deliver world-class content and experiences for our players. Our teams take our mission and our responsibility to deliver fun and social engagement to our players in this tough time very seriously. They really didn't miss a beat during all this transition, and you can see the strong results of those efforts in our Q1 results and increased full year guidance. 
Our first quarter revenue and earnings were well ahead of our prior outlook primarily driven by our investment in creative and commercial initiatives for Call of Duty delivering better-than-expected results throughout the quarter. In addition, World of Warcraft continued to overdeliver, and other key franchises and catalog sales also exceeded our outlook, benefiting from stronger demand towards the end of the quarter as consumers sheltered at home in many of our key regions. 
To review the quarter, I will start with our segment results. Activision revenue was $519 million, growing 64% year-over-year. Growth was driven by Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and Warzone in-game revenues, strong game sales of premium Modern Warfare and the addition of Call of Duty Mobile. Operating income was $184 million with an operating margin of 35%, 12 percentage points higher year-over-year. 
Blizzard revenue was $452 million, increasing 31% year-over-year, reflecting strong growth for World of Warcraft and the release of Warcraft III Reforged in the quarter. Operating income was $197 million. Blizzard's operating margin was 44%, significantly higher year-over-year, primarily due to strong revenue growth. 
King's revenue of $498 million was roughly flat sequentially and lower year-over-year driven primarily by King's actions to prioritize mobile payer engagement in the quarter. The ads business grew over 75% year-over-year. Operating income was $156 million with an operating margin of 31%, lower than a year ago due to lower revenues and higher operating expenses as King made disciplined investments in expanding its player network. Across our segments, in-game net bookings grew 20% year-over-year to $956 million. 
Now let's turn to our overall consolidated results. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be referencing non-GAAP figures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. 
For the quarter, we generated Q1 GAAP revenues of $1.79 billion, $148 million above our February guidance. This includes the net recognition of deferrals of $266 million. Net bookings of $1.52 billion were $247 million above our February outlook. We incurred GAAP-only restructuring and related charges of $23 million, and we generated Q1 GAAP EPS of $0.65 and Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $0.76, which was $0.10 above guidance. These figures include the net recognition of deferrals of $0.18. 
In terms of cash flow, the increasingly digital, recurring and cash-generative nature of our business remains one of our fundamental strengths. This powers a strong balance sheet, which continues to be an important strategic asset for the company, especially now. In Q1, we delivered operating cash flow of $148 million, lower year-over-year despite higher operating income due to cash payments for tax settlements and working capital timing. Our cash and investments at the end of March were approximately $6 billion, and we ended the quarter with a net cash position of approximately $3.3 billion. And as previously announced, this week, we will pay an annual dividend of $0.41 per share, 11% higher year-over-year. 
Now let's turn to our outlook for Q2 and the full year. In Q2, Activision plans to deliver 2 seasons of in-game content for Modern Warfare and Warzone versus 1 season in the first quarter. Season 3 has already launched very successfully in April. Activision also released Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 remastered on PC and Xbox One following the PS4 release in late Q1, and they plan to continue delivering new features, events and seasons for Call of Duty Mobile. 
In April, Blizzard launched its latest Hearthstone expansion, Ashes of Outland, and through the quarter, we'll continue to support other key franchises with Indian content. And King will continue to deliver innovative features, events and live ops across its portfolio. 
Turning to the second half of the year. Our planned slate includes a new Call of Duty premium title, 2 releases based on our extensive library of IP from Activision and Blizzard's Shadowlands expansion for World of Warcraft. We will also continue to deliver in-game experiences for our other key franchises across our portfolio, and we continue to expect to begin regional playtesting for Diablo Immortal and certain other mobile titles. Although as discussed last quarter, we don't include any material revenue from these new mobile titles in our guidance. 
Before I discuss the specifics of our outlook, I'll provide some context. The full extent of the impact of the pandemic on our financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to fully predict at this time. While we have seen a positive impact on demand, there are also risks related to global economic weakness, rising unemployment, pressures on retail channel, pricing and other factors where we have limited visibility currently. We have tried to be prudent in our guidance to account for these effects, and we believe there is a potential for overperformance if these risks do not materialize. 
Now the addition of the Warzone free-to-play experience has further increased the reach, engagement and player investment in Call of Duty, building on an existing strength for Modern Warfare and creating a strong foundation for future financial performance. As discussed, we are also seeing increased demand for our other franchises as interest in gaming grows. 
The current environment creates the potential for a structural opportunity to bring more players into our communities who we can then engage and retain for the long term and to accelerate the continuing shift towards digital sales in our business. We have attempted to be conservative in our assumptions around the impact of these trends beyond the second quarter, but the backdrop does create greater potential for operating overperformance later this year. 
Since we provided our initial guidance in February, the strengthening dollar has resulted in an additional FX headwind to full year net bookings of approximately $100 million, and the combination of FX and lower interest income from declining interest rates represent, in aggregate, approximately $0.08 of headwind to our full year GAAP and non-GAAP EPS versus our prior outlook. Overall though, with strong momentum across the business, we are raising our outlook for net bookings, revenue and EPS for the year. And in the case of EPS, we are raising by an amount greater than our first quarter overperformance despite the FX and interest rate headwinds I just described. 
Now let me get into specifics. For Q2, on a GAAP basis, we now expect revenues of $1.69 billion, including the net recognition of deferrals of $15 million. We expect net bookings of $1.68 billion; product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 19%; and operating expenses, including software amortization, of 48%; and a GAAP-only restructuring charge of approximately $20 million. We expect a tax rate of 21%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 776 million and EPS of $0.54. 
For Q2 on a non-GAAP basis, we now expect product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 19% and operating expenses, including software amortization, of 43%. We expect a tax rate of 19% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.64, including net deferrals of $0.01. 
On a GAAP basis for 2020, we now expect revenues of $6.8 billion, including net deferrals of $100 million. We now expect net bookings of $6.9 billion for the year; product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 19%; operating expenses, including software amortization, of 48%; and a GAAP-only restructuring charge of approximately $50 million. We now expect a GAAP tax rate of 20%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 778 million and GAAP EPS of $2.22. 
For 2020, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 20%; and operating expenses, including software amortization, of 42%. We expect a tax rate of 19% and non-GAAP EPS of $2.62, including the net recognition of deferrals of $0.02. 
So in closing, our business has accelerating momentum from the dual tailwinds of strong execution in our largest franchises following last year's investments and increased development capacity and expanded reach and engagement as people turn to our interactive content as they shelter at home. We are humbled that so many people are turning to our content for solace, joy and connection in this challenging time, and we'll continue to stay focused on delivering the high-quality experiences that they have come to expect from us.

I think the short answer to the question is that Warzone has definitely been accretive to the franchise. And it's become and it is a really important part of the overall franchise ecosystem that we're creating. And I think it's worth just talking about that a bit. 
Since the last few calls, we've been discussing, bringing our community together through a number of player-focused initiatives, and that started with cross-plays, so all the friends can just get together no matter what platform you're on. It was about the free content to our community at the same time, and it was about kind of the new deterministic content system we put in the game. And of course, in the backdrop here, you have Modern Warfare, which has been just a fantastic game that gets better over time. And then what we really did is amplified all this with the launch of Warzone, our massive-scale battle royale experience. 
And when you look at Warzone, it was definitely built to provide endless fun on its own and to stand on its own as a great game, but Warzone and Modern Warfare are also obviously connected in many ways, including through shared progression systems, game systems and content offerings. And what we're seeing right now in Warzone is a large number of players choosing to upgrade to the premium Modern Warfare game and experience everything that the Modern Warfare universe has to offer. And so far, the number of upgrades to premium that we're seeing are definitely above our initial expectations, and that's really great to see. 
And also, across this universe, the Modern Warfare universe, from an engagement perspective, we're also seeing franchise highs now in daily average unique players, peak concurrent players, and overall player investment has been indicated on the call so far. So regarding the future of Warzone, we know how much the community is loving it. We know how much they're enjoying the experience so far. So we're going to continue to invest in this significantly in terms of content, events, new modes, new ways to play and really just a ton more in the future. 
And to follow-up on the last part of your question, I think what I would say is, yes, we believe it has the potential to positively impact future premium games as well, and so we're excited about that opportunity. 
And before I jump off, I would also just like to thank all our Activision publishing, development teams and all our employees for keeping all of our critical projects on track. This shift to work from home has been a massive logistical exercise across the organization, and the teams have done just an outstanding job, and I just wanted to close this question by a big thank you to them. 
But again, Mario, thanks for the question. I appreciate it."

Clearly, it's obviously a scenario we'd all love to see, which is life returning to back to normal as soon as possible. But the reality is that we really don't know what that new normal will look like once that comes to pass. It does seem like that there is a likelihood that even once shelter at home ends, that there may be -- it may be a fair amount of time before people are really returning to normal as we know it. 
So we do think that there is potentially an acceleration to the structural change that we've seen in consumer entertainment, consumption patterns that we've already been seeing in gaming, and that trend could persist for the long term, which would obviously benefit social yet socially distant categories like gaming. We've already seen this with the younger generation of consumers, where gaming is more an integrated part of their social and entertainment fabric. And times like these will make that activity, we believe, even more mainstream. We're obviously trying to lean into this and welcome as many players into our ecosystem as possible and bring more gamers into our communities and give them a compelling experience that hopefully turns them into long-term fans. 
We don't really have any great data points right now on what happens to consumption when people return from shelter at home. But we have seen in Asia that the strong momentum continues even as they've started to transition back. So we hope that's a sign of the similar opportunity we may have in other parts of the world as they start to return to normal as well. 
So generally speaking, we think there's a pretty big opportunity here to see an acceleration in the long-term structural shifts that we've already seen from the existing heightened engagement. But as usual, we're always trying to be prudent in how we model that because we know there are still so many unknowns at this time."

Thank you for the question. Before I answer, I want to take a step back and just say we're really thankful that our games are able to play a part in helping bring people together during what's really an unprecedented and challenging time for us all. In World of Warcraft, it was is a very -- it's been [ fortunate to be able to ] engineer it as a very social experience, and that's as true today as the day we launched. Over time, we listened to feedback from the community, and the game has evolved to what we now call the modern game, which has really expanded the breadth and the depth of gameplay as well as making it easier to kind of find friends, group up, make progress or play alone, all within the social environment. At the same time, we've seen a lot of good work in returning -- experience for players returning to the classic WoW experience. 
So today, we think about World of Warcraft as a single community under one subscription where players can enjoy both WoW Classic and modern WoW, and we release a steady stream of content for both. The variety of different experiences has always been a strength of the game, and it's been good to see players resonate -- that resonate with players as they see a lot of what they're looking for in World of Warcraft. 
We've seen particularly strong engagement with Classic in the East, and the momentum has continued in those regions even as they have started to come back to work. And we saw Western subscribers grow in March driven by players returning to modern WoW, primarily, and this has contributed to strong presales for Shadowlands. The momentum we saw in March across both modes continues with the active community growing faster than it ever has and that's outside of an expansion launch period. 
On the development side, our teams have done a really good job in shifting to work from home. We're able to welcome select players into the closed alpha for Shadowlands last month. And thanks to the hard work of the team, Shadowlands is on track to launch in Q4 this year. 
And lastly, before I hand off the call -- or I hand off to the next question, I really want to thank all the Blizzard employees during this difficult time. It's been really amazing to kind of see everyone come together in a positive way."

So we exited 2019, as you heard, with strong momentum in the ads business, and that's continued in Q1, where we saw in the quarter that we delivered over 75% year-on-year growth. And as you mentioned in the question, we saw deceleration towards the end of March within the broader advertising ecosystem, but the business did grow 20% year-on-year in April, over 20% in April. 
So let me answer your question by talking a little bit of what we're doing going forward. I think about the things that we're already doing and what not to continue. And that's about rolling out more ads to more players, broadening our advertiser base and working with more partners as we continue to build our tech infrastructure. But now we're actually increasing some focus areas that we see as kind of in the short and medium term will provide opportunities. So we're going to the brand advertisers and doubling down on the relationships in those sectors that aren't experiencing slowdowns and they are experiencing actually sustained demand for their products. So the team is quite active there. 
We're also starting to leverage quite a bit of advertiser interest in very differentiated products like the sponsorship product that we have, which was new to our ecosystem and seeing some really nice advertiser interest, and that really amplifies the value proposition of the King network in this environment. 
And then we are rolling out a new technology in our games, and that's become the focus. That allows us to really optimize our demand and get higher CPMs for the ads that we are showing. And that's been a focus in this quarter and continues to be for the year. 
So if you add that plus you look at our network, which is truly global and international, what we're doing is we're looking at it as a pretty diversified set of opportunities. So when regions are starting to experience some recovery before others, we focus our efforts there as the opportunity may sit geographically in some places at a certain point in time. So with all of that, my expectation is that the advertising business does deliver growth this year. 
On your point on acquisition costs, that's the flip side of this. So what we're seeing is while we see that some advertisers [indiscernible] as King are seeing an opportunity to bring new players more efficiently than ever to our network. And when you couple that with a very different approach, it's great for us for the medium and long term. So when we do that, of course, that reinforces kind of both the in-app side of the house, the game business and the advertising number as we continue to invest in the network. 
So yes, again, kind of to echo a lot of what my colleagues have said, and before I hand back to the operator, I just want to [ thank the global ] King team and the employees across King, who have really not missed a beat as we have experienced something quite remarkable in going to work from home pretty quickly. And so a big thanks from me for the team and the incredible work that they're doing."

Relatively speaking,",439,"Dennis. Thanks for the question. Obviously, we're in kind of uncharted waters. There's not really any precedent for what's going on right now in the economy, which definitely makes us cautious and careful maybe more so than normal. 
Relatively speaking, however, we do feel pretty good about the value proposition of our content even in tough times. There's not great past precedents, obviously, for where we are. But you can look at least back to the past 2 market dislocations in 2001 and 2008 for at least some directional indication of how gaming has performed in challenging economic times. And what we've seen is the consumer recreational spending in the U.S., for example, was fairly resilient during those downturns. 
And if you hone in a little more specifically on entertainment, the global gaming industry fared extremely well and actually grew low to mid-single digits in these time periods, whereas broader consumer recreational spending declined low single digits, and that -- we think that's driven by the low cost per hour of gaming, which makes it a great value versus other forms of entertainment. And so if you compare that to the situation we're in now, where other forms of location-based entertainment, like going to movies, concerts, sporting events, whatever those may be, and they may not be available for some time -- for consumers for some period of time, this may also drive some share shift to gaming from those other categories. And thankfully, in contrast to other forms of media, we're very fortunate that the digital nature of our business enables us to not only distribute content remotely but to produce it remotely. So obviously an advantage for us to keep our content fresh. 
Another point is in those past recessions in 2001 and 2008, gaming has come a long way since then. Obviously, it's much more social and more connected and more mainstream, and our business is much more diversified, too, across platforms, geographies, types of games, which is helpful when times get challenging. On the flip side, there obviously are more free ways for players to play games than there have been. So there could be more engagement with slightly weaker monetization. But in the long term, we kind of view that as an opportunity as well because that usually normalizes itself. 
So I'd say there's puts and takes across the spectrum, but -- which is why with all this uncertainty in the economy, we tried to reflect these risks as we think about forecasting the business. But the strong momentum we're seeing gives us, obviously, confidence in raising our outlook even with this challenging backdrop."

I think it's important to probably first just step back and think about what our goal has been through all this. And the goal has been pretty simple. And what we wanted to do is provide players around the world a real fun, high-quality and, I think importantly, an authentic Call of Duty experience regardless of what platform you play on, where you happen to live or what business model really motivates you to play. And that's exactly what we've delivered across mobile, across console and across PC. 
And if you look at some of the metrics over the last 6 months, then you've seen Q4 and both in Q1, we've crossed over 100 million MAUs and dramatically increasing our player base. And a lot of that has been driven by Mobile and Warzone, of course, as is the ongoing success of Modern Warfare driving that. But through Mobile and Warzone, we're definitely reaching new audiences and new geographies in ways that we just haven't before. And as I look at Call of Duty right now, it's more global today than at any point in time in its history in terms of audience profile, and that's pretty exciting for us to see. 
So a little bit on your question on engagement. And for us, when it comes to engagement, what we've seen really time and time again is that engagement just tends to drive engagement. And so for us, exposure on what platform is driving engagement across other platform and other experiences, so we actually like to see that cross over a lot. 
And in terms of the investment part of your question, that also is looking additive to us across this ecosystem as well. In the previous question, I talked about Warzone and how we're seeing that as being accretive to the franchise overall. And with respect to CoD Mobile then, specifically, when you take a look at it, we're seeing really great momentum there. It was referenced earlier that season 5 just concluded, and it's our best-performing season in terms of engagement and in-game performance since the first season. And Season 6 just launched on May 1. And so that's off to a really strong start as well. 
So for me, when I look at it and I see the positive trends on mobile as a platform but coming at a time we're having record engagement and record performance across console and PC, and to me, that's a pretty clear indication that what we're seeing on Call of Duty Mobile is delivering incremental results for the franchise as well. So the ecosystem the way we're looking at right now seems to be working incredibly well. And in terms of mobile, in terms of our strategy, it remains a critical part of our overall plans going forward and a key investment area for us. 
And just speaking of the ecosystem, I'd probably just close by, obviously, a very exciting time for everyone on the franchise right now. And our teams are hyper-focused and passionately focused, most importantly, on delivering great new content and seasons and games to our growing community around the world that we're seeing right now. 
And I guess I would just close by saying we couldn't be more thankful for the incredible and growing community that we're seeing out there around the world for their trust and support, and we look forward to everything that's to come in the future. So thanks for the question."

Look, the vast majority of our developers, they moved to remote work by mid-March as I mentioned in my opening remarks. And really, just credit to all those involved. It was such a huge undertaking. Multifunctional teams across facilities, IT, HR, security operations and other groups really rallied together to make it all happen. 
And we're really fortunate to be in a truly digital business, where the majority of our content creation really can be performed across any location. So the vast majority of our developers, they took their computers home, plugged into secure access and just kept creating. So in some cases, we've had to move high-end computing and graphic rigs to our developers' homes as well. But we were able to do that relatively quickly. So our development teams working on everything from design to art to engineering to production really had most of what they needed to keep working. 
That being said, it's not easy as there are aspects of building our games that are more challenging via remote work, like collaborative design, in-person user research, motion capture, voice-over and QA. So we've really had to find some creative solutions to work through these, like for record voice-overs, we did that remotely. We've also enabled new secure access systems for some of the functions where large groups are engaging. 
But so far and based on what we can see and with true ingenuity and creativity from the teams, we're managing through this as best as we can. And what's really important is we just need to continue to provide our communities with the innovative content and features that they love and that they want to keep playing. So that's why I said in my prepared remarks that we're currently still on track to deliver our key content in the second half of this year, and my primary focus is to ensure that we continue to execute on these top priorities."

So when we think about competition, Blizzard is full of gamers, and we're always excited when new games release. We think new titles are good for players. They bring fresh ideas, and that's really something that everything -- or that's something that everyone benefits from. The industry is big enough for lots of different teams to be successful. And we found that if we are focused on gameplay first and then we continue to listen to our community feedback, we experience great results. 
And so I'm really proud of the Hearthstone team and what they've accomplished, especially recently. Under the leadership with an expanded development team, they've delivered larger content updates to players and have really maintained a high-quality bar we set for ourselves. 
We rolled out the first major new game mode, which was Battlegrounds in November, as we've talked about, and we've seen it bring players back and continue to drive renewed engagement in the game. 
And then last month, we launched the latest expansion, which was Ashes of Outland, and that's the first game that we've launched while we were in a working-from-home environment. And that expansion introduced the game's first new class, so the first new class that's ever been added to the game since launch, the Demon Hunter, and brought about really some of the biggest fundamental changes that the game has seen today. 
The sentiment around the new features and the new content is very positive. And as a result of the steady updates in the game, we saw increased engagement in Q1 versus Q4 and further uptakes in April. The Hearthstone team is looking to build on that momentum with a really good pipeline of content still later to come this year. 
And then one of the things we've learned is that Battlegrounds has proven that new modes can drive meaningful engagement. And so the team is thinking about that as part of their future planning going forward."

So let me first step back and set the context of what we're seeing here in Q1. You heard us talk about it, which is, in the past few quarters, we've been focusing on growing that audience of players and also payers. And so in Q3 and Q4 last year, we grew the Candy player base. And then in Q3, we started introducing initiatives that are aimed at broadening the payer reach across the network, which started improving the payer conversion mechanics in the second half of last year. So back then when we did that, you heard me talk about that there would be a trade-off in the near-term bookings, but we thought that's the right thing to do for the business for the long-term health of that business. 
So we've seen that through the introduction of the right content and timely offers contextually placed, more players start coming into the ecosystem and more payers start coming into the ecosystem. So in Q1, we went further with that approach, both on content and on offer management, and we started broadening our reach of the player investment initiatives. So we started building on top of that momentum in Candy, and we started expanding to all of our network in Q1. And so as that player base started growing steadily in the quarter, we started seeing kind of that momentum build. And in March, we saw even further acceleration. 
And then on the payer conversion, we started seeing some really encouraging results in Q1, and in fact, kind of in Q1, we saw the strong sequential improvement in payers that we've seen in many years. So the trends have really kind of started looking very favorable, and that's improved in April. So I'm really pleased with how the ecosystem has been building up, not just in Q1 but all the things that we've been doing from a content perspective and from a player engagement mechanics perspective in the past few quarters to get to here. 
So when I look ahead, you'll expect us to continue to do this. You'll expect content from us. You'll continue to expect more ways that we optimize offerings for different players to kind of go after those broader motivations. And the good news here is that you're -- you won't see the drag on Q2 bookings that we would have otherwise expected because of this really strong engagement that we're seeing. And then we add on top of that, that we can grow this network now more efficiently, as I just answered before. 
So I think the combination of all of those really kind of tend to the network. And then where we continue to keep the players active is really about what the King team does incredibly well, which is innovating the content pipeline and the features within what's happening in the game to keep these players engaged and continue to kind of drive towards players and payer numbers increasing over time. So that's kind of, I think, the -- what you're seeing now, but it's kind of the combination of everything that we've been building over the past few quarters."

Let me first convey our sympathies to those who have suffered during this difficult time. While very few of our own team members have contracted COVID-19, a number of our employees have been impacted by the illness and the passing of family members. Our thoughts and prayers are with them and everyone else affected by the pandemic. 
Quite honestly, I've been awestruck during the last 2 months by the strength of our employees and their families, managing through unprecedented challenges from health care to child care. Our teams around the world have shown ingenuity and incredible resilience. And even faced with so many difficulties, our employees still ensured that the joy, the social connection and the unexpected benefits of gaming as a way to keep our 400 million players around the world connected and engaged and safely at home has continued without interruption.
Our employees and their families have shown incredible empathy for those affected by the pandemic in their communities and across the world. They've organized meal deliveries, care for the elderly, even the use of their own 3D printers to create high-quality facial protection for their colleagues. Our teams have shown unwavering support for the first responders, nurses, doctors and medical professionals working tirelessly in unimaginable conditions. 
Our corporate social responsibility initiatives have been expanded to support programs to provide health care professionals with a variety of resources, including faster, more effective testing and the use of tools like convalescent blood transfusion as a possible method of immunization. We've also increased our direct support for military families by millions of dollars. 
Through our team's dedication and incredibly hard work under very difficult circumstances, we delivered results significantly above our outlook for the first quarter, and this momentum will likely continue for the second quarter. I've conducted almost 100 earnings calls, and none was under a backdrop of so much uncertainty for the future. 
Our mission to connect and engage the world through epic entertainment has never been more meaningful than it is today. At a time when so many forms of social interactions and entertainment experiences have been shut down, we're providing entertainment with positive impact for hundreds of millions of people through our games. Our content and connecting members of our communities around the world is critically important. 
Our development and commercial teams quickly adapted to this new work environment, and as of now, we're on track to deliver compelling new content, including the World of Warcraft Shadowlands expansion and the next premium Call of Duty release, both of which are planned for the second half of the year. Our esports organization has quickly pivoted to remote production and continues to deliver live esports for both the Call of Duty League and the Overwatch League, a direct result of the hard work and flexibility of our team owners and our sponsors. 
In the face of unprecedented circumstances, our extraordinary teams also delivered extremely strong first quarter financial results. We significantly exceeded our outlook for both revenue and earnings per share. We reached new heights for first quarter net bookings across each of mobile, console and PC, and we exited the quarter with accelerating engagement and momentum across the business as people around the world turn to our content for entertainment and connection. 
Performance in the quarter was led by Call of Duty, which is achieving tremendous scale and momentum across platforms, geographies and business models. Following industry-leading launches for Call of Duty Mobile and Modern Warfare in the fourth quarter of 2019, the franchise raised the bar even higher with the launch of Warzone in March. With a free-to-play business model and cross-platform play, Warzone expanded Modern Warfare's reach, engagement and player investment. Warzone to date has brought in over 60 million players since its launch. 
The exceptional results for Call of Duty reflect our team's remarkable execution as they innovate and take on new commercial challenges to grow and better serve our community. Their success demonstrates that free-to-play experiences across mobile, console and PC not only extend the reach of a franchise but can also lead to strong in-game monetization and sales of premium content. Call of Duty's success highlights the great potential across our portfolio as we continue to focus on extending our fully owned intellectual property to new platforms, new geographies and new business models. 
Blizzard also recorded strong growth in the first quarter led by World of Warcraft. After doubling in the second half of 2019, the WoW active community grew further in Q1. Blizzard is seeing strong increases in engagement across our franchises as people around the world stay home, adding to business momentum as our game teams execute against the strongest pipeline of content in Blizzard's history. 
At King, Candy Crush was again the top-grossing game franchise across U.S. app stores with engagement increasing sharply towards the end of the quarter. To enable our community to play even more as a part of the stay-at-home initiative, in late March, King offered unlimited free lives across many of their titles, resulting in the number of game rounds played in a single day shattering all prior records. Momentum continued to increase in April with strong year-over-year growth in reach, engagement and player investment. 
As we build on our strong first quarter results and our continuing momentum, I'm excited to introduce our new President and Chief Operating Officer, Daniel Alegre. From his long tenure at Google, Daniel brings deep experience building direct digital relationships with consumers, fostering strategic relationships with key industry partners and driving rapid growth internationally and in early-stage businesses. His expertise and commitment to excellence and execution will be his focus. 
I'd also like to thank Coddy Johnson for his extraordinary contributions to the continued success of the company during his 12-year tenure and for being a truly, truly valued friend. 
Of course, our strong business performance wouldn't be possible without the efforts of our dedicated, talented and truly empathic teams around the world. We are so grateful for the work you're doing under extremely challenging circumstances. We're also appreciative of the continued support of our shareholders, partners and players, and we wish you and your families health and safety through what remains a difficult time. 
And now Daniel will review the highlights of our operations with you."

I'm glad to be with you all for my first earnings call as COO and really proud to be part of a company so deeply connected to its mission during this really challenging time. I want to start by first expressing my deepest sympathies to",2049,"Thank you, Bobby. I'm glad to be with you all for my first earnings call as COO and really proud to be part of a company so deeply connected to its mission during this really challenging time. 
I want to start by first expressing my deepest sympathies to all those affected by this health crisis and expressing thanks on behalf of the entire company to all those on the front lines of the battle against the COVID pandemic. I would also like to thank our employees for their commitment to our players and to each other, particularly under such a unique and difficult environment we are currently living in. 
But before I discuss our recent operational highlights, I'd like to share with you my focus and priorities. They are simple: execution, execution and execution. We have great franchises, and we will get back to what we are known for: superb execution. 
As Bobby said, the health and safety of our employees and their families remains our priority. I'd like to expand on the measures we are taking to keep our employees and their families safe and address our expectations for our development pipeline for the remainder of the year. 
All our offices had moved to work from home environments by mid-March, and we are fortunate to have had very few cases of COVID-19 across the company. Now we are insuring our employees and their family members are receiving the best possible care, and we're covering all costs of testing and treatment for affected employees and their families. We have increased access to telehealth resources and contracted private doctors and medical support in regions where employees live and work. We have had additional services to our already best-in-class health benefits and ensured that employees have access to the mental and physical well-being and support they need while at home. And we are continuing to find other ways to support our employees and their families, including services to help families balance work and home life. 
Now turning to development. The digital nature of our content means our creative talent can continue to work on our product pipeline from home. Although the shift to remote working does add complexity and challenges in some areas of the game development process, including creative collaboration, motion capture, voice-over work, localization and quality assurance, we are implementing mitigation measures to each, and to address each of these areas. Importantly, based on the work to date, we still expect to deliver a robust slate of content over the remainder of the year. This includes the next premium release of Call of Duty, 2 titles based on library IP from Activision, the World of Warcraft Shadowlands expansion, regional testing for new mobile titles and ongoing live operations across our key franchises. 
Regardless of location, our teams remain focused on executing against our 4 strategic growth pillars, as Bobby has laid out: first, delivering a strong, consistent cadence of major new content releases; second, driving live operations with ongoing in-game content, services, features and events; third, expanding King's industry-leading mobile success and extending our acclaimed console and PC franchises to mobile; and finally, building new engagement models around our franchises, including advertising, esports and consumer products. Now more than ever, players new and existing are looking for connection through epic entertainment. And our mission is to make that available to them in whatever form they find most convenient. 
Now turning to our first quarter results. We significantly exceeded our outlook, driven primarily by overperformance for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare throughout the quarter, including a highly successful start for our new free-to-play Call of Duty: Warzone. We also continued -- saw continued momentum for World of Warcraft and better-than-expected results for other key franchises in the second half of March as populations sheltering at home in many of our key regions turned to our content for entertainment and social connection. These trends have continued so far in the second quarter with business performance accelerating further in April. 
Now starting with Activision, MAUs more than doubled over the prior year, reaching 102 million, as Call of Duty delivered remarkable growth across multiple vectors. As we've discussed on prior calls, we made significant changes with the launch of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare to enhance the player experience, expand the community and deepen engagement. We added cross-platform play, introduced a new in-game content system and removed the season pass to keep our players closer together. Modern Warfare entered the year with strong momentum, achieving substantial year-over-year growth in engagement, premium game sales and in-game net bookings in both January and February. 
And the launch of Warzone on console and PC on March 10 really took the franchise to new heights. Warzone is a massive free-to-play experience, where up to 150 players compete in a range of modes on a vast map, featuring cross-play and in-game system entirely integrated with the Modern Warfare Battle Pass. Warzone adds yet more compelling content for our Modern Warfare community and also enables an entirely new set of players around the world to experience Call of Duty for free. This response has been incredible. Warzone has brought in more than 60 million players since the launch, including many on the PC platform and in countries beyond Call of Duty's traditional regions. We are seeing the free-to-play experience driving strong incremental sales on the premium Modern Warfare title, adding to its sales momentum entering the year and rising demand from stay-at-home conditions. 
Modern Warfare sell-through in Q1 was the highest ever for a Call of Duty title outside of the launch quarter. Life to date, Modern Warfare has sold through more units and has more players than any prior Call of Duty title at this point after its release. Warzone also contributed to a further acceleration in Modern Warfare's in-game net bookings, which more than doubled year-over-year versus the prior game in Q1, even with the removal of the Season Pass. And this momentum has only strengthened. The third season of in-game content launched in April and is Call of Duty's best performing to date for both engagement and player investment. 
With the new free-to-play experience contributing to a massively expanded audience, unprecedented momentum in premium game sales and robust in-game growth, we expect Modern Warfare's net bookings this year to be the highest for a Call of Duty game in the year after launch. And looking ahead, the next premium release for Call of Duty already looks great and remains on track for release later this year. 
On the mobile platform, the Call of Duty Mobile team continued to build on last October's breakout launch with new content, features and events aimed at optimizing engagement, retention and player investment. The team started to deliver an accelerated cadence of content in March, launching new seasonal events every 4 weeks, twice as frequently as previously. The combination of increasingly compelling content and events and stay-at-home dynamics drove the growth in reach and engagement in March, and player investment has followed with April's season 5 delivering the highest monthly in-game net bookings since season 1. With deep engagement, substantial content in the pipeline and opportunities to further refine the in-game system, we expect Call of Duty Mobile to be an increasing contributor over time. 
Q1 also saw the launch of the inaugural season of the professional Call of Duty League. Originally planned in a local city-based home stand format, we quickly pivoted all matches to online play and remote production for the remainder of the regular season to keep our players and fans safe while still delivering premium esports content to a global audience. With Call of Duty demonstrating the power of our franchise model across platforms, geographies and business model, and premium content on track for the fall, we really couldn't be more excited about the growth trajectory for 2020 and beyond. 
Now turning to Blizzard. MAUs were 32 million in Q1 with each of Blizzard's key franchises experiencing a month-on-month increase in reach in March. 
World of Warcraft continued its strong momentum in the quarter as the team continued to deliver more content between expansions than ever before. Having doubled its active community in the second half of last year, the number of players on monthly or longer-term subscription plans increased further in Q1. Reach and engagement were particularly strong as regions introduced shelter-at-home measures through the quarter, with momentum increasing further in April. 
The community continues to engage deeply in Classic, a recreation of our original WoW from 15 years ago, which has delivered substantial content drops in recent months and has much more to come later in the year. Reach and engagement also increased for modern WoW, which again received a major content drop in Q1. And this increased activity drove accelerating presales of Shadowlands, the next expansion for modern WoW, which is slated for the second half of the year. 
Hearthstone continued to deliver improved engagement trends in the first quarter, driven by the launch of the new Battlegrounds auto battler mode in November and strong execution in live operations. 
Overwatch also experienced a meaningful increase in engagement in March as its latest seasonal event coincided with stay-at-home effects. And fans continue to engage with the franchise through the Overwatch League, which successfully moved to online play and remote production during the quarter. 
And finally, Diablo Immortal is shaping up very well. We remain on track to begin regional testing for the game in the middle of the year. 
At King, MAUs were 273 million, increasing 10% from the fourth quarter. MAUs grew month-on-month in January and February and then accelerated further in March as shelter-at-home conditions came into effect. King's key franchises -- franchise, Candy Crush, grew MAUs year-over-year in each month of the quarter with double-digit growth in March. And within the Candy franchise, the community played more rounds of games in any quarter since the 2016 acquisition. Now in terms of player investment, Candy Crush Saga remained the top-grossing title across U.S. app stores, and the wider Candy franchise was once again #1. 
We previously discussed King's initiatives to bring back lapsed payers and attract new payers into the ecosystem, positioning the business for stronger growth over the medium and long term. And as expected, these initiatives dampened in-game net bookings again in Q1, but they contributed to ongoing improvement in payer trends in January and February before payers' numbers -- payer numbers stepped up further in both March and April. And with strengthening engagement and payer trends, we've seen King's in-game net bookings grow by low double-digit percentage year-over-year April. 
While we saw improving trends in King's in-game business, which represents a significant majority of the segment's net bookings, the advertising business slowed towards the end of the quarter. Advertising grew over 75% year-over-year for the first quarter, then moderated a bit in April against the backdrop of a sudden decline in demand across the digital advertising sector, albeit still growing over 20% year-on-year in April. While we assume the environment will remain challenging, we do expect growth for the full year as we roll out more ads to more players, enhance our infrastructure to deliver the highest value adds to each player and broaden both our base of advertisers and demand partners. 
I also note that the combination of King's strong in-game trends and the current situation in the ad market is creating more opportunities for the business to cost effectively bring players into the network, expanding its audience and further boosting its MAU trajectory. The same is true across our other business units. 
So in summary, we entered the year with strong momentum in some of our biggest franchises, which only increased further through the quarter. Our employees are showing remarkable dedication as they take on the responsibility of delivering the highest-quality content to our expanded communities. And I couldn't be more excited to be part of this great and dedicated global team. I am focused on executing on our priorities as we deliver against the substantial opportunity to extend our largest IP across new platforms, geographies and business models and work on the strongest pipeline in our company's history. 
I will now hand over the call to Dennis to discuss our Q1 financial results and outlook. Dennis?"

Today, I will review our Q1 2020 results as well as our outlook for 2020 and the second quarter. But before I start, I'd just like to echo Daniel and Bobby's sentiments about the unique environment we're in and share my sincerest sympathies to those who have been affected directly by it as well as my thanks and gratitude to all our teams and employees who have so seamlessly transitioned into this new work environment we find ourselves in. 
Our digitally native business model, both on the production and the distribution side of our business, makes us well positioned to deliver world-class content and experiences for our players. Our teams take our mission and our responsibility to deliver fun and social engagement to our players in this tough time very seriously. They really didn't miss a beat during all this transition, and you can see the strong results of those efforts in our Q1 results and increased full year guidance. 
Our first quarter revenue and earnings were well ahead of our prior outlook primarily driven by our investment in creative and commercial initiatives for Call of Duty delivering better-than-expected results throughout the quarter. In addition, World of Warcraft continued to overdeliver, and other key franchises and catalog sales also exceeded our outlook, benefiting from stronger demand towards the end of the quarter as consumers sheltered at home in many of our key regions. 
To review the quarter, I will start with our segment results. Activision revenue was $519 million, growing 64% year-over-year. Growth was driven by Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and Warzone in-game revenues, strong game sales of premium Modern Warfare and the addition of Call of Duty Mobile. Operating income was $184 million with an operating margin of 35%, 12 percentage points higher year-over-year. 
Blizzard revenue was $452 million, increasing 31% year-over-year, reflecting strong growth for World of Warcraft and the release of Warcraft III Reforged in the quarter. Operating income was $197 million. Blizzard's operating margin was 44%, significantly higher year-over-year, primarily due to strong revenue growth. 
King's revenue of $498 million was roughly flat sequentially and lower year-over-year driven primarily by King's actions to prioritize mobile payer engagement in the quarter. The ads business grew over 75% year-over-year. Operating income was $156 million with an operating margin of 31%, lower than a year ago due to lower revenues and higher operating expenses as King made disciplined investments in expanding its player network. Across our segments, in-game net bookings grew 20% year-over-year to $956 million. 
Now let's turn to our overall consolidated results. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be referencing non-GAAP figures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. 
For the quarter, we generated Q1 GAAP revenues of $1.79 billion, $148 million above our February guidance. This includes the net recognition of deferrals of $266 million. Net bookings of $1.52 billion were $247 million above our February outlook. We incurred GAAP-only restructuring and related charges of $23 million, and we generated Q1 GAAP EPS of $0.65 and Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $0.76, which was $0.10 above guidance. These figures include the net recognition of deferrals of $0.18. 
In terms of cash flow, the increasingly digital, recurring and cash-generative nature of our business remains one of our fundamental strengths. This powers a strong balance sheet, which continues to be an important strategic asset for the company, especially now. In Q1, we delivered operating cash flow of $148 million, lower year-over-year despite higher operating income due to cash payments for tax settlements and working capital timing. Our cash and investments at the end of March were approximately $6 billion, and we ended the quarter with a net cash position of approximately $3.3 billion. And as previously announced, this week, we will pay an annual dividend of $0.41 per share, 11% higher year-over-year. 
Now let's turn to our outlook for Q2 and the full year. In Q2, Activision plans to deliver 2 seasons of in-game content for Modern Warfare and Warzone versus 1 season in the first quarter. Season 3 has already launched very successfully in April. Activision also released Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 remastered on PC and Xbox One following the PS4 release in late Q1, and they plan to continue delivering new features, events and seasons for Call of Duty Mobile. 
In April, Blizzard launched its latest Hearthstone expansion, Ashes of Outland, and through the quarter, we'll continue to support other key franchises with Indian content. And King will continue to deliver innovative features, events and live ops across its portfolio. 
Turning to the second half of the year. Our planned slate includes a new Call of Duty premium title, 2 releases based on our extensive library of IP from Activision and Blizzard's Shadowlands expansion for World of Warcraft. We will also continue to deliver in-game experiences for our other key franchises across our portfolio, and we continue to expect to begin regional playtesting for Diablo Immortal and certain other mobile titles. Although as discussed last quarter, we don't include any material revenue from these new mobile titles in our guidance. 
Before I discuss the specifics of our outlook, I'll provide some context. The full extent of the impact of the pandemic on our financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to fully predict at this time. While we have seen a positive impact on demand, there are also risks related to global economic weakness, rising unemployment, pressures on retail channel, pricing and other factors where we have limited visibility currently. We have tried to be prudent in our guidance to account for these effects, and we believe there is a potential for overperformance if these risks do not materialize. 
Now the addition of the Warzone free-to-play experience has further increased the reach, engagement and player investment in Call of Duty, building on an existing strength for Modern Warfare and creating a strong foundation for future financial performance. As discussed, we are also seeing increased demand for our other franchises as interest in gaming grows. 
The current environment creates the potential for a structural opportunity to bring more players into our communities who we can then engage and retain for the long term and to accelerate the continuing shift towards digital sales in our business. We have attempted to be conservative in our assumptions around the impact of these trends beyond the second quarter, but the backdrop does create greater potential for operating overperformance later this year. 
Since we provided our initial guidance in February, the strengthening dollar has resulted in an additional FX headwind to full year net bookings of approximately $100 million, and the combination of FX and lower interest income from declining interest rates represent, in aggregate, approximately $0.08 of headwind to our full year GAAP and non-GAAP EPS versus our prior outlook. Overall though, with strong momentum across the business, we are raising our outlook for net bookings, revenue and EPS for the year. And in the case of EPS, we are raising by an amount greater than our first quarter overperformance despite the FX and interest rate headwinds I just described. 
Now let me get into specifics. For Q2, on a GAAP basis, we now expect revenues of $1.69 billion, including the net recognition of deferrals of $15 million. We expect net bookings of $1.68 billion; product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 19%; and operating expenses, including software amortization, of 48%; and a GAAP-only restructuring charge of approximately $20 million. We expect a tax rate of 21%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 776 million and EPS of $0.54. 
For Q2 on a non-GAAP basis, we now expect product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 19% and operating expenses, including software amortization, of 43%. We expect a tax rate of 19% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.64, including net deferrals of $0.01. 
On a GAAP basis for 2020, we now expect revenues of $6.8 billion, including net deferrals of $100 million. We now expect net bookings of $6.9 billion for the year; product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 19%; operating expenses, including software amortization, of 48%; and a GAAP-only restructuring charge of approximately $50 million. We now expect a GAAP tax rate of 20%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 778 million and GAAP EPS of $2.22. 
For 2020, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 20%; and operating expenses, including software amortization, of 42%. We expect a tax rate of 19% and non-GAAP EPS of $2.62, including the net recognition of deferrals of $0.02. 
So in closing, our business has accelerating momentum from the dual tailwinds of strong execution in our largest franchises following last year's investments and increased development capacity and expanded reach and engagement as people turn to our interactive content as they shelter at home. We are humbled that so many people are turning to our content for solace, joy and connection in this challenging time, and we'll continue to stay focused on delivering the high-quality experiences that they have come to expect from us.

I think the short answer to the question is that Warzone has definitely been accretive to the franchise. And it's become and it is a really important part of the overall franchise ecosystem that we're creating. And I think it's worth just talking about that a bit. 
Since the last few calls, we've been discussing, bringing our community together through a number of player-focused initiatives, and that started with cross-plays, so all the friends can just get together no matter what platform you're on. It was about the free content to our community at the same time, and it was about kind of the new deterministic content system we put in the game. And of course, in the backdrop here, you have Modern Warfare, which has been just a fantastic game that gets better over time. And then what we really did is amplified all this with the launch of Warzone, our massive-scale battle royale experience. 
And when you look at Warzone, it was definitely built to provide endless fun on its own and to stand on its own as a great game, but Warzone and Modern Warfare are also obviously connected in many ways, including through shared progression systems, game systems and content offerings. And what we're seeing right now in Warzone is a large number of players choosing to upgrade to the premium Modern Warfare game and experience everything that the Modern Warfare universe has to offer. And so far, the number of upgrades to premium that we're seeing are definitely above our initial expectations, and that's really great to see. 
And also, across this universe, the Modern Warfare universe, from an engagement perspective, we're also seeing franchise highs now in daily average unique players, peak concurrent players, and overall player investment has been indicated on the call so far. So regarding the future of Warzone, we know how much the community is loving it. We know how much they're enjoying the experience so far. So we're going to continue to invest in this significantly in terms of content, events, new modes, new ways to play and really just a ton more in the future. 
And to follow-up on the last part of your question, I think what I would say is, yes, we believe it has the potential to positively impact future premium games as well, and so we're excited about that opportunity. 
And before I jump off, I would also just like to thank all our Activision publishing, development teams and all our employees for keeping all of our critical projects on track. This shift to work from home has been a massive logistical exercise across the organization, and the teams have done just an outstanding job, and I just wanted to close this question by a big thank you to them. 
But again, Mario, thanks for the question. I appreciate it."

Clearly, it's obviously a scenario we'd all love to see, which is life returning to back to normal as soon as possible. But the reality is that we really don't know what that new normal will look like once that comes to pass. It does seem like that there is a likelihood that even once shelter at home ends, that there may be -- it may be a fair amount of time before people are really returning to normal as we know it. 
So we do think that there is potentially an acceleration to the structural change that we've seen in consumer entertainment, consumption patterns that we've already been seeing in gaming, and that trend could persist for the long term, which would obviously benefit social yet socially distant categories like gaming. We've already seen this with the younger generation of consumers, where gaming is more an integrated part of their social and entertainment fabric. And times like these will make that activity, we believe, even more mainstream. We're obviously trying to lean into this and welcome as many players into our ecosystem as possible and bring more gamers into our communities and give them a compelling experience that hopefully turns them into long-term fans. 
We don't really have any great data points right now on what happens to consumption when people return from shelter at home. But we have seen in Asia that the strong momentum continues even as they've started to transition back. So we hope that's a sign of the similar opportunity we may have in other parts of the world as they start to return to normal as well. 
So generally speaking, we think there's a pretty big opportunity here to see an acceleration in the long-term structural shifts that we've already seen from the existing heightened engagement.

Thank you for the question. Before I answer, I want to take a step back and just say we're really thankful that our games are able to play a part in helping bring people together during what's really an unprecedented and challenging time for us all. In World of Warcraft, it was is a very -- it's been [ fortunate to be able to ] engineer it as a very social experience, and that's as true today as the day we launched. Over time, we listened to feedback from the community, and the game has evolved to what we now call the modern game, which has really expanded the breadth and the depth of gameplay as well as making it easier to kind of find friends, group up, make progress or play alone, all within the social environment. At the same time, we've seen a lot of good work in returning -- experience for players returning to the classic WoW experience. 
So today, we think about World of Warcraft as a single community under one subscription where players can enjoy both WoW Classic and modern WoW, and we release a steady stream of content for both. The variety of different experiences has always been a strength of the game, and it's been good to see players resonate -- that resonate with players as they see a lot of what they're looking for in World of Warcraft. 
We've seen particularly strong engagement with Classic in the East, and the momentum has continued in those regions even as they have started to come back to work. And we saw Western subscribers grow in March driven by players returning to modern WoW, primarily, and this has contributed to strong presales for Shadowlands. The momentum we saw in March across both modes continues with the active community growing faster than it ever has and that's outside of an expansion launch period. 
On the development side, our teams have done a really good job in shifting to work from home. We're able to welcome select players into the closed alpha for Shadowlands last month. And thanks to the hard work of the team, Shadowlands is on track to launch in Q4 this year. 
And lastly, before I hand off the call -- or I hand off to the next question, I really want to thank all the Blizzard employees during this difficult time. It's been really amazing to kind of see everyone come together in a positive way."

Thanks so much for the question. So we exited 2019, as you heard, with strong momentum in the ads business, and that's continued in Q1, where we saw in the quarter that we delivered over 75% year-on-year growth.

So we exited 2019, as you heard, with strong momentum in the ads business, and that's continued in Q1, where we saw in the quarter that we delivered over 75% year-on-year growth. And as you mentioned in the question, we saw deceleration towards the end of March within the broader advertising ecosystem, but the business did grow 20% year-on-year in April, over 20% in April. 
So let me answer your question by talking a little bit of what we're doing going forward. I think about the things that we're already doing and what not to continue. And that's about rolling out more ads to more players, broadening our advertiser base and working with more partners as we continue to build our tech infrastructure. But now we're actually increasing some focus areas that we see as kind of in the short and medium term will provide opportunities. So we're going to the brand advertisers and doubling down on the relationships in those sectors that aren't experiencing slowdowns and they are experiencing actually sustained demand for their products. So the team is quite active there. 
We're also starting to leverage quite a bit of advertiser interest in very differentiated products like the sponsorship product that we have, which was new to our ecosystem and seeing some really nice advertiser interest, and that really amplifies the value proposition of the King network in this environment. 
And then we are rolling out a new technology in our games, and that's become the focus. That allows us to really optimize our demand and get higher CPMs for the ads that we are showing. And that's been a focus in this quarter and continues to be for the year. 
So if you add that plus you look at our network, which is truly global and international, what we're doing is we're looking at it as a pretty diversified set of opportunities. So when regions are starting to experience some recovery before others, we focus our efforts there as the opportunity may sit geographically in some places at a certain point in time. So with all of that, my expectation is that the advertising business does deliver growth this year. 
On your point on acquisition costs, that's the flip side of this. So what we're seeing is while we see that some advertisers [indiscernible] as King are seeing an opportunity to bring new players more efficiently than ever to our network. And when you couple that with a very different approach, it's great for us for the medium and long term. So when we do that, of course, that reinforces kind of both the in-app side of the house, the game business and the advertising number as we continue to invest in the network. 
So yes, again, kind of to echo a lot of what my colleagues have said, and before I hand back to the operator, I just want to [ thank the global ] King team and the employees across King, who have really not missed a beat as we have experienced something quite remarkable in going to work from home pretty quickly. And so a big thanks from me for the team and the incredible work that they're doing."

There's not really any precedent for what's going on right now in the economy, which definitely makes us cautious and careful maybe more so than normal. 
Relatively speaking, however, we do feel pretty good about the value proposition of our content even in tough times. There's not great past precedents, obviously, for where we are. But you can look at least back to the past 2 market dislocations in 2001 and 2008 for at least some directional indication of how gaming has performed in challenging economic times. And what we've seen is the consumer recreational spending in the U.S., for example, was fairly resilient during those downturns. 
And if you hone in a little more specifically on entertainment, the global gaming industry fared extremely well and actually grew low to mid-single digits in these time periods, whereas broader consumer recreational spending declined low single digits, and that -- we think that's driven by the low cost per hour of gaming, which makes it a great value versus other forms of entertainment. And so if you compare that to the situation we're in now, where other forms of location-based entertainment, like going to movies, concerts, sporting events, whatever those may be, and they may not be available for some time -- for consumers for some period of time, this may also drive some share shift to gaming from those other categories. And thankfully, in contrast to other forms of media, we're very fortunate that the digital nature of our business enables us to not only distribute content remotely but to produce it remotely. So obviously an advantage for us to keep our content fresh. 
Another point is in those past recessions in 2001 and 2008, gaming has come a long way since then. Obviously, it's much more social and more connected and more mainstream, and our business is much more diversified, too, across platforms, geographies, types of games, which is helpful when times get challenging. On the flip side, there obviously are more free ways for players to play games than there have been. So there could be more engagement with slightly weaker monetization. But in the long term, we kind of view that as an opportunity as well because that usually normalizes itself. 
So I'd say there's puts and takes across the spectrum, but -- which is why with all this uncertainty in the economy, we tried to reflect these risks as we think about forecasting the business. But the strong momentum we're seeing gives us, obviously, confidence in raising our outlook even with this challenging backdrop."

I think it's important to probably first just step back and think about what our goal has been through all this. And the goal has been pretty simple. And what we wanted to do is provide players around the world a real fun, high-quality and, I think importantly, an authentic Call of Duty experience regardless of what platform you play on, where you happen to live or what business model really motivates you to play. And that's exactly what we've delivered across mobile, across console and across PC. 
And if you look at some of the metrics over the last 6 months, then you've seen Q4 and both in Q1, we've crossed over 100 million MAUs and dramatically increasing our player base. And a lot of that has been driven by Mobile and Warzone, of course, as is the ongoing success of Modern Warfare driving that. But through Mobile and Warzone, we're definitely reaching new audiences and new geographies in ways that we just haven't before. And as I look at Call of Duty right now, it's more global today than at any point in time in its history in terms of audience profile, and that's pretty exciting for us to see. 
So a little bit on your question on engagement. And for us, when it comes to engagement, what we've seen really time and time again is that engagement just tends to drive engagement. And so for us, exposure on what platform is driving engagement across other platform and other experiences, so we actually like to see that cross over a lot. 
And in terms of the investment part of your question, that also is looking additive to us across this ecosystem as well. In the previous question, I talked about Warzone and how we're seeing that as being accretive to the franchise overall. And with respect to CoD Mobile then, specifically, when you take a look at it, we're seeing really great momentum there. It was referenced earlier that season 5 just concluded, and it's our best-performing season in terms of engagement and in-game performance since the first season. And Season 6 just launched on May 1. And so that's off to a really strong start as well. 
So for me, when I look at it and I see the positive trends on mobile as a platform but coming at a time we're having record engagement and record performance across console and PC, and to me, that's a pretty clear indication that what we're seeing on Call of Duty Mobile is delivering incremental results for the franchise as well. So the ecosystem the way we're looking at right now seems to be working incredibly well. And in terms of mobile, in terms of our strategy, it remains a critical part of our overall plans going forward and a key investment area for us. 
And just speaking of the ecosystem, I'd probably just close by, obviously, a very exciting time for everyone on the franchise right now. And our teams are hyper-focused and passionately focused, most importantly, on delivering great new content and seasons and games to our growing community around the world that we're seeing right now. 
And I guess I would just close by saying we couldn't be more thankful for the incredible and growing community that we're seeing out there around the world for their trust and support, and we look forward to everything that's to come in the future. So thanks for the question."

Look, the vast majority of our developers, they moved to remote work by mid-March as I mentioned in my opening remarks. And really, just credit to all those involved. It was such a huge undertaking. Multifunctional teams across facilities, IT, HR, security operations and other groups really rallied together to make it all happen. 
And we're really fortunate to be in a truly digital business, where the majority of our content creation really can be performed across any location. So the vast majority of our developers, they took their computers home, plugged into secure access and just kept creating. So in some cases, we've had to move high-end computing and graphic rigs to our developers' homes as well. But we were able to do that relatively quickly. So our development teams working on everything from design to art to engineering to production really had most of what they needed to keep working. 
That being said, it's not easy as there are aspects of building our games that are more challenging via remote work, like collaborative design, in-person user research, motion capture, voice-over and QA. So we've really had to find some creative solutions to work through these, like for record voice-overs, we did that remotely. We've also enabled new secure access systems for some of the functions where large groups are engaging. 
But so far and based on what we can see and with true ingenuity and creativity from the teams, we're managing through this as best as we can. And what's really important is we just need to continue to provide our communities with the innovative content and features that they love and that they want to keep playing.

So when we think about competition, Blizzard is full of gamers, and we're always excited when new games release. We think new titles are good for players. They bring fresh ideas, and that's really something that everything -- or that's something that everyone benefits from. The industry is big enough for lots of different teams to be successful. And we found that if we are focused on gameplay first and then we continue to listen to our community feedback, we experience great results. 
And so I'm really proud of the Hearthstone team and what they've accomplished, especially recently. Under the leadership with an expanded development team, they've delivered larger content updates to players and have really maintained a high-quality bar we set for ourselves. 
We rolled out the first major new game mode, which was Battlegrounds in November, as we've talked about, and we've seen it bring players back and continue to drive renewed engagement in the game. 
And then last month, we launched the latest expansion, which was Ashes of Outland, and that's the first game that we've launched while we were in a working-from-home environment. And that expansion introduced the game's first new class, so the first new class that's ever been added to the game since launch, the Demon Hunter, and brought about really some of the biggest fundamental changes that the game has seen today. 
The sentiment around the new features and the new content is very positive. And as a result of the steady updates in the game, we saw increased engagement in Q1 versus Q4 and further uptakes in April. The Hearthstone team is looking to build on that momentum with a really good pipeline of content still later to come this year. 
And then one of the things we've learned is that Battlegrounds has proven that new modes can drive meaningful engagement. And so the team is thinking about that as part of their future planning going forward."

So let me first step back and set the context of what we're seeing here in Q1. You heard us talk about it, which is, in the past few quarters, we've been focusing on growing that audience of players and also payers. And so in Q3 and Q4 last year, we grew the Candy player base. And then in Q3, we started introducing initiatives that are aimed at broadening the payer reach across the network, which started improving the payer conversion mechanics in the second half of last year. So back then when we did that, you heard me talk about that there would be a trade-off in the near-term bookings, but we thought that's the right thing to do for the business for the long-term health of that business. 
So we've seen that through the introduction of the right content and timely offers contextually placed, more players start coming into the ecosystem and more payers start coming into the ecosystem. So in Q1, we went further with that approach, both on content and on offer management, and we started broadening our reach of the player investment initiatives. So we started building on top of that momentum in Candy, and we started expanding to all of our network in Q1. And so as that player base started growing steadily in the quarter, we started seeing kind of that momentum build. And in March, we saw even further acceleration. 
And then on the payer conversion, we started seeing some really encouraging results in Q1, and in fact, kind of in Q1, we saw the strong sequential improvement in payers that we've seen in many years. So the trends have really kind of started looking very favorable, and that's improved in April. So I'm really pleased with how the ecosystem has been building up, not just in Q1 but all the things that we've been doing from a content perspective and from a player engagement mechanics perspective in the past few quarters to get to here. 
So when I look ahead, you'll expect us to continue to do this. You'll expect content from us. You'll continue to expect more ways that we optimize offerings for different players to kind of go after those broader motivations. And the good news here is that you're -- you won't see the drag on Q2 bookings that we would have otherwise expected because of this really strong engagement that we're seeing. And then we add on top of that, that we can grow this network now more efficiently, as I just answered before. 
So I think the combination of all of those really kind of tend to the network. And then where we continue to keep the players active is really about what the King team does incredibly well, which is innovating the content pipeline and the features within what's happening in the game to keep these players engaged and continue to kind of drive towards players and payer numbers increasing over time. So that's kind of, I think, the -- what you're seeing now, but it's kind of the combination of everything that we've been building over the past few quarters."

We hope all of you and your families are safe and healthy. Our employees continue to do an extraordinary job managing family demands, working in challenging circumstances and remaining focused on execution of our stakeholder priorities. Ensuring that our employees and their families have the very best health care, everywhere we operate remains our priority. 
Against the backdrop of the ongoing pandemic and significant social and cultural upheaval, we are delivering entertainment that inspires and unites, helps break down barriers and enables players to forge and sustain friendships and community through gameplay. With billions of gamers worldwide, games provide social interactions that connect people more deeply than any other form of entertainment. 
The investments we have made in new compelling content and experiences within our franchises have helped us expand to almost every country in the world across a wide range of audiences. Today, we have a broad and diverse player base of over 400 million players with over 100 million players in each key region we operate: EMEA, Asia Pacific and the Americas. And we estimate that approximately half of our players are now female. We have an opportunity to grow and serve more players globally as we discover more ways to connect and engage the world through our epic entertainment. 
Our second quarter results significantly exceeded our prior outlook for both revenue and earnings per share, and with continued momentum in our business, we are again raising our full year outlook. Of course, in these uncertain and unpredictable times, our results are subject to change and volatility. 
In the second quarter, our player base grew 30% year-over-year, adding more than 100 million monthly active players. Time spent in our games grew 70% over the same period and Q2 engagement and player investment were at historic highs. We grew net bookings 70% year-over-year, setting new highs for second quarter net bookings on both mobile and console, with operating margin up strongly year-over-year. 
Our results benefited from increased demand from our content as people around the world sheltered at home. This upside varied across businesses and franchises with our most social content seeing the strongest and longer-lasting impact. The biggest driver of our year-over-year engagement and financial performance was Call of Duty, which has seen a remarkable increase in its scale as we expanded the franchise across platforms, geographies and business models. As the world starts to reopen, we believe these actions have delivered a true structural change in the trajectory of our largest franchise, and this is the road map we plan to follow for the many franchises we have in our library, which dates back to 1980. 
The launch of Warzone within the Call of Duty universe has given existing players compelling new content and enabled large numbers of first-time players to unleash their inter military heroes. Over 75 million people have played Warzone since its launch, adding significant reach and engagement to a franchise that already enjoyed strong momentum following the 2019 launches of Modern Warfare and Call of Duty Mobile. 
We've truly seen a step change in the engagement of our franchise, with total time spent in Call of Duty in Q2, more than 8x higher than in the year ago quarter. And as players engage, they're choosing to invest with in-game player investment and sales of premium content, both meaningfully higher than last year. The expansion of the Call of Duty franchise to over 100 million players across PC, console and mobile highlights the scale of the opportunity for our broader portfolio of fully owned intellectual property. 
We're also seeing ongoing momentum from our growth initiatives for world of Warcraft and Candy Crush. And as we execute on our pipeline of major content and live operations on mobile, PC and console, we expect to continue expanding the scale of our franchises. We remain focused on investing in our creative talent, growing our development teams to continue delivering more high-quality content more frequently and continuing to reduce unnecessary process that stifles innovation and creativity. 
With more players in more countries on more platforms and our deep experience across a wide range of business models, we're on track to deliver the strong long-term financial performance that our stakeholders expect. 
I'm incredibly proud of our employees and their families. They have overcome difficulties, demonstrated great empathy and resilience and, through extraordinary circumstance, have remained steadfast in their commitment to meet growing audience demand for our games. And more than ever, there's a growing need for the services of our Call of Duty Endowment, which helps returning veterans transition to the civilian workforce. We, of course, we're delighted to fund a record number of placements in the second quarter and have now helped more than 72,000 veterans find high-quality jobs since we started the Call of Duty Endowment in 2009. 
In the near term, while the economic outlook remains very unclear, the ongoing commitment of our creative and commercial teams should enable us to remain on track to deliver great new content in the second half of the year. We now expect record full year net bookings and earnings per share. Thank you all for your support and your encouragement. Daniel will now review the highlights of our operations for the past quarter with you."
4222231,675644289,2059294,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2020",2020-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bobby.

As you heard, Activision Blizzard significantly exceeded its second quarter outlook. Each of our key franchises delivered better-than-expected results, with growth led by the Call of Duty franchise following the launch of Warzone. During the quarter, we remained laser-focused on driving financial performance through our 3 strategic growth drivers of expanding audience reach, deepening engagement and increasing player investment. Strong execution against these growth drivers enabled us to serve compelling experiences to an expanded gaming audience against a backdrop of demand tailwinds from shelter at home in the quarter. We saw substantial growth in our biggest franchises, and importantly, the increased investment and successful initiatives that drove strong Q2 results also positioned us to continue growing and delighting our global communities and to deliver sustained, greater financial performance over the long term. 
Now turning to our franchise and operational highlights across our business units. Starting with Activision. Monthly active users or MAUs grew more than threefold year-over-year to 125 million. Call of Duty reached new heights in the quarter with reach, engagement and player investment experiencing another step change increase following the launch of Warzone in March. Warzone has now brought in more than 75 million players. In the first full quarter since Warzone launched, hours played in the Modern Warfare universe increased eightfold year-over-year, driven by both existing and new players. As Warzone players engaged, many upgraded to premium Modern Warfare experience. In fact, in Q2, we added more players outside of the launch quarter to the premium Call of Duty experience than ever before with the majority coming through Warzone, reflecting the powerful combination of premium differentiated content alongside a free offering.  
Warzone's success is enabling us to reach new players in new geographies, including on PC, with PC consumption more than double the prior premium content release. Call of Duty in-game net bookings more than doubled from Q1 and were around 5x higher than the year ago quarter. In its first 3 quarters, total in-game net bookings for Modern Warfare now exceeded the prior 3 Call of Duty titles combined over the same period. 
Engagement has remained strong in the third quarter and our fifth season of new content launches tomorrow with map changes and new events that we think will continue to delight players. As we look ahead, Activision will continue to build on its direct digital relationship with this expanded community as it delivers the next premium installment for call of Duty, which comes from a wholly owned Call of Duty Studios, Treyarch and Raven Software. We're excited for its plan release later this year. 
Call of Duty continues to break new ground on the mobile platform, too. Call of Duty Mobile saw strong sequential growth in engagement and player investment. Benefiting from both shelter in place tailwinds and the team's ongoing work to further optimize gameplay, monthly seasonal content and the in-game economy. The game climbed up the U.S. app store grossing charts and each of the 3 seasons in Q2 generated more net bookings per day than the prior. And having pivoted all matches to online play in remote production in April, we continue to celebrate player achievement and drive even greater franchise engagement with a Call of Duty League. 
And Activision continues to refresh beloved IP for some of the world's most passionate fans with 2 titles that are shaping up fantastically. We are thrilled to again partner with Legendary Skateboarder, Tony Hawk, to bring Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 back to gamers in September. 
And Activision will build on the incredible success of the crash franchise in recent years to launch Crash Bandicoot 4, it's about time, the first entirely new build from the ground up crash experience in over a decade, launching in October. 
Now turning to Blizzard. MAUs were 32 million in Q2. World of Warcraft reach and engagement once again increased sequentially as shelter-at-home conditions further boosted the franchise's strong trajectory since the launch of Classic. Blizzard is delivering live operations, quality of life enhancements and major content to keep its expanded community engaged. This includes the release of the most significant multiplayer event in WoW Classic in July, and anticipation continues to build for Shadowlands, the next expansion for modern wow coming in the fourth quarter. Engagement in the franchise is the highest it has been at this point ahead of an expansion in a decade. And Shadowlands is seeing an enthusiastic response from players in its public testing, with presales accelerating even further in the second quarter. 
The expanded Hearthstone team launched the game's latest expansion as well as a new hero class during the second quarter as they continue to accelerate the pace of innovative content in the franchise. Building on the success of battlegrounds and strong execution in lab operations, the Heartstone pipeline includes expansions, new engagement features and exciting new game mode planned for the coming quarters. 
Overwatch saw a significant number of returning players contributing to strong year-over-year growth in engagement. The franchise continues to enjoy a sizable, loyal and engaged community, both in the game and bolstered by ongoing enthusiasm for the Overwatch League as the development team works on the early anticipated Overwatch 2. 
And finally, the Diablo franchises entry into mobile, the Diablo Immortal, looks great with Blizzard planning to expand internal testing with the company play test to start in the coming weeks. 
Now turning to King. King MAUs increased 5% year-over-year to 271 million, including double-digit growth in MAUs for the Candy Crush franchise. King delivered strong increases in reach and engagement amidst shelter-at-home conditions at the start of Q2. We saw these tailwinds moderate in the second half of the quarter, although MAUs remained higher year-over-year, again, driven by Candy Crush. The team's ongoing initiatives to broaden the payer base enable the business to benefit from this higher reach and engagement. Payer conversion was higher year-over-year throughout Q2, continuing the improving trends seen in recent quarters and positioning the business for stronger results over the medium and long term. And Candy Crush was once again the top grossing franchise in the U.S. app stores. 
King recently announced its first release since narrowing its pipeline to focus on its highest potential projects. As we leverage the strongest capabilities across our business units to further expand the reach of our IP, King will bring Activision's beloved crash franchise to the mobile platform. Crash Bandicoot on the run, is an ambitious new take on the runner category with deep social and resource management elements, and the game is already looking great as it progresses through testing. 
Along with higher performance for in-app purchases, King also delivered strong growth in advertising, accelerating through the quarter, even with ongoing headwinds in the digital advertising sector. While the backdrop remains uncertain, the performance once again validates the value proposition of our premium, safe platform for brands in any environment. 
Turning to the impact of the pandemic on demand. Shelter-at-home conditions boosted reach and engagement for each of our key franchises in the first half of the quarter. These tailwinds moderated in the second half as more countries started to reopen with trends varying across geographies and franchises. EMEA and Asia Pacific saw greater moderation as lockdowns ended, with the Americas seeing more sustained tailwinds. And while casual franchises returned to more typical trends more quickly, our core franchises, with the greatest emphasis on social, multi-player game play are seeing engagement remain elevated even as regions reopen. 
From an operational perspective, while the vast majority of our employees continue to work from home, our teams continue to deliver content, features and services to our players. As discussed last quarter, remote working does add complexity and challenges in some areas of the game development process, but our mitigation measures have been affected so far, and we believe we are on track to deliver new content in the second half. 
In summary, our franchise focus and a return to the execution standards that have driven our business for decades will result in substantial overperformance against our original outlook. Dennis will now share the detailed results of our second quarter and specifics of our revised outlook. Dennis?"

Today, I will review our Q2 2020 results as well as our outlook for 2020 and the third quarter. Our second quarter revenue and earnings were well ahead of our prior outlook, primarily driven by a strong player response to our initiatives in the Call of Duty franchise, along with greater-than-anticipated shelter-at-home tailwinds for our other franchises. 
To review the quarter, let's start with our segment results. Activision revenue was $993 million, increasing 270% year-over-year. Growth was driven by Modern Warfare and Warzone in game revenues, strong sales of premium Modern Warfare, the addition of Call of Duty Mobile as well as catalog content sales. Operating income was $559 million. 
Activision's operating margin was 56%, an all-time record, reflecting high incremental margins for both in-game and upfront sales on console and PC. Blizzard revenue was $461 million, growing 20% year-over-year, driven by another strong quarter of growth for World of Warcraft. Operating income was $203 million with an operating margin of 44%, both significantly higher year-over-year. King revenue was $553 million, was the highest since the 2016 acquisition growing 11% year-over-year. In-app revenue growth moderated during the quarter but remained positive throughout, while advertising revenues reaccelerated throughout the quarter. Operating income was $212 million, again, the highest since the acquisition with an operating margin of 38%, 4 percentage points higher year-over-year. Across our segments, in-game net bookings grew 77% year-over-year to a record $1.37 billion. 
Now let's turn to our consolidated results. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be referencing non-GAAP figures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. 
For the quarter, we generated Q2 GAAP revenues of $1.93 billion, $242 million above our May guidance. This includes the net deferral of $146 million. Net bookings of $2.08 billion were $403 million above our May outlook. And we generated Q2 GAAP EPS of $0.75 and Q2 non-GAAP EPS of $0.81, which was $0.17 above guidance. These figures include the net deferral of $0.16. 
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Q2 operating cash flow was $768 million, increasing over $600 million year-over-year, reflecting higher operating income and lower cash taxes, offset by working capital timing. During the quarter, we paid an annual dividend of $0.41 per share, 11% higher year-over-year for a total of $316 million. Our cash investments at the end of June was approximately $6.5 billion, and we ended the quarter with a net cash position of approximately $3.8 billion. We have long viewed our strong balance sheet as a strategic asset, and we're pleased with the strength of our business fundamentals and conservative financial policy were recognized in the recent upgrade of our credit rating to A- at S&P. 
Now let's turn to our outlook for Q3 and the full year. With regard to our slate, in Q3, Activision's fifth season of content for Call of Duty Modern Warfare and Warzone launches tomorrow, and the team will release new features, events and seasons for Call of Duty Mobile. On September 4, Activision will release Tony Hawk, Pro Skater 1 and 2 for the Playstation four, Xbox One and PC. Blizzard will launch its latest Hearthstone expansion, Scholomance  Academy, on Thursday this week, and through the quarter, we'll continue to support other key franchises within game content. And King is planning numerous features and innovative live ops in Candy Crush as well as other games across its portfolio. 
In the fourth quarter, in addition to ongoing live ops and in-game content across the portfolio, Activision plans to launch Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time. And most importantly, the new Call of Duty premium release is slated to arrive into what we expect to be the largest and most engaged franchise player base at launch ever. And Blizzard plans to release the World of Warcraft Shadowlands expansion for its expanded community. In the second half, we will also continue to refine and test new mobile content in our pipeline, although consistent with our prior outlook, we don't include any material revenue from new mobile titles in our guidance. 
Before I discuss the specifics of our outlook, I'll provide some context. We continue to experience strong momentum in the business even as tailwinds from shelter in place moderate. In the second half, we are planning to launch major new content into key franchises with meaningfully larger audiences than we have seen previously, creating the opportunity for strong financial results. In particular, the addition of the Warzone free-to-play experience has significantly increased the reach, engagement and player investment in Call of Duty, building on existing strength for our largest franchise and creating a strong foundation for future financial performance. That said, we remain mindful of risks and uncertainties related to the global economic weakness, rising unemployment and potential pressures on the retail channel and pricing. The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to fully predict at this time. We continue to believe we are being prudent in our guidance to account for these risks, and there could be over performance if these risks do not materialize. So with that as a backdrop, we are again raising our outlook for net bookings, revenue and EPS for the year, with our full year outlook increasing by an amount greater than our second quarter overperformance. 
Now let me get into the specifics. For Q3 on a GAAP basis, we now expect revenues of $1.8 billion, including the net recognition of deferrals of $150 million. We expect net bookings of $1.65 billion. Product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 18% and operating expenses including software amortization of 46% and a GAAP-only restructuring charge of approximately $20 million. We expect a tax rate of 20%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of $780 million and EPS of $0.64. 
For Q3 on a non-GAAP basis, we now expect product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 18% and  operating expenses, including software amortization of 40%. We expect a tax rate of 19% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.75, including the net recognition of deferrals of $0.15. On a GAAP basis for 2020, we now expect revenues of $7.28 billion, including net deferrals of $350 million. We now expect net bookings of $7.63 billion, $725 million above our May outlook. Product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 19%; operating expenses, including software amortization of 47%; and a GAAP-only restructuring charge of approximately $50 million. We expect a GAAP tax rate of 20%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of $780 million and GAAP EPS of $2.46. 
For 2020, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 19% and operating expenses, including software amortization of 42%. We expect a tax rate of 19% and non-GAAP EPS of $2.87, including net deferrals of $0.18. 
So in closing, our business has strong momentum heading into the back half of the year. Having increased investment in development and commercial resources for our largest franchises last year strong execution against our strategic initiatives meant we were well positioned to drive growth in reach, engagement and player investment in the second quarter as people sheltered at home. This puts us in a very good place for the second half of the year and beyond. The opportunity set for our business and wholly owned franchises across platforms, geographies and business models has never been greater, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver the long-term business excellence and performance that our shareholders rightly expect. Now I welcome our business leaders, Jay, Humam and Rob, as they join us for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator?"

It certainly looks as if COVID has really accelerated secular trends in the sector. In terms of our player numbers and engagement, we think you're seeing an acceleration in something that was already strong and was the strong growth in gaming that we've been experiencing. Consumer leisure time has been shifting to more interactive forms of entertainment for many years, and that has just accelerated in the recent months. Now we believe that as new players come into gaming, they're going to gravitate towards the largest franchises that have massive communities who are enjoying fresh and compelling experiences. So we've seen that with Call of Duty and World of Warcraft, in particular, where our content initiatives over the last few quarters meant that we were really well positioned to deliver great content as new players came in. And as we continue to benefit from the social nature of many of our games, we expect that as new players engage and form in-game connections with existing or new friends, many of them will stay engaged for the long term, and we see this as a really big opportunity. And as you'd expect, in our franchises, we're doing everything we can to welcome as many new players as possible and expanding the funnel to bring more gamers into our communities and really give them the compelling social experiences that turns them into long-term fans. 
We've also seen a further acceleration in the ongoing mix towards full game downloads, which, as you know, has a positive financial impact for us. And as you've seen for many years now that as consumers buy media digitally, they tend not to go back to physical purchases because of the conveniences and the advantages of buying digital. So we think this shift is likely going to be sustained. 
Now some of the demand tailwinds from shelter at home are moderating, as we discussed in our opening remarks, but what's more important for us as we look forward, is that there's just such a huge opportunity for us to further expand our franchises as we execute on our pipeline and our growth initiatives and invest in great and innovative new content. And while we have over 400 million players already, there's billions of users and gamers out there worldwide. We want to continue to find ways for them to experience our franchises in whichever way that they prefer. We have the pipeline in place to achieve that and are focused on continuing to execute against this pipeline to really unlock that full potential of our portfolio."

I probably want to start out by saying first the success of we saying Warzone, call duty Mobile. In addition to, of course, what we've continued to see in our premium games, has created a ton of new opportunities for the franchise. And so starting with marketing, it's definitely had an impact there on how we think about marketing in this new world. As you've seen from our results, right now, we have a larger, more engaged and more global audience than we've ever had at any point in time in our history. And that means that we could be more direct and more targeted than we've ever been before. So that's a huge benefit and plus for us as we think about marketing on that vector. 
Another thing I think that's really important for us as it relates to marketing is from storytelling, from a storytelling perspective, where we can be even more, I think, creative and fun and engaging with our fans than ever before. So if you look at Warzone, in particular, it's not only like a great game experience, but it's also a great platform for us to share new franchise news and information directly with our community like we haven't done before. So this is also a big and positive change for us as we think about the business. And kind of to your initial point that you're talking about, why you were waiting for such a long time, we are and we aren't, but it's Warzone, I think, that's caused us to rethink how, when and even where we review our upcoming titles. So we can't wait to share it with the community, and we think it's going to be very different and more engaging than anything that we've ever done before. 
Now as you heard on the call before, Treyarch and Raven are coming up with the next premium game. And obviously, very excited on what they're working on, and we do think fans are going to absolutely love it. The game looks incredible right now. And internally, people having a ton of fun, playing across its campaign mode as well as the online mode the developers are very well known for. And so all I can say in terms of timing is I suspect we'll be hearing more about this fairly soon. 
Now on your question of how we're going to integrate the new title with Warzone, I think that's a good one. It's an important one. And what you should expect is that we do a very tight integration between the 2. Modern Warfare and Warzone are obviously very tightly connected. I think that's really important to the player base. And we plan to do the same with all our upcoming titles as well, our premium titles, to ensure that we can reward all of our players and give them personal experiences regardless of whether they choose to just play in a Warzone or also playing the premium game as well. So the connection will absolutely be there. 
And then finally, I think on your last question was in regards to next-gen pricing. And so what I'll say here is we'll be sharing our plans soon. So I'm not going to share anything today. For now, we're just very excited for the launch of the new generation of hardware. We think it represents another strong look forward in creating really incredible entertainment and value for our brands as we look forward. Thank you."

I think the teams have done a good job in adapting to a remote work environment. When you think about the team based collaboration that's required to create great games the current remote work environment does have some challenges when it comes to iteration and ideation. But I'm proud of the teams, and I feel like they've been incredibly resourceful to figure out ways to continue to serve the community with the great content as you saw in Q2 and in Q1 of this year. All of this gives us a lot of momentum heading into the second half of this year when we have a lot of things planned. The WoW and the Hearthstone teams continue to bring lots of content to the community, and this is important for both of these games going forward. 
Longer term or longer-term projects that are in a more creative or collaborative stage of development make it harder to really measure the impact of the shift to remote working. And one of the things that we're conscious of is the longer the situation persists, the greater the challenge. So we're continuing to actively monitor, continuing to plan and try to put ourselves in the best possible position, continuing to operate effectively during covet and beyond. 
So you mentioned BlizzCon. And we did announce that we will not be bringing the community together this fall. But we are planning on channeling the spirit of BlizzCon into a virtual event early -- in early part of next year. We're really fortunate to have a passionate and engaged community that's really looking forward to what we're creating and what we're working on, and we're looking forward to sharing what the teams have been working on at that event. 
So just about equal, the Overwatch teams. They're  deeply committed to creating awesome AAA experiences for players. They're working hard to bring those games to the community. And we expect the launches and data that we continue to release on those to be big events for those franchises. And beyond those launches, we've been focused on delivering new experiences and our live games the community really enjoys. So we talked about here in WoW through classic, we've been able to introduce more content from the existing subscription to continue to give the community real reasons to stay engaged. 
And now outside of the temple of secret -- sequels, we have another -- a number of initiatives that are underway, and we expect to deliver strong system performance in the future. That's something that's very important to us. Thanks for the question."

Our advertising business proved resilient in the second quarter, and we delivered robust year-over-year growth. Now at the heart of this ad business is our platform, which provides a fully controlled, safe environment for brands. And that's a very powerful value proposition for advertisers, especially given the current backdrop. 
Now to add to that, we have a number of initiatives underway that will further strengthen this platform. So as an example, we're continuing to invest in the direct sales force and expand our network demand partners as well. And again, we saw strong year-over-year growth across both the direct advertisers and our demand partners in Q2. Now add to that we're continuing to invest in our tech infrastructure. And we continue to invest in tools as well to further optimize this demand and the pricing around it. But at the heart of it, the way I think about the investment is also investment in the product itself and the innovation there. So that is also resonating. So as an example, to give one, we worked with target in Q2, and they were looking to drive awareness in consideration with their Easter marketing campaign. And when we combine an integrated sponsorship and Candy Crush Saga with our rewarded video product, Target was able to reach tens of millions of players in the U.S., and they achieved a 10-point lift in their top of mind awareness and a 7-point lift in consideration. So all of this is allowing to attract, allowing us to attract new brand advertisers into the ecosystem. And over the past few months, we had a number of these, which span a number of sectors. And these names spend something like from Samsung to -- to ABC to Sargento to Home Depot, and we continue to use our direct sales force to reach out to more of these advertisers across these sectors and continue to innovate the product around them. 
Now with all that said, there is uncertainty in the ad market, as you've seen in the recent months, and that includes Apple's recent announcement around IDSA. Now it's still too early to determine the specific impact on the business, at least on our business. But we're working closely with our advertising partners and our demand partners to prepare for these changes. So puts and takes out there, net-net, we still remain confident in the value proposition and the long-term opportunity of this advertising business."

Obviously, we do believe that it's sustainable, and we're very excited for what's going on COD Mobile. We're seeing really strong momentum with the title, the games now surpassed over 250 million downloads globally, and it just keeps on tracking for us. Over the past several months, the team has made really great progress on adding great new content, content for the community and then also in optimizing the engagement, the retention and the in-game economy to make sure we're working on all components. So overall, the game is performing really well. And as you noted in your question, we are absolutely still reinvesting in both the product itself and also in the marketing to build an even larger audience similar to what you'd see a lot of top mobiles do, especially in this earlier growth phase to mobile. And -- but I'd also say at the same time, the game is still contributing nicely both to the top and bottom line for Activision. But because of its scale, we're seeing it benefit us and we're also reinvesting in it. The game's coming up on its 1-year anniversary in October, and I mentioned the content investment. In October, we plan on delivering significant new content to the game and a lot of in-game enhancements, including a new weapon system for mobile. Now you've probably seen, our players have certainly noticed in Modern Warfare, how much they're enjoying customizing their weapons and how they do it in that experience. And we think the community is going to love the opportunity to do the same in COD Mobile. So overall, we're extremely happy with the sustained trends we're seeing on mobile. We continue to reach new audiences around the world. And I'd say we're just very committed to growing our mobile business. For us, that includes adding additional internal mobile talent and resources. Of course, we'll continue to support our existing initiatives. And I think importantly, as we look forward, even more tightly integrating mobile into the overall Call of Duty ecosystem to bring our community together closer and having more fun. 
And I'd just like to close by, and we've mentioned this before, I think, but it is important, Call of Duty right now through the success of our premium titles in Warzone and Mobile is larger and more global than it's ever been in history. And I just want to say thanks to all of our teams have just done an incredible job across the board.

As you just heard from Rob, we are really bringing that community and that experience together across platforms and across experiences. And firstly, I'd say we're really just not done with call of Duty. We're in the first inning. We've only been 5 months in since the life of a Warzone, and the team is working really, really hard to integrate that with our next premium release. So we can really maximize the potential of this powerful combination of both premium and free-to-play content. And it's still early in expanding the audience on PC as well, which offers, as you know, a very significant potential for future growth when you consider the size of the player base and particularly including the fact that we are now having access to players all around the world and expanding it. PC, obviously, is more accessible. 
And then as Rob was mentioning, there's a lot more to come on mobile, too. COD mobile is off to a really great start, but we're just scratching the surface of what that franchise can be on mobile and then integrating the experiences across multiple platforms, we know is just an incredible opportunity for the franchise. But to the early successes, they do represent incredible proof points, as to your question, of how the franchise strategy is really working. And it certainly applies to a lot of the franchises that we have. We see that our current players really want more ways to engage with their favorite IP, be it through mobile or other platforms, and that offering authentic and really deep experiences on new platforms can drive much, much higher engagement, and this quarter's results really shows that. 
And we also see that the free-to-play on mobile and other platforms can bring in multiples of new players into our franchises. Importantly, with strong execution, this is not cannibalistic. Actually, on the contrary, free-to-play coexists with other business models and can be meaningfully additive to a franchise, bringing new players into the ecosystem. So these proof points are relevant across our portfolio. And to your question, it's not just Diablo, but it's also across all our franchises. And our teams see an opportunity to drive a greater reach, engagement and player investment greater than ever before across the franchises. And with the really strong execution that we know we can deliver, we expect to continue that trend. And thanks again for your question."

As we talked about earlier, we are planning for the game to enter what we're calling expanded internal testing this quarter. And internal testing is an important step for us, not only from an operational perspective, but also because we have many Blizzard employees who are deeply engaged. We have quite a few extra players within the company, and a lot of the employees that we have represent many aspects of our global community. 
From the very beginning, it was important to us to ensure that this is an authentic Blizzard quality diablo experience for the huge community of the Diablo players around the world, and it's our intention to meet the expectations of those players everywhere. The type of experience that Diablo players have loved for over 20 years is one that we think is appealing to everyone, and we think that we're working here on a deep and engaging RPG on mobile. And so there's great potential for players in all regions to really love the game. And so we're more than willing to spend the time on it to get it right. We've continued to see a lot of interest and anticipation from the Diablo community, and the games come along really well. We're eager to get it into the players' hands. 
I'll mention one more thing. You asked about Diablo Immortal , but I do want to take the opportunity to also mention Diablo, which we are building for PC and for console and is also coming along and looking really good. We share public quarterly updates with the community, and we really discuss -- the team discusses the approach of different elements and different storytelling and design philosophies. And we need to interact and see that hard-core the Diablo player race respond with the excitement about the direction of the game. And the entire team is deeply committed to bringing them a fitting continuation to that era. And so there's a lot for players and fans in Diablo to look forward to."

We've seen double-digit growth year-on-year in Candy players, and we see continued progress on our payer conversion efforts. And we see the opportunity for growth across both the in-app purchase business and our ads business in the Candy franchise. Now having said that, we will continue to selectively invest in focused new games pipeline, and we explore both new IP and where it makes sense at the Activision IP library. So with Crash, in particular, when we saw its vibrant history, and we saw what that represents over the past 20 years, it represented a great opportunity for us to expand the King portfolio with an iconic IP like that. We have focused our new game development efforts over the past few years to really only selectively invest behind the most exciting opportunities. And with this one, the King team is thrilled to be developing a game with this IP from the Activision catalog. And as you see from the game's, it's looking really great. We're reimagining the Crash franchise for an incredible mobile experience, and we just can't wait to get this game out there to a dedicated crash and base and to also bring it to new audiences.

And it's a great example of what we can do as a broader organization when we leverage kind of our respective strength to maximize the potential of our IP across the company. There's multiple examples. If you look at how we partner with Blizzard to bring Call of Duty to Battle.net on PC, where we've driven record results. We also launched a world-class city base sports business with the call duty league in partnership with our Activision Blizzard sports team. And so now in the case of Crash, this IP is getting the full treatment it deserves, and it's getting it because of the talent across the company. First, we're very thrilled that we bring in brand-new experience to consoles in October with Crash 4, and the game is just coming along really great, and the team at -- has done an excellent job of ensuring the game honors, it's rich history, you deliver something to new and fun to fan. But then that's one really important vector that we're focused on. But then as we think in terms of mobile, last year, we launched Call of Duty and Modern Warfare very successfully and very close together, quite frankly. And together, these games have proven accretive to our overall results and have certainly grown our audience on a global basis. So now we're standing here, we look at this opportunity with King and thinking what a perfect opportunity, partner with the talented team may, who's so proven in mobile and have such great talent in the organization to expand the crash IP on mobile, with a unique game experience that's different from what we're doing on console and then, of course, while at the same time, delivering a new premium experience through contents of Crash 4. So net-net, for me, it's one, it's a great time to be a crash fan. And two, it's just also really great to see the company working so well together on so many fronts. So that's what I would add.

We've known you for a long time, and we always try to be as helpful as we can and prudent in our approach to guidance. But I think it's even more important now, obviously, with the economic backdrop being so total and unpredictable. Regarding shelter at home, you heard it in our prepared remarks, and Daniel referenced it earlier, we have seen some engagement in tailwinds moderating somewhat as regions reopen, particularly in some of our games that have less social connected tissue. We -- we're assuming in our guidance, that continues as more regions reopened in Q3, although it's not entirely clear how quickly that plays out because the trends kind of are different in different regions of the world. Even so, we're obviously very strong. We have strong momentum, and we feel really confident about our third quarter guidance, particularly because our largest franchises have so much momentum and that leads us to the strong guidance we provided for Q3 already. 
When you turn to Q4, our Q4 guide implies you'll see some appropriate risk that we've applied into our outlook. Obviously, there's a few reasons for that. Everyone is aware of the economic backdrop that we're in with unemployment in unusual levels and risk to consumer spending, particularly with new consoles coming out, which will absorb some consumer wallets as they purchase new hardware and, similarly, want to be relatively conservative about the retail channel as that continues to contract. We do see -- obviously, the flip side of that is a strong benefit and tailwind that brings to digital for us, which was the comments we mentioned earlier. We have seen acceleration on that side for the console, which is a nice tailwind, and we expect that to continue. In an environment like this, and we talked a little bit about it last quarter, we do feel really good about the value proposition of our content in past challenging economic times interactive entertainment, given its low cost per hour relative to other forms of entertainment is a very compelling value for consumers. So hopefully, that bodes well even in this uncertain economic environment that we find ourselves in. But similar to last quarter, obviously, there's a lot of unknowns, and we've tried to be prudent with our guidance. But in spite of that, we've obviously raised our full year guidance by the largest amount in our history. And we believe there's obvious potential for even further overperformance if some of those risks don't materialize and if we can navigate through them effectively, which obviously would give us great momentum next in the year with a very, very large player base heading into 2021 and beyond. So lots of opportunity in front of us, albeit in an uncertain time. So thank you very much for the question, and thank you very much for everyone for joining us today and for your participation and interest. We look forward to speaking with many of you this quarter throughout the quarter. And hopefully, we'll see many of you again. Thank you."

We hope all of you and your families are safe and healthy. Our employees continue to do an extraordinary job managing family demands, working in challenging circumstances and remaining focused on",886,"Thank you, Chris, and thank you all for joining us today. 
We hope all of you and your families are safe and healthy. Our employees continue to do an extraordinary job managing family demands, working in challenging circumstances and remaining focused on execution of our stakeholder priorities. Ensuring that our employees and their families have the very best health care, everywhere we operate remains our priority. 
Against the backdrop of the ongoing pandemic and significant social and cultural upheaval, we are delivering entertainment that inspires and unites, helps break down barriers and enables players to forge and sustain friendships and community through gameplay. With billions of gamers worldwide, games provide social interactions that connect people more deeply than any other form of entertainment. 
The investments we have made in new compelling content and experiences within our franchises have helped us expand to almost every country in the world across a wide range of audiences. Today, we have a broad and diverse player base of over 400 million players, with over 100 million players in each key region we operate: EMEA, Asia Pacific and the Americas. And we estimate that approximately half of our players are now female. We have an opportunity to grow and serve more players globally as we discover more ways to connect and engage the world through our epic entertainment. 
Our second quarter results significantly exceeded our prior outlook for both revenue and earnings per share, and with continued momentum in our business, we are again raising our full year outlook. Of course, in these uncertain and unpredictable times, our results are subject to change and volatility. 
In the second quarter, our player base grew 30% year-over-year, adding more than 100 million monthly active players. Time spent in our games grew 70% over the same period and Q2 engagement and player investment were at historic highs. We grew net bookings 70% year-over-year, setting new highs for second quarter net bookings on both mobile and console, with operating margin up strongly year-over-year. 
Our results benefited from increased demand from our content as people around the world sheltered at home. This upside varied across businesses and franchises with our most social content seeing the strongest and longer-lasting impact. The biggest driver of our year-over-year engagement and financial performance was Call of Duty, which has seen a remarkable increase in its scale as we expanded the franchise across platforms, geographies and business models. As the world starts to reopen, we believe these actions have delivered a true structural change in the trajectory of our largest franchise, and this is the road map we plan to follow for the many franchises we have in our library, which dates back to 1980. 
The launch of Warzone within the Call of Duty universe has given existing players compelling new content and enabled large numbers of first-time players to unleash their inter-military heroes. Over 75 million people have played Warzone since its launch, adding significant reach and engagement to a franchise that already enjoyed strong momentum following the 2019 launches of Modern Warfare and Call of Duty Mobile. 
We've truly seen a step change in the engagement of our franchise, with total time spent in Call of Duty in Q2, more than 8x higher than in the year ago quarter. And as players engage, they're choosing to invest, with in-game player investment and sales of premium content both meaningfully higher than last year. The expansion of the Call of Duty franchise to over 100 million players across PC, console and mobile highlights the scale of the opportunity for our broader portfolio of fully owned intellectual property. 
We're also seeing ongoing momentum from our growth initiatives for World of Warcraft and Candy Crush. And as we execute on our pipeline of major content and live operations on mobile, PC and console, we expect to continue expanding the scale of our franchises. We remain focused on investing in our creative talent, growing our development teams to continue delivering more high-quality content more frequently and continuing to reduce unnecessary process that stifles innovation and creativity. 
With more players in more countries on more platforms and our deep experience across a wide range of business models, we're on track to deliver the strong long-term financial performance that our stakeholders expect. 
I'm incredibly proud of our employees and their families. They have overcome difficulties, demonstrated great empathy and resilience and, through extraordinary circumstance, have remained steadfast in their commitment to meet growing audience demand for our games. And more than ever, there's a growing need for the services of our Call of Duty Endowment, which helps returning veterans transition to the civilian workforce. We, of course, were delighted to fund a record number of placements in the second quarter and have now helped more than 72,000 veterans find high-quality jobs since we started the Call of Duty Endowment in 2009. 
In the near term, while the economic outlook remains very unclear, the ongoing commitment of our creative and commercial teams should enable us to remain on track to deliver great new content in the second half of the year. We now expect record full year net bookings and earnings per share. 
Thank you all for your support and your encouragement. Daniel will now review the highlights of our operations for the past quarter with you."
4222231,675644289,2059414,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2020",2020-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bobby. As you heard, Activision Blizzard significantly exceeded its second quarter outlook. Each of our key franchises delivered better-than-expected results, with growth led by the Call of Duty franchise following the launch of Warzone. Duri",1363,"Thank you, Bobby. 
As you heard, Activision Blizzard significantly exceeded its second quarter outlook. Each of our key franchises delivered better-than-expected results, with growth led by the Call of Duty franchise following the launch of Warzone. During the quarter, we remained laser-focused on driving financial performance through our 3 strategic growth drivers of expanding audience reach, deepening engagement and increasing player investment. Strong execution against these growth drivers enabled us to serve compelling experiences to an expanded gaming audience against a backdrop of demand tailwinds from shelter at home in the quarter. We saw substantial growth in our biggest franchises, and importantly, the increased investment and successful initiatives that drove strong Q2 results also positioned us to continue growing and delighting our global communities and to deliver sustained, greater financial performance over the long term. 
Now turning to our franchise and operational highlights across our business units. Starting with Activision. Monthly active users or MAUs grew more than threefold year-over-year to 125 million. Call of Duty reached new heights in the quarter with reach, engagement and player investment experiencing another step change increase following the launch of Warzone in March. Warzone has now brought in more than 75 million players. In the first full quarter since Warzone launched, hours played in the Modern Warfare universe increased eightfold year-over-year, driven by both existing and new players. 
As Warzone players engaged, many upgraded to premium Modern Warfare experience. In fact, in Q2, we added more players outside of the launch quarter to the premium Call of Duty experience than ever before with the majority coming through Warzone, reflecting the powerful combination of premium differentiated content alongside a free offering.  
Warzone's success is enabling us to reach new players in new geographies, including on PC, with PC consumption more than double the prior premium content release. Call of Duty in-game net bookings more than doubled from Q1 and were around 5x higher than the year ago quarter. In its first 3 quarters, total in-game net bookings for Modern Warfare now exceeded the prior 3 Call of Duty titles combined over the same period. 
Engagement has remained strong in the third quarter and our fifth season of new content launches tomorrow with map changes and new events that we think will continue to delight players. As we look ahead, Activision will continue to build on its direct digital relationship with this expanding community as it delivers the next premium installment for Call of Duty, which comes from a wholly owned Call of Duty studios, Treyarch and Raven Software. We're excited for its planned release later this year. 
Call of Duty continues to break new ground on the mobile platform, too. Call of Duty Mobile saw strong sequential growth in engagement and player investment. Benefiting from both shelter in place tailwinds and the team's ongoing work to further optimize gameplay, monthly seasonal content and the in-game economy. The game climbed up the U.S. app store grossing charts, and each of the 3 seasons in Q2 generated more net bookings per day than the prior. And having pivoted all matches to online play in remote production in April, we continue to celebrate player achievement and drive even greater franchise engagement with a Call of Duty League. 
And Activision continues to refresh beloved IP for some of the world's most passionate fans with 2 titles that are shaping up fantastically. We are thrilled to again partner with legendary skateboarder, Tony Hawk, to bring Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 back to gamers in September. And Activision will build on the incredible success of the Crash franchise in recent years to launch Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time, the first entirely new build from the ground up crash experience in over a decade, launching in October. 
Now turning to Blizzard. MAUs were 32 million in Q2. World of Warcraft reach and engagement once again increased sequentially as shelter-at-home conditions further boosted the franchise's strong trajectory since the launch of Classic. Blizzard is delivering live operations, quality-of-life enhancements and major content to keep its expanded community engaged. This includes the release of the most significant multiplayer event in WoW Classic in July, and anticipation continues to build for Shadowlands, the next expansion for modern WoW coming in the fourth quarter. Engagement in the franchise is the highest it has been at this point ahead of an expansion in a decade. And Shadowlands is seeing an enthusiastic response from players in its public testing, with presales accelerating even further in the second quarter. 
The expanded Hearthstone team launched the game's latest expansion as well as a new hero class during the second quarter as they continue to accelerate the pace of innovative content in the franchise. Building on the success of Battlegrounds and strong execution in live operation, the Hearthstone pipeline includes expansions, new engagement features and exciting new game mode planned for the coming quarters. 
Overwatch saw a significant number of returning players contributing to strong year-over-year growth in engagement. The franchise continues to enjoy a sizable, loyal and engaged community, both in the game and bolstered by ongoing enthusiasm for the Overwatch League as the development team works on the eagerly anticipated Overwatch 2. 
And finally, the Diablo franchises entry into mobile, the Diablo Immortal, looks great, with Blizzard planning to expand internal testing with the company play test to start in the coming weeks. 
Now turning to King. King MAUs increased 5% year-over-year to 271 million, including double-digit growth in MAUs for the Candy Crush franchise. King delivered strong increases in reach and engagement amidst shelter-at-home conditions at the start of Q2. We saw these tailwinds moderate in the second half of the quarter, although MAUs remained higher year-over-year, again, driven by Candy Crush. 
The team's ongoing initiatives to broaden the payer base enable the business to benefit from this higher reach and engagement. Payer conversion was higher year-over-year throughout Q2, continuing the improving trends seen in recent quarters and positioning the business for stronger results over the medium and long term. And Candy Crush was once again the top grossing franchise in the U.S. app stores. 
King recently announced its first release since narrowing its pipeline to focus on its highest-potential projects. As we leverage the strongest capabilities across our business units to further expand the reach of our IP, King will bring Activision's beloved Crash franchise to the mobile platform. Crash Bandicoot: On the Run, is an ambitious new take on the runner category with deep social and resource management elements, and the game is already looking great as it progresses through testing. 
Along with higher performance for in-app purchases, King also delivered strong growth in advertising, accelerating through the quarter, even with ongoing headwinds in the digital advertising sector. While the backdrop remains uncertain, the performance once again validates the value proposition of our premium, safe platform for brands in any environment. 
Turning to the impact of the pandemic on demand. Shelter-at-home conditions boosted reach and engagement for each of our key franchises in the first half of the quarter. These tailwinds moderated in the second half as more countries started to reopen with trends varying across geographies and franchises. EMEA and Asia Pacific saw greater moderation as lockdowns ended, with the Americas seeing more sustained tailwinds. And while casual franchises returned to more typical trends more quickly, our core franchises, with the greatest emphasis on social, multi-player game play are seeing engagement remain elevated even as regions reopen. 
From an operational perspective, while the vast majority of our employees continue to work from home, our teams continue to deliver content, features and services to our players. As discussed last quarter, remote working does add complexity and challenges in some areas of the game development process, but our mitigation measures have been affected so far, and we believe we are on track to deliver new content in the second half. 
In summary, our franchise focus and a return to the execution standards that have driven our business for decades will result in substantial overperformance against our original outlook. 
Dennis will now share the detailed results of our second quarter and specifics of our revised outlook. Dennis?"

Today, I will review our Q2 2020 results as well as our outlook for 2020 and the third quarter. Our second quarter revenue and earnings were well ahead of our prior outlook, primarily driven by a strong player response to our initiatives in the Call of Duty franchise, along with greater-than-anticipated shelter-at-home tailwinds for our other franchises. 
To review the quarter, let's start with our segment results. Activision revenue was $993 million, increasing 270% year-over-year. Growth was driven by Modern Warfare and Warzone in game revenues, strong sales of premium Modern Warfare, the addition of Call of Duty Mobile as well as catalog content sales. Operating income was $559 million. Activision's operating margin was 56%, an all-time record, reflecting high incremental margins for both in-game and upfront sales on console and PC. 
Blizzard revenue was $461 million, growing 20% year-over-year, driven by another strong quarter of growth for World of Warcraft. Operating income was $203 million with an operating margin of 44%, both significantly higher year-over-year. 
King revenue was $553 million, was the highest since the 2016 acquisition growing 11% year-over-year. In-app revenue growth moderated during the quarter but remained positive throughout, while advertising revenues reaccelerated throughout the quarter. Operating income was $212 million, again, the highest since the acquisition, with an operating margin of 38%, 4 percentage points higher year-over-year. 
Across our segments, in-game net bookings grew 77% year-over-year to a record $1.37 billion. 
Now let's turn to our consolidated results. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be referencing non-GAAP figures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. 
For the quarter, we generated Q2 GAAP revenues of $1.93 billion, $242 million above our May guidance. This includes the net deferral of $146 million. Net bookings of $2.08 billion were $403 million above our May outlook. And we generated Q2 GAAP EPS of $0.75 and Q2 non-GAAP EPS of $0.81, which was $0.17 above guidance. These figures include the net deferral of $0.16. 
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Q2 operating cash flow was $768 million, increasing over $600 million year-over-year, reflecting higher operating income and lower cash taxes, offset by working capital timing. During the quarter, we paid an annual dividend of $0.41 per share, 11% higher year-over-year for a total of $316 million. Our cash investments at the end of June was approximately $6.5 billion, and we ended the quarter with a net cash position of approximately $3.8 billion. We have long viewed our strong balance sheet as a strategic asset, and we're pleased with the strength of our business fundamentals and conservative financial policy were recognized in the recent upgrade of our credit rating to A- at S&P. 
Now let's turn to our outlook for Q3 and the full year. With regard to our slate, in Q3, Activision's fifth season of content for Call of Duty Modern Warfare and Warzone launches tomorrow, and the team will release new features, events and seasons for Call of Duty Mobile. On September 4, Activision will release Tony Hawk, Pro Skater 1 and 2 for the Playstation 4, Xbox One and PC. Blizzard will launch its latest Hearthstone expansion, Scholomance Academy, on Thursday this week, and through the quarter, we'll continue to support other key franchises with in-game content. And King is planning numerous features and innovative live ops in Candy Crush as well as other games across its portfolio. 
In the fourth quarter, in addition to ongoing live ops and in-game content across the portfolio, Activision plans to launch Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time, and most importantly, the new Call of Duty premium release is slated to arrive into what we expect to be the largest and most engaged franchise player base at launch ever. And Blizzard plans to release the World of Warcraft Shadowlands expansion for its expanded community. In the second half, we will also continue to refine and test new mobile content in our pipeline, although consistent with our prior outlook, we don't include any material revenue from new mobile titles in our guidance. 
Before I discuss the specifics of our outlook, I'll provide some context. We continue to experience strong momentum in the business even as tailwinds from shelter in place moderate. In the second half, we are planning to launch major new content into key franchises with meaningfully larger audiences than we have seen previously, creating the opportunity for strong financial results. 
In particular, the addition of the Warzone free-to-play experience has significantly increased the reach, engagement and player investment in Call of Duty, building on existing strength for our largest franchise and creating a strong foundation for future financial performance. That said, we remain mindful of risks and uncertainties related to the global economic weakness, rising unemployment and potential pressures on the retail channel and pricing. 
The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to fully predict at this time. We continue to believe we are being prudent in our guidance to account for these risks, and there could be overperformance if these risks do not materialize. So with that as a backdrop, we are again raising our outlook for net bookings, revenue and EPS for the year, with our full year outlook increasing by an amount greater than our second quarter overperformance. 
Now let me get into the specifics. For Q3 on a GAAP basis, we now expect revenues of $1.8 billion, including the net recognition of deferrals of $150 million. We expect net bookings of $1.65 billion. Product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 18% and operating expenses including software amortization of 46% and a GAAP-only restructuring charge of approximately $20 million. We expect a tax rate of 20%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 780 million and EPS of $0.64. 
For Q3 on a non-GAAP basis, we now expect product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 18% and  operating expenses, including software amortization of 40%. We expect a tax rate of 19% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.75, including the net recognition of deferrals of $0.15. On a GAAP basis for 2020, we now expect revenues of $7.28 billion, including net deferrals of $350 million. We now expect net bookings of $7.63 billion, $725 million above our May outlook. Product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 19%; operating expenses, including software amortization of 47%; and a GAAP-only restructuring charge of approximately $50 million. We expect a GAAP tax rate of 20%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 780 million and GAAP EPS of $2.46. 
For 2020, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 19% and operating expenses, including software amortization of 42%. We expect a tax rate of 19% and non-GAAP EPS of $2.87, including net deferrals of $0.18. 
So in closing, our business has strong momentum heading into the back half of the year. Having increased investment in development and commercial resources for our largest franchises last year, strong execution against our strategic initiatives meant we were well positioned to drive growth in reach, engagement and player investment in the second quarter as people sheltered at home. This puts us in a very good place for the second half of the year and beyond. 
The opportunity set for our business and wholly owned franchises across platforms, geographies and business models has never been greater, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver the long-term business excellence and performance that our shareholders rightly expect.

It certainly looks as if COVID has really accelerated secular trends in the sector. In terms of our player numbers and engagement, we think you're seeing an acceleration in something that was already strong and was the strong growth in gaming that we've been experiencing. Consumer leisure time has been shifting to more interactive forms of entertainment for many years, and that has just accelerated in the recent months. 
Now we believe that as new players come into gaming, they're going to gravitate towards the largest franchises that have massive communities who are enjoying fresh and compelling experiences. So we've seen that with Call of Duty and World of Warcraft, in particular, where our content initiatives over the last few quarters meant that we were really well positioned to deliver great content as new players came in. 
And as we continue to benefit from the social nature of many of our games, we expect that as new players engage and form in-game connections with existing or new friends, many of them will stay engaged for the long term, and we see this as a really big opportunity. And as you'd expect, in our franchises, we're doing everything we can to welcome as many new players as possible and expanding the funnel to bring more gamers into our communities and really give them the compelling social experiences that turns them into long-term fans. 
We've also seen a further acceleration in the ongoing mix towards full game downloads, which, as you know, has a positive financial impact for us. And as you've seen for many years now that as consumers buy media digitally, they tend not to go back to physical purchases because of the conveniences and the advantages of buying digital. So we think this shift is likely going to be sustained. 
Now some of the demand tailwinds from shelter at home are moderating, as we discussed in our opening remarks, but what's more important for us as we look forward is that there's just such a huge opportunity for us to further expand our franchises as we execute on our pipeline and our growth initiatives and invest in great and innovative new content. 
And while we have over 400 million players already, there's billions of users and gamers out there worldwide. We want to continue to find ways for them to experience our franchises in whichever way that they prefer. We have the pipeline in place to achieve that and are focused on continuing to execute against this pipeline to really unlock that full potential of our portfolio."

Thanks for those questions. Let me try to attack them one by one. I'd probably want to start out by saying first the success of what we're saying, Warzone and Call of Duty Mobile, in addition to, of course, what we've continued to see in our premium games, has created a ton of new opportunities for the franchise. And so starting with marketing, it's definitely had an impact there on how we think about marketing in this new world. As you've seen from our results, right now, we have a larger, more engaged and more global audience than we've ever had at any point in time in our history. And that means that we could be more direct and more targeted than we've ever been before. So that's a huge benefit and plus for us as we think about marketing on that vector. 
Another thing I think that's really important for us as it relates to marketing is from storytelling, from a storytelling perspective, where we can be even more, I think, creative and fun and engaging with our fans than ever before. So if you look at Warzone, in particular, it's not only like a great game experience, but it's also a great platform for us to share new franchise news and information directly with our community like we haven't done before. So this is also a big and positive change for us as we think about the business. 
And kind of to your initial point that you're talking about, why you were waiting for such a long time, we are and we aren't. But it's Warzone, I think, that's caused us to rethink how, when and even where we reveal our upcoming titles. So we can't wait to share it with the community, and we think it's going to be very different and more engaging than anything that we've ever done before. 
Now as you heard on the call before, Treyarch and Raven are coming up with the next premium game. And obviously, very excited on what they're working on, and we do think fans are going to absolutely love it. The game looks incredible right now. And internally, people having a ton of fun, playing across its campaign mode as well as the online mode that the developers are very well known for. And so all I can say in terms of timing is I suspect you'll be hearing more about this fairly soon. 
Now on your question of how we're going to integrate the new title with Warzone, I think that's a good one, and it's an important one. And what you should expect is that we do a very tight integration between the two. Modern Warfare and Warzone are obviously very tightly connected. I think that's really important for the player base. And we plan to do the same with all our upcoming titles as well, our premium titles, to ensure that we can reward all of our players and give them personal experiences regardless of whether they choose to just play in a Warzone or also playing the premium game as well.

And then finally, I think on your last question was in regards to next-gen pricing. And so what I'll say here is we'll be sharing our plans soon. So I'm not going to share anything today. For now, we're just very excited for the launch of the new generation of hardware. We think it represents another strong leap forward in creating really incredible entertainment and value for our fans as we look forward. Thank you."

I think the teams have done a good job in adapting to a remote work environment. When you think about the team-based collaboration that's required to create great games, the current remote work environment does have some challenges when it comes to iteration and ideation. But I'm proud of the teams, and I feel like they've been incredibly resourceful to figure out ways to continue to serve the community with the great content, as you saw in Q2 and in Q1 of this year. All of this gives us a lot of momentum heading into the second half of this year when we have a lot of things planned. The WoW and the Hearthstone teams continue to bring lots of content to the community, and this is important for both of these games going forward. 
Longer-term projects that are in a more creative or collaborative stage of development make it harder to really measure the impact of the shift to remote working. And one of the things that we're conscious of is the longer the situation persists, the greater the challenge. So we're continuing to actively monitor, continuing to plan and trying to put ourselves in the best possible position, continuing to operate effectively during COVID and beyond. 
So you mentioned BlizzCon, and we did announce that we will not be bringing the community together this fall, but we are planning on channeling the spirit of BlizzCon into a virtual event early -- in early part of next year. We're really fortunate to have a passionate and engaged community that's really looking forward to what we're creating and what we're working on. And we're looking forward to sharing what the teams have been working on at that event. 
Since you asked about sequels, Diablo and Overwatch teams, they're deeply committed to creating awesome AAA experiences for players. They're working hard to bring those games to the community. And we expect the launches and data that we continue to release from those to be big events for those franchises. 
And beyond those launches, we've been focused on delivering new experiences in our live games the community really enjoys. So we talked about here in WoW through Classic, we've been able to introduce more content from the existing subscription to continue to give the community real reasons to stay engaged. 
And now outside of the temple secret -- sequels, we have another -- a number of initiatives that are underway, and we expect to deliver strong and consistent performance in the future. That's something that's very important to us. Thanks for the question."

Our advertising business proved resilient in the second quarter, and we delivered robust year-over-year growth. Now at the heart of this ad business is our platform, which provides a fully controlled, safe environment for brands. And that's a very powerful value proposition for advertisers, especially given the current backdrop. 
Now to add to that, we have a number of initiatives underway that will further strengthen this platform. So as an example, we're continuing to invest in the direct sales force and expand our network demand partners as well. And again, we saw strong year-over-year growth across both the direct advertisers and our demand partners in Q2. Now add to that, that we're continuing to invest in our tech infrastructure, and we continue to invest in tools as well to further optimize this demand and the pricing around it. 
But at the heart of it, the way I think about the investment is also investment in the product itself and the innovation there. So that is also resonating. So as an example, to give one, we worked with Target in Q2, and they were looking to drive awareness in consideration with their Easter marketing campaign. And when we combined an integrated sponsorship in Candy Crush Saga with our rewarded video product, Target was able to reach tens of millions of players in the U.S., and they achieved a 10-point lift in their top-of-mind awareness and a 7-point lift in consideration. So all of this is allowing to attract -- allowing us to attract new brand advertisers into the ecosystem. 
And over the past few months, we had a number of these which spanned a number of sectors. And these names span something like from Samsung to [ Buyer's ] to ABC to Sargento to Home Depot, and we continue to use our direct sales force to reach out to more of these advertisers across these sectors and continue to innovate the product around them. 
Now with all that said, there is uncertainty in the ad market, as you've seen in the recent months, and that includes Apple's recent announcement around IDSA. Now it's still too early to determine the specific impact on the business, at least on our business, but we're working closely with our advertising partners and our demand partners to prepare for these changes. So puts and takes out there, net-net, we still remain confident in the value proposition and the long-term opportunity of this advertising business."

Obviously, we do believe that it's sustainable, and we're very excited for what's going on COD Mobile. We're seeing really strong momentum with the title, the game's now surpassed over 250 million downloads globally, and it just keeps on tracking for us. Over the past several months, the team has made really great progress on adding great new content for the community and then also in optimizing the engagement, the retention and the in-game economy to make sure we're working on all components. 
So overall, the game is performing really well. And as you noted in your question, we are absolutely still reinvesting in both the product itself and also in the marketing to build an even larger audience similar to what you'd see a lot of top mobiles do, especially in this earlier growth phase to mobile. 
And -- but I'd also say at the same time, the game is still contributing nicely both to the top and bottom line for Activision. But because of its scale, we're seeing it benefit us and we're also reinvesting in it. The game's coming up on its 1-year anniversary in October, and I mentioned the content in investment. In October, we plan on delivering significant new content to the game and a lot of in-game enhancements, including a new weapon system for mobile. 
Now you've probably seen, our players have certainly noticed in Modern Warfare, how much they're enjoying customizing their weapons and how they do it in that experience, and we think the community is going to love the opportunity to do the same in COD Mobile. 
So overall, we're extremely happy with the sustained trends we're seeing on Mobile. We continue to reach new audiences around the world. And I'd say we're just very committed to growing our mobile business. For us, that includes adding additional internal mobile talent and resources. Of course, we'll continue to support our existing initiatives, and I think importantly, as we look forward, even more tightly integrating mobile into the overall Call of Duty ecosystem to bring our community together closer and having more fun. 
And I'd just like to close by, and we've mentioned this before, I think, but it is important, Call of Duty right now, through the success of our premium titles in Warzone and Mobile is larger and more global than it's ever been in any point of time in its history. And I just want to say thanks to all of our teams that have just done an incredible job across the board. And of course, we are super thankful to our incredible community for their continued trust and support for what we're doing on Call of Duty. Thanks for the question."

As you just heard from Rob, we are really bringing that community and that experience together across platforms and across experiences. And firstly, I'd say we're really just not done with Call of Duty. We're in the first inning. We've only been 5 months in since the life of Warzone, and the team is working really, really hard to integrate that with our next premium release, so we can really maximize the potential of this powerful combination of both premium and free-to-play content. 
And it's still early in expanding the audience on PC as well, which offers, as you know, a very significant potential for future growth when you consider the size of the player base, and particularly including the fact that we are now having access to players all around the world and expanding it. PC, obviously, is more accessible. 
And then as Rob was mentioning, there's a lot more to come on mobile, too. COD mobile is off to a really great start. But we're just scratching the surface of what that franchise can be on mobile and then integrating the experiences across multiple platforms, we know is just an incredible opportunity for the franchise. 
But to the early successes, they do represent incredible proof points, as to your question, of how the franchise strategy is really working. And it certainly applies to a lot of the franchises that we have. We see that our current players really want more ways to engage with their favorite IP, be it through mobile or other platforms, and that offering authentic and really deep experiences on new platforms can drive much, much higher engagement, and this quarter's results really shows that. 
And we also see that the free-to-play on mobile and other platforms can bring in multiples of new players into our franchises. Importantly, with strong execution, this is not cannibalistic. Actually, on the contrary, free-to-play coexists with other business models and can be meaningfully additive to a franchise, bringing new players into the ecosystem. 
So these proof points are relevant across our portfolio. And to your question, it's not just Diablo, but it's also across all our franchises. And our teams see an opportunity to drive a greater reach, engagement and player investment greater than ever before across the franchises. And with the really strong execution that we know we can deliver, we expect to continue that trend. And thanks again for your question."

As we talked about earlier, we are planning for the game to enter what we're calling expanded internal testing this quarter. And internal testing is an important step for us, not only from an operational perspective, but also because we have many Blizzard employees who are deeply engaged. We have quite a few extra players within the company, and a lot of the employees that we have represent many aspects of our global community. 
From the very beginning, it was important to us to ensure that this is an authentic Blizzard quality diablo experience for the huge community of the Diablo players around the world, and it's our intention to meet the expectations of those players everywhere. The type of experience that Diablo players have loved for over 20 years is one that we think is appealing to everyone, and we think that we're working here on a deep and engaging RPG on mobile. And so there's great potential for players in all regions to really love the game. And so we're more than willing to spend the time on it to get it right. We've continued to see a lot of interest and anticipation from the Diablo community, and the games come along really well. We're eager to get it into the players' hands. 
I'll mention one more thing. You asked about Diablo Immortal , but I do want to take the opportunity to also mention Diablo IV, which we are building for PC and for console and is also coming along and looking really good. We share public quarterly updates with the community, and we really discuss -- the team discusses the approach of different elements and different storytelling and design philosophies. And we need to interact and see that hard-core the Diablo player race respond with the excitement about the direction of the game. And the entire team is deeply committed to bringing them a fitting continuation to that era. And so there's a lot for players and fans in Diablo to look forward to."

And that's consistent, I think, with the broader company approach. 
So we're continuing to focus on our live franchises, and in particular, Candy Crush, where we see a really substantial opportunity for ongoing growth. And that means that we continue to invest in content and innovation features, both to engage our existing audience and to also continue to bring new players into our games network, and we've seen this pay off. We've seen double-digit growth year-on-year in Candy players, and we see continued progress on our payer conversion efforts. And we see the opportunity for growth across both the in-app purchase business and our ads business in the Candy franchise. 
Now having said that, we will continue to selectively invest in focused new games pipeline, and we explore both new IP, and where it makes sense, at the Activision IP library. So with Crash, in particular, when we saw its vibrant history and we saw what that represents over the past 20 years, it represented a great opportunity for us to expand the King portfolio with an iconic IP like that. 
We have focused our new game development efforts over the past few years to really only selectively invest behind the most exciting opportunities. And with this one, the King team is thrilled to be developing a game with this IP from the Activision catalog. And as you see from the game's trailer, it's looking really great. We're reimagining the Crash franchise for an incredible mobile experience, and we just can't wait to get this game out there to a dedicated Crash and base and to also bring it to new audiences.

I think it just brings up -- thanks, Humam. I think it just brings up a really important point. And it's a great example of what we can do as a broader organization when we leverage kind of our respective strength to maximize the potential of our IP across the company. There's multiple examples. If you look at how we partner with Blizzard to bring Call of Duty to Battle.net on PC, where we've driven record results. We also launched a world-class city-based e-sports business with the Call of Duty League in partnership with our Activision Blizzard e-sports team. 
And so now, in the case of Crash, this IP is getting the full treatment it deserves, and it's getting it because of the talent across the company. First, we're very thrilled as we bring in brand-new experience to consoles in October with Crash 4, and the game is just coming along really great, and the team at  Toys For Bob has done an excellent job of ensuring the game honors its rich history, yet delivers something to new and fun for fans. So that's one really important vector that we're focused on. 
But then as we think in terms of mobile, last year, we launched Call of Duty and Modern Warfare very successfully and very close together, quite frankly. And together, these games have proven accretive to our overall results and have certainly grown our audience on a global basis. So now we're standing here, we look at this opportunity with King and thinking what a perfect opportunity, partner with a talented team there who's so proven in mobile and have such great talent in their organization to expand the Crash IP on mobile with a unique game experience that's different from what we're doing on console, and then, of course, while at the same time, delivering a new premium experience to consoles of Crash 4. 
So net-net, for me, one, it's a great time to be a Crash fan; and two, it's just also really great to see the company, I think, working so well together on so many fronts. So that's what I would add. So thanks."

We've known you for a long time, and we always try to be as thoughtful as we can and prudent in our approach to guidance. But I think it's even more important now, obviously, with the economic backdrop being so volatile and unpredictable. 
Regarding shelter at home, you heard it in our prepared remarks and Daniel referenced it earlier, we have seen some engagement and tailwinds moderating somewhat as regions reopen, particularly in some of our games that have less social connective tissue. We're assuming in our guidance, that continues as more regions reopen in Q3. Although it's not entirely clear how quickly that plays out because the trends kind of are different in different regions of the world. 
Even so, we're obviously very strong. We have strong momentum, and we feel really confident about our third quarter guidance, particularly because our largest franchises have so much momentum and that leads us to the strong guidance we provided for Q3 already. 
When you turn to Q4, our Q4 guide implies you'll see some appropriate risk that we've applied into our outlook. Obviously, there's a few reasons for that. Everyone is aware of the economic backdrop that we're in with unemployment in unusual levels and risk to consumer spending, particularly with new consoles coming out, which will absorb some consumer wallets as they purchase new hardware, and similarly, want to be relatively conservative about the retail channel as that continues to contract. We do see -- obviously, the flip side of that is a strong benefit and tailwind that brings to digital for us, which was -- as the comments mentioned earlier, we have seen acceleration on that side for the console, which is a nice tailwind, and we expect that to continue. 
In an environment like this, and we talked a little bit about it last quarter, we do feel really good about the value proposition of our content in past challenging economic times. Interactive entertainment, given its low cost per hour relative to other forms of entertainment, is a very compelling value for consumers. So hopefully, that bodes well even in this uncertain economic environment that we find ourselves in. 
But similar to the last quarter, obviously, there's a lot of unknowns, and we've tried to be prudent with our guidance. But in spite of that, we've obviously raised our full year guidance by the largest amount in our history. And we believe there's obviously potential for even further overperformance if some of those risks don't materialize and if we can navigate through them effectively, which obviously would give us great momentum existing the year with a very, very large player base heading into 2021 and beyond. So lots of opportunity in front of us, albeit in an uncertain time. 
So thank you very much for the question, and thank you very much for everyone for joining us today and for your participation and interest. We look forward to speaking with many of you this quarter throughout the quarter. And hopefully, we'll see many of you again. Thank you."

We hope all of you and your families are safe and healthy.

We hope all of you and your families are safe and healthy. Our employees continue to do an extraordinary job managing family demands, working in challenging circumstances and remaining focused on execution of our stakeholder priorities. Ensuring that our employees and their families have the very best health care, everywhere we operate remains our priority. 
Against the backdrop of the ongoing pandemic and significant social and cultural upheaval, we are delivering entertainment that inspires and unites, helps break down barriers and enables players to forge and sustain friendships and community through gameplay. With billions of gamers worldwide, games provide social interactions that connect people more deeply than any other form of entertainment. 
The investments we have made in new compelling content and experiences within our franchises have helped us expand to almost every country in the world across a wide range of audiences. Today, we have a broad and diverse player base of over 400 million players, with over 100 million players in each key region we operate: EMEA, Asia Pacific and the Americas. And we estimate that approximately half of our players are now female. We have an opportunity to grow and serve more players globally as we discover more ways to connect and engage the world through our epic entertainment. 
Our second quarter results significantly exceeded our prior outlook for both revenue and earnings per share, and with continued momentum in our business, we are again raising our full year outlook. Of course, in these uncertain and unpredictable times, our results are subject to change and volatility. 
In the second quarter, our player base grew 30% year-over-year, adding more than 100 million monthly active players. Time spent in our games grew 70% over the same period and Q2 engagement and player investment were at historic highs. We grew net bookings 70% year-over-year, setting new highs for second quarter net bookings on both mobile and console, with operating margin up strongly year-over-year. 
Our results benefited from increased demand from our content as people around the world sheltered at home. This upside varied across businesses and franchises with our most social content seeing the strongest and longer-lasting impact. The biggest driver of our year-over-year engagement and financial performance was Call of Duty, which has seen a remarkable increase in its scale as we expanded the franchise across platforms, geographies and business models. As the world starts to reopen, we believe these actions have delivered a true structural change in the trajectory of our largest franchise, and this is the road map we plan to follow for the many franchises we have in our library, which dates back to 1980. 
The launch of Warzone within the Call of Duty universe has given existing players compelling new content and enabled large numbers of first-time players to unleash their inter-military heroes. Over 75 million people have played Warzone since its launch, adding significant reach and engagement to a franchise that already enjoyed strong momentum following the 2019 launches of Modern Warfare and Call of Duty Mobile. 
We've truly seen a step change in the engagement of our franchise, with total time spent in Call of Duty in Q2, more than 8x higher than in the year ago quarter. And as players engage, they're choosing to invest, with in-game player investment and sales of premium content both meaningfully higher than last year. The expansion of the Call of Duty franchise to over 100 million players across PC, console and mobile highlights the scale of the opportunity for our broader portfolio of fully owned intellectual property. 
We're also seeing ongoing momentum from our growth initiatives for World of Warcraft and Candy Crush. And as we execute on our pipeline of major content and live operations on mobile, PC and console, we expect to continue expanding the scale of our franchises. We remain focused on investing in our creative talent, growing our development teams to continue delivering more high-quality content more frequently and continuing to reduce unnecessary process that stifles innovation and creativity. 
With more players in more countries on more platforms and our deep experience across a wide range of business models, we're on track to deliver the strong long-term financial performance that our stakeholders expect. 
I'm incredibly proud of our employees and their families. They have overcome difficulties, demonstrated great empathy and resilience and, through extraordinary circumstance, have remained steadfast in their commitment to meet growing audience demand for our games. And more than ever, there's a growing need for the services of our Call of Duty Endowment, which helps returning veterans transition to the civilian workforce. We, of course, were delighted to fund a record number of placements in the second quarter and have now helped more than 72,000 veterans find high-quality jobs since we started the Call of Duty Endowment in 2009. 
In the near term, while the economic outlook remains very unclear, the ongoing commitment of our creative and commercial teams should enable us to remain on track to deliver great new content in the second half of the year. We now expect record full year net bookings and earnings per share. 
Thank you all for your support and your encouragement. Daniel will now review the highlights of our operations for the past quarter with you."
4222231,675644289,2086341,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2020",2020-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bobby. As you heard, Activision Blizzard significantly exceeded its second quarter outlook. Each of our key franchises delivered better-than-expected results, with growth led by the Call of Duty franchise following the launch of Warzone. Duri",1362,"Thank you, Bobby. 
As you heard, Activision Blizzard significantly exceeded its second quarter outlook. Each of our key franchises delivered better-than-expected results, with growth led by the Call of Duty franchise following the launch of Warzone. During the quarter, we remained laser-focused on driving financial performance through our 3 strategic growth drivers of expanding audience reach, deepening engagement and increasing player investment. Strong execution against these growth drivers enabled us to serve compelling experiences to an expanded gaming audience against a backdrop of demand tailwinds from shelter at home in the quarter. We saw substantial growth in our biggest franchises, and importantly, the increased investment and successful initiatives that drove strong Q2 results also positioned us to continue growing and delighting our global communities and to deliver sustained, greater financial performance over the long term. 
Now turning to our franchise and operational highlights across our business units. Starting with Activision. Monthly active users or MAUs grew more than threefold year-over-year to 125 million. Call of Duty reached new heights in the quarter with reach, engagement and player investment experiencing another step change increase following the launch of Warzone in March. Warzone has now brought in more than 75 million players. In the first full quarter since Warzone launched, hours played in the Modern Warfare universe increased eightfold year-over-year, driven by both existing and new players. 
As Warzone players engaged, many upgraded to premium Modern Warfare experience. In fact, in Q2, we added more players outside of the launch quarter to the premium Call of Duty experience than ever before with the majority coming through Warzone, reflecting the powerful combination of premium differentiated content alongside a free offering.  
Warzone's success is enabling us to reach new players in new geographies, including on PC, with PC consumption more than double the prior premium content release. Call of Duty in-game net bookings more than doubled from Q1 and were around 5x higher than the year ago quarter. In its first 3 quarters, total in-game net bookings for Modern Warfare now exceeded the prior 3 Call of Duty titles combined over the same period. 
Engagement has remained strong in the third quarter and our fifth season of new content launches tomorrow with map changes and new events that we think will continue to delight players. As we look ahead, Activision will continue to build on its direct digital relationship with this expanding community as it delivers the next premium installment for Call of Duty, which comes from a wholly owned Call of Duty studios, Treyarch and Raven Software. We're excited for its planned release later this year. 
Call of Duty continues to break new ground on the mobile platform, too. Call of Duty Mobile saw strong sequential growth in engagement and player investment. Benefiting from both shelter in place tailwinds and the team's ongoing work to further optimize gameplay, monthly seasonal content and the in-game economy. The game climbed up the U.S. app store grossing charts, and each of the 3 seasons in Q2 generated more net bookings per day than the prior. And having pivoted all matches to online play in remote production in April, we continue to celebrate player achievement and drive even greater franchise engagement with a Call of Duty League. 
And Activision continues to refresh beloved IP for some of the world's most passionate fans with 2 titles that are shaping up fantastically. We are thrilled to again partner with legendary skateboarder, Tony Hawk, to bring Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 back to gamers in September. And Activision will build on the incredible success of the Crash franchise in recent years to launch Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time, the first entirely new build from the ground up crash experience in over a decade, launching in October. 
Now turning to Blizzard. MAUs were 32 million in Q2. World of Warcraft reach and engagement once again increased sequentially as shelter-at-home conditions further boosted the franchise's strong trajectory since the launch of Classic. Blizzard is delivering live operations, quality-of-life enhancements and major content to keep its expanded community engaged. This includes the release of the most significant multiplayer event in WoW Classic in July, and anticipation continues to build for Shadowlands, the next expansion for modern WoW coming in the fourth quarter. Engagement in the franchise is the highest it has been at this point ahead of an expansion in a decade. And Shadowlands is seeing an enthusiastic response from players in its public testing, with presales accelerating even further in the second quarter. 
The expanded Hearthstone team launched the game's latest expansion as well as a new hero class during the second quarter as they continue to accelerate the pace of innovative content in the franchise. Building on the success of Battlegrounds and strong execution in live operation, the Hearthstone pipeline includes expansions, new engagement features and exciting new game mode planned for the coming quarters. 
Overwatch saw a significant number of returning players contributing to strong year-over-year growth in engagement. The franchise continues to enjoy a sizable, loyal and engaged community, both in the game and bolstered by ongoing enthusiasm for the Overwatch League as the development team works on the eagerly anticipated Overwatch 2. 
And finally, the Diablo franchises entry into mobile, the Diablo Immortal, looks great, with Blizzard planning to expand internal testing with the company play test to start in the coming weeks. 
Now turning to King. King MAUs increased 5% year-over-year to 271 million, including double-digit growth in MAUs for the Candy Crush franchise. King delivered strong increases in reach and engagement amidst shelter-at-home conditions at the start of Q2. We saw these tailwinds moderate in the second half of the quarter, although MAUs remained higher year-over-year, again, driven by Candy Crush. 
The team's ongoing initiatives to broaden the payer base enable the business to benefit from this higher reach and engagement. Payer conversion was higher year-over-year throughout Q2, continuing the improving trends seen in recent quarters and positioning the business for stronger results over the medium and long term. And Candy Crush was once again the top-grossing franchise in the U.S. app stores. 
King recently announced its first release since narrowing its pipeline to focus on its highest-potential projects. As we leverage the strongest capabilities across our business units to further expand the reach of our IP, King will bring Activision's beloved Crash franchise to the mobile platform. Crash Bandicoot: On the Run, is an ambitious new take on the runner category with deep social and resource management elements, and the game is already looking great as it progresses through testing. 
Along with higher performance for in-app purchases, King also delivered strong growth in advertising, accelerating through the quarter, even with ongoing headwinds in the digital advertising sector. While the backdrop remains uncertain, the performance once again validates the value proposition of our premium, safe platform for brands in any environment. 
Turning to the impact of the pandemic on demand. Shelter-at-home conditions boosted reach and engagement for each of our key franchises in the first half of the quarter. These tailwinds moderated in the second half as more countries started to reopen with trends varying across geographies and franchises. EMEA and Asia Pacific saw greater moderation as lockdowns ended, with the Americas seeing more sustained tailwinds. And while casual franchises returned to more typical trends more quickly, our core franchises, with the greatest emphasis on social, multi-player game play are seeing engagement remain elevated even as regions reopen. 
From an operational perspective, while the vast majority of our employees continue to work from home, our teams continue to deliver content, features and services to our players. As discussed last quarter, remote working does add complexity and challenges in some areas of the game development process, but our mitigation measures have been affected so far, and we believe we are on track to deliver new content in the second half. 
In summary, our franchise focus and a return to the execution standards that have driven our business for decades will result in substantial overperformance against our original outlook. 
Dennis will now share the detailed results of our second quarter and specifics of our revised outlook. Dennis?"

Today, I will review our Q2 2020 results as well as our outlook for 2020 and the third quarter. Our second quarter revenue and earnings were well ahead of our prior outlook, primarily driven by a strong player response to our initiatives in the Call of Duty franchise, along with greater-than-anticipated shelter-at-home tailwinds for our other franchises. 
To review the quarter, let's start with our segment results. Activision revenue was $993 million, increasing 270% year-over-year. Growth was driven by Modern Warfare and Warzone in game revenues, strong sales of premium Modern Warfare, the addition of Call of Duty Mobile as well as catalog content sales. Operating income was $559 million. Activision's operating margin was 56%, an all-time record, reflecting high incremental margins for both in-game and upfront sales on console and PC. 
Blizzard revenue was $461 million, growing 20% year-over-year, driven by another strong quarter of growth for World of Warcraft. Operating income was $203 million with an operating margin of 44%, both significantly higher year-over-year. 
King revenue was $553 million, was the highest since the 2016 acquisition growing 11% year-over-year. In-app revenue growth moderated during the quarter but remained positive throughout, while advertising revenues reaccelerated throughout the quarter. Operating income was $212 million, again, the highest since the acquisition, with an operating margin of 38%, 4 percentage points higher year-over-year. 
Across our segments, in-game net bookings grew 77% year-over-year to a record $1.37 billion. 
Now let's turn to our consolidated results. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be referencing non-GAAP figures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. 
For the quarter, we generated Q2 GAAP revenues of $1.93 billion, $242 million above our May guidance. This includes the net deferral of $146 million. Net bookings of $2.08 billion were $403 million above our May outlook. And we generated Q2 GAAP EPS of $0.75 and Q2 non-GAAP EPS of $0.81, which was $0.17 above guidance. These figures include the net deferral of $0.16. 
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Q2 operating cash flow was $768 million, increasing over $600 million year-over-year, reflecting higher operating income and lower cash taxes, offset by working capital timing. During the quarter, we paid an annual dividend of $0.41 per share, 11% higher year-over-year for a total of $316 million. Our cash investments at the end of June was approximately $6.5 billion, and we ended the quarter with a net cash position of approximately $3.8 billion. We have long viewed our strong balance sheet as a strategic asset, and we're pleased with the strength of our business fundamentals and conservative financial policy were recognized in the recent upgrade of our credit rating to A- at S&P. 
Now let's turn to our outlook for Q3 and the full year. With regard to our slate, in Q3, Activision's fifth season of content for Call of Duty Modern Warfare and Warzone launches tomorrow, and the team will release new features, events and seasons for Call of Duty Mobile. On September 4, Activision will release Tony Hawk, Pro Skater 1 and 2 for the Playstation 4, Xbox One and PC. Blizzard will launch its latest Hearthstone expansion, Scholomance Academy, on Thursday this week, and through the quarter, we'll continue to support other key franchises with in-game content. And King is planning numerous features and innovative live ops in Candy Crush as well as other games across its portfolio. 
In the fourth quarter, in addition to ongoing live ops and in-game content across the portfolio, Activision plans to launch Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time, and most importantly, the new Call of Duty premium release is slated to arrive into what we expect to be the largest and most engaged franchise player base at launch ever. And Blizzard plans to release the World of Warcraft Shadowlands expansion for its expanded community. In the second half, we will also continue to refine and test new mobile content in our pipeline, although consistent with our prior outlook, we don't include any material revenue from new mobile titles in our guidance. 
Before I discuss the specifics of our outlook, I'll provide some context. We continue to experience strong momentum in the business even as tailwinds from shelter in place moderate. In the second half, we are planning to launch major new content into key franchises with meaningfully larger audiences than we have seen previously, creating the opportunity for strong financial results. 
In particular, the addition of the Warzone free-to-play experience has significantly increased the reach, engagement and player investment in Call of Duty, building on existing strength for our largest franchise and creating a strong foundation for future financial performance. That said, we remain mindful of risks and uncertainties related to the global economic weakness, rising unemployment and potential pressures on the retail channel and pricing. 
The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to fully predict at this time. We continue to believe we are being prudent in our guidance to account for these risks, and there could be overperformance if these risks do not materialize. So with that as a backdrop, we are again raising our outlook for net bookings, revenue and EPS for the year, with our full year outlook increasing by an amount greater than our second quarter overperformance. 
Now let me get into the specifics. For Q3 on a GAAP basis, we now expect revenues of $1.8 billion, including the net recognition of deferrals of $150 million. We expect net bookings of $1.65 billion. Product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 18% and operating expenses including software amortization of 46% and a GAAP-only restructuring charge of approximately $20 million. We expect a tax rate of 20%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 780 million and EPS of $0.64. 
For Q3 on a non-GAAP basis, we now expect product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 18% and operating expenses, including software amortization of 40%. We expect a tax rate of 19% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.75, including the net recognition of deferrals of $0.15. On a GAAP basis for 2020, we now expect revenues of $7.28 billion, including net deferrals of $350 million. We now expect net bookings of $7.63 billion, $725 million above our May outlook. Product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 19%; operating expenses, including software amortization of 47%; and a GAAP-only restructuring charge of approximately $50 million. We expect a GAAP tax rate of 20%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 780 million and GAAP EPS of $2.46. 
For 2020, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 19% and operating expenses, including software amortization of 42%. We expect a tax rate of 19% and non-GAAP EPS of $2.87, including net deferrals of $0.18. 
So in closing, our business has strong momentum heading into the back half of the year. Having increased investment in development and commercial resources for our largest franchises last year, strong execution against our strategic initiatives meant we were well positioned to drive growth in reach, engagement and player investment in the second quarter as people sheltered at home. This puts us in a very good place for the second half of the year and beyond. 
The opportunity set for our business and wholly owned franchises across platforms, geographies and business models has never been greater, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver the long-term business excellence and performance that our shareholders rightly expect.

It certainly looks as if COVID has really accelerated secular trends in the sector. In terms of our player numbers and engagement, we think you're seeing an acceleration in something that was already strong and was the strong growth in gaming that we've been experiencing. Consumer leisure time has been shifting to more interactive forms of entertainment for many years, and that has just accelerated in the recent months. 
Now we believe that as new players come into gaming, they're going to gravitate towards the largest franchises that have massive communities who are enjoying fresh and compelling experiences. So we've seen that with Call of Duty and World of Warcraft, in particular, where our content initiatives over the last few quarters meant that we were really well positioned to deliver great content as new players came in. 
And as we continue to benefit from the social nature of many of our games, we expect that as new players engage and form in-game connections with existing or new friends, many of them will stay engaged for the long term, and we see this as a really big opportunity. And as you'd expect, in our franchises, we're doing everything we can to welcome as many new players as possible and expanding the funnel to bring more gamers into our communities and really give them the compelling social experiences that turns them into long-term fans. 
We've also seen a further acceleration in the ongoing mix towards full game downloads, which, as you know, has a positive financial impact for us. And as you've seen for many years now that as consumers buy media digitally, they tend not to go back to physical purchases because of the conveniences and the advantages of buying digital. So we think this shift is likely going to be sustained. 
Now some of the demand tailwinds from shelter at home are moderating, as we discussed in our opening remarks, but what's more important for us as we look forward is that there's just such a huge opportunity for us to further expand our franchises as we execute on our pipeline and our growth initiatives and invest in great and innovative new content. 
And while we have over 400 million players already, there's billions of users and gamers out there worldwide. We want to continue to find ways for them to experience our franchises in whichever way that they prefer. We have the pipeline in place to achieve that and are focused on continuing to execute against this pipeline to really unlock that full potential of our portfolio."

Thanks for those questions. Let me try to attack them one by one. I'd probably want to start out by saying first the success of what we're saying, Warzone and Call of Duty Mobile, in addition to, of course, what we've continued to see in our premium games, has created a ton of new opportunities for the franchise. And so starting with marketing, it's definitely had an impact there on how we think about marketing in this new world. As you've seen from our results, right now, we have a larger, more engaged and more global audience than we've ever had at any point in time in our history. And that means that we could be more direct and more targeted than we've ever been before. So that's a huge benefit and plus for us as we think about marketing on that vector. 
Another thing I think that's really important for us as it relates to marketing is from storytelling, from a storytelling perspective, where we can be even more, I think, creative and fun and engaging with our fans than ever before. So if you look at Warzone, in particular, it's not only like a great game experience, but it's also a great platform for us to share new franchise news and information directly with our community like we haven't done before. So this is also a big and positive change for us as we think about the business. 
And kind of to your initial point that you're talking about, why you were waiting for such a long time, we are and we aren't. But it's Warzone, I think, that's caused us to rethink how, when and even where we reveal our upcoming titles. So we can't wait to share it with the community, and we think it's going to be very different and more engaging than anything that we've ever done before. 
Now as you heard on the call before, Treyarch and Raven are coming up with the next premium game. And obviously, very excited on what they're working on, and we do think fans are going to absolutely love it. The game looks incredible right now. And internally, people having a ton of fun, playing across its campaign mode as well as the online mode that the developers are very well known for. And so all I can say in terms of timing is I suspect you'll be hearing more about this fairly soon. 
Now on your question of how we're going to integrate the new title with Warzone, I think that's a good one, and it's an important one. And what you should expect is that we do a very tight integration between the two. Modern Warfare and Warzone are obviously very tightly connected. I think that's really important for the player base. And we plan to do the same with all our upcoming titles as well, our premium titles, to ensure that we can reward all of our players and give them personal experiences regardless of whether they choose to just play in a Warzone or also playing the premium game as well. So the connection will absolutely be there. 
And then finally, I think on your last question was in regards to next-gen pricing. And so what I'll say here is we'll be sharing our plans soon. So I'm not going to share anything today. For now, we're just very excited for the launch of the new generation of hardware.

I think the teams have done a good job in adapting to a remote work environment. When you think about the team-based collaboration that's required to create great games, the current remote work environment does have some challenges when it comes to iteration and ideation. But I'm proud of the teams, and I feel like they've been incredibly resourceful to figure out ways to continue to serve the community with the great content, as you saw in Q2 and in Q1 of this year. All of this gives us a lot of momentum heading into the second half of this year when we have a lot of things planned. The WoW and the Hearthstone teams continue to bring lots of content to the community, and this is important for both of these games going forward. 
Longer-term projects that are in a more creative or collaborative stage of development make it harder to really measure the impact of the shift to remote working. And one of the things that we're conscious of is the longer the situation persists, the greater the challenge. So we're continuing to actively monitor, continuing to plan and trying to put ourselves in the best possible position, continuing to operate effectively during COVID and beyond. 
So you mentioned BlizzCon, and we did announce that we will not be bringing the community together this fall, but we are planning on channeling the spirit of BlizzCon into a virtual event early -- in early part of next year. We're really fortunate to have a passionate and engaged community that's really looking forward to what we're creating and what we're working on. And we're looking forward to sharing what the teams have been working on at that event. 
Since you asked about sequels, Diablo and Overwatch teams, they're deeply committed to creating awesome AAA experiences for players. They're working hard to bring those games to the community. And we expect the launches and data that we continue to release from those to be big events for those franchises. 
And beyond those launches, we've been focused on delivering new experiences in our live games the community really enjoys. So we talked about here in WoW through Classic, we've been able to introduce more content from the existing subscription to continue to give the community real reasons to stay engaged. 
And now outside of the temple secret -- sequels, we have another -- a number of initiatives that are underway, and we expect to deliver strong and consistent performance in the future. That's something that's very important to us. Thanks for the question."

Our advertising business proved resilient in the second quarter, and we delivered robust year-over-year growth. Now at the heart of this ad business is our platform, which provides a fully controlled, safe environment for brands. And that's a very powerful value proposition for advertisers, especially given the current backdrop. 
Now to add to that, we have a number of initiatives underway that will further strengthen this platform. So as an example, we're continuing to invest in the direct sales force and expand our network demand partners as well. And again, we saw strong year-over-year growth across both the direct advertisers and our demand partners in Q2. Now add to that, that we're continuing to invest in our tech infrastructure, and we continue to invest in tools as well to further optimize this demand and the pricing around it. 
But at the heart of it, the way I think about the investment is also investment in the product itself and the innovation there. So that is also resonating. So as an example, to give one, we worked with Target in Q2, and they were looking to drive awareness in consideration with their Easter marketing campaign. And when we combined an integrated sponsorship in Candy Crush Saga with our rewarded video product, Target was able to reach tens of millions of players in the U.S., and they achieved a 10-point lift in their top-of-mind awareness and a 7-point lift in consideration. So all of this is allowing to attract -- allowing us to attract new brand advertisers into the ecosystem. 
And over the past few months, we had a number of these which spanned a number of sectors. And these names span something like from Samsung to [ Buyer's ] to ABC to Sargento to Home Depot, and we continue to use our direct sales force to reach out to more of these advertisers across these sectors and continue to innovate the product around them. 
Now with all that said, there is uncertainty in the ad market, as you've seen in the recent months, and that includes Apple's recent announcement around IDSA. Now it's still too early to determine the specific impact on the business, at least on our business, but we're working closely with our advertising partners and our demand partners to prepare for these changes. So puts and takes out there, net-net, we still remain confident in the value proposition and the long-term opportunity of this advertising business."

Obviously, we do believe that it's sustainable, and we're very excited for what's going on COD Mobile. We're seeing really strong momentum with the title, the game's now surpassed over 250 million downloads globally, and it just keeps on tracking for us. Over the past several months, the team has made really great progress on adding great new content for the community and then also in optimizing the engagement, the retention and the in-game economy to make sure we're working on all components. 
So overall, the game is performing really well. And as you noted in your question, we are absolutely still reinvesting in both the product itself and also in the marketing to build an even larger audience similar to what you'd see a lot of top mobiles do, especially in this earlier growth phase to mobile. 
And -- but I'd also say at the same time, the game is still contributing nicely both to the top and bottom line for Activision. But because of its scale, we're seeing it benefit us and we're also reinvesting in it. The game's coming up on its 1-year anniversary in October, and I mentioned the content in investment. In October, we plan on delivering significant new content to the game and a lot of in-game enhancements, including a new weapon system for mobile. 
Now you've probably seen, our players have certainly noticed in Modern Warfare, how much they're enjoying customizing their weapons and how they do it in that experience, and we think the community is going to love the opportunity to do the same in COD Mobile. 
So overall, we're extremely happy with the sustained trends we're seeing on Mobile. We continue to reach new audiences around the world. And I'd say we're just very committed to growing our mobile business. For us, that includes adding additional internal mobile talent and resources. Of course, we'll continue to support our existing initiatives, and I think importantly, as we look forward, even more tightly integrating mobile into the overall Call of Duty ecosystem to bring our community together closer and having more fun. 
And I'd just like to close by, and we've mentioned this before, I think, but it is important, Call of Duty right now, through the success of our premium titles in Warzone and Mobile is larger and more global than it's ever been in any point of time in its history. And I just want to say thanks to all of our teams that have just done an incredible job across the board. And of course, we are super thankful to our incredible community for their continued trust and support for what we're doing on Call of Duty. Thanks for the question."

As you just heard from Rob, we are really bringing that community and that experience together across platforms and across experiences. And firstly, I'd say we're really just not done with Call of Duty. We're in the first inning. We've only been 5 months in since the life of Warzone, and the team is working really, really hard to integrate that with our next premium release, so we can really maximize the potential of this powerful combination of both premium and free-to-play content. 
And it's still early in expanding the audience on PC as well, which offers, as you know, a very significant potential for future growth when you consider the size of the player base, and particularly including the fact that we are now having access to players all around the world and expanding it. PC, obviously, is more accessible. 
And then as Rob was mentioning, there's a lot more to come on mobile, too. COD mobile is off to a really great start. But we're just scratching the surface of what that franchise can be on mobile and then integrating the experiences across multiple platforms, we know is just an incredible opportunity for the franchise. 
But to the early successes, they do represent incredible proof points, as to your question, of how the franchise strategy is really working. And it certainly applies to a lot of the franchises that we have. We see that our current players really want more ways to engage with their favorite IP, be it through mobile or other platforms, and that offering authentic and really deep experiences on new platforms can drive much, much higher engagement, and this quarter's results really shows that. 
And we also see that the free-to-play on mobile and other platforms can bring in multiples of new players into our franchises. Importantly, with strong execution, this is not cannibalistic. Actually, on the contrary, free-to-play coexists with other business models and can be meaningfully additive to a franchise, bringing new players into the ecosystem. 
So these proof points are relevant across our portfolio. And to your question, it's not just Diablo, but it's also across all our franchises. And our teams see an opportunity to drive a greater reach, engagement and player investment greater than ever before across the franchises. And with the really strong execution that we know we can deliver, we expect to continue that trend. And thanks again for your question."

As we talked about earlier, we are planning for the game to enter what we're calling expanded internal testing this quarter. And internal testing is an important step for us, not only from an operational perspective but also because we have many Blizzard employees who are deeply engaged. We have quite a few extra players within the company, and a lot of the employees that we have represent many aspects of our global community. 
From the very beginning, it was important to us to ensure that this is an authentic Blizzard quality diablo experience for the huge community of the Diablo players around the world, and it's our intention to meet the expectations of those players everywhere. The type of experience that Diablo players have loved for over 20 years is one that we think is appealing to everyone, and we think that we're working here on a deep and engaging RPG on mobile. And so there's great potential for players in all regions to really love the game. And so we're more than willing to spend the time on it to get it right. We've continued to see a lot of interest and anticipation from the Diablo community, and the games come along really well. We're eager to get it into the players' hands. 
I'll mention one more thing. You asked about Diablo Immortal, but I do want to take the opportunity to also mention Diablo IV, which we are building for PC and for console and is also coming along and looking really good. We share public quarterly updates with the community, and we really discuss -- the team discusses the approach of different elements and different storytelling and design philosophies. And we need to interact and see that hard-core the Diablo player race respond with the excitement about the direction of the game. And the entire team is deeply committed to bringing them a fitting continuation to that era. And so there's a lot for players and fans in Diablo to look forward to."

And that's consistent, I think, with the broader company approach. 
So we're continuing to focus on our live franchises, and in particular, Candy Crush, where we see a really substantial opportunity for ongoing growth. And that means that we continue to invest in content and innovation features, both to engage our existing audience and to also continue to bring new players into our games network, and we've seen this pay off. We've seen double-digit growth year-on-year in Candy players, and we see continued progress on our payer conversion efforts. And we see the opportunity for growth across both the in-app purchase business and our ads business in the Candy franchise. 
Now having said that, we will continue to selectively invest in focused new games pipeline, and we explore both new IP, and where it makes sense, at the Activision IP library. So with Crash, in particular, when we saw its vibrant history and we saw what that represents over the past 20 years, it represented a great opportunity for us to expand the King portfolio with an iconic IP like that. 
We have focused our new game development efforts over the past few years to really only selectively invest behind the most exciting opportunities. And with this one, the King team is thrilled to be developing a game with this IP from the Activision catalog. And as you see from the game's trailer, it's looking really great. We're reimagining the Crash franchise for an incredible mobile experience, and we just can't wait to get this game out there to a dedicated Crash and base and to also bring it to new audiences.

I think it just brings up -- thanks, Humam. I think it just brings up a really important point. And it's a great example of what we can do as a broader organization when we leverage kind of our respective strength to maximize the potential of our IP across the company. There's multiple examples. If you look at how we partner with Blizzard to bring Call of Duty to Battle.net on PC, where we've driven record results. We also launched a world-class city-based e-sports business with the Call of Duty League in partnership with our Activision Blizzard e-sports team. 
And so now, in the case of Crash, this IP is getting the full treatment it deserves, and it's getting it because of the talent across the company. First, we're very thrilled as we bring in brand-new experience to consoles in October with Crash 4, and the game is just coming along really great, and the team at  Toys For Bob has done an excellent job of ensuring the game honors its rich history, yet delivers something to new and fun for fans. So that's one really important vector that we're focused on. 
But then as we think in terms of mobile, last year, we launched Call of Duty and Modern Warfare very successfully and very close together, quite frankly. And together, these games have proven accretive to our overall results and have certainly grown our audience on a global basis. So now we're standing here, we look at this opportunity with King and thinking what a perfect opportunity, partner with a talented team there who's so proven in mobile and have such great talent in their organization to expand the Crash IP on mobile with a unique game experience that's different from what we're doing on console, and then, of course, while at the same time, delivering a new premium experience to consoles of Crash 4. 
So net-net, for me, one, it's a great time to be a Crash fan; and two, it's just also really great to see the company, I think, working so well together on so many fronts. So that's what I would add. So thanks."

We've known you for a long time, and we always try to be as thoughtful as we can and prudent in our approach to guidance. But I think it's even more important now, obviously, with the economic backdrop being so volatile and unpredictable. 
Regarding shelter at home, you heard it in our prepared remarks and Daniel referenced it earlier, we have seen some engagement and tailwinds moderating somewhat as regions reopen, particularly in some of our games that have less social connective tissue. We're assuming in our guidance, that continues as more regions reopen in Q3. Although it's not entirely clear how quickly that plays out because the trends kind of are different in different regions of the world. 
Even so, we're obviously very strong. We have strong momentum, and we feel really confident about our third quarter guidance, particularly because our largest franchises have so much momentum and that leads us to the strong guidance we provided for Q3 already. 
When you turn to Q4, our Q4 guide implies you'll see some appropriate risk that we've applied into our outlook. Obviously, there's a few reasons for that. Everyone is aware of the economic backdrop that we're in with unemployment in unusual levels and risk to consumer spending, particularly with new consoles coming out, which will absorb some consumer wallets as they purchase new hardware, and similarly, want to be relatively conservative about the retail channel as that continues to contract. We do see -- obviously, the flip side of that is a strong benefit and tailwind that brings to digital for us, which was -- as the comments mentioned earlier, we have seen acceleration on that side for the console, which is a nice tailwind, and we expect that to continue. 
In an environment like this, and we talked a little bit about it last quarter, we do feel really good about the value proposition of our content in past challenging economic times. Interactive entertainment, given its low cost per hour relative to other forms of entertainment, is a very compelling value for consumers. So hopefully, that bodes well even in this uncertain economic environment that we find ourselves in. 
But similar to the last quarter, obviously, there's a lot of unknowns, and we've tried to be prudent with our guidance. But in spite of that, we've obviously raised our full year guidance by the largest amount in our history. And we believe there's obviously potential for even further overperformance if some of those risks don't materialize and if we can navigate through them effectively, which obviously would give us great momentum existing the year with a very, very large player base heading into 2021 and beyond. So lots of opportunity in front of us, albeit in an uncertain time. 
So thank you very much for the question, and thank you very much for everyone for joining us today and for your participation and interest. We look forward to speaking with many of you this quarter throughout the quarter. And hopefully, we'll see many of you again. Thank you."

We hope all of you and your families are safe and healthy.

We hope all of you and your families are safe and healthy. Our employees continue to do an extraordinary job managing family demands, working in challenging circumstances and remaining focused on execution of our stakeholder priorities. Ensuring that our employees and their families have the very best health care, everywhere we operate remains our priority. 
Against the backdrop of the ongoing pandemic and significant social and cultural upheaval, we are delivering entertainment that inspires and unites, helps break down barriers and enables players to forge and sustain friendships and community through gameplay. With billions of gamers worldwide, games provide social interactions that connect people more deeply than any other form of entertainment. 
The investments we have made in new compelling content and experiences within our franchises have helped us expand to almost every country in the world across a wide range of audiences. Today, we have a broad and diverse player base of over 400 million players, with over 100 million players in each key region we operate: EMEA, Asia Pacific and the Americas. And we estimate that approximately half of our players are now female. We have an opportunity to grow and serve more players globally as we discover more ways to connect and engage the world through our epic entertainment. 
Our second quarter results significantly exceeded our prior outlook for both revenue and earnings per share, and with continued momentum in our business, we are again raising our full year outlook. Of course, in these uncertain and unpredictable times, our results are subject to change and volatility. 
In the second quarter, our player base grew 30% year-over-year, adding more than 100 million monthly active players. Time spent in our games grew 70% over the same period and Q2 engagement and player investment were at historic highs. We grew net bookings 70% year-over-year, setting new highs for second quarter net bookings on both mobile and console, with operating margin up strongly year-over-year. 
Our results benefited from increased demand from our content as people around the world sheltered at home. This upside varied across businesses and franchises with our most social content seeing the strongest and longer-lasting impact. The biggest driver of our year-over-year engagement and financial performance was Call of Duty, which has seen a remarkable increase in its scale as we expanded the franchise across platforms, geographies and business models. As the world starts to reopen, we believe these actions have delivered a true structural change in the trajectory of our largest franchise, and this is the road map we plan to follow for the many franchises we have in our library, which dates back to 1980. 
The launch of Warzone within the Call of Duty universe has given existing players compelling new content and enabled large numbers of first-time players to unleash their inter-military heroes. Over 75 million people have played Warzone since its launch, adding significant reach and engagement to a franchise that already enjoyed strong momentum following the 2019 launches of Modern Warfare and Call of Duty Mobile. 
We've truly seen a step change in the engagement of our franchise, with total time spent in Call of Duty in Q2, more than 8x higher than in the year ago quarter. And as players engage, they're choosing to invest, with in-game player investment and sales of premium content both meaningfully higher than last year. The expansion of the Call of Duty franchise to over 100 million players across PC, console and mobile highlights the scale of the opportunity for our broader portfolio of fully owned intellectual property. 
We're also seeing ongoing momentum from our growth initiatives for World of Warcraft and Candy Crush. And as we execute on our pipeline of major content and live operations on mobile, PC and console, we expect to continue expanding the scale of our franchises. We remain focused on investing in our creative talent, growing our development teams to continue delivering more high-quality content more frequently and continuing to reduce unnecessary process that stifles innovation and creativity. 
With more players in more countries on more platforms and our deep experience across a wide range of business models, we're on track to deliver the strong long-term financial performance that our stakeholders expect. 
I'm incredibly proud of our employees and their families. They have overcome difficulties, demonstrated great empathy and resilience and, through extraordinary circumstance, have remained steadfast in their commitment to meet growing audience demand for our games. And more than ever, there's a growing need for the services of our Call of Duty Endowment, which helps returning veterans transition to the civilian workforce. We, of course, were delighted to fund a record number of placements in the second quarter and have now helped more than 72,000 veterans find high-quality jobs since we started the Call of Duty Endowment in 2009. 
In the near term, while the economic outlook remains very unclear, the ongoing commitment of our creative and commercial teams should enable us to remain on track to deliver great new content in the second half of the year. We now expect record full year net bookings and earnings per share. 
Thank you all for your support and your encouragement. Daniel will now review the highlights of our operations for the past quarter with you."
4222231,675644289,2086342,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2020",2020-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bobby. As you heard, Activision Blizzard significantly exceeded its second quarter outlook. Each of our key franchises delivered better-than-expected results, with growth led by the Call of Duty franchise following the launch of Warzone. Duri",1362,"Thank you, Bobby. 
As you heard, Activision Blizzard significantly exceeded its second quarter outlook. Each of our key franchises delivered better-than-expected results, with growth led by the Call of Duty franchise following the launch of Warzone. During the quarter, we remained laser-focused on driving financial performance through our 3 strategic growth drivers of expanding audience reach, deepening engagement and increasing player investment. Strong execution against these growth drivers enabled us to serve compelling experiences to an expanded gaming audience against a backdrop of demand tailwinds from shelter at home in the quarter. We saw substantial growth in our biggest franchises, and importantly, the increased investment and successful initiatives that drove strong Q2 results also positioned us to continue growing and delighting our global communities and to deliver sustained, greater financial performance over the long term. 
Now turning to our franchise and operational highlights across our business units. Starting with Activision. Monthly active users or MAUs grew more than threefold year-over-year to 125 million. Call of Duty reached new heights in the quarter with reach, engagement and player investment experiencing another step change increase following the launch of Warzone in March. Warzone has now brought in more than 75 million players. In the first full quarter since Warzone launched, hours played in the Modern Warfare universe increased eightfold year-over-year, driven by both existing and new players. 
As Warzone players engaged, many upgraded to premium Modern Warfare experience. In fact, in Q2, we added more players outside of the launch quarter to the premium Call of Duty experience than ever before with the majority coming through Warzone, reflecting the powerful combination of premium differentiated content alongside a free offering.  
Warzone's success is enabling us to reach new players in new geographies, including on PC, with PC consumption more than double the prior premium content release. Call of Duty in-game net bookings more than doubled from Q1 and were around 5x higher than the year ago quarter. In its first 3 quarters, total in-game net bookings for Modern Warfare now exceeded the prior 3 Call of Duty titles combined over the same period. 
Engagement has remained strong in the third quarter and our fifth season of new content launches tomorrow with map changes and new events that we think will continue to delight players. As we look ahead, Activision will continue to build on its direct digital relationship with this expanding community as it delivers the next premium installment for Call of Duty, which comes from a wholly owned Call of Duty studios, Treyarch and Raven Software. We're excited for its planned release later this year. 
Call of Duty continues to break new ground on the mobile platform, too. Call of Duty Mobile saw strong sequential growth in engagement and player investment. Benefiting from both shelter in place tailwinds and the team's ongoing work to further optimize gameplay, monthly seasonal content and the in-game economy. The game climbed up the U.S. app store grossing charts, and each of the 3 seasons in Q2 generated more net bookings per day than the prior. And having pivoted all matches to online play in remote production in April, we continue to celebrate player achievement and drive even greater franchise engagement with a Call of Duty League. 
And Activision continues to refresh beloved IP for some of the world's most passionate fans with 2 titles that are shaping up fantastically. We are thrilled to again partner with legendary skateboarder, Tony Hawk, to bring Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 back to gamers in September. And Activision will build on the incredible success of the Crash franchise in recent years to launch Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time, the first entirely new build from the ground up crash experience in over a decade, launching in October. 
Now turning to Blizzard. MAUs were 32 million in Q2. World of Warcraft reach and engagement once again increased sequentially as shelter-at-home conditions further boosted the franchise's strong trajectory since the launch of Classic. Blizzard is delivering live operations, quality-of-life enhancements and major content to keep its expanded community engaged. This includes the release of the most significant multiplayer event in WoW Classic in July, and anticipation continues to build for Shadowlands, the next expansion for modern WoW coming in the fourth quarter. Engagement in the franchise is the highest it has been at this point ahead of an expansion in a decade. And Shadowlands is seeing an enthusiastic response from players in its public testing, with presales accelerating even further in the second quarter. 
The expanded Hearthstone team launched the game's latest expansion as well as a new hero class during the second quarter as they continue to accelerate the pace of innovative content in the franchise. Building on the success of Battlegrounds and strong execution in live operation, the Hearthstone pipeline includes expansions, new engagement features and exciting new game mode planned for the coming quarters. 
Overwatch saw a significant number of returning players contributing to strong year-over-year growth in engagement. The franchise continues to enjoy a sizable, loyal and engaged community, both in the game and bolstered by ongoing enthusiasm for the Overwatch League as the development team works on the eagerly anticipated Overwatch 2. 
And finally, the Diablo franchises entry into mobile, the Diablo Immortal, looks great, with Blizzard planning to expand internal testing with the company play test to start in the coming weeks. 
Now turning to King. King MAUs increased 5% year-over-year to 271 million, including double-digit growth in MAUs for the Candy Crush franchise. King delivered strong increases in reach and engagement amidst shelter-at-home conditions at the start of Q2. We saw these tailwinds moderate in the second half of the quarter, although MAUs remained higher year-over-year, again, driven by Candy Crush. 
The team's ongoing initiatives to broaden the payer base enable the business to benefit from this higher reach and engagement. Payer conversion was higher year-over-year throughout Q2, continuing the improving trends seen in recent quarters and positioning the business for stronger results over the medium and long term. And Candy Crush was once again the top-grossing franchise in the U.S. app stores. 
King recently announced its first release since narrowing its pipeline to focus on its highest-potential projects. As we leverage the strongest capabilities across our business units to further expand the reach of our IP, King will bring Activision's beloved Crash franchise to the mobile platform. Crash Bandicoot: On the Run, is an ambitious new take on the runner category with deep social and resource management elements, and the game is already looking great as it progresses through testing. 
Along with higher performance for in-app purchases, King also delivered strong growth in advertising, accelerating through the quarter, even with ongoing headwinds in the digital advertising sector. While the backdrop remains uncertain, the performance once again validates the value proposition of our premium, safe platform for brands in any environment. 
Turning to the impact of the pandemic on demand. Shelter-at-home conditions boosted reach and engagement for each of our key franchises in the first half of the quarter. These tailwinds moderated in the second half as more countries started to reopen with trends varying across geographies and franchises. EMEA and Asia Pacific saw greater moderation as lockdowns ended, with the Americas seeing more sustained tailwinds. And while casual franchises returned to more typical trends more quickly, our core franchises, with the greatest emphasis on social, multi-player game play are seeing engagement remain elevated even as regions reopen. 
From an operational perspective, while the vast majority of our employees continue to work from home, our teams continue to deliver content, features and services to our players. As discussed last quarter, remote working does add complexity and challenges in some areas of the game development process, but our mitigation measures have been affected so far, and we believe we are on track to deliver new content in the second half. 
In summary, our franchise focus and a return to the execution standards that have driven our business for decades will result in substantial overperformance against our original outlook. 
Dennis will now share the detailed results of our second quarter and specifics of our revised outlook. Dennis?"

Today, I will review our Q2 2020 results as well as our outlook for 2020 and the third quarter.

Today, I will review our Q2 2020 results as well as our outlook for 2020 and the third quarter. Our second quarter revenue and earnings were well ahead of our prior outlook, primarily driven by a strong player response to our initiatives in the Call of Duty franchise, along with greater-than-anticipated shelter-at-home tailwinds for our other franchises. 
To review the quarter, let's start with our segment results. Activision revenue was $993 million, increasing 270% year-over-year. Growth was driven by Modern Warfare and Warzone in game revenues, strong sales of premium Modern Warfare, the addition of Call of Duty Mobile as well as catalog content sales. Operating income was $559 million. Activision's operating margin was 56%, an all-time record, reflecting high incremental margins for both in-game and upfront sales on console and PC. 
Blizzard revenue was $461 million, growing 20% year-over-year, driven by another strong quarter of growth for World of Warcraft. Operating income was $203 million with an operating margin of 44%, both significantly higher year-over-year. 
King revenue was $553 million, was the highest since the 2016 acquisition growing 11% year-over-year. In-app revenue growth moderated during the quarter but remained positive throughout, while advertising revenues reaccelerated throughout the quarter. Operating income was $212 million, again, the highest since the acquisition, with an operating margin of 38%, 4 percentage points higher year-over-year. 
Across our segments, in-game net bookings grew 77% year-over-year to a record $1.37 billion. 
Now let's turn to our consolidated results. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be referencing non-GAAP figures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. 
For the quarter, we generated Q2 GAAP revenues of $1.93 billion, $242 million above our May guidance. This includes the net deferral of $146 million. Net bookings of $2.08 billion were $403 million above our May outlook. And we generated Q2 GAAP EPS of $0.75 and Q2 non-GAAP EPS of $0.81, which was $0.17 above guidance. These figures include the net deferral of $0.16. 
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Q2 operating cash flow was $768 million, increasing over $600 million year-over-year, reflecting higher operating income and lower cash taxes, offset by working capital timing. During the quarter, we paid an annual dividend of $0.41 per share, 11% higher year-over-year for a total of $316 million. Our cash investments at the end of June was approximately $6.5 billion, and we ended the quarter with a net cash position of approximately $3.8 billion. We have long viewed our strong balance sheet as a strategic asset, and we're pleased with the strength of our business fundamentals and conservative financial policy were recognized in the recent upgrade of our credit rating to A- at S&P. 
Now let's turn to our outlook for Q3 and the full year. With regard to our slate, in Q3, Activision's fifth season of content for Call of Duty Modern Warfare and Warzone launches tomorrow, and the team will release new features, events and seasons for Call of Duty Mobile. On September 4, Activision will release Tony Hawk, Pro Skater 1 and 2 for the Playstation 4, Xbox One and PC. Blizzard will launch its latest Hearthstone expansion, Scholomance Academy, on Thursday this week, and through the quarter, we'll continue to support other key franchises with in-game content. And King is planning numerous features and innovative live ops in Candy Crush as well as other games across its portfolio. 
In the fourth quarter, in addition to ongoing live ops and in-game content across the portfolio, Activision plans to launch Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time, and most importantly, the new Call of Duty premium release is slated to arrive into what we expect to be the largest and most engaged franchise player base at launch ever. And Blizzard plans to release the World of Warcraft Shadowlands expansion for its expanded community. In the second half, we will also continue to refine and test new mobile content in our pipeline, although consistent with our prior outlook, we don't include any material revenue from new mobile titles in our guidance. 
Before I discuss the specifics of our outlook, I'll provide some context. We continue to experience strong momentum in the business even as tailwinds from shelter in place moderate. In the second half, we are planning to launch major new content into key franchises with meaningfully larger audiences than we have seen previously, creating the opportunity for strong financial results. 
In particular, the addition of the Warzone free-to-play experience has significantly increased the reach, engagement and player investment in Call of Duty, building on existing strength for our largest franchise and creating a strong foundation for future financial performance. That said, we remain mindful of risks and uncertainties related to the global economic weakness, rising unemployment and potential pressures on the retail channel and pricing. 
The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to fully predict at this time. We continue to believe we are being prudent in our guidance to account for these risks, and there could be overperformance if these risks do not materialize. So with that as a backdrop, we are again raising our outlook for net bookings, revenue and EPS for the year, with our full year outlook increasing by an amount greater than our second quarter overperformance. 
Now let me get into the specifics. For Q3 on a GAAP basis, we now expect revenues of $1.8 billion, including the net recognition of deferrals of $150 million. We expect net bookings of $1.65 billion. Product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 18% and operating expenses including software amortization of 46% and a GAAP-only restructuring charge of approximately $20 million. We expect a tax rate of 20%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 780 million and EPS of $0.64. 
For Q3 on a non-GAAP basis, we now expect product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 18% and operating expenses, including software amortization of 40%. We expect a tax rate of 19% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.75, including the net recognition of deferrals of $0.15. On a GAAP basis for 2020, we now expect revenues of $7.28 billion, including net deferrals of $350 million. We now expect net bookings of $7.63 billion, $725 million above our May outlook. Product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 19%; operating expenses, including software amortization of 47%; and a GAAP-only restructuring charge of approximately $50 million. We expect a GAAP tax rate of 20%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 780 million and GAAP EPS of $2.46. 
For 2020, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 19% and operating expenses, including software amortization of 42%. We expect a tax rate of 19% and non-GAAP EPS of $2.87, including net deferrals of $0.18. 
So in closing, our business has strong momentum heading into the back half of the year. Having increased investment in development and commercial resources for our largest franchises last year, strong execution against our strategic initiatives meant we were well positioned to drive growth in reach, engagement and player investment in the second quarter as people sheltered at home. This puts us in a very good place for the second half of the year and beyond. 
The opportunity set for our business and wholly owned franchises across platforms, geographies and business models has never been greater, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver the long-term business excellence and performance that our shareholders rightly expect.

It certainly looks as if COVID has really accelerated secular trends in the sector. In terms of our player numbers and engagement, we think you're seeing an acceleration in something that was already strong and was the strong growth in gaming that we've been experiencing. Consumer leisure time has been shifting to more interactive forms of entertainment for many years, and that has just accelerated in the recent months. 
Now we believe that as new players come into gaming, they're going to gravitate towards the largest franchises that have massive communities who are enjoying fresh and compelling experiences. So we've seen that with Call of Duty and World of Warcraft, in particular, where our content initiatives over the last few quarters meant that we were really well positioned to deliver great content as new players came in. 
And as we continue to benefit from the social nature of many of our games, we expect that as new players engage and form in-game connections with existing or new friends, many of them will stay engaged for the long term, and we see this as a really big opportunity. And as you'd expect, in our franchises, we're doing everything we can to welcome as many new players as possible and expanding the funnel to bring more gamers into our communities and really give them the compelling social experiences that turns them into long-term fans. 
We've also seen a further acceleration in the ongoing mix towards full game downloads, which, as you know, has a positive financial impact for us. And as you've seen for many years now that as consumers buy media digitally, they tend not to go back to physical purchases because of the conveniences and the advantages of buying digital. So we think this shift is likely going to be sustained. 
Now some of the demand tailwinds from shelter at home are moderating, as we discussed in our opening remarks, but what's more important for us as we look forward is that there's just such a huge opportunity for us to further expand our franchises as we execute on our pipeline and our growth initiatives and invest in great and innovative new content. 
And while we have over 400 million players already, there's billions of users and gamers out there worldwide. We want to continue to find ways for them to experience our franchises in whichever way that they prefer. We have the pipeline in place to achieve that and are focused on continuing to execute against this pipeline to really unlock that full potential of our portfolio."

Thanks for those questions. Let me try to attack them one by one. I'd probably want to start out by saying first the success of what we're saying, Warzone and Call of Duty Mobile, in addition to, of course, what we've continued to see in our premium games, has created a ton of new opportunities for the franchise. And so starting with marketing, it's definitely had an impact there on how we think about marketing in this new world. As you've seen from our results, right now, we have a larger, more engaged and more global audience than we've ever had at any point in time in our history. And that means that we could be more direct and more targeted than we've ever been before. So that's a huge benefit and plus for us as we think about marketing on that vector. 
Another thing I think that's really important for us as it relates to marketing is from storytelling, from a storytelling perspective, where we can be even more, I think, creative and fun and engaging with our fans than ever before. So if you look at Warzone, in particular, it's not only like a great game experience, but it's also a great platform for us to share new franchise news and information directly with our community like we haven't done before. So this is also a big and positive change for us as we think about the business. 
And kind of to your initial point that you're talking about, why you were waiting for such a long time, we are and we aren't. But it's Warzone, I think, that's caused us to rethink how, when and even where we reveal our upcoming titles. So we can't wait to share it with the community, and we think it's going to be very different and more engaging than anything that we've ever done before. 
Now as you heard on the call before, Treyarch and Raven are coming up with the next premium game. And obviously, very excited on what they're working on, and we do think fans are going to absolutely love it. The game looks incredible right now. And internally, people having a ton of fun, playing across its campaign mode as well as the online mode that the developers are very well known for. And so all I can say in terms of timing is I suspect you'll be hearing more about this fairly soon. 
Now on your question of how we're going to integrate the new title with Warzone, I think that's a good one, and it's an important one. And what you should expect is that we do a very tight integration between the two. Modern Warfare and Warzone are obviously very tightly connected. I think that's really important for the player base. And we plan to do the same with all our upcoming titles as well, our premium titles, to ensure that we can reward all of our players and give them personal experiences regardless of whether they choose to just play in a Warzone or also playing the premium game as well. So the connection will absolutely be there. 
And then finally, I think on your last question was in regards to next-gen pricing. And so what I'll say here is we'll be sharing our plans soon. So I'm not going to share anything today. For now, we're just very excited for the launch of the new generation of hardware.

I think the teams have done a good job in adapting to a remote work environment. When you think about the team-based collaboration that's required to create great games, the current remote work environment does have some challenges when it comes to iteration and ideation. But I'm proud of the teams, and I feel like they've been incredibly resourceful to figure out ways to continue to serve the community with the great content, as you saw in Q2 and in Q1 of this year. All of this gives us a lot of momentum heading into the second half of this year when we have a lot of things planned. The WoW and the Hearthstone teams continue to bring lots of content to the community, and this is important for both of these games going forward. 
Longer-term projects that are in a more creative or collaborative stage of development make it harder to really measure the impact of the shift to remote working. And one of the things that we're conscious of is the longer the situation persists, the greater the challenge. So we're continuing to actively monitor, continuing to plan and trying to put ourselves in the best possible position, continuing to operate effectively during COVID and beyond. 
So you mentioned BlizzCon, and we did announce that we will not be bringing the community together this fall, but we are planning on channeling the spirit of BlizzCon into a virtual event early -- in early part of next year. We're really fortunate to have a passionate and engaged community that's really looking forward to what we're creating and what we're working on. And we're looking forward to sharing what the teams have been working on at that event. 
Since you asked about sequels, Diablo and Overwatch teams, they're deeply committed to creating awesome AAA experiences for players. They're working hard to bring those games to the community. And we expect the launches and data that we continue to release from those to be big events for those franchises. 
And beyond those launches, we've been focused on delivering new experiences in our live games the community really enjoys. So we talked about here in WoW through Classic, we've been able to introduce more content from the existing subscription to continue to give the community real reasons to stay engaged. 
And now outside of the temple secret -- sequels, we have another -- a number of initiatives that are underway, and we expect to deliver strong and consistent performance in the future. That's something that's very important to us. Thanks for the question."

Our advertising business proved resilient in the second quarter, and we delivered robust year-over-year growth. Now at the heart of this ad business is our platform, which provides a fully controlled, safe environment for brands. And that's a very powerful value proposition for advertisers, especially given the current backdrop. 
Now to add to that, we have a number of initiatives underway that will further strengthen this platform. So as an example, we're continuing to invest in the direct sales force and expand our network demand partners as well. And again, we saw strong year-over-year growth across both the direct advertisers and our demand partners in Q2. Now add to that, that we're continuing to invest in our tech infrastructure, and we continue to invest in tools as well to further optimize this demand and the pricing around it. 
But at the heart of it, the way I think about the investment is also investment in the product itself and the innovation there. So that is also resonating. So as an example, to give one, we worked with Target in Q2, and they were looking to drive awareness in consideration with their Easter marketing campaign. And when we combined an integrated sponsorship in Candy Crush Saga with our rewarded video product, Target was able to reach tens of millions of players in the U.S., and they achieved a 10-point lift in their top-of-mind awareness and a 7-point lift in consideration. So all of this is allowing to attract -- allowing us to attract new brand advertisers into the ecosystem. 
And over the past few months, we had a number of these which spanned a number of sectors. And these names span something like from Samsung to [ Buyer's ] to ABC to Sargento to Home Depot, and we continue to use our direct sales force to reach out to more of these advertisers across these sectors and continue to innovate the product around them. 
Now with all that said, there is uncertainty in the ad market, as you've seen in the recent months, and that includes Apple's recent announcement around IDSA. Now it's still too early to determine the specific impact on the business, at least on our business, but we're working closely with our advertising partners and our demand partners to prepare for these changes. So puts and takes out there, net-net, we still remain confident in the value proposition and the long-term opportunity of this advertising business."

Obviously, we do believe that it's sustainable, and we're very excited for what's going on COD Mobile. We're seeing really strong momentum with the title, the game's now surpassed over 250 million downloads globally, and it just keeps on tracking for us. Over the past several months, the team has made really great progress on adding great new content for the community and then also in optimizing the engagement, the retention and the in-game economy to make sure we're working on all components. 
So overall, the game is performing really well. And as you noted in your question, we are absolutely still reinvesting in both the product itself and also in the marketing to build an even larger audience similar to what you'd see a lot of top mobiles do, especially in this earlier growth phase to mobile. 
And -- but I'd also say at the same time, the game is still contributing nicely both to the top and bottom line for Activision. But because of its scale, we're seeing it benefit us and we're also reinvesting in it. The game's coming up on its 1-year anniversary in October, and I mentioned the content in investment. In October, we plan on delivering significant new content to the game and a lot of in-game enhancements, including a new weapon system for mobile. 
Now you've probably seen, our players have certainly noticed in Modern Warfare, how much they're enjoying customizing their weapons and how they do it in that experience, and we think the community is going to love the opportunity to do the same in COD Mobile. 
So overall, we're extremely happy with the sustained trends we're seeing on Mobile. We continue to reach new audiences around the world. And I'd say we're just very committed to growing our mobile business. For us, that includes adding additional internal mobile talent and resources. Of course, we'll continue to support our existing initiatives, and I think importantly, as we look forward, even more tightly integrating mobile into the overall Call of Duty ecosystem to bring our community together closer and having more fun. 
And I'd just like to close by, and we've mentioned this before, I think, but it is important, Call of Duty right now, through the success of our premium titles in Warzone and Mobile is larger and more global than it's ever been in any point of time in its history. And I just want to say thanks to all of our teams that have just done an incredible job across the board. And of course, we are super thankful to our incredible community for their continued trust and support for what we're doing on Call of Duty. Thanks for the question."

As you just heard from Rob, we are really bringing that community and that experience together across platforms and across experiences. And firstly, I'd say we're really just not done with Call of Duty. We're in the first inning. We've only been 5 months in since the life of Warzone, and the team is working really, really hard to integrate that with our next premium release, so we can really maximize the potential of this powerful combination of both premium and free-to-play content. 
And it's still early in expanding the audience on PC as well, which offers, as you know, a very significant potential for future growth when you consider the size of the player base, and particularly including the fact that we are now having access to players all around the world and expanding it. PC, obviously, is more accessible. 
And then as Rob was mentioning, there's a lot more to come on mobile, too. COD mobile is off to a really great start. But we're just scratching the surface of what that franchise can be on mobile and then integrating the experiences across multiple platforms, we know is just an incredible opportunity for the franchise. 
But to the early successes, they do represent incredible proof points, as to your question, of how the franchise strategy is really working. And it certainly applies to a lot of the franchises that we have. We see that our current players really want more ways to engage with their favorite IP, be it through mobile or other platforms, and that offering authentic and really deep experiences on new platforms can drive much, much higher engagement, and this quarter's results really shows that. 
And we also see that the free-to-play on mobile and other platforms can bring in multiples of new players into our franchises. Importantly, with strong execution, this is not cannibalistic. Actually, on the contrary, free-to-play coexists with other business models and can be meaningfully additive to a franchise, bringing new players into the ecosystem. 
So these proof points are relevant across our portfolio. And to your question, it's not just Diablo, but it's also across all our franchises. And our teams see an opportunity to drive a greater reach, engagement and player investment greater than ever before across the franchises. And with the really strong execution that we know we can deliver, we expect to continue that trend. And thanks again for your question."

As we talked about earlier, we are planning for the game to enter what we're calling expanded internal testing this quarter. And internal testing is an important step for us, not only from an operational perspective but also because we have many Blizzard employees who are deeply engaged. We have quite a few extra players within the company, and a lot of the employees that we have represent many aspects of our global community. 
From the very beginning, it was important to us to ensure that this is an authentic Blizzard quality diablo experience for the huge community of the Diablo players around the world, and it's our intention to meet the expectations of those players everywhere. The type of experience that Diablo players have loved for over 20 years is one that we think is appealing to everyone, and we think that we're working here on a deep and engaging RPG on mobile. And so there's great potential for players in all regions to really love the game. And so we're more than willing to spend the time on it to get it right. We've continued to see a lot of interest and anticipation from the Diablo community, and the games come along really well. We're eager to get it into the players' hands. 
I'll mention one more thing. You asked about Diablo Immortal, but I do want to take the opportunity to also mention Diablo IV, which we are building for PC and for console and is also coming along and looking really good. We share public quarterly updates with the community, and we really discuss -- the team discusses the approach of different elements and different storytelling and design philosophies. And we need to interact and see that hard-core the Diablo player race respond with the excitement about the direction of the game. And the entire team is deeply committed to bringing them a fitting continuation to that era. And so there's a lot for players and fans in Diablo to look forward to."

And that's consistent, I think, with the broader company approach. 
So we're continuing to focus on our live franchises, and in particular, Candy Crush, where we see a really substantial opportunity for ongoing growth. And that means that we continue to invest in content and innovation features, both to engage our existing audience and to also continue to bring new players into our games network, and we've seen this pay off. We've seen double-digit growth year-on-year in Candy players, and we see continued progress on our payer conversion efforts. And we see the opportunity for growth across both the in-app purchase business and our ads business in the Candy franchise. 
Now having said that, we will continue to selectively invest in focused new games pipeline, and we explore both new IP, and where it makes sense, at the Activision IP library. So with Crash, in particular, when we saw its vibrant history and we saw what that represents over the past 20 years, it represented a great opportunity for us to expand the King portfolio with an iconic IP like that. 
We have focused our new game development efforts over the past few years to really only selectively invest behind the most exciting opportunities. And with this one, the King team is thrilled to be developing a game with this IP from the Activision catalog. And as you see from the game's trailer, it's looking really great. We're reimagining the Crash franchise for an incredible mobile experience, and we just can't wait to get this game out there to a dedicated Crash and base and to also bring it to new audiences.

I think it just brings up -- thanks, Humam. I think it just brings up a really important point. And it's a great example of what we can do as a broader organization when we leverage kind of our respective strength to maximize the potential of our IP across the company. There's multiple examples. If you look at how we partner with Blizzard to bring Call of Duty to Battle.net on PC, where we've driven record results. We also launched a world-class city-based e-sports business with the Call of Duty League in partnership with our Activision Blizzard e-sports team. 
And so now, in the case of Crash, this IP is getting the full treatment it deserves, and it's getting it because of the talent across the company. First, we're very thrilled as we bring in brand-new experience to consoles in October with Crash 4, and the game is just coming along really great, and the team at  Toys For Bob has done an excellent job of ensuring the game honors its rich history, yet delivers something to new and fun for fans. So that's one really important vector that we're focused on. 
But then as we think in terms of mobile, last year, we launched Call of Duty and Modern Warfare very successfully and very close together, quite frankly. And together, these games have proven accretive to our overall results and have certainly grown our audience on a global basis. So now we're standing here, we look at this opportunity with King and thinking what a perfect opportunity, partner with a talented team there who's so proven in mobile and have such great talent in their organization to expand the Crash IP on mobile with a unique game experience that's different from what we're doing on console, and then, of course, while at the same time, delivering a new premium experience to consoles of Crash 4. 
So net-net, for me, one, it's a great time to be a Crash fan; and two, it's just also really great to see the company, I think, working so well together on so many fronts. So that's what I would add. So thanks."

We've known you for a long time, and we always try to be as thoughtful as we can and prudent in our approach to guidance. But I think it's even more important now, obviously, with the economic backdrop being so volatile and unpredictable. 
Regarding shelter at home, you heard it in our prepared remarks and Daniel referenced it earlier, we have seen some engagement and tailwinds moderating somewhat as regions reopen, particularly in some of our games that have less social connective tissue. We're assuming in our guidance, that continues as more regions reopen in Q3. Although it's not entirely clear how quickly that plays out because the trends kind of are different in different regions of the world. 
Even so, we're obviously very strong. We have strong momentum, and we feel really confident about our third quarter guidance, particularly because our largest franchises have so much momentum and that leads us to the strong guidance we provided for Q3 already. 
When you turn to Q4, our Q4 guide implies you'll see some appropriate risk that we've applied into our outlook. Obviously, there's a few reasons for that. Everyone is aware of the economic backdrop that we're in with unemployment in unusual levels and risk to consumer spending, particularly with new consoles coming out, which will absorb some consumer wallets as they purchase new hardware, and similarly, want to be relatively conservative about the retail channel as that continues to contract. We do see -- obviously, the flip side of that is a strong benefit and tailwind that brings to digital for us, which was -- as the comments mentioned earlier, we have seen acceleration on that side for the console, which is a nice tailwind, and we expect that to continue. 
In an environment like this, and we talked a little bit about it last quarter, we do feel really good about the value proposition of our content in past challenging economic times. Interactive entertainment, given its low cost per hour relative to other forms of entertainment, is a very compelling value for consumers. So hopefully, that bodes well even in this uncertain economic environment that we find ourselves in. 
But similar to the last quarter, obviously, there's a lot of unknowns, and we've tried to be prudent with our guidance. But in spite of that, we've obviously raised our full year guidance by the largest amount in our history. And we believe there's obviously potential for even further overperformance if some of those risks don't materialize and if we can navigate through them effectively, which obviously would give us great momentum existing the year with a very, very large player base heading into 2021 and beyond. So lots of opportunity in front of us, albeit in an uncertain time. 
So thank you very much for the question, and thank you very much for everyone for joining us today and for your participation and interest. We look forward to speaking with many of you this quarter throughout the quarter. And hopefully, we'll see many of you again. Thank you."

I hope all of you and your families are safe and healthy.

I hope all of you and your families are safe and healthy. In the midst of the ongoing pandemic, this week, a few hundred of our employees were evacuated from their homes in Orange County because of fires. The resilience our employees around the world continue to show under very difficult circumstances is incredibly inspiring. Our externally talented teams have been able to connect and entertain hundreds of millions of people around the world at a time when connection and joy is more important than ever. 
This led to better-than-expected third quarter results, and we're again raising our outlook for the full year. We now expect net bookings in 2020 to grow over 25% year-over-year with earnings per share growing even faster. Since refocusing our teams on our greatest opportunities, we've started to return to the execution excellence we've always been known for. We have significantly grown the number of creative and commercial employees working on our key franchises. We have a clear strategy to continue expanding reach, engagement and player investment across all of our biggest franchises, and we continue to increase investment to grow the communities anchored in our franchises. 
We have a deep company-wide commitment to continue to deliver the highest-quality content and live operations to our network of almost 400 million players. And we've transitioned the business to a digital-first model, enabling our players to consume our content in the most convenient, value-focused manner. Our continued strong results reflect our focus on execution. 
Today, we're in a position to deliver sustained and significant long-term expansion across our portfolio of fully owned franchises. As we execute against our content pipeline, extend our key franchises to mobile, introduce new free-to-play experiences and continue to optimize in-game operations, we are positioned to continue converting our growing agent into consistent and long-term revenue and earnings growth. 
Call of Duty is the first community benefit from our pursuit of this franchise based strategy. With over 100 million monthly players, the Call of Duty community is larger than ever before. And with expansion across all platforms, the franchise has transformed into a truly social experience that engages and connects our players in truly epic ways. Through Modern Warfare and our free-to-play game Warzone, over 2/3 of players playing groups of friends, demonstrating the rich social connections enabled by our games. On mobile, Call of Duty has been downloaded over 300 million times worldwide and has become the highest grossing new game in the U.S. app stores since its launched last October. By expanding to mobile, we've brought in tens of millions of new players in countries far beyond our traditional audiences. With the game now in final large-scale testing in China and over 50 million players already preregistered, we see a clear path to continue growing Call of Duty's reach engagement and player investment on mobile in the largest mobile gaming market in the world. 
Deep engagement in premium Call of Duty content as well as the addition of free-to-play experiences across mobile, console and PC drove the number of monthly players in the community to over 3x the year ago level in this third quarter, and hours played were 7x higher than a year ago. As the community engages, they consume more content. More players are purchasing premium content than ever before, and these growth rates highlight the tremendous power of the combination of our premium and free-to-play business model. We expect to continue the Call of Duty momentum when we deliver Black Ops Cold War in 2 weeks. And our marketing has changed to reflect the scale and size of our own proprietary network. 
In August, millions of players gained access to the Black Ops Cold War Reveal trailer by playing interactive content within Warzone, generating a true virtual water cooler moment, driving substantial interest in the new release. Going direct to our network of players in this way represents more effective marketing than any paid media network. 
We intend to achieve with all our franchises as well as the potential new franchises we are actively creating, many of the successes we have had with call of Duty. In World of Warcraft, for example, we've seen unprecedented engagement trends since the subscriber base doubled following the launch of Classic last year. Presales of the upcoming Shadowlands expansion are the highest we've seen at this stage ahead of any release. Blizzard has the largest team ever working on ensuring Shadowlands meets all of our players' highest expectations and to deliver more frequent major content launches across both the modern game and classic in the years ahead. 
Blizzard has also dedicated creative talent focused on delivering multiple mobile experience in the coming years. Our franchises are well suited for global mobile, console and PC gaming audiences, and we're determined to deliver compelling mobile experiences for both existing fans of our franchises and the hundreds of millions of players around the world who haven't yet played our games. 
We also see continued growth opportunities for Candy Crush. Even as the franchise continues its leadership as the #1 franchise in the U.S. app stores with both in-app purchases and advertising driving growth in the third quarter, we'll continue to introduce competitive and collaborative social features to further broaden reach and deepen engagement in the coming quarters. 
There are few entertainment franchises that generate over $1 billion in annual net bookings. And today, we operate 3 of them: Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush. And each has clear opportunity for sustained growth. With our team's hard at work on multiple products in the Diablo franchise and major innovations for the Overwatch franchise as well as a number of new potential franchises at Blizzard and King, the pipeline across our portfolio and the potential for revenue and earnings expansion has never been stronger. 
I am so proud of our employees. Amid what continues to be the most challenging environment I've ever experienced in a 3 decades of leading the company, our teams continue to perform with extraordinary commitment to our audiences around the world. Of course, ensuring that our employees and their families are safe and healthy remains my #1 priority. The majority of our teams continue to work successfully from home, and they continue to show ingenuity and fortitude as they overcome challenges in health care, family care and work. 
For the balance of this year, we're raising our outlook, and we believe we will continue connecting and engaging more players than ever before in 2021. 
Thank you for your continued support. Daniel will now review the highlights of our operations for the past quarter with you."

Even through the challenges of operating during the pandemic, Activision Blizzard significantly exceeded its third quarter outlook with strong execution across our 3 strategic growth drivers: expanding audience reach, deepening engagemen",1549,"Thank you, Bobby. Even through the challenges of operating during the pandemic, Activision Blizzard significantly exceeded its third quarter outlook with strong execution across our 3 strategic growth drivers: expanding audience reach, deepening engagement and increasing player investment. Our player base grew 23% year-over-year, and total time spent in our games increased even more. We grew net bookings 46% year-over-year, driven by strong in-game performance with substantial operating margin expansion and earnings per share more than doubling year-over-year. We achieved these results through a laser focus on execution both in major content launches and live operations across PC, console and mobile and in our new approaches to engagement and business models, particularly the introduction of Call of Duty free-to-play experiences. 
Our continued investments and successful initiatives for our largest franchises position the business for ongoing strong results, and we expect reach, engagement and player investment to remain structurally higher going forward. 
We're seeing a clear return on our increased investment in creative and commercial talent, and we intend to continue scaling our capabilities across our 6 key franchises: Call of Duty, Candy Crush, World of Warcraft, Hearthstone, Diablo and Overwatch. We're still early in unlocking the full potential of these wholly owned franchises and IP. 
Now turning to our franchise and operational highlights across our business units. Starting with Activision. Monthly active users tripled year-over-year to 111 million. The Call of Duty ecosystem had another fantastic quarter, again delivering substantial year-over-year growth across reach, engagement and player investment. The combination of premium Modern Warfare content and the free-to-play Warzone experience on PC and console continues to expand the community and drive deep engagement. 
Modern Warfare and Warzone saw more than 3x many monthly players as the prior title in the year ago quarter, with strong growth both inside and outside our traditional regions. Console player numbers grew strongly, and monthly players grew over tenfold year-over-year on PC. 
Across platforms, hours played in the Modern Warfare universe, where approximately 7x higher year-over-year versus the prior title. We again saw substantial year-over-year growth in premium game sales as Warzone players chose to upgrade to the full Call of Duty experience. Modern Warfare's first year sales are the highest in Call of Duty's history with 2/3 of lifetime units sold digitally, and we are seeing sustained strength in the franchise's revamped in-game system with console and PC in-game net bookings, 4x the year ago level. 
On November 13, we will launch Black Ops Cold War, the latest installment for Call of Duty. Anticipation for the release is high, with far more players engaged in the game's public testing than for the year ago title. 
Supporting cross-platform play across PC, current generation and next-generation consoles the premium release includes 3 compelling modes, an immersive single player campaign set in the volatile geopolitical battle of the 1980s, the deep and engaging multiplayer gameplay that Black Ops fans expect and a terrific zombies mode, and there's so much more to come. We are releasing the title into the largest and most engaged community at the time of launch in franchise history, and we are leveraging our direct digital relationships with our players to build awareness through entirely new in-game initiatives. Black Ops Cold War's in-game content will be centered around the same in-game system that resonated so well with players in modern Warfare. And starting with the first season of in-game content in December, Black Ops Cold War will be integrated into Warzone. 
We'll bring Black Ops Cold War's characters and weaponry into the free-to-play experience. Along with substantial new content, ensuring that Warzone remains both a terrific experience and a powerful on-ramp for the franchise's premium content. 
We are confident that Call of Duty will once again be the #1 console franchise globally for up-front sales this year, and we expect a continued shift to full game downloads, given the convenience for players and in-game marketing initiatives enabled by Warzone. 
On mobile, Call of Duty Mobile sustained the impressive levels of reach and engagement seen in the second quarter. As the game passes its first anniversary, the team continues to refine and optimize gameplay, seasonal content and the in-game economy, leveraging over 15 years of proven content and learnings in the franchise. October saw the biggest update yet with the addition of the Alcatraz map for Black Ops 4 and further social features, driving continued growth in engagement and player investment versus Q3 seasons. And with further additions ahead, the game now in final large-scale testing in China, the title is well positioned for further growth as it enters its second year. Also in Q3, the inaugural season of the Call of Duty League concluded with the champs weekend breaking records for the highest viewership of any Call of Duty esports event. Overall, the Call of Duty franchise and ecosystem are in great shape, and we can't wait to build on this with a premium release in a couple of weeks. 
Also, in the third quarter, Activision continued to reimagine the loved IP with the successful launch of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2. The game received fantastic reviews and became the fastest title in the series to reach 1 million units sold, highlighting the opportunity for our rich library of classic franchises. 
And in October, we launched Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time. The first all new Crash title in over a day, again to a great critical reception. 
Now turning to Blizzard. MAUs were 30 million in Q3. World of Warcraft MAUs were stable year-over-year, having structurally increased last Q3 following the launch of Classic. Anticipation continues to build for the Shadowlands expansion ahead of its November 23 launch. Franchise engagement is at its highest level for this stage ahead of an expansion in a decade, with presales well ahead of any prior expansion. The team has determined, build on this momentum, incorporating the community's feedback from testing to ensure that the expansion delights and engages players over a sustained period. The response has been extremely positive so far, particularly around the new character customization options and the new player experience, which not only streamlines how players enter the game, but allows current players to seamlessly level up new characters in previous expansions. And Blizzard will follow Shadowlands with more content for the franchise than ever before into the next year and beyond. 
Hours played in Heartstone grew year-over-year in the third quarter with the Battlegrounds mode seeing sustained strong engagement since it released last November. Battlegrounds engagement illustrates the significant potential for new modes within the franchise, and the team continues to execute against an innovative pipeline with rigorous opportunity. November will see the broad release of Duos, a new player versus player mode, which is already seeing strong interest in early access since its reveal last week, alongside a new in-game progression system and the latest expansion, Madness at the Darkmoon Faire, all aimed at providing a rich and rewarding experience that drives growth across existing, lapsed and new players. 
Overwatch continues to have a large and dedicated community with an average 10 million monthly players in the quarter, more than 4 years since launch. Millions more have engaged through the 2020 season of the Overwatch League with the grand finals being the most watch event in the league's history. 
And finally, amongst multiple Blizzard mobile titles under development, Diablo Immortal saw a hugely enthusiastic response in internal testing in the third quarter and will soon enter external regional testing. 
Now turning to King. Overall, King Network MAUs were stable year-over-year at 249 million, while King's most important franchise, Candy Crush, again grew MAUs solidly year-over-year, in-game net bookings grew year-over-year. King's initiative to attract both lapsed and new payers have meaningfully improved the trajectory for a number of payers over the last year. And we are now starting to see the benefits of these actions in net bookings with a healthier payer base that is responding probably to compelling new features and live operations. As a result, Candy Crush was once again the top grossing franchise in the U.S. app stores. 
We also saw strength in 2 of King's other franchises, Farm Heroes and Bubble Witch, which both grew net bookings year-over-year as the team delivered a higher frequency of in game content. Along with higher performance for in-app purchases, King again delivered robust double-digit growth in advertising, with strength across both direct brand advertisers and partner networks. 
The team's investments in its direct sales channel tech infrastructure and product innovation continues to pay off. The advertising business track to grow net bookings around 40% this fiscal year and similar to King's in-app business is set to enter next year with a strong trajectory. 
And as we announced this week, King's newest title, Crash Bandicoot: On the Run! will launch in spring. The title has all been met with incredible fan reception option with preregistrations off to a very strong start. Around 10 million people have already registered their interest in the game. 
In summary, execution against our franchise strategy has driven another quarter of strong year-over-year growth across the business, and we have momentum heading into Q4 and next year. 
Dennis will now share the detailed results of our third quarter and specifics of our raised outlook."

Today, I will review our Q3 2020 results as well as our outlook for the fourth quarter. Net bookings in the third quarter grew 46% year-over-year to $1.77 billion, with digital net bookings growing 65% year-over-year and representing over",1051,"Thanks, Daniel. Today, I will review our Q3 2020 results as well as our outlook for the fourth quarter. Net bookings in the third quarter grew 46% year-over-year to $1.77 billion, with digital net bookings growing 65% year-over-year and representing over 90% of the total. 
Let's start by looking at our segment results. Activision revenue was $773 million, growing 270% year-over-year. Growth was again driven by Modern Warfare and Warzone in-game revenues, strong sales of premium Modern Warfare, the addition of Call of Duty Mobile and the successful Tony Hawk launch. Operating income was $345 million with an operating margin of 45% full third quarter records. 
Blizzard revenue was $411 million, growing 4% year-over-year, driven by another strong quarter of growth for World of Warcraft. Operating income was $133 million, increasing 80% year-over-year with an operating margin of 32%, 14 points higher year-over-year. King revenue of $536 million was 7% higher year-over-year, with both in-app revenue and advertising revenue growing. 
Operating income was $248 million, the highest since acquisition, with an operating margin of 46%, 8 points higher sequentially, boosted by lower sales and marketing versus Q2. 
In total, across our segments, in-game net bookings were $1.2 billion, growing 69% year-over-year with each of Activision Blizzard and King contributing to this strong performance. Total segment operating profit of $726 million grew 147% year-over-year. This was despite an approximately $50 million headwind as we adjusted esports franchise terms and made investments to support our team owners and ecosystems amid a challenging environment for live events during the pandemic. This was primarily in Blizzard segment results. 
Now let's turn to our consolidated results. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. For the quarter, we generated Q3 GAAP revenues of $1.95 billion, $154 million above our August outlook. This includes the net recognition of deferrals of $187 million. Net bookings of $1.77 billion or $117 million above August outlook, and we generated Q3 GAAP EPS of $0.78 and Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $0.88, which was $0.14 and $0.13 above guidance, respectively. These figures include the net recognition of deferrals of $0.17. 
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Q3 operating cash flow was $196 million, reflecting higher cash taxes paid and changes in working capital. Year-to-date, operating cash flow of $1.11 billion grew 22% year-over-year. 
Our cash and investments at the end of September were approximately $7.6 billion, and we ended the quarter with a net cash position of approximately $4 billion. 
During the quarter, we issued $2 billion of unsecured 10- and 30-year notes. We redeemed all of our outstanding $1.05 billion of notes due in '21 and '22, with the remaining $950 million further strengthening our balance sheet as we took advantage of historically low interest rates. 
Now let's turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year. In the fourth quarter, in addition to ongoing live operations and in-game content across the portfolio, Activision launched Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time on PS4 and Xbox One in early October. And of course, on November 13, we will release Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War on current and next-gen PlayStation and Xbox and PC. 
Blizzard will release Hearthstone's Madness at the Darkmoon Faire expansion and the World of Warcraft: Shadowlands expansion. And King is planning numerous features and innovative live ops and Candy Crush. 
Before I discuss the specifics of our outlook, I'll provide some context. We are ending the holiday season with strong momentum across Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush, our 3 largest franchises, which bodes well for the future. And we are launching major new content for Call of Duty and World of Warcraft into highly engaged communities. But at the same time, in the short term, we wish to remain prudent in our assumptions regarding the consumer spending environment, the console transition and the pace of player migration from deeply engaging existing content. 
I'd also note that while Call of Duty Mobile has entered final large-scale testing in China, we do not include material revenue from the region on our Q4 outlook and anticipate monetization will become more meaningful next year. 
For Q4 on a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $2.0 billion, including net deferrals of $731 million. We expect net bookings of $2.7 billion. We now expect a GAAP-only restructuring charge of approximately $50 million and a GAAP operating margin of 24%, and we expect GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 782 million and EPS of $0.44. For Q4, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect an operating margin of 33% and and non-GAAP EPS of $0.63, including net deferrals of $0.46. 
On a GAAP basis for 2020, we now expect revenues of $7.7 billion, including net deferrals of $425 million. We now expect net bookings of $8.1 billion, $475 million above our August outlook. We expect a GAAP-only restructuring charge of approximately $90 million and a GAAP operating margin of 34%. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 779 million and GAAP EPS of $2.61. 
For 2020, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect an operating margin of 39% and non-GAAP EPS of $3.08, including net deferrals of $0.27. 
Now I'd also like to briefly touch on 2021. I'd note that it is still early, we remain cognizant of macro risk, and we will take our normal prudent approach to forecasting results, but strong business momentum looks in our favor, and we see numerous opportunities to expand the scale of our franchises. Successful execution against our plans would position our segments to build on the aggregate performance reflected in our revised 2020 outlook. 
So in closing, our business has seen a structural change this year, and we continue to experience strong momentum heading into holiday season and next year. We see substantial opportunity ahead for our franchises across geographies, platforms and business models. And we'll continue to focus on business improvements and operating efficiencies and the service of investing more in development to further expand our communities and franchises. We remain confident that executing against our plan will position us to deliver strong results and shareholder value over the long term.

Let me first start by saying that obviously, we're thrilled with how the community has embraced horizon. And obviously, we're very thankful for their support. We're also really proud of the work that our development teams have done on the game and continue to do so. Warzone has really become an incredible addition to the franchise. It's a central place where we can connect and engage the entire Call of Duty community. And I also think maintaining that tight connection with our premium games has been really important, especially for players who want to check out everything the Call of Duty has to offer, and we saw that with Modern Warfare, and we plan to continue that into the future. So Call of Duty community should expect to see Warzone evolve and innovate in a lot of fun ways. And alongside our premium games importantly. 
Now let me clarify a bit on your question on how Cold War and Warzone are going to work together, and I'll do this at a high level. And please also note that we're going to be sharing a lot of details with the community coming up really soon. But first, core Black Ops Cold War progression will build upon the success and will work similarly to how it did in Modern Warfare. So for example, all the awesome new Black Ops weapons and operators you unlock and your level 1 to 55 progression will be usable in Black Ops and in Warzone, just like that work in Modern Warfare. Black Ops Battle Pass content and store content will also work across Black Ops and Warzone. Now players, of course, can continue to use their Modern Warfare content in Warzone once Black Ops launches. And as a result, 1 cool feature that players will see is that they'll be able to choose either their Black Ops load out for the Modern Warfare load outs in Warzone for their game play. And this is just one example on how Warzone is going to expand and evolve over time. 
Now players can also expect a ton of free post-launch content from the Black Ops Cold War premium experience across multiplayer and zombies. I think we did a great job on this for the community for everyone with Modern Warfare, and we'll do the same with Black Ops. So November 13 really is just the beginning for this game, and I think it's a great game. And just like Modern Warfare, this game is going to get bigger and better and more fun as the year goes on. 
So -- in terms of overall progression, unlocks and content, we've really built upon what has worked really well for the community with Modern Warfare. And we think people and players we'll be really excited to check at everything Black Ops Cold War has to offer as well. 
Now in terms of timing of the next season, Daniel mentioned this, we expect Season 1 for Black Ops Cold War and Warzone to launch this December. And that's when you're going to be able to start to see the impact of Black Ops and Warzone really starting to work together in cool and fun ways. Again, a lot more detail here, which we're going to be revealing in the next week or 2. 
And I guess the final thing I would say, and Dan, I think, mentioned this as well. What's exciting for us is we are launching Black Ops Cold War into the largest and most engaged community in Colony's history. And now we're really excited to see what the community does and how they play together across this ecosystem that's now really expanding even further, and we're excited about where it's going, but thanks for the question."

And this is Daniel. I'll take that question. Look, we love to see the platform innovation, be it in next-gen consoles or streaming or the increased power of mobile devices, which really enables new and unique ways for us to deliver experiences and content to our communities. With more well-capitalized companies coming into the space and really investing to extend the reach of gaming, if anything, this is just going to accelerate the growth in already growing industry. So it's actually great for everybody. These platforms really need great content to thrive, and for us, as a leading content owner that fully owns our franchises and our IP, we're really well positioned to take advantage of this expansion platforms and also the associated economics. 
We're also excited just for the next-generation of consoles and the potential they offer to really bring even more compelling experiences to our players. And you're already seeing us supporting the new hardware with the launch of Black Ops Cold War on day 1, as Rob was mentioning. 
Ultimately, for us, our priority is to build the best player experiences where our players want to be and really where they can connect with other members of the community. It's just so powerful. 
That said, though, our development resources just are finite. So we really have to focus on where the biggest opportunities are. For example, we need to make sure that we're enabling our franchises on the billions of mobile devices that are available right now. That's, by far, our biggest opportunity, and we're investing meaningfully to capitalize on this and to take all our franchises to mobile over time. That's really, really important for us. 
Now regarding your question on subscriptions, we're also very fortunate in that we have exposure to every gaming business model at scale. We operate the largest subscription franchise in the industry, and World of Warcraft. So we feel we have a good experience here. And we already have deep digital relationships with our players, including through Battle.net, which gives us just a lot of potential in this area. 
We already offer multiple ways for players to access our most current and premium content, and this will really continue to evolve as our business needs change. Our current business models offer tremendous value to our communities. As you can see from our results, it's also driving great financial results for our shareholders."

The first thing we do is express that we're really excited for players to get their hands on Shadowlands, and we've announced that the lease date is November 23. That is the exact 16-year anniversary for the launch of the original old World of Warcraft. We made the delay earlier to Shadowlands to make sure that the quality of the game is really going to match our expectations and that the game was going to be great. And the community feedback that we received on that decision was overwhelmingly positive. And so we're keeping the quality of the game as a top concern. It's helped drive, I think, a lot of excitement for a while, both in the form of really strong player engagement and as well as expansion presales. 
So players are already been doing the content that we released with Shadowlands pre patch. But I want to talk about a future that I'm personally really passionate, much as the new player experience. 
So the goal for this system was to really streamline learning how to play World of Warcraft for newcomers And also give people who have multiple characters a way to level up in previous expansions. So today, the way we look at the WoW ecosystem is that we operate to distinct game modes, both with very engaged player bases that that gives us the opportunity to deliver a lot of content into the wealth community, really more than ever before, all under a single unified subscription. 
We've talked before about our plans to expand the size the development teams, and we intend to follow the warranty Shadowlands even more content across both the modern game and in classic. 
But if we step back, we think of Warcraft as a huge franchise and WoW is only a part of it. WoW always exploring how to express aircraft with new experiences, and we see a lot of opportunity for growth in 2021 and beyond. Thanks for the question."

I think just starting at a high level, again, on Call of Duty Mobile, we're really happy and proud of the success we've seen here with the over 300 million downloads around the world. We did maintain a lot of good momentum in the third quarter, driven really by the frequency of updates and the quality of those updates, most importantly, and it's resonated really well with the community. 
And the good sign for us is that momentum has continued now already into the fourth quarter. 
In October, we had our big 1-year anniversary event. And I guess 1 metric I can give you would suggest we're off to a very strong start. The first week of that event has been the strongest first week that we've seen in terms of gross bookings. And so that's a really nice positive and continued momentum that we're seeing. 
Now in terms of future growth, we do still see strong potential for Call of Duty Mobile. China, obviously, we believe, can become a significant contributor to our overall franchise revenues. And we talked about how the title has been approved, and now it's in final testing. So again, we expect to see it soon. Hope to see it soon, but we think can have great impact in the region. 
And it's really not just China. For example, Mexico and Brazil are top 5 markets for us in terms of both installs and revenue. And so we see a big opportunity to further expand geographically in other markets through mobile through increased marketing and accessibility initiatives over the coming quarters. 
Now we also see a big opportunity to further connect the mobile experience to what's happening on console and PC. And to your point, that includes Warzone. As you know, Warzone for us is a very important strategic initiative. I just don't have any announcements that we're going to share today on it, but certainly, Warzone is an important piece for us across the franchise. 
Now overall, we're really happy with our progress on mobile for Call of Duty, and we're going to continue to invest in talent and capabilities to bring the best possible Call of Duty experiences to the mobile platform. 
And with these opportunities on mobile that we're talking about right now, and I think with the momentum we're seeing on the franchise across console and PC and across everything we have going on, we do believe Call of Duty is really well positioned for growth next year. And well into the future. Thank you."

So as you can see from Q3 results, we h",545,"Alex, thanks for the question. This is Humam. Let me take your second question first. I'll provide context on how we're thinking about the business overall and then kind of the IDSA changes in the context of that. 
So as you can see from Q3 results, we have some great momentum in the can business across both in-app purchases and also advertising. So looking ahead, we expect that momentum to deliver growth for us next year. And as you noted from earlier, we also will add to that in new launch with Crash Bandicoot: On the Run! 
So -- but let me start with the in-app business and the dynamics there. Our initiatives to broaden the payer base are delivering clearly some really good results for us and are laying great foundations for growth for the future. And so in Candy, in particular, we see quite a few opportunities ahead of us, including really a lot of innovation around competitors and collaborative social features that are driving franchise growth and engagement. 
To give you just one example, in the United Kingdom, recently, we ran Candy all stars. And that's Candy's first ever competitive tournament, which was limited in the United Kingdom. And we saw some really terrific results across reach, engagement and player investment. And so the team is really thinking about exploring even more initiatives to build on for the success. 
So when you think about IDSA in that context and our ability on user acquisition, bring in new players, I'd point out that at the scale of the King Network and Candy strong brand recognition, we drive a significant majority of our installs organically. So many of our competitors are typically much more reliant on aggressive big user acquisition than we are. So while we will see how this plays out, we think that we ultimately will see less impact on an IDSA change here on the user acquisition piece of the King segment. 
Now on the advertising side, that's also been performing quite well, driven by really strong execution, and we've really been evangelizing our brand-safe platform. And we introduced, as you've heard in previous calls, a number of really great product innovations there, like sponsorships, which we have been delivering for us. 
So when IDFA comes into that context, there may be some short term volatility in advertising industry as a whole. But we really believe that the investments in our own direct sales and our own track have really positioned us for future growth and growth next year as part of that. So with that, I add on as well that next year is a year of a launch for us around Crash Bandicoot: On the Run! and which will launch in the spring, and we would expect that to contribute to King's top and bottom line. 
Again, going with an iconic franchise from a really deep catalog of IP and Activision Blizzard enables us to benefit from brand recognition. 
So on that, really good momentum right now, and I feel really, really good about our growth prospects for the business in each one of these areas and how they carry forward into next year. And kind of the context of the IDFA changes as part of that. Thank you."

And this is my now 31st year of doing this, I don't recall a time where I've seen more opportunity for growth and margin expansion in all the time that I've been doing this. The challenge for us is going to be, one, prioritizing opportunity; and then two, making sure that we have the right talent aligned with those opportunities. But when I look at the success that we're experiencing now, and I think about the opportunities we have over the next few years, including next year, we have more momentum going into the next few years than I can remember in a long time. And a lot of the changes that we've made over the last few years are really starting to pay dividends. So from a long-term perspective, I think more platforms, more opportunities to deliver interactive entertainment experiences, increasing engagement that we're seeing from our games becoming increasingly social, the shift to more frequent delivery of content, the flexibility that we have in player investment models. I haven't seen as much opportunity ever. And so the challenge for us is going to be make sure we prioritize them effectively and have the right people in place to take advantage of them. But if you're asking about long-term outlook, I don't think it's ever been better."

I hope all of you and your families are safe and healthy. 
In the midst of the ongoing pandemic, this week, a few hundred of our employees were evacuated from their homes in Orange County because of fires. The resilience our employees around the world continue to show under very difficult circumstances is incredibly inspiring. Our externally talented teams have been able to connect and entertain hundreds of millions of people around the world at a time when connection and joy is more important than ever. 
This led to better-than-expected third quarter results, and we're again raising our outlook for the full year. We now expect net bookings in 2020 to grow over 25% year-over-year with earnings per share growing even faster. Since refocusing our teams on our greatest opportunities, we've started to return to the execution excellence we've always been known for. We have significantly grown the number of creative and commercial employees working on our key franchises. We have a clear strategy to continue expanding reach, engagement and player investment across all of our biggest franchises, and we continue to increase investment to grow the communities anchored in our franchises. 
We have a deep company-wide commitment to continue to deliver the highest-quality content and live operations to our network of almost 400 million players. And we've transitioned the business to a digital-first model, enabling our players to consume our content in the most convenient, value-focused manner. Our continued strong results reflect our focus on execution. 
Today, we're in a position to deliver sustained and significant long-term expansion across our portfolio of fully owned franchises. As we execute against our content pipeline, extend our key franchises to mobile, introduce new free-to-play experiences and continue to optimize in-game operations, we are positioned to continue converting our growing agent into consistent and long-term revenue and earnings growth. 
Call of Duty is the first community benefit from our pursuit of this franchise based strategy. With over 100 million monthly players, the Call of Duty community is larger than ever before. And with expansion across all platforms, the franchise has transformed into a truly social experience that engages and connects our players in truly epic ways. Through Modern Warfare and our free-to-play game Warzone, over 2/3 of players playing groups of friends, demonstrating the rich social connections enabled by our games. On mobile, Call of Duty has been downloaded over 300 million times worldwide and has become the highest grossing new game in the U.S. app stores since its launched last October. By expanding to mobile, we've brought in tens of millions of new players in countries far beyond our traditional audiences. With the game now in final large-scale testing in China and over 50 million players already preregistered, we see a clear path to continue growing Call of Duty's reach engagement and player investment on mobile in the largest mobile gaming market in the world. 
Deep engagement in premium Call of Duty content as well as the addition of free-to-play experiences across mobile, console and PC drove the number of monthly players in the community to over 3x the year ago level in this third quarter, and hours played were 7x higher than a year ago. As the community engages, they consume more content. More players are purchasing premium content than ever before, and these growth rates highlight the tremendous power of the combination of our premium and free-to-play business model. We expect to continue the Call of Duty momentum when we deliver Black Ops Cold War in 2 weeks. And our marketing has changed to reflect the scale and size of our own proprietary network. 
In August, millions of players gained access to the Black Ops Cold War Reveal trailer by playing interactive content within Warzone, generating a true virtual water cooler moment, driving substantial interest in the new release. Going direct to our network of players in this way represents more effective marketing than any paid media network. 
We intend to achieve with all our franchises as well as the potential new franchises we are actively creating, many of the successes we have had with call of Duty. In World of Warcraft, for example, we've seen unprecedented engagement trends since the subscriber base doubled following the launch of Classic last year. Presales of the upcoming Shadowlands expansion are the highest we've seen at this stage ahead of any release. Blizzard has the largest team ever working on ensuring Shadowlands meets all of our players' highest expectations and to deliver more frequent major content launches across both the modern game and classic in the years ahead. 
Blizzard has also dedicated creative talent focused on delivering multiple mobile experience in the coming years. Our franchises are well suited for global mobile, console and PC gaming audiences, and we're determined to deliver compelling mobile experiences for both existing fans of our franchises and the hundreds of millions of players around the world who haven't yet played our games. 
We also see continued growth opportunities for Candy Crush. Even as the franchise continues its leadership as the #1 franchise in the U.S. app stores with both in-app purchases and advertising driving growth in the third quarter, we'll continue to introduce competitive and collaborative social features to further broaden reach and deepen engagement in the coming quarters. 
There are few entertainment franchises that generate over $1 billion in annual net bookings. And today, we operate 3 of them: Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush. And each has clear opportunity for sustained growth. With our team's hard at work on multiple products in the Diablo franchise and major innovations for the Overwatch franchise as well as a number of new potential franchises at Blizzard and King, the pipeline across our portfolio and the potential for revenue and earnings expansion has never been stronger. 
I am so proud of our employees. Amid what continues to be the most challenging environment I've ever experienced in a 3 decades of leading the company, our teams continue to perform with extraordinary commitment to our audiences around the world. Of course, ensuring that our employees and their families are safe and healthy remains my #1 priority. The majority of our teams continue to work successfully from home, and they continue to show ingenuity and fortitude as they overcome challenges in health care, family care and work. 
For the balance of this year, we're raising our outlook, and we believe we will continue connecting and engaging more players than ever before in 2021. 
Thank you for your continued support. Daniel will now review the highlights of our operations for the past quarter with you."

Even through the challenges of operating during the pandemic, Activision Blizzard significantly exceeded its third quarter outlook with strong execution across our 3 strategic growth drivers: expanding audience reach, deepening engagement and increasing player investment. Our player base grew 23% year-over-year, and total time spent in our games increased even more. We grew net bookings 46% year-over-year, driven by strong in-game performance with substantial operating margin expansion and earnings per share more than doubling year-over-year. We achieved these results through a laser focus on execution both in major content launches and live operations across PC, console and mobile and in our new approaches to engagement and business models, particularly the introduction of Call of Duty free-to-play experiences. 
Our continued investments and successful initiatives for our largest franchises position the business for ongoing strong results, and we expect reach, engagement and player investment to remain structurally higher going forward. 
We're seeing a clear return on our increased investment in creative and commercial talent, and we intend to continue scaling our capabilities across our 6 key franchises: Call of Duty, Candy Crush, World of Warcraft, Hearthstone, Diablo and Overwatch. We're still early in unlocking the full potential of these wholly owned franchises and IP. 
Now turning to our franchise and operational highlights across our business units. Starting with Activision. Monthly active users tripled year-over-year to 111 million. The Call of Duty ecosystem had another fantastic quarter, again delivering substantial year-over-year growth across reach, engagement and player investment. The combination of premium Modern Warfare content and the free-to-play Warzone experience on PC and console continues to expand the community and drive deep engagement. 
Modern Warfare and Warzone saw more than 3x many monthly players as the prior title in the year ago quarter, with strong growth both inside and outside our traditional regions. Console player numbers grew strongly, and monthly players grew over tenfold year-over-year on PC. 
Across platforms, hours played in the Modern Warfare universe, where approximately 7x higher year-over-year versus the prior title. We again saw substantial year-over-year growth in premium game sales as Warzone players chose to upgrade to the full Call of Duty experience. Modern Warfare's first year sales are the highest in Call of Duty's history with 2/3 of lifetime units sold digitally, and we are seeing sustained strength in the franchise's revamped in-game system with console and PC in-game net bookings, 4x the year ago level. 
On November 13, we will launch Black Ops Cold War, the latest installment for Call of Duty. Anticipation for the release is high, with far more players engaged in the game's public testing than for the year ago title. 
Supporting cross-platform play across PC, current generation and next-generation consoles the premium release includes 3 compelling modes, an immersive single player campaign set in the volatile geopolitical battle of the 1980s, the deep and engaging multiplayer gameplay that Black Ops fans expect and a terrific zombies mode, and there's so much more to come. We are releasing the title into the largest and most engaged community at the time of launch in franchise history, and we are leveraging our direct digital relationships with our players to build awareness through entirely new in-game initiatives. Black Ops Cold War's in-game content will be centered around the same in-game system that resonated so well with players in modern Warfare. And starting with the first season of in-game content in December, Black Ops Cold War will be integrated into Warzone. 
We'll bring Black Ops Cold War's characters and weaponry into the free-to-play experience. Along with substantial new content, ensuring that Warzone remains both a terrific experience and a powerful on-ramp for the franchise's premium content. 
We are confident that Call of Duty will once again be the #1 console franchise globally for up-front sales this year, and we expect a continued shift to full game downloads, given the convenience for players and in-game marketing initiatives enabled by Warzone. 
On mobile, Call of Duty Mobile sustained the impressive levels of reach and engagement seen in the second quarter. As the game passes its first anniversary, the team continues to refine and optimize gameplay, seasonal content and the in-game economy, leveraging over 15 years of proven content and learnings in the franchise. October saw the biggest update yet with the addition of the Alcatraz map for Black Ops 4 and further social features, driving continued growth in engagement and player investment versus Q3 seasons. And with further additions ahead, the game now in final large-scale testing in China, the title is well positioned for further growth as it enters its second year. Also in Q3, the inaugural season of the Call of Duty League concluded with the champs weekend breaking records for the highest viewership of any Call of Duty esports event. Overall, the Call of Duty franchise and ecosystem are in great shape, and we can't wait to build on this with a premium release in a couple of weeks. 
Also, in the third quarter, Activision continued to reimagine the loved IP with the successful launch of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2. The game received fantastic reviews and became the fastest title in the series to reach 1 million units sold, highlighting the opportunity for our rich library of classic franchises. 
And in October, we launched Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time. The first all new Crash title in over a day, again to a great critical reception. 
Now turning to Blizzard. MAUs were 30 million in Q3. World of Warcraft MAUs were stable year-over-year, having structurally increased last Q3 following the launch of Classic. Anticipation continues to build for the Shadowlands expansion ahead of its November 23 launch. Franchise engagement is at its highest level for this stage ahead of an expansion in a decade, with presales well ahead of any prior expansion. The team has determined, build on this momentum, incorporating the community's feedback from testing to ensure that the expansion delights and engages players over a sustained period. The response has been extremely positive so far, particularly around the new character customization options and the new player experience, which not only streamlines how players enter the game, but allows current players to seamlessly level up new characters in previous expansions. And Blizzard will follow Shadowlands with more content for the franchise than ever before into the next year and beyond. 
Hours played in Hearthstone grew year-over-year in the third quarter with the Battlegrounds mode seeing sustained strong engagement since it released last November. Battlegrounds engagement illustrates the significant potential for new modes within the franchise, and the team continues to execute against an innovative pipeline with rigorous opportunity. November will see the broad release of Duos, a new player versus player mode, which is already seeing strong interest in early access since its reveal last week, alongside a new in-game progression system and the latest expansion, Madness at the Darkmoon Faire, all aimed at providing a rich and rewarding experience that drives growth across existing, lapsed and new players. 
Overwatch continues to have a large and dedicated community with an average 10 million monthly players in the quarter, more than 4 years since launch. Millions more have engaged through the 2020 season of the Overwatch League with the grand finals being the most watch event in the league's history. 
And finally, amongst multiple Blizzard mobile titles under development, Diablo Immortal saw a hugely enthusiastic response in internal testing in the third quarter and will soon enter external regional testing. 
Now turning to King. Overall, King Network MAUs were stable year-over-year at 249 million, while King's most important franchise, Candy Crush, again grew MAUs solidly year-over-year, in-game net bookings grew year-over-year. King's initiative to attract both lapsed and new payers have meaningfully improved the trajectory for a number of payers over the last year. And we are now starting to see the benefits of these actions in net bookings with a healthier payer base that is responding probably to compelling new features and live operations. As a result, Candy Crush was once again the top grossing franchise in the U.S. app stores. 
We also saw strength in 2 of King's other franchises, Farm Heroes and Bubble Witch, which both grew net bookings year-over-year as the team delivered a higher frequency of in game content. Along with higher performance for in-app purchases, King again delivered robust double-digit growth in advertising, with strength across both direct brand advertisers and partner networks. 
The team's investments in its direct sales channel tech infrastructure and product innovation continues to pay off. The advertising business track to grow net bookings around 40% this fiscal year and similar to King's in-app business is set to enter next year with a strong trajectory. 
And as we announced this week, King's newest title, Crash Bandicoot: On the Run will launch in spring. The title has all been met with incredible fan reception option with preregistrations off to a very strong start. Around 10 million people have already registered their interest in the game. 
In summary, execution against our franchise strategy has driven another quarter of strong year-over-year growth across the business, and we have momentum heading into Q4 and next year. 
Dennis will now share the detailed results of our third quarter and specifics of our raised outlook."

Today, I will review our Q3 2020 results as well as our outlook for the fourth quarter. Net bookings in the third quarter grew 46% year-over-year to $1.77 billion, with digital net bookings growing 65% year-over-year and representing over 90% of the total. 
Let's start by looking at our segment results. Activision revenue was $773 million, growing 270% year-over-year. Growth was again driven by Modern Warfare and Warzone in-game revenues, strong sales of premium Modern Warfare, the addition of Call of Duty Mobile and the successful Tony Hawk launch. Operating income was $345 million with an operating margin of 45% full third quarter records. 
Blizzard revenue was $411 million, growing 4% year-over-year, driven by another strong quarter of growth for World of Warcraft. Operating income was $133 million, increasing 80% year-over-year with an operating margin of 32%, 14 points higher year-over-year. King revenue of $536 million was 7% higher year-over-year, with both in-app revenue and advertising revenue growing. 
Operating income was $248 million, the highest since acquisition, with an operating margin of 46%, 8 points higher sequentially, boosted by lower sales and marketing versus Q2. 
In total, across our segments, in-game net bookings were $1.2 billion, growing 69% year-over-year with each of Activision Blizzard and King contributing to this strong performance. Total segment operating profit of $726 million grew 147% year-over-year. This was despite an approximately $50 million headwind as we adjusted esports franchise terms and made investments to support our team owners and ecosystems amid a challenging environment for live events during the pandemic. This was primarily in Blizzard segment results. 
Now let's turn to our consolidated results. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. For the quarter, we generated Q3 GAAP revenues of $1.95 billion, $154 million above our August outlook. This includes the net recognition of deferrals of $187 million. Net bookings of $1.77 billion or $117 million above August outlook, and we generated Q3 GAAP EPS of $0.78 and Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $0.88, which was $0.14 and $0.13 above guidance, respectively. These figures include the net recognition of deferrals of $0.17. 
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Q3 operating cash flow was $196 million, reflecting higher cash taxes paid and changes in working capital. Year-to-date, operating cash flow of $1.11 billion grew 22% year-over-year. 
Our cash and investments at the end of September were approximately $7.6 billion, and we ended the quarter with a net cash position of approximately $4 billion. 
During the quarter, we issued $2 billion of unsecured 10- and 30-year notes. We redeemed all of our outstanding $1.05 billion of notes due in '21 and '22, with the remaining $950 million further strengthening our balance sheet as we took advantage of historically low interest rates. 
Now let's turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year. In the fourth quarter, in addition to ongoing live operations and in-game content across the portfolio, Activision launched Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time on PS4 and Xbox One in early October. And of course, on November 13, we will release Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War on current and next-gen PlayStation and Xbox and PC. 
Blizzard will release Hearthstone's Madness at the Darkmoon Faire expansion and the World of Warcraft: Shadowlands expansion. And King is planning numerous features and innovative live ops and Candy Crush. 
Before I discuss the specifics of our outlook, I'll provide some context. We are ending the holiday season with strong momentum across Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush, our 3 largest franchises, which bodes well for the future. And we are launching major new content for Call of Duty and World of Warcraft into highly engaged communities. But at the same time, in the short term, we wish to remain prudent in our assumptions regarding the consumer spending environment, the console transition and the pace of player migration from deeply engaging existing content. 
I'd also note that while Call of Duty Mobile has entered final large-scale testing in China, we do not include material revenue from the region on our Q4 outlook and anticipate monetization will become more meaningful next year. 
For Q4 on a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $2.0 billion, including net deferrals of $731 million. We expect net bookings of $2.7 billion. We now expect a GAAP-only restructuring charge of approximately $50 million and a GAAP operating margin of 24%, and we expect GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 782 million and EPS of $0.44. For Q4, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect an operating margin of 33% and and non-GAAP EPS of $0.63, including net deferrals of $0.46. 
On a GAAP basis for 2020, we now expect revenues of $7.7 billion, including net deferrals of $425 million. We now expect net bookings of $8.1 billion, $475 million above our August outlook. We expect a GAAP-only restructuring charge of approximately $90 million and a GAAP operating margin of 34%. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 779 million and GAAP EPS of $2.61. 
For 2020, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect an operating margin of 39% and non-GAAP EPS of $3.08, including net deferrals of $0.27. 
Now I'd also like to briefly touch on 2021. I'd note that it is still early, we remain cognizant of macro risk, and we will take our normal prudent approach to forecasting results, but strong business momentum looks in our favor, and we see numerous opportunities to expand the scale of our franchises. Successful execution against our plans would position our segments to build on the aggregate performance reflected in our revised 2020 outlook. 
So in closing, our business has seen a structural change this year, and we continue to experience strong momentum heading into holiday season and next year. We see substantial opportunity ahead for our franchises across geographies, platforms and business models. And we'll continue to focus on business improvements and operating efficiencies and the service of investing more in development to further expand our communities and franchises. We remain confident that executing against our plan will position us to deliver strong results and shareholder value over the long term.

Let me first start by saying that obviously, we're thrilled with how the community has embraced horizon. And obviously, we're very thankful for their support. We're also really proud of the work that our development teams have done on the game and continue to do so. Warzone has really become an incredible addition to the franchise. It's a central place where we can connect and engage the entire Call of Duty community. And I also think maintaining that tight connection with our premium games has been really important, especially for players who want to check out everything the Call of Duty has to offer, and we saw that with Modern Warfare, and we plan to continue that into the future. So Call of Duty community should expect to see Warzone evolve and innovate in a lot of fun ways. And alongside our premium games importantly. 
Now let me clarify a bit on your question on how Cold War and Warzone are going to work together, and I'll do this at a high level. And please also note that we're going to be sharing a lot of details with the community coming up really soon. But first, core Black Ops Cold War progression will build upon the success and will work similarly to how it did in Modern Warfare. So for example, all the awesome new Black Ops weapons and operators you unlock and your level 1 to 55 progression will be usable in Black Ops and in Warzone, just like that work in Modern Warfare. Black Ops Battle Pass content and store content will also work across Black Ops and Warzone. Now players, of course, can continue to use their Modern Warfare content in Warzone once Black Ops launches. And as a result, 1 cool feature that players will see is that they'll be able to choose either their Black Ops load out for the Modern Warfare load outs in Warzone for their game play. And this is just one example on how Warzone is going to expand and evolve over time. 
Now players can also expect a ton of free post-launch content from the Black Ops Cold War premium experience across multiplayer and zombies. I think we did a great job on this for the community for everyone with Modern Warfare, and we'll do the same with Black Ops. So November 13 really is just the beginning for this game, and I think it's a great game. And just like Modern Warfare, this game is going to get bigger and better and more fun as the year goes on. 
So -- in terms of overall progression, unlocks and content, we've really built upon what has worked really well for the community with Modern Warfare. And we think people and players we'll be really excited to check at everything Black Ops Cold War has to offer as well. 
Now in terms of timing of the next season, Daniel mentioned this, we expect Season 1 for Black Ops Cold War and Warzone to launch this December. And that's when you're going to be able to start to see the impact of Black Ops and Warzone really starting to work together in cool and fun ways. Again, a lot more detail here, which we're going to be revealing in the next week or 2. 
And I guess the final thing I would say, and Dan, I think, mentioned this as well. What's exciting for us is we are launching Black Ops Cold War into the largest and most engaged community in Colony's history. And now we're really excited to see what the community does and how they play together across this ecosystem that's now really expanding even further, and we're excited about where it's going, but thanks for the question."

And this is Daniel. I'll take that question. Look, we love to see the platform innovation, be it in next-gen consoles or streaming or the increased power of mobile devices, which really enables new and unique ways for us to deliver experiences and content to our communities. With more well-capitalized companies coming into the space and really investing to extend the reach of gaming, if anything, this is just going to accelerate the growth in already growing industry. So it's actually great for everybody. These platforms really need great content to thrive, and for us, as a leading content owner that fully owns our franchises and our IP, we're really well positioned to take advantage of this expansion platforms and also the associated economics. 
We're also excited just for the next-generation of consoles and the potential they offer to really bring even more compelling experiences to our players. And you're already seeing us supporting the new hardware with the launch of Black Ops Cold War on day 1, as Rob was mentioning. 
Ultimately, for us, our priority is to build the best player experiences where our players want to be and really where they can connect with other members of the community. It's just so powerful. 
That said, though, our development resources just are finite. So we really have to focus on where the biggest opportunities are. For example, we need to make sure that we're enabling our franchises on the billions of mobile devices that are available right now. That's, by far, our biggest opportunity, and we're investing meaningfully to capitalize on this and to take all our franchises to mobile over time. That's really, really important for us. 
Now regarding your question on subscriptions, we're also very fortunate in that we have exposure to every gaming business model at scale. We operate the largest subscription franchise in the industry, and World of Warcraft. So we feel we have a good experience here. And we already have deep digital relationships with our players, including through Battle.net, which gives us just a lot of potential in this area. 
We already offer multiple ways for players to access our most current and premium content, and this will really continue to evolve as our business needs change. Our current business models offer tremendous value to our communities. As you can see from our results, it's also driving great financial results for our shareholders."

The first thing we do is express that we're really excited for players to get their hands on Shadowlands, and we've announced that the release date is November 23. That is the exact 16-year anniversary for the launch of the original old World of Warcraft. We made the delay earlier to Shadowlands to make sure that the quality of the game is really going to match our expectations and that the game was going to be great. And the community feedback that we received on that decision was overwhelmingly positive. And so we're keeping the quality of the game as a top concern. It's helped drive, I think, a lot of excitement for a while, both in the form of really strong player engagement and as well as expansion presales. 
So players are already been doing the content that we released with Shadowlands pre patch. But I want to talk about a future that I'm personally really passionate, much as the new player experience. 
So the goal for this system was to really streamline learning how to play World of Warcraft for newcomers And also give people who have multiple characters a way to level up in previous expansions. So today, the way we look at the WoW ecosystem is that we operate to distinct game modes, both with very engaged player bases that that gives us the opportunity to deliver a lot of content into the wealth community, really more than ever before, all under a single unified subscription. 
We've talked before about our plans to expand the size the development teams, and we intend to follow the warranty Shadowlands even more content across both the modern game and in classic. 
But if we step back, we think of Warcraft as a huge franchise and WoW is only a part of it. WoW always exploring how to express aircraft with new experiences, and we see a lot of opportunity for growth in 2021 and beyond. Thanks for the question."

I think just starting at a high level, again, on Call of Duty Mobile, we're really happy and proud of the success we've seen here with the over 300 million downloads around the world. We did maintain a lot of good momentum in the third quarter, driven really by the frequency of updates and the quality of those updates, most importantly, and it's resonated really well with the community. And the good sign for us is that momentum has continued now already into the fourth quarter. 
In October, we had our big 1-year anniversary event. And I guess 1 metric I can give you would suggest we're off to a very strong start. The first week of that event has been the strongest first week that we've seen in terms of gross bookings. And so that's a really nice positive and continued momentum that we're seeing. 
Now in terms of future growth, we do still see strong potential for Call of Duty Mobile. China, obviously, we believe, can become a significant contributor to our overall franchise revenues. And we talked about how the title has been approved, and now it's in final testing. So again, we expect to see it soon. Hope to see it soon, but we think can have great impact in the region. 
And it's really not just China. For example, Mexico and Brazil are top 5 markets for us in terms of both installs and revenue. And so we see a big opportunity to further expand geographically in other markets through mobile through increased marketing and accessibility initiatives over the coming quarters. 
Now we also see a big opportunity to further connect the mobile experience to what's happening on console and PC. And to your point, that includes Warzone. As you know, Warzone for us is a very important strategic initiative. I just don't have any announcements that we're going to share today on it, but certainly, Warzone is an important piece for us across the franchise. 
Now overall, we're really happy with our progress on mobile for Call of Duty, and we're going to continue to invest in talent and capabilities to bring the best possible Call of Duty experiences to the mobile platform. 
And with these opportunities on mobile that we're talking about right now, and I think with the momentum we're seeing on the franchise across console and PC and across everything we have going on, we do believe Call of Duty is really well positioned for growth next year. And well into the future. Thank you."

So as you can see from Q3 results, we have some great momentum in the can business across both in-app purchases and also advertising. So looking ahead, we expect that momentum to deliver growth for us next year. And as you noted from earlier, we also will add to that in new launch with Crash Bandicoot: On the Run.
So -- but let me start with the in-app business and the dynamics there. Our initiatives to broaden the payer base are delivering clearly some really good results for us and are laying great foundations for growth for the future. And so in Candy, in particular, we see quite a few opportunities ahead of us, including really a lot of innovation around competitors and collaborative social features that are driving franchise growth and engagement. 
To give you just one example, in the United Kingdom, recently, we ran Candy All Stars. And that's Candy's first-ever competitive tournament, which was limited in the United Kingdom. And we saw some really terrific results across reach, engagement and player investment. And so the team is really thinking about exploring even more initiatives to build on for the success. 
So when you think about IDSA in that context and our ability on user acquisition, bring in new players, I'd point out that at the scale of the King Network and Candy strong brand recognition, we drive a significant majority of our installs organically. So many of our competitors are typically much more reliant on aggressive big user acquisition than we are. So while we will see how this plays out, we think that we ultimately will see less impact on an IDSA change here on the user acquisition piece of the King segment. 
Now on the advertising side, that's also been performing quite well, driven by really strong execution, and we've really been evangelizing our brand-safe platform. And we introduced, as you've heard in previous calls, a number of really great product innovations there, like sponsorships, which we have been delivering for us. 
So when IDFA comes into that context, there may be some short term volatility in advertising industry as a whole. But we really believe that the investments in our own direct sales and our own track have really positioned us for future growth and growth next year as part of that. So with that, I add on as well that next year is a year of a launch for us around Crash Bandicoot: On the Run! and which will launch in the spring, and we would expect that to contribute to King's top and bottom line. 
Again, going with an iconic franchise from a really deep catalog of IP and Activision Blizzard enables us to benefit from brand recognition. 
So on that, really good momentum right now, and I feel really, really good about our growth prospects for the business in each one of these areas and how they carry forward into next year. And kind of the context of the IDFA changes as part of that. Thank you."

And then just real quickly, Dennis, you mentioned that the successful execution in 2021 will allow you to build on your new 2020 outlook.

And this is my now 31st year of doing this, I don't recall a time where I've seen more opportunity for growth and margin expansion in all the time that I've been doing this. The challenge for us is going to be, one, prioritizing opportunity; and then two, making sure that we have the right talent aligned with those opportunities. But when I look at the success that we're experiencing now, and I think about the opportunities we have over the next few years, including next year, we have more momentum going into the next few years than I can remember in a long time. And a lot of the changes that we've made over the last few years are really starting to pay dividends. So from a long-term perspective, I think more platforms, more opportunities to deliver interactive entertainment experiences, increasing engagement that we're seeing from our games becoming increasingly social, the shift to more frequent delivery of content, the flexibility that we have in player investment models. I haven't seen as much opportunity ever. And so the challenge for us is going to be make sure we prioritize them effectively and have the right people in place to take advantage of them. But if you're asking about long-term outlook, I don't think it's ever been better."

I hope all of you and your families are safe and healthy. 
In the midst of the ongoing pandemic, this week, a few hundred of our employees were evacuated from their homes in Orange County because of fires. The resilience our employees around the world continue to show under very difficult circumstances is incredibly inspiring. Our externally talented teams have been able to connect and entertain hundreds of millions of people around the world at a time when connection and joy is more important than ever. 
This led to better-than-expected third quarter results, and we're again raising our outlook for the full year. We now expect net bookings in 2020 to grow over 25% year-over-year with earnings per share growing even faster. Since refocusing our teams on our greatest opportunities, we've started to return to the execution excellence we've always been known for. We have significantly grown the number of creative and commercial employees working on our key franchises. We have a clear strategy to continue expanding reach, engagement and player investment across all of our biggest franchises, and we continue to increase investment to grow the communities anchored in our franchises. 
We have a deep company-wide commitment to continue to deliver the highest-quality content and live operations to our network of almost 400 million players. And we've transitioned the business to a digital-first model, enabling our players to consume our content in the most convenient, value-focused manner. Our continued strong results reflect our focus on execution. 
Today, we're in a position to deliver sustained and significant long-term expansion across our portfolio of fully owned franchises. As we execute against our content pipeline, extend our key franchises to mobile, introduce new free-to-play experiences and continue to optimize in-game operations, we are positioned to continue converting our growing agent into consistent and long-term revenue and earnings growth. 
Call of Duty is the first community benefit from our pursuit of this franchise based strategy. With over 100 million monthly players, the Call of Duty community is larger than ever before. And with expansion across all platforms, the franchise has transformed into a truly social experience that engages and connects our players in truly epic ways. Through Modern Warfare and our free-to-play game Warzone, over 2/3 of players playing groups of friends, demonstrating the rich social connections enabled by our games. On mobile, Call of Duty has been downloaded over 300 million times worldwide and has become the highest grossing new game in the U.S. app stores since its launched last October. By expanding to mobile, we've brought in tens of millions of new players in countries far beyond our traditional audiences. With the game now in final large-scale testing in China and over 50 million players already preregistered, we see a clear path to continue growing Call of Duty's reach engagement and player investment on mobile in the largest mobile gaming market in the world. 
Deep engagement in premium Call of Duty content as well as the addition of free-to-play experiences across mobile, console and PC drove the number of monthly players in the community to over 3x the year ago level in this third quarter, and hours played were 7x higher than a year ago. As the community engages, they consume more content. More players are purchasing premium content than ever before, and these growth rates highlight the tremendous power of the combination of our premium and free-to-play business model. We expect to continue the Call of Duty momentum when we deliver Black Ops Cold War in 2 weeks. And our marketing has changed to reflect the scale and size of our own proprietary network. 
In August, millions of players gained access to the Black Ops Cold War Reveal trailer by playing interactive content within Warzone, generating a true virtual water cooler moment, driving substantial interest in the new release. Going direct to our network of players in this way represents more effective marketing than any paid media network. 
We intend to achieve with all our franchises as well as the potential new franchises we are actively creating, many of the successes we have had with call of Duty. In World of Warcraft, for example, we've seen unprecedented engagement trends since the subscriber base doubled following the launch of Classic last year. Presales of the upcoming Shadowlands expansion are the highest we've seen at this stage ahead of any release. Blizzard has the largest team ever working on ensuring Shadowlands meets all of our players' highest expectations and to deliver more frequent major content launches across both the modern game and classic in the years ahead. 
Blizzard has also dedicated creative talent focused on delivering multiple mobile experience in the coming years. Our franchises are well suited for global mobile, console and PC gaming audiences, and we're determined to deliver compelling mobile experiences for both existing fans of our franchises and the hundreds of millions of players around the world who haven't yet played our games. 
We also see continued growth opportunities for Candy Crush. Even as the franchise continues its leadership as the #1 franchise in the U.S. app stores with both in-app purchases and advertising driving growth in the third quarter, we'll continue to introduce competitive and collaborative social features to further broaden reach and deepen engagement in the coming quarters. 
There are few entertainment franchises that generate over $1 billion in annual net bookings. And today, we operate 3 of them: Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush. And each has clear opportunity for sustained growth. With our team's hard at work on multiple products in the Diablo franchise and major innovations for the Overwatch franchise as well as a number of new potential franchises at Blizzard and King, the pipeline across our portfolio and the potential for revenue and earnings expansion has never been stronger. 
I am so proud of our employees. Amid what continues to be the most challenging environment I've ever experienced in a 3 decades of leading the company, our teams continue to perform with extraordinary commitment to our audiences around the world. Of course, ensuring that our employees and their families are safe and healthy remains my #1 priority. The majority of our teams continue to work successfully from home, and they continue to show ingenuity and fortitude as they overcome challenges in health care, family care and work. 
For the balance of this year, we're raising our outlook, and we believe we will continue connecting and engaging more players than ever before in 2021. 
Thank you for your continued support. Daniel will now review the highlights of our operations for the past quarter with you."

Even through the challenges of operating during the pandemic, Activision Blizzard significantly exceeded its third quarter outlook with strong execution across our 3 strategic growth drivers: expanding audience reach, deepening engagem",1549,"Thank you, Bobby. 
Even through the challenges of operating during the pandemic, Activision Blizzard significantly exceeded its third quarter outlook with strong execution across our 3 strategic growth drivers: expanding audience reach, deepening engagement and increasing player investment. Our player base grew 23% year-over-year, and total time spent in our games increased even more. We grew net bookings 46% year-over-year, driven by strong in-game performance with substantial operating margin expansion and earnings per share more than doubling year-over-year. We achieved these results through a laser focus on execution both in major content launches and live operations across PC, console and mobile and in our new approaches to engagement and business models, particularly the introduction of Call of Duty free-to-play experiences. 
Our continued investments and successful initiatives for our largest franchises position the business for ongoing strong results, and we expect reach, engagement and player investment to remain structurally higher going forward. 
We're seeing a clear return on our increased investment in creative and commercial talent, and we intend to continue scaling our capabilities across our 6 key franchises: Call of Duty, Candy Crush, World of Warcraft, Hearthstone, Diablo and Overwatch. We're still early in unlocking the full potential of these wholly owned franchises and IP. 
Now turning to our franchise and operational highlights across our business units. Starting with Activision. Monthly active users tripled year-over-year to 111 million. The Call of Duty ecosystem had another fantastic quarter, again delivering substantial year-over-year growth across reach, engagement and player investment. The combination of premium Modern Warfare content and the free-to-play Warzone experience on PC and console continues to expand the community and drive deep engagement. 
Modern Warfare and Warzone saw more than 3x many monthly players as the prior title in the year ago quarter, with strong growth both inside and outside our traditional regions. Console player numbers grew strongly, and monthly players grew over tenfold year-over-year on PC. 
Across platforms, hours played in the Modern Warfare universe, where approximately 7x higher year-over-year versus the prior title. We again saw substantial year-over-year growth in premium game sales as Warzone players chose to upgrade to the full Call of Duty experience. Modern Warfare's first year sales are the highest in Call of Duty's history with 2/3 of lifetime units sold digitally, and we are seeing sustained strength in the franchise's revamped in-game system with console and PC in-game net bookings, 4x the year ago level. 
On November 13, we will launch Black Ops Cold War, the latest installment for Call of Duty. Anticipation for the release is high, with far more players engaged in the game's public testing than for the year ago title. 
Supporting cross-platform play across PC, current generation and next-generation consoles the premium release includes 3 compelling modes, an immersive single player campaign set in the volatile geopolitical battle of the 1980s, the deep and engaging multiplayer gameplay that Black Ops fans expect and a terrific zombies mode, and there's so much more to come. We are releasing the title into the largest and most engaged community at the time of launch in franchise history, and we are leveraging our direct digital relationships with our players to build awareness through entirely new in-game initiatives. Black Ops Cold War's in-game content will be centered around the same in-game system that resonated so well with players in modern Warfare. And starting with the first season of in-game content in December, Black Ops Cold War will be integrated into Warzone. 
We'll bring Black Ops Cold War's characters and weaponry into the free-to-play experience. Along with substantial new content, ensuring that Warzone remains both a terrific experience and a powerful on-ramp for the franchise's premium content. 
We are confident that Call of Duty will once again be the #1 console franchise globally for up-front sales this year, and we expect a continued shift to full game downloads, given the convenience for players and in-game marketing initiatives enabled by Warzone. 
On mobile, Call of Duty Mobile sustained the impressive levels of reach and engagement seen in the second quarter. As the game passes its first anniversary, the team continues to refine and optimize gameplay, seasonal content and the in-game economy, leveraging over 15 years of proven content and learnings in the franchise. October saw the biggest update yet with the addition of the Alcatraz map for Black Ops 4 and further social features, driving continued growth in engagement and player investment versus Q3 seasons. And with further additions ahead, the game now in final large-scale testing in China, the title is well positioned for further growth as it enters its second year. Also in Q3, the inaugural season of the Call of Duty League concluded with the champs weekend breaking records for the highest viewership of any Call of Duty esports event. Overall, the Call of Duty franchise and ecosystem are in great shape, and we can't wait to build on this with a premium release in a couple of weeks. 
Also, in the third quarter, Activision continued to reimagine the loved IP with the successful launch of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2. The game received fantastic reviews and became the fastest title in the series to reach 1 million units sold, highlighting the opportunity for our rich library of classic franchises. 
And in October, we launched Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time. The first all new Crash title in over a day, again to a great critical reception. 
Now turning to Blizzard. MAUs were 30 million in Q3. World of Warcraft MAUs were stable year-over-year, having structurally increased last Q3 following the launch of Classic. Anticipation continues to build for the Shadowlands expansion ahead of its November 23 launch. Franchise engagement is at its highest level for this stage ahead of an expansion in a decade, with presales well ahead of any prior expansion. The team has determined, build on this momentum, incorporating the community's feedback from testing to ensure that the expansion delights and engages players over a sustained period. The response has been extremely positive so far, particularly around the new character customization options and the new player experience, which not only streamlines how players enter the game, but allows current players to seamlessly level up new characters in previous expansions. And Blizzard will follow Shadowlands with more content for the franchise than ever before into the next year and beyond. 
Hours played in Hearthstone grew year-over-year in the third quarter with the Battlegrounds mode seeing sustained strong engagement since it released last November. Battlegrounds engagement illustrates the significant potential for new modes within the franchise, and the team continues to execute against an innovative pipeline with rigorous opportunity. November will see the broad release of Duos, a new player versus player mode, which is already seeing strong interest in early access since its reveal last week, alongside a new in-game progression system and the latest expansion, Madness at the Darkmoon Faire, all aimed at providing a rich and rewarding experience that drives growth across existing, lapsed and new players. 
Overwatch continues to have a large and dedicated community with an average 10 million monthly players in the quarter, more than 4 years since launch. Millions more have engaged through the 2020 season of the Overwatch League with the grand finals being the most watch event in the league's history. 
And finally, amongst multiple Blizzard mobile titles under development, Diablo Immortal saw a hugely enthusiastic response in internal testing in the third quarter and will soon enter external regional testing. 
Now turning to King. Overall, King Network MAUs were stable year-over-year at 249 million, while King's most important franchise, Candy Crush, again grew MAUs solidly year-over-year, in-game net bookings grew year-over-year. King's initiative to attract both lapsed and new payers have meaningfully improved the trajectory for a number of payers over the last year. And we are now starting to see the benefits of these actions in net bookings with a healthier payer base that is responding probably to compelling new features and live operations. As a result, Candy Crush was once again the top grossing franchise in the U.S. app stores. 
We also saw strength in 2 of King's other franchises, Farm Heroes and Bubble Witch, which both grew net bookings year-over-year as the team delivered a higher frequency of in game content. Along with higher performance for in-app purchases, King again delivered robust double-digit growth in advertising, with strength across both direct brand advertisers and partner networks. 
The team's investments in its direct sales channel tech infrastructure and product innovation continues to pay off. The advertising business track to grow net bookings around 40% this fiscal year and similar to King's in-app business is set to enter next year with a strong trajectory. 
And as we announced this week, King's newest title, Crash Bandicoot: On the Run will launch in spring. The title has all been met with incredible fan reception option with preregistrations off to a very strong start. Around 10 million people have already registered their interest in the game. 
In summary, execution against our franchise strategy has driven another quarter of strong year-over-year growth across the business, and we have momentum heading into Q4 and next year. 
Dennis will now share the detailed results of our third quarter and specifics of our raised outlook."

Today, I will review our Q3 2020 results as well as our outlook for the fourth quarter. Net bookings in the third quarter grew 46% year-over-year to $1.77 billion, with digital net bookings growing 65% year-over-year and representing over 90% of the total. 
Let's start by looking at our segment results. Activision revenue was $773 million, growing 270% year-over-year. Growth was again driven by Modern Warfare and Warzone in-game revenues, strong sales of premium Modern Warfare, the addition of Call of Duty Mobile and the successful Tony Hawk launch. Operating income was $345 million with an operating margin of 45% full third quarter records. 
Blizzard revenue was $411 million, growing 4% year-over-year, driven by another strong quarter of growth for World of Warcraft. Operating income was $133 million, increasing 80% year-over-year with an operating margin of 32%, 14 points higher year-over-year. King revenue of $536 million was 7% higher year-over-year, with both in-app revenue and advertising revenue growing. 
Operating income was $248 million, the highest since acquisition, with an operating margin of 46%, 8 points higher sequentially, boosted by lower sales and marketing versus Q2. 
In total, across our segments, in-game net bookings were $1.2 billion, growing 69% year-over-year with each of Activision Blizzard and King contributing to this strong performance. Total segment operating profit of $726 million grew 147% year-over-year. This was despite an approximately $50 million headwind as we adjusted esports franchise terms and made investments to support our team owners and ecosystems amid a challenging environment for live events during the pandemic. This was primarily in Blizzard segment results. 
Now let's turn to our consolidated results. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. For the quarter, we generated Q3 GAAP revenues of $1.95 billion, $154 million above our August outlook. This includes the net recognition of deferrals of $187 million. Net bookings of $1.77 billion or $117 million above August outlook, and we generated Q3 GAAP EPS of $0.78 and Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $0.88, which was $0.14 and $0.13 above guidance, respectively. These figures include the net recognition of deferrals of $0.17. 
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Q3 operating cash flow was $196 million, reflecting higher cash taxes paid and changes in working capital. Year-to-date, operating cash flow of $1.11 billion grew 22% year-over-year. 
Our cash and investments at the end of September were approximately $7.6 billion, and we ended the quarter with a net cash position of approximately $4 billion. 
During the quarter, we issued $2 billion of unsecured 10- and 30-year notes. We redeemed all of our outstanding $1.05 billion of notes due in '21 and '22, with the remaining $950 million further strengthening our balance sheet as we took advantage of historically low interest rates. 
Now let's turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year. In the fourth quarter, in addition to ongoing live operations and in-game content across the portfolio, Activision launched Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time on PS4 and Xbox One in early October. And of course, on November 13, we will release Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War on current and next-gen PlayStation and Xbox and PC. 
Blizzard will release Hearthstone's Madness at the Darkmoon Faire expansion and the World of Warcraft: Shadowlands expansion. And King is planning numerous features and innovative live ops and Candy Crush. 
Before I discuss the specifics of our outlook, I'll provide some context. We are ending the holiday season with strong momentum across Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush, our 3 largest franchises, which bodes well for the future. And we are launching major new content for Call of Duty and World of Warcraft into highly engaged communities. But at the same time, in the short term, we wish to remain prudent in our assumptions regarding the consumer spending environment, the console transition and the pace of player migration from deeply engaging existing content. 
I'd also note that while Call of Duty Mobile has entered final large-scale testing in China, we do not include material revenue from the region on our Q4 outlook and anticipate monetization will become more meaningful next year. 
For Q4 on a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $2.0 billion, including net deferrals of $731 million. We expect net bookings of $2.7 billion. We now expect a GAAP-only restructuring charge of approximately $50 million and a GAAP operating margin of 24%, and we expect GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 782 million and EPS of $0.44. For Q4, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect an operating margin of 33% and and non-GAAP EPS of $0.63, including net deferrals of $0.46. 
On a GAAP basis for 2020, we now expect revenues of $7.7 billion, including net deferrals of $425 million. We now expect net bookings of $8.1 billion, $475 million above our August outlook. We expect a GAAP-only restructuring charge of approximately $90 million and a GAAP operating margin of 34%. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 779 million and GAAP EPS of $2.61. 
For 2020, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect an operating margin of 39% and non-GAAP EPS of $3.08, including net deferrals of $0.27. 
Now I'd also like to briefly touch on 2021. I'd note that it is still early, we remain cognizant of macro risk, and we will take our normal prudent approach to forecasting results, but strong business momentum looks in our favor, and we see numerous opportunities to expand the scale of our franchises. Successful execution against our plans would position our segments to build on the aggregate performance reflected in our revised 2020 outlook. 
So in closing, our business has seen a structural change this year, and we continue to experience strong momentum heading into holiday season and next year. We see substantial opportunity ahead for our franchises across geographies, platforms and business models. And we'll continue to focus on business improvements and operating efficiencies and the service of investing more in development to further expand our communities and franchises. We remain confident that executing against our plan will position us to deliver strong results and shareholder value over the long term. 
Now I welcome our business leaders, Jay, Humam and Rob, as they join us for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator?"

Let me first start by saying that obviously, we're thrilled with how the community has embraced horizon. And obviously, we're very thankful for their support. We're also really proud of the work that our development teams have done on the game and continue to do so. Warzone has really become an incredible addition to the franchise. It's a central place where we can connect and engage the entire Call of Duty community. And I also think maintaining that tight connection with our premium games has been really important, especially for players who want to check out everything the Call of Duty has to offer, and we saw that with Modern Warfare, and we plan to continue that into the future. So Call of Duty community should expect to see Warzone evolve and innovate in a lot of fun ways. And alongside our premium games importantly. 
Now let me clarify a bit on your question on how Cold War and Warzone are going to work together, and I'll do this at a high level. And please also note that we're going to be sharing a lot of details with the community coming up really soon. But first, core Black Ops Cold War progression will build upon the success and will work similarly to how it did in Modern Warfare. So for example, all the awesome new Black Ops weapons and operators you unlock and your level 1 to 55 progression will be usable in Black Ops and in Warzone, just like that work in Modern Warfare. Black Ops Battle Pass content and store content will also work across Black Ops and Warzone. Now players, of course, can continue to use their Modern Warfare content in Warzone once Black Ops launches. And as a result, 1 cool feature that players will see is that they'll be able to choose either their Black Ops load out for the Modern Warfare load outs in Warzone for their game play. And this is just one example on how Warzone is going to expand and evolve over time. 
Now players can also expect a ton of free post-launch content from the Black Ops Cold War premium experience across multiplayer and zombies. I think we did a great job on this for the community for everyone with Modern Warfare, and we'll do the same with Black Ops. So November 13 really is just the beginning for this game, and I think it's a great game. And just like Modern Warfare, this game is going to get bigger and better and more fun as the year goes on. 
So -- in terms of overall progression, unlocks and content, we've really built upon what has worked really well for the community with Modern Warfare. And we think people and players we'll be really excited to check at everything Black Ops Cold War has to offer as well. 
Now in terms of timing of the next season, Daniel mentioned this, we expect Season 1 for Black Ops Cold War and Warzone to launch this December. And that's when you're going to be able to start to see the impact of Black Ops and Warzone really starting to work together in cool and fun ways. Again, a lot more detail here, which we're going to be revealing in the next week or 2. 
And I guess the final thing I would say, and Dan, I think, mentioned this as well. What's exciting for us is we are launching Black Ops Cold War into the largest and most engaged community in Colony's history. And now we're really excited to see what the community does and how they play together across this ecosystem that's now really expanding even further, and we're excited about where it's going, but thanks for the question."

And this is Daniel. I'll take that question. Look, we love to see the platform innovation, be it in next-gen consoles or streaming or the increased power of mobile devices, which really enables new and unique ways for us to deliver experiences and content to our communities. With more well-capitalized companies coming into the space and really investing to extend the reach of gaming, if anything, this is just going to accelerate the growth in already growing industry. So it's actually great for everybody. These platforms really need great content to thrive, and for us, as a leading content owner that fully owns our franchises and our IP, we're really well positioned to take advantage of this expansion platforms and also the associated economics. 
We're also excited just for the next-generation of consoles and the potential they offer to really bring even more compelling experiences to our players. And you're already seeing us supporting the new hardware with the launch of Black Ops Cold War on day 1, as Rob was mentioning. 
Ultimately, for us, our priority is to build the best player experiences where our players want to be and really where they can connect with other members of the community. It's just so powerful. 
That said, though, our development resources just are finite. So we really have to focus on where the biggest opportunities are. For example, we need to make sure that we're enabling our franchises on the billions of mobile devices that are available right now. That's, by far, our biggest opportunity, and we're investing meaningfully to capitalize on this and to take all our franchises to mobile over time. That's really, really important for us. 
Now regarding your question on subscriptions, we're also very fortunate in that we have exposure to every gaming business model at scale. We operate the largest subscription franchise in the industry, and World of Warcraft. So we feel we have a good experience here. And we already have deep digital relationships with our players, including through Battle.net, which gives us just a lot of potential in this area. 
We already offer multiple ways for players to access our most current and premium content, and this will really continue to evolve as our business needs change. Our current business models offer tremendous value to our communities. As you can see from our results, it's also driving great financial results for our shareholders."

The first thing we do is express that we're really excited for players to get their hands on Shadowlands, and we've announced that the release date is November 23. That is the exact 16-year anniversary for the launch of the original old World of Warcraft. We made the delay earlier to Shadowlands to make sure that the quality of the game is really going to match our expectations and that the game was going to be great. And the community feedback that we received on that decision was overwhelmingly positive. And so we're keeping the quality of the game as a top concern. It's helped drive, I think, a lot of excitement for a while, both in the form of really strong player engagement and as well as expansion presales. 
So players are already been doing the content that we released with Shadowlands pre patch. But I want to talk about a future that I'm personally really passionate, much as the new player experience. 
So the goal for this system was to really streamline learning how to play World of Warcraft for newcomers And also give people who have multiple characters a way to level up in previous expansions. So today, the way we look at the WoW ecosystem is that we operate to distinct game modes, both with very engaged player bases that that gives us the opportunity to deliver a lot of content into the wealth community, really more than ever before, all under a single unified subscription. 
We've talked before about our plans to expand the size the development teams, and we intend to follow the warranty Shadowlands even more content across both the modern game and in classic. 
But if we step back, we think of Warcraft as a huge franchise and WoW is only a part of it. WoW always exploring how to express aircraft with new experiences, and we see a lot of opportunity for growth in 2021 and beyond. Thanks for the question."

I think just starting at a high level, again, on Call of Duty Mobile, we're really happy and proud of the success we've seen here with the over 300 million downloads around the world. We did maintain a lot of good momentum in the third quarter, driven really by the frequency of updates and the quality of those updates, most importantly, and it's resonated really well with the community. And the good sign for us is that momentum has continued now already into the fourth quarter. 
In October, we had our big 1-year anniversary event. And I guess 1 metric I can give you would suggest we're off to a very strong start. The first week of that event has been the strongest first week that we've seen in terms of gross bookings. And so that's a really nice positive and continued momentum that we're seeing. 
Now in terms of future growth, we do still see strong potential for Call of Duty Mobile. China, obviously, we believe, can become a significant contributor to our overall franchise revenues. And we talked about how the title has been approved, and now it's in final testing. So again, we expect to see it soon. Hope to see it soon, but we think can have great impact in the region. 
And it's really not just China. For example, Mexico and Brazil are top 5 markets for us in terms of both installs and revenue. And so we see a big opportunity to further expand geographically in other markets through mobile through increased marketing and accessibility initiatives over the coming quarters. 
Now we also see a big opportunity to further connect the mobile experience to what's happening on console and PC. And to your point, that includes Warzone. As you know, Warzone for us is a very important strategic initiative. I just don't have any announcements that we're going to share today on it, but certainly, Warzone is an important piece for us across the franchise. 
Now overall, we're really happy with our progress on mobile for Call of Duty, and we're going to continue to invest in talent and capabilities to bring the best possible Call of Duty experiences to the mobile platform. 
And with these opportunities on mobile that we're talking about right now, and I think with the momentum we're seeing on the franchise across console and PC and across everything we have going on, we do believe Call of Duty is really well positioned for growth next year. And well into the future. Thank you."

I'll provide context on how we're thinking about the business overall and then kind of the IDSA changes in the context of that. 
So as you can see from Q3 results, we have some great momentum in the can business across both in-app purchases and also advertising. So looking ahead, we expect that momentum to deliver growth for us next year. And as you noted from earlier, we also will add to that in new launch with Crash Bandicoot: On the Run.
So -- but let me start with the in-app business and the dynamics there. Our initiatives to broaden the payer base are delivering clearly some really good results for us and are laying great foundations for growth for the future. And so in Candy, in particular, we see quite a few opportunities ahead of us, including really a lot of innovation around competitors and collaborative social features that are driving franchise growth and engagement. 
To give you just one example, in the United Kingdom, recently, we ran Candy All Stars. And that's Candy's first-ever competitive tournament, which was limited in the United Kingdom. And we saw some really terrific results across reach, engagement and player investment. And so the team is really thinking about exploring even more initiatives to build on for the success. 
So when you think about IDSA in that context and our ability on user acquisition, bring in new players, I'd point out that at the scale of the King Network and Candy strong brand recognition, we drive a significant majority of our installs organically. So many of our competitors are typically much more reliant on aggressive big user acquisition than we are. So while we will see how this plays out, we think that we ultimately will see less impact on an IDSA change here on the user acquisition piece of the King segment. 
Now on the advertising side, that's also been performing quite well, driven by really strong execution, and we've really been evangelizing our brand-safe platform. And we introduced, as you've heard in previous calls, a number of really great product innovations there, like sponsorships, which we have been delivering for us. 
So when IDFA comes into that context, there may be some short term volatility in advertising industry as a whole. But we really believe that the investments in our own direct sales and our own track have really positioned us for future growth and growth next year as part of that. So with that, I add on as well that next year is a year of a launch for us around Crash Bandicoot: On the Run! and which will launch in the spring, and we would expect that to contribute to King's top and bottom line. 
Again, going with an iconic franchise from a really deep catalog of IP and Activision Blizzard enables us to benefit from brand recognition. 
So on that, really good momentum right now, and I feel really, really good about our growth prospects for the business in each one of these areas and how they carry forward into next year. And kind of the context of the IDFA changes as part of that. Thank you."

So I think when you look at this year, and particularly the multiple touch points of opportunity that we're realizing on franchises like Call of Duty, those same opportunities exist for us on all of our franchises as well as the new potential franchises that we have in development. And this is my now 31st year of doing this, I don't recall a time where I've seen more opportunity for growth and margin expansion in all the time that I've been doing this. The challenge for us is going to be, one, prioritizing opportunity; and then two, making sure that we have the right talent aligned with those opportunities. But when I look at the success that we're experiencing now, and I think about the opportunities we have over the next few years, including next year, we have more momentum going into the next few years than I can remember in a long time. And a lot of the changes that we've made over the last few years are really starting to pay dividends. So from a long-term perspective, I think more platforms, more opportunities to deliver interactive entertainment experiences, increasing engagement that we're seeing from our games becoming increasingly social, the shift to more frequent delivery of content, the flexibility that we have in player investment models. I haven't seen as much opportunity ever. And so the challenge for us is going to be make sure we prioritize them effectively and have the right people in place to take advantage of them. But if you're asking about long-term outlook, I don't think it's ever been better."

I hope all of you and your families are safe and healthy. 
In the midst of the ongoing pandemic, this week, a few hundred of our employees were evacuated from their homes in Orange County because of fires. The resilience our employees around the world continue to show under very difficult circumstances is incredibly inspiring. Our externally talented teams have been able to connect and entertain hundreds of millions of people around the world at a time when connection and joy is more important than ever. 
This led to better-than-expected third quarter results, and we're again raising our outlook for the full year. We now expect net bookings in 2020 to grow over 25% year-over-year with earnings per share growing even faster. Since refocusing our teams on our greatest opportunities, we've started to return to the execution excellence we've always been known for. We have significantly grown the number of creative and commercial employees working on our key franchises. We have a clear strategy to continue expanding reach, engagement and player investment across all of our biggest franchises, and we continue to increase investment to grow the communities anchored in our franchises. 
We have a deep company-wide commitment to continue to deliver the highest-quality content and live operations to our network of almost 400 million players. And we've transitioned the business to a digital-first model, enabling our players to consume our content in the most convenient, value-focused manner. Our continued strong results reflect our focus on execution. 
Today, we're in a position to deliver sustained and significant long-term expansion across our portfolio of fully owned franchises. As we execute against our content pipeline, extend our key franchises to mobile, introduce new free-to-play experiences and continue to optimize in-game operations, we are positioned to continue converting our growing agent into consistent and long-term revenue and earnings growth. 
Call of Duty is the first community benefit from our pursuit of this franchise based strategy. With over 100 million monthly players, the Call of Duty community is larger than ever before. And with expansion across all platforms, the franchise has transformed into a truly social experience that engages and connects our players in truly epic ways. Through Modern Warfare and our free-to-play game Warzone, over 2/3 of players playing groups of friends, demonstrating the rich social connections enabled by our games. On mobile, Call of Duty has been downloaded over 300 million times worldwide and has become the highest grossing new game in the U.S. app stores since its launched last October. By expanding to mobile, we've brought in tens of millions of new players in countries far beyond our traditional audiences. With the game now in final large-scale testing in China and over 50 million players already preregistered, we see a clear path to continue growing Call of Duty's reach engagement and player investment on mobile in the largest mobile gaming market in the world. 
Deep engagement in premium Call of Duty content as well as the addition of free-to-play experiences across mobile, console and PC drove the number of monthly players in the community to over 3x the year ago level in this third quarter, and hours played were 7x higher than a year ago. As the community engages, they consume more content. More players are purchasing premium content than ever before, and these growth rates highlight the tremendous power of the combination of our premium and free-to-play business model. We expect to continue the Call of Duty momentum when we deliver Black Ops Cold War in 2 weeks. And our marketing has changed to reflect the scale and size of our own proprietary network. 
In August, millions of players gained access to the Black Ops Cold War Reveal trailer by playing interactive content within Warzone, generating a true virtual water cooler moment, driving substantial interest in the new release. Going direct to our network of players in this way represents more effective marketing than any paid media network. 
We intend to achieve with all our franchises as well as the potential new franchises we are actively creating, many of the successes we have had with call of Duty. In World of Warcraft, for example, we've seen unprecedented engagement trends since the subscriber base doubled following the launch of Classic last year. Presales of the upcoming Shadowlands expansion are the highest we've seen at this stage ahead of any release. Blizzard has the largest team ever working on ensuring Shadowlands meets all of our players' highest expectations and to deliver more frequent major content launches across both the modern game and classic in the years ahead. 
Blizzard has also dedicated creative talent focused on delivering multiple mobile experience in the coming years. Our franchises are well suited for global mobile, console and PC gaming audiences, and we're determined to deliver compelling mobile experiences for both existing fans of our franchises and the hundreds of millions of players around the world who haven't yet played our games. 
We also see continued growth opportunities for Candy Crush. Even as the franchise continues its leadership as the #1 franchise in the U.S. app stores with both in-app purchases and advertising driving growth in the third quarter, we'll continue to introduce competitive and collaborative social features to further broaden reach and deepen engagement in the coming quarters. 
There are few entertainment franchises that generate over $1 billion in annual net bookings. And today, we operate 3 of them: Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush. And each has clear opportunity for sustained growth. With our team's hard at work on multiple products in the Diablo franchise and major innovations for the Overwatch franchise as well as a number of new potential franchises at Blizzard and King, the pipeline across our portfolio and the potential for revenue and earnings expansion has never been stronger. 
I am so proud of our employees. Amid what continues to be the most challenging environment I've ever experienced in a 3 decades of leading the company, our teams continue to perform with extraordinary commitment to our audiences around the world. Of course, ensuring that our employees and their families are safe and healthy remains my #1 priority. The majority of our teams continue to work successfully from home, and they continue to show ingenuity and fortitude as they overcome challenges in health care, family care and work. 
For the balance of this year, we're raising our outlook, and we believe we will continue connecting and engaging more players than ever before in 2021. 
Thank you for your continued support. Daniel will now review the highlights of our operations for the past quarter with you."

Even through the challenges of operating during the pandemic, Activision Blizzard significantly exceeded its third quarter outlook with strong execution across our 3 strategic growth drivers: expanding audience reach, deepening engagem",1549,"Thank you, Bobby. 
Even through the challenges of operating during the pandemic, Activision Blizzard significantly exceeded its third quarter outlook with strong execution across our 3 strategic growth drivers: expanding audience reach, deepening engagement and increasing player investment. Our player base grew 23% year-over-year, and total time spent in our games increased even more. We grew net bookings 46% year-over-year, driven by strong in-game performance with substantial operating margin expansion and earnings per share more than doubling year-over-year. We achieved these results through a laser focus on execution both in major content launches and live operations across PC, console and mobile and in our new approaches to engagement and business models, particularly the introduction of Call of Duty free-to-play experiences. 
Our continued investments and successful initiatives for our largest franchises position the business for ongoing strong results, and we expect reach, engagement and player investment to remain structurally higher going forward. 
We're seeing a clear return on our increased investment in creative and commercial talent, and we intend to continue scaling our capabilities across our 6 key franchises: Call of Duty, Candy Crush, World of Warcraft, Hearthstone, Diablo and Overwatch. We're still early in unlocking the full potential of these wholly owned franchises and IP. 
Now turning to our franchise and operational highlights across our business units. Starting with Activision. Monthly active users tripled year-over-year to 111 million. The Call of Duty ecosystem had another fantastic quarter, again delivering substantial year-over-year growth across reach, engagement and player investment. The combination of premium Modern Warfare content and the free-to-play Warzone experience on PC and console continues to expand the community and drive deep engagement. 
Modern Warfare and Warzone saw more than 3x many monthly players as the prior title in the year ago quarter, with strong growth both inside and outside our traditional regions. Console player numbers grew strongly, and monthly players grew over tenfold year-over-year on PC. 
Across platforms, hours played in the Modern Warfare universe, where approximately 7x higher year-over-year versus the prior title. We again saw substantial year-over-year growth in premium game sales as Warzone players chose to upgrade to the full Call of Duty experience. Modern Warfare's first year sales are the highest in Call of Duty's history with 2/3 of lifetime units sold digitally, and we are seeing sustained strength in the franchise's revamped in-game system with console and PC in-game net bookings, 4x the year ago level. 
On November 13, we will launch Black Ops Cold War, the latest installment for Call of Duty. Anticipation for the release is high, with far more players engaged in the game's public testing than for the year ago title. 
Supporting cross-platform play across PC, current generation and next-generation consoles the premium release includes 3 compelling modes, an immersive single player campaign set in the volatile geopolitical battle of the 1980s, the deep and engaging multiplayer gameplay that Black Ops fans expect and a terrific zombies mode, and there's so much more to come. We are releasing the title into the largest and most engaged community at the time of launch in franchise history, and we are leveraging our direct digital relationships with our players to build awareness through entirely new in-game initiatives. Black Ops Cold War's in-game content will be centered around the same in-game system that resonated so well with players in modern Warfare. And starting with the first season of in-game content in December, Black Ops Cold War will be integrated into Warzone. 
We'll bring Black Ops Cold War's characters and weaponry into the free-to-play experience. Along with substantial new content, ensuring that Warzone remains both a terrific experience and a powerful on-ramp for the franchise's premium content. 
We are confident that Call of Duty will once again be the #1 console franchise globally for up-front sales this year, and we expect a continued shift to full game downloads, given the convenience for players and in-game marketing initiatives enabled by Warzone. 
On mobile, Call of Duty Mobile sustained the impressive levels of reach and engagement seen in the second quarter. As the game passes its first anniversary, the team continues to refine and optimize gameplay, seasonal content and the in-game economy, leveraging over 15 years of proven content and learnings in the franchise. October saw the biggest update yet with the addition of the Alcatraz map for Black Ops 4 and further social features, driving continued growth in engagement and player investment versus Q3 seasons. And with further additions ahead, the game now in final large-scale testing in China, the title is well positioned for further growth as it enters its second year. Also in Q3, the inaugural season of the Call of Duty League concluded with the champs weekend breaking records for the highest viewership of any Call of Duty esports event. Overall, the Call of Duty franchise and ecosystem are in great shape, and we can't wait to build on this with a premium release in a couple of weeks. 
Also, in the third quarter, Activision continued to reimagine the loved IP with the successful launch of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2. The game received fantastic reviews and became the fastest title in the series to reach 1 million units sold, highlighting the opportunity for our rich library of classic franchises. 
And in October, we launched Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time. The first all new Crash title in over a day, again to a great critical reception. 
Now turning to Blizzard. MAUs were 30 million in Q3. World of Warcraft MAUs were stable year-over-year, having structurally increased last Q3 following the launch of Classic. Anticipation continues to build for the Shadowlands expansion ahead of its November 23 launch. Franchise engagement is at its highest level for this stage ahead of an expansion in a decade, with presales well ahead of any prior expansion. The team has determined, build on this momentum, incorporating the community's feedback from testing to ensure that the expansion delights and engages players over a sustained period. The response has been extremely positive so far, particularly around the new character customization options and the new player experience, which not only streamlines how players enter the game, but allows current players to seamlessly level up new characters in previous expansions. And Blizzard will follow Shadowlands with more content for the franchise than ever before into the next year and beyond. 
Hours played in Hearthstone grew year-over-year in the third quarter with the Battlegrounds mode seeing sustained strong engagement since it released last November. Battlegrounds engagement illustrates the significant potential for new modes within the franchise, and the team continues to execute against an innovative pipeline with rigorous opportunity. November will see the broad release of Duos, a new player versus player mode, which is already seeing strong interest in early access since its reveal last week, alongside a new in-game progression system and the latest expansion, Madness at the Darkmoon Faire, all aimed at providing a rich and rewarding experience that drives growth across existing, lapsed and new players. 
Overwatch continues to have a large and dedicated community with an average 10 million monthly players in the quarter, more than 4 years since launch. Millions more have engaged through the 2020 season of the Overwatch League with the grand finals being the most watch event in the league's history. 
And finally, amongst multiple Blizzard mobile titles under development, Diablo Immortal saw a hugely enthusiastic response in internal testing in the third quarter and will soon enter external regional testing. 
Now turning to King. Overall, King Network MAUs were stable year-over-year at 249 million, while King's most important franchise, Candy Crush, again grew MAUs solidly year-over-year, in-game net bookings grew year-over-year. King's initiative to attract both lapsed and new payers have meaningfully improved the trajectory for a number of payers over the last year. And we are now starting to see the benefits of these actions in net bookings with a healthier payer base that is responding probably to compelling new features and live operations. As a result, Candy Crush was once again the top grossing franchise in the U.S. app stores. 
We also saw strength in 2 of King's other franchises, Farm Heroes and Bubble Witch, which both grew net bookings year-over-year as the team delivered a higher frequency of in game content. Along with higher performance for in-app purchases, King again delivered robust double-digit growth in advertising, with strength across both direct brand advertisers and partner networks. 
The team's investments in its direct sales channel tech infrastructure and product innovation continues to pay off. The advertising business track to grow net bookings around 40% this fiscal year and similar to King's in-app business is set to enter next year with a strong trajectory. 
And as we announced this week, King's newest title, Crash Bandicoot: On the Run will launch in spring. The title has all been met with incredible fan reception option with preregistrations off to a very strong start. Around 10 million people have already registered their interest in the game. 
In summary, execution against our franchise strategy has driven another quarter of strong year-over-year growth across the business, and we have momentum heading into Q4 and next year. 
Dennis will now share the detailed results of our third quarter and specifics of our raised outlook."

Today, I will review our Q3 2020 results as well as our outlook for the fourth quarter. Net bookings in the third quarter grew 46% year-over-year to $1.77 billion, with digital net bookings growing 65% year-over-year and representing over 90% of the total. 
Let's start by looking at our segment results. Activision revenue was $773 million, growing 270% year-over-year. Growth was again driven by Modern Warfare and Warzone in-game revenues, strong sales of premium Modern Warfare, the addition of Call of Duty Mobile and the successful Tony Hawk launch. Operating income was $345 million with an operating margin of 45% full third quarter records. 
Blizzard revenue was $411 million, growing 4% year-over-year, driven by another strong quarter of growth for World of Warcraft. Operating income was $133 million, increasing 80% year-over-year with an operating margin of 32%, 14 points higher year-over-year. King revenue of $536 million was 7% higher year-over-year, with both in-app revenue and advertising revenue growing. 
Operating income was $248 million, the highest since acquisition, with an operating margin of 46%, 8 points higher sequentially, boosted by lower sales and marketing versus Q2. 
In total, across our segments, in-game net bookings were $1.2 billion, growing 69% year-over-year with each of Activision Blizzard and King contributing to this strong performance. Total segment operating profit of $726 million grew 147% year-over-year. This was despite an approximately $50 million headwind as we adjusted esports franchise terms and made investments to support our team owners and ecosystems amid a challenging environment for live events during the pandemic. This was primarily in Blizzard segment results. 
Now let's turn to our consolidated results. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. For the quarter, we generated Q3 GAAP revenues of $1.95 billion, $154 million above our August outlook. This includes the net recognition of deferrals of $187 million. Net bookings of $1.77 billion or $117 million above August outlook, and we generated Q3 GAAP EPS of $0.78 and Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $0.88, which was $0.14 and $0.13 above guidance, respectively. These figures include the net recognition of deferrals of $0.17. 
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Q3 operating cash flow was $196 million, reflecting higher cash taxes paid and changes in working capital. Year-to-date, operating cash flow of $1.11 billion grew 22% year-over-year. 
Our cash and investments at the end of September were approximately $7.6 billion, and we ended the quarter with a net cash position of approximately $4 billion. 
During the quarter, we issued $2 billion of unsecured 10- and 30-year notes. We redeemed all of our outstanding $1.05 billion of notes due in '21 and '22, with the remaining $950 million further strengthening our balance sheet as we took advantage of historically low interest rates. 
Now let's turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year. In the fourth quarter, in addition to ongoing live operations and in-game content across the portfolio, Activision launched Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time on PS4 and Xbox One in early October. And of course, on November 13, we will release Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War on current and next-gen PlayStation and Xbox and PC. 
Blizzard will release Hearthstone's Madness at the Darkmoon Faire expansion and the World of Warcraft: Shadowlands expansion. And King is planning numerous features and innovative live ops and Candy Crush. 
Before I discuss the specifics of our outlook, I'll provide some context. We are ending the holiday season with strong momentum across Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush, our 3 largest franchises, which bodes well for the future. And we are launching major new content for Call of Duty and World of Warcraft into highly engaged communities. But at the same time, in the short term, we wish to remain prudent in our assumptions regarding the consumer spending environment, the console transition and the pace of player migration from deeply engaging existing content. 
I'd also note that while Call of Duty Mobile has entered final large-scale testing in China, we do not include material revenue from the region on our Q4 outlook and anticipate monetization will become more meaningful next year. 
For Q4 on a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $2.0 billion, including net deferrals of $731 million. We expect net bookings of $2.7 billion. We now expect a GAAP-only restructuring charge of approximately $50 million and a GAAP operating margin of 24%, and we expect GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 782 million and EPS of $0.44. For Q4, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect an operating margin of 33% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.63, including net deferrals of $0.46. 
On a GAAP basis for 2020, we now expect revenues of $7.7 billion, including net deferrals of $425 million. We now expect net bookings of $8.1 billion, $475 million above our August outlook. We expect a GAAP-only restructuring charge of approximately $90 million and a GAAP operating margin of 34%. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 779 million and GAAP EPS of $2.61. 
For 2020, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect an operating margin of 39% and non-GAAP EPS of $3.08, including net deferrals of $0.27. 
Now I'd also like to briefly touch on 2021. I'd note that it is still early, we remain cognizant of macro risk, and we will take our normal prudent approach to forecasting results, but strong business momentum looks in our favor, and we see numerous opportunities to expand the scale of our franchises. Successful execution against our plans would position our segments to build on the aggregate performance reflected in our revised 2020 outlook. 
So in closing, our business has seen a structural change this year, and we continue to experience strong momentum heading into holiday season and next year. We see substantial opportunity ahead for our franchises across geographies, platforms and business models. And we'll continue to focus on business improvements and operating efficiencies and the service of investing more in development to further expand our communities and franchises. We remain confident that executing against our plan will position us to deliver strong results and shareholder value over the long term.

Let me first start by saying that obviously, we're thrilled with how the community has embraced horizon. And obviously, we're very thankful for their support. We're also really proud of the work that our development teams have done on the game and continue to do so. Warzone has really become an incredible addition to the franchise. It's a central place where we can connect and engage the entire Call of Duty community. And I also think maintaining that tight connection with our premium games has been really important, especially for players who want to check out everything the Call of Duty has to offer, and we saw that with Modern Warfare, and we plan to continue that into the future. So Call of Duty community should expect to see Warzone evolve and innovate in a lot of fun ways. And alongside our premium games importantly. 
Now let me clarify a bit on your question on how Cold War and Warzone are going to work together, and I'll do this at a high level. And please also note that we're going to be sharing a lot of details with the community coming up really soon. But first, core Black Ops Cold War progression will build upon the success and will work similarly to how it did in Modern Warfare. So for example, all the awesome new Black Ops weapons and operators you unlock and your level 1 to 55 progression will be usable in Black Ops and in Warzone, just like that work in Modern Warfare. Black Ops Battle Pass content and store content will also work across Black Ops and Warzone. Now players, of course, can continue to use their Modern Warfare content in Warzone once Black Ops launches. And as a result, 1 cool feature that players will see is that they'll be able to choose either their Black Ops load out for the Modern Warfare load outs in Warzone for their game play. And this is just one example on how Warzone is going to expand and evolve over time. 
Now players can also expect a ton of free post-launch content from the Black Ops Cold War premium experience across multiplayer and zombies. I think we did a great job on this for the community for everyone with Modern Warfare, and we'll do the same with Black Ops. So November 13 really is just the beginning for this game, and I think it's a great game. And just like Modern Warfare, this game is going to get bigger and better and more fun as the year goes on. 
So -- in terms of overall progression, unlocks and content, we've really built upon what has worked really well for the community with Modern Warfare. And we think people and players we'll be really excited to check at everything Black Ops Cold War has to offer as well. 
Now in terms of timing of the next season, Daniel mentioned this, we expect Season 1 for Black Ops Cold War and Warzone to launch this December. And that's when you're going to be able to start to see the impact of Black Ops and Warzone really starting to work together in cool and fun ways. Again, a lot more detail here, which we're going to be revealing in the next week or 2. 
And I guess the final thing I would say, and Dan, I think, mentioned this as well. What's exciting for us is we are launching Black Ops Cold War into the largest and most engaged community in Colony's history. And now we're really excited to see what the community does and how they play together across this ecosystem that's now really expanding even further, and we're excited about where it's going, but thanks for the question."

And this is Daniel. I'll take that question. Look, we love to see the platform innovation, be it in next-gen consoles or streaming or the increased power of mobile devices, which really enables new and unique ways for us to deliver experiences and content to our communities. With more well-capitalized companies coming into the space and really investing to extend the reach of gaming, if anything, this is just going to accelerate the growth in already growing industry. So it's actually great for everybody. These platforms really need great content to thrive, and for us, as a leading content owner that fully owns our franchises and our IP, we're really well positioned to take advantage of this expansion platforms and also the associated economics. 
We're also excited just for the next-generation of consoles and the potential they offer to really bring even more compelling experiences to our players. And you're already seeing us supporting the new hardware with the launch of Black Ops Cold War on day 1, as Rob was mentioning. 
Ultimately, for us, our priority is to build the best player experiences where our players want to be and really where they can connect with other members of the community. It's just so powerful. 
That said, though, our development resources just are finite. So we really have to focus on where the biggest opportunities are. For example, we need to make sure that we're enabling our franchises on the billions of mobile devices that are available right now. That's, by far, our biggest opportunity, and we're investing meaningfully to capitalize on this and to take all our franchises to mobile over time. That's really, really important for us. 
Now regarding your question on subscriptions, we're also very fortunate in that we have exposure to every gaming business model at scale. We operate the largest subscription franchise in the industry and World of Warcraft. So we feel we have a good experience here. And we already have deep digital relationships with our players, including through Battle.net, which gives us just a lot of potential in this area. 
We already offer multiple ways for players to access our most current and premium content and this will really continue to evolve as our business needs change.

The first thing we do is express that we're really excited for players to get their hands on Shadowlands and we've announced that the release date is November 23. That is the exact 16-year anniversary for the launch of the original old World of Warcraft. We made the delay earlier to Shadowlands to make sure that the quality of the game is really going to match our expectations and that the game was going to be great. And the community feedback that we received on that decision was overwhelmingly positive. And so we're keeping the quality of the game as a top concern. It's helped drive, I think, a lot of excitement for a while, both in the form of really strong player engagement and as well as expansion presales. 
So players are already been doing the content that we released with Shadowlands pre patch. But I want to talk about a future that I'm personally really passionate, much as the new player experience. 
So the goal for this system was to really streamline learning how to play World of Warcraft for newcomers And also give people who have multiple characters a way to level up in previous expansions. So today, the way we look at the WoW ecosystem is that we operate to distinct game modes, both with very engaged player bases that that gives us the opportunity to deliver a lot of content into the wealth community, really more than ever before, all under a single unified subscription. 
We've talked before about our plans to expand the size the development teams, and we intend to follow the warranty Shadowlands even more content across both the modern game and in classic. 
But if we step back, we think of Warcraft as a huge franchise and WoW is only a part of it. WoW always exploring how to express aircraft with new experiences, and we see a lot of opportunity for growth in 2021 and beyond. Thanks for the question."

I think just starting at a high level, again, on Call of Duty Mobile, we're really happy and proud of the success we've seen here with the over 300 million downloads around the world. We did maintain a lot of good momentum in the third quarter, driven really by the frequency of updates and the quality of those updates, most importantly and it's resonated really well with the community. And the good sign for us is that momentum has continued now already into the fourth quarter. 
In October, we had our big 1-year anniversary event. And I guess 1 metric I can give you would suggest we're off to a very strong start. The first week of that event has been the strongest first week that we've seen in terms of gross bookings. And so that's a really nice positive and continued momentum that we're seeing. 
Now in terms of future growth, we do still see strong potential for Call of Duty Mobile. China, obviously, we believe, can become a significant contributor to our overall franchise revenues. And we talked about how the title has been approved and now it's in final testing. So again, we expect to see it soon. Hope to see it soon, but we think can have great impact in the region. 
And it's really not just China. For example, Mexico and Brazil are top 5 markets for us in terms of both installs and revenue. And so we see a big opportunity to further expand geographically in other markets through mobile through increased marketing and accessibility initiatives over the coming quarters. 
Now we also see a big opportunity to further connect the mobile experience to what's happening on console and PC. And to your point, that includes Warzone. As you know, Warzone for us is a very important strategic initiative. I just don't have any announcements that we're going to share today on it, but certainly, Warzone is an important piece for us across the franchise. 
Now overall, we're really happy with our progress on mobile for Call of Duty, and we're going to continue to invest in talent and capabilities to bring the best possible Call of Duty experiences to the mobile platform. 
And with these opportunities on mobile that we're talking about right now, and I think with the momentum we're seeing on the franchise across console and PC and across everything we have going on, we do believe Call of Duty is really well positioned for growth next year. And well into the future. Thank you."

I'll provide context on how we're thinking about the business overall and then kind of the IDSA changes in the context of that. 
So as you can see from Q3 results, we have some great momentum in the can business across both in-app purchases and also advertising. So looking ahead, we expect that momentum to deliver growth for us next year. And as you noted from earlier, we also will add to that in new launch with Crash Bandicoot: On the Run.
So -- but let me start with the in-app business and the dynamics there. Our initiatives to broaden the payer base are delivering clearly some really good results for us and are laying great foundations for growth for the future. And so in Candy, in particular, we see quite a few opportunities ahead of us, including really a lot of innovation around competitors and collaborative social features that are driving franchise growth and engagement. 
To give you just one example, in the United Kingdom, recently, we ran Candy All Stars. And that's Candy's first-ever competitive tournament, which was limited in the United Kingdom. And we saw some really terrific results across reach, engagement and player investment. And so the team is really thinking about exploring even more initiatives to build on for the success. 
So when you think about IDSA in that context and our ability on user acquisition, bring in new players, I'd point out that at the scale of the King Network and Candy strong brand recognition, we drive a significant majority of our installs organically. So many of our competitors are typically much more reliant on aggressive big user acquisition than we are. So while we will see how this plays out, we think that we ultimately will see less impact on an IDSA change here on the user acquisition piece of the King segment. 
Now on the advertising side, that's also been performing quite well, driven by really strong execution and we've really been evangelizing our brand-safe platform. And we introduced, as you've heard in previous calls, a number of really great product innovations there, like sponsorships, which we have been delivering for us. 
So when IDFA comes into that context, there may be some short term volatility in advertising industry as a whole. But we really believe that the investments in our own direct sales and our own track have really positioned us for future growth and growth next year as part of that. So with that, I add on as well that next year is a year of a launch for us around Crash Bandicoot: On the Run! and which will launch in the spring and we would expect that to contribute to King's top and bottom line. 
Again, going with an iconic franchise from a really deep catalog of IP and Activision Blizzard enables us to benefit from brand recognition. 
So on that, really good momentum right now, and I feel really, really good about our growth prospects for the business in each one of these areas and how they carry forward into next year. And kind of the context of the IDFA changes as part of that. Thank you."

So I think when you look at this year, and particularly the multiple touch points of opportunity that we're realizing on franchises like Call of Duty, those same opportunities exist for us on all of our franchises as well as the new potential franchises that we have in development. And this is my now 31st year of doing this, I don't recall a time where I've seen more opportunity for growth and margin expansion in all the time that I've been doing this. The challenge for us is going to be, one, prioritizing opportunity; and then two, making sure that we have the right talent aligned with those opportunities. But when I look at the success that we're experiencing now, and I think about the opportunities we have over the next few years, including next year, we have more momentum going into the next few years than I can remember in a long time. And a lot of the changes that we've made over the last few years are really starting to pay dividends. So from a long-term perspective, I think more platforms, more opportunities to deliver interactive entertainment experiences, increasing engagement that we're seeing from our games becoming increasingly social, the shift to more frequent delivery of content, the flexibility that we have in player investment models. I haven't seen as much opportunity ever. And so the challenge for us is going to be make sure we prioritize them effectively and have the right people in place to take advantage of them. But if you're asking about long-term outlook, I don't think it's ever been better."
