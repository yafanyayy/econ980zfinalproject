Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. I hope that you and your families are all healthy and safe. Our thoughts go out to everyone affected by this crisis, and our thanks go to the front line workers who are fighting this pandemic. I would also like to recognize the incredible efforts of our entire team at Carrier, which has continued to deliver essential products and services to our customers during these challenging times. I have been so impressed with our 53,000 employees. They have stepped up in a truly profound way, and I couldn't be more proud of this phenomenal team. 
Clearly, a lot has changed since we last spoke to you in February. Therefore, we are going to structure our comments as follows: first, I'll take you through the impact that COVID-19 is having on our business and how we are addressing these dynamics head on. Tim will then run you through our first quarter financials as well as provide more detail on our approach to managing our liquidity, cash and balance sheet. And then I'll provide more color on the remainder of 2020. 
Starting with Slide 2. In response to COVID-19, we jumped in a gear early and aggressively. We started daily leadership team meetings that continue today, and we established 4 priorities that have guided our decision-making. 
Our first priority is the safety of our employees. Our office employees are generally working remotely while our factory personnel have largely continued in the workplace to support our customers given the critical nature of our products and services. 
In our factories, we have gone to tremendous lengths to keep our people safe by implementing an extensive range of safety protocols, and we are now applying those best practices to our offices as we begin to transition office employees back to the workplace. 
Our second priority has been to maintain business continuity to deliver essential products and services to our customers. Like other manufacturers, we did experience temporary closures in some of our 49 factories. 
In China, where we have 9 factories and about 1,300 suppliers. All of our sites were operational within a couple of weeks after the February [ 10 3 ] opening after the Lunar New Year, and our output from our sites -- from our local suppliers, has been close to 100% for the past month. We have had short-term factory closures in India, Malaysia, Mexico, the EU and the U.S., but our team has done a superb job of minimizing the length of the occasional site closures and supporting our customers. 
While we continue to experience episodic supplier challenges, our supply chain team has been managing these issues as they arise. Our third priority is to effectively manage our costs and preserve cash. Tim will cover this topic in more detail, but I'm pleased with our proactive approach and early results. 
We accelerated and increased savings through Carrier 600, which is our plan to eliminate $600 million in cost over 3 years. Between our overdrive expectations on Carrier 600 for this year, together with other onetime cost actions, we will be driving $425 million in cost actions this year. For example, we have implemented a 15% pay cut for our senior leadership team, including myself, reduce the Board of Director pay, instituted a 15-day furlough, suspended merit increases, we're driving down expected incremental public company costs by about $25 million for the year and we are aggressively managing our discretionary spend. 
We will also be reducing our CapEx from our initial plan of $350 million to $400 million to $200 million to $225 million. Though we are aggressively containing spend, we continue to invest in areas that are critical to our growth agenda, including R&D, sales and digital, all critical to our core strategy to get to sustained mid single-digit growth levels. 
On the cash side, we are comfortable with our liquidity position. We started with $1.3 billion in cash on April 3, and we are confident in our ability to generate more than $1 billion in free cash flow this year. We have access to a $2 billion revolver if needed. So we have a strong cash position and are carefully managing it. 
Finally, our fourth priority has been to ensure that we emerge from this pandemic stronger by accelerating implementation of our strategic imperatives. And I'll give you more color on that on the next slide. So turning to Slide 3. 
It highlights how we're positioning Carrier for long-term success. Starting with our organization culture of focus and values. This truly is a new Carrier with a very different feel to it, both internally and externally. We recently launched the Carrier way, which lays out our vision, values and behaviors. Our culture is focused on customers, winning, growth, agility, innovation and empowerment. We are breaking down barriers to enable our people to be more externally focused and empowering them to drive our long-term growth agenda. 
On people, we have made great progress in assembling a world-class leadership team with both external hires and promotions of internal talent. We launched the new Carrier operating system, which is both nimble and disciplined, and we are doubling down on our ESG commitments with a laser focus on our commitment to the environment through not only our own factories, but also more innovative energy-efficient products. And we've supplemented our focus on the environment with initiatives that support the needs of our communities by playing our part in the fight against this pandemic. 
For example, we designed and produced our new  OptiClean Negative Air machines in just a few weeks and early feedback from the hospitals on our prototype units is very positive. 
Turning to our strategy and growth pillars. These remain unchanged. We continue to deliver against our 3 strategic top line priorities funded by Carrier 600. In the first pillar, growing our core we remain well positioned within each of our segments, building off of our #1 or 2 market positions. We are also adding 500 net sales employees, while we continue to make key strategic R&D and digital investments. 
We've had significant wins across the portfolio, including our largest order ever of 19 DV chillers for data centers in Indonesia, an exclusive long-term resi deal with Fisher Homes in the U.S. and very significant wins across our refrigeration and F&S portfolios. 
In our second pillar, extending our products and geographic coverage, as a vote of confidence in our [ CO2 ] technology that we're using to enter warehouse refrigeration, we were selected to provide the cooling for the Beijing Olympics ice rink, and we secured a VRF win for the Sanyo Olympic village apartments in China for 3,500 heat pumps and 1,000 condensing units. 
And in the third pillar, driving aftermarket and digital, we have a dedicated aftermarket team in place. We indicated that we'd get to a 30% conversion rate in commercial HVAC by the end of next year, and we are on track to do so this year. We're rolling out structured tiered offerings customized that customers' needs, and we have leaned forward on digital as a differentiator through remote monitoring, diagnostics and prognostics. 
We've had some key aftermarket wins including a 4-year chiller service agreement with the Hong Kong international airport for 52 chillers across 17 buildings and support for Tim Hortons China operations that is projected to scale to 1,500 stores over the next 10 years. 
And on the right side of the slide, we're very proud of our essential and vital role in society. We support air conditioning systems and hospitals and nursing homes and the delivery of food and pharmaceuticals safely around the world. Looking ahead, as countries and regions around the world are preparing to reopen economies in society, we intend to play a critical role in anticipating and creating the new normal. For example, indoor air quality will be critical. We're putting the VVAC and HVAC in our unique electrostatic systems can filter microscopic size contaminants. Carrier will be a leader in transitioning buildings around the world from sick to healthy buildings. Adjusting food safety in the new normal will be paramount, and we have been making tremendous progress on Holistic Cold Chain Solutions. 
In our Fire & Security business, Touch List and traceability will be very thematic in the future. With our Touch List Blue Diamond solution, we can eliminate 80% of typical contact points in an office building by enabling employees to use their cellphones instead. So with that, let me turn it over to Tim to discuss 1Q cost and cash, and I'll come back to discuss our best sense of 2020. Tim?"

Please turn to Slide 4, where I will walk you through our Q1 results. But before I start, I want to point out that as we move from being a division of United Technologies to becoming a fully independent public company, some",1563,"Thank you, Dave. Good morning. Please turn to Slide 4, where I will walk you through our Q1 results. But before I start, I want to point out that as we move from being a division of United Technologies to becoming a fully independent public company, some of the numbers we report will not have a perfect comparison with last year's. The Form 10 carve out statements adjusted for that in some circumstances, but not all. 
We'll try to help you understand those noncomparables with explanations but it may be a bit messy and will continue to be so for the remainder of the year. With that caveat, let me jump into the results for our first quarter. 
Despite significant macroeconomic headwinds in the back half of the quarter, it started out about how we had expected and reflected a solid start to the year. Sales of $3.9 billion were down 10% from last year, 9% organically, which adjusts for a 1% FX headwind. We reported at Investor Day that we faced difficult year-on-year comparisons in each of our 3 segments. In HVAC, our residential results last year reflected a strong furnace season due to abnormally high shipments ahead of a new fer regulation. In refrigeration, our North America truck and trailer business came off a cyclical peak in Q1 last year. And in F&S, we wound down our residential intrusion business, creating a year-on-year decline in 2020. 
Additional pressure came from the warm winter this year and resulting softness in residential furnace sales. These items accounted for about half of our Q1 decline. The remainder resulted from the impact of COVID-19 on our business in the latter part of the quarter. It first hit China where about 8% or $1.5 billion of our revenues are derived. This had a material detrimental effect with domestic China sales down approximately 40%. And in addition, a good part of our global factory production and supply chain sources come from China. We did, however, manage through that disruption without a material impact on our rest of world business. But then later in the quarter, the virus move west into Europe and then on to the Americas. This pandemic accounted for about $230 million of our revenue decline in the quarter. Our teams have worked tirelessly to keep factories operational and productive to serve our customers around the world. And they continue to do so. Moving down the P&L. GAAP operating profit was $315 million. Adjusted operating profit of $436 million was down 16% from last year. But this adjusted number is still not comparable. Our Q1 included about $24 million of public company costs that were not included in the same quarter of 2019. Absent the impact of that, the comparable year-on-year decline was 12%. And of course, it was heavily impacted by COVID-19. While we're not happy about the negative signs here, a 12% decline for comparable adjusted operating profits versus a 9% decline in organic revenues shows we were able to offset a lot of the typical decrementals, largely preserving our operating margin. Our Q1 GAAP EPS was $0.11, and adjusted EPS was $0.35. Since we were not a public company last year, the year-over-year comparisons of EPS are not meaningful. I'm pleased to report that our free cash flow was favorable to last year by over $200 million. Q1 is typically a seasonal user of cash, so bringing it in almost flat reflected a solid start to the year. The decline in net income was more than offset by favorable working capital results and aided by some deferred tax payments. All things considered, our performance in the first quarter was solid with good mitigation of very difficult environment. Let's now look at how the segments performed. Please turn to Slide 5. HVAC was down 9% organically. Within it, North America Residential was down 11% organically, with roughly half the decline due to last year's furred driven accelerated gas furnace shipments. And the other half to slow shipments this year due to the unseasonably warm winter. Overall, furnace sales were down 30% year-over-year. The commercial business was down 8% organically, as a 5% decline in light commercial and 20% decline in applied, driven by weakness in China and Europe that was only partially offset by a flattish services business and strength in ALC and  NORESCO. Refrigeration sales were down 14% organically, with North America truck trailer down close to 30%. Europe truck trailer down around 15%, and  container down around 7%. 
A difficult truck trailer comparison for the quarter was expected, as I mentioned earlier, but the results did deteriorate as the quarter progressed. Commercial Refrigeration was down 13% organically, with weakness in both Europe and Asia. The Fire & Security segment was down 5% organically, with the products business down 4% organically. This was attributable to COVID related project delays and shutdowns in Asia and Europe, but was partially offset by growth in our longer cycle businesses, [ water mist ] and gas suppression and also growth in Global Access solutions. The field business was down 5% organically due to March lockdowns across regions with particular weakness in Hong Kong, Australasia and France. In this world of uncertainty, we're focused on controlling the controllables, and that includes aggressive cost containment actions. Slide 6 provides a breakdown of our cost programs. In February, we told you that we expected to achieve $175 million of savings from our Carrier 600 this year and that we would invest $150 million of that back into the business to support our growth strategies. The current environment shifted some of our priorities to aggressively reduce cost, yet to preserve critical investment initiatives. The actions that we're taking are expected to generate $425 million of cost improvement this year, including accelerating Carrier 600, reducing our planned investments, and implementing an aggressive cost containment program. First, we will accelerate Carrier 600 and expect to deliver an additional $50 million in 2020 for a total of $225 million. 
Second, we have scaled back our investments in the year by $75 million in a very surgical manner. We are preserving the investments and initiatives that are most critical to our growth strategy, to ensure we are well positioned as we exit this crisis. 
We have also initiated a $300 million cost containment program for 2020. Lastly, while COVID-19 affects volume and the drop-through of margins, it also disrupts our factories and other areas of our cost base. We're anticipating a $200 million nonrecurring headwind this year on things like factory absorption, supply chain disruption, expediting costs and inefficiencies caused by precautions for the safety of our employees. 
The $425 million of cost actions more than offset this impact and our net savings are $250 million, up from the $25 million, we laid out at Investor Day in February. Dave mentioned our top priorities for 2020, one of which is to maintain ample liquidity. Please turn to Slide 7, and I'll walk you through that. I mentioned earlier that we performed well from a cash flow standpoint in a quarter that is typically a big user of cash. Our working capital usually seasonally spikes in Q1 as we start building for the spring/summer selling season. 
We managed it tightly this year and delivered better cash than planned by over $200 million. We started the quarter with a cash position of $952 million and ended it with a balance of $768 million. This resulted from a neutral free cash flow and a use of $184 million from other investing and financing activities, including a small debt repayment and the effect of foreign exchange. And at spin, UTC returned us approximately $560 million of cash, so our opening balance sheet started with just over $1.3 billion on April 3. 
From this base, we will continue our efforts to preserve and enhance our liquidity. We will intensify our focus on all the components and levers available to us. This will include tightly managing working capital, expanding and driving the program we began in Q1. We have also done a deep scrub of our CapEx budget for the year and cut it by 40% to 50%. 
It is now $200 million to $225 million, down from the $350 million to $400 million we had originally planned. In pairing it back, we have prioritized those projects targeted at our strategic priorities for growth. And those projects, which have high returns and a quick payback. We will also assess the timing and amount of a dividend. Our Form 10 identified a possible dividend scenario that was appropriate at the time but the environment we face today is much different from what it was then. 
With this foundation and these actions, we expect good free cash flow for the year, and it will add to our available cash. In addition to our cash position, we have a $2 billion revolving credit agreement with a strong bank group. That revolver remains undrawn and fully available to us. And finally, I will remind you that we have no debt maturities until 2023. So we feel quite good about our liquidity and are confident we have access to the capital we need to weather the storm and to operate and grow the business. 
With that, let me turn it back over to Dave to discuss how we're thinking about the balance of the year."

So what does this mean for our expectations for the full year? For our scenario planning in this uncertain global economy, we looked at 3 key indicators to frame our thinking.

For our scenario planning in this uncertain global economy, we looked at 3 key indicators to frame our thinking. First, macroeconomic projections like GDP. I second, indicators more directly tied to our business like new housing starts; and third, order trends. At a macro level, starting with GDP, our current guidepost for 2020 assume U.S. GDP declines about 25% in the second quarter and 5% to 10% for the full year. Expectations for Europe are similar. We assume China shows growth in Q2 and accelerates from there. When we look at macro indicators specific to our segments, we assume headwinds from lower replacement volumes as unemployment rates impact homeowner purchases, U.S. housing starts being down 10% to 20% this year and continued softness in non-resi construction starts in North America and Europe as we see from leading indicators like the architectural billing index. 
And in our refrigeration business, the forecast declines in North America and Europe truck trailer will be even steeper than we had originally forecast. ACT forecasts North American truck trailer production to be down 45% this year, and European truck trailer is likely to be down 20% to 30%. Container drops are likely to be far more muted. So then on Page 8, let me share some color with you on orders. We start with our China experience. Q1 orders were down 40% year-over-year, with February being the lowest month, down 50%. In the category of good news, the China recovery has been very positive. Our daily order rates returned to precrisis levels in mid-April, and our April orders in China were flat overall. The recovery has been at its body and 1-month doesn't make a trend. But for us, China has declined and then its recovery were both quite steep. Our current thinking about the U.S. and EU, is that the decline will be a bit shallower, but the recovery will be longer. 
For us, orders declined earlier in the EU than in the U.S., but we also expect an early recovery. Orders in 1Q were down 10% in Europe, but were down 5% in the U.S. and that accelerated into April with Europe down 30% and the U.S. down 25%. Based on a slower recovery in the EU and U.S. versus China, our internal planning assumes recovery of orders to more typical levels as we get into later 3Q and early Q4. So what does this all mean as we frame 2020? Turning to Slide 9. I you could think of the numbers that you see here as guidepost as we look at various scenarios playing out globally. We see sales between $15 billion and $17 billion, adjusted op profit between $1.7 billion and $2 billion, and free cash flow over $1 billion. Also, with respect to the scenarios behind the sales decline for the whole company, you should think about the HVAC segment decline fairly aligned with the percentage range that you see here, with refrigeration facing a bit more headwind and F&S is expected to be a bit at the better end of the range. Given that 80% of our sales are in the U.S. and Europe, we expect the steepest declines to occur in 2Q with improvements from there. So we have done our best to analyze the rest of the year for ourselves and for you, and we will continue to update you as this very fluid situation evolves. And though the coming months are inherently uncertain, what I do know with great confidence is that we'll get through this crisis. And over the long term, megatrends such as climate change, global urbanization and the shift towards digitalization and operating in the new normal will remain tailwinds for our business. And this takes me to our last page on Page 10. 
We remain confident that the game plan that we laid out for you on February 10 will drive the results that you see here. We are getting real traction on the 3 pillars of our top line strategy, which will propel sustained mid-single-digit top line growth. We are tenaciously driving Carrier 600 to invest in growth and to help drive margin expansion to enable high single-digit EPS growth on a steady state basis. And we are laser-focused on driving working capital improvements needed to support free cash flow equal to net income. We have a clear road map to success. We remain committed to executing on our plan with urgency, conviction and effectiveness. And with that, we'll open us up for questions."

Say, as we -- as you know, we usually think of what we call a drop-through rate, decremental. Usually, I like to think of it as incremental. But unfortunately, in this environment, we talk about decrementals, as about 28%. What you saw in the first quarter actually was much favorable to that, but that was largely because we had the better part of 10 percentage points worth of benefit from cost reduction in the quarter, about $40 million lower cost and that contributed to a much lower drop through. And interestingly, our sales in China were hit during the quarter, the hardest of ours, and China tends to carry lower general margins through, and we benefited by about 4%. So that's why you see the 14%. You actually may not see the 14%. You may see a 19%. But remember, we talked about a $24 million stand-alone cost that's the first quarter component of the $107 million that you ultimately see for the full year. I will also point out that I think you may have seen from UTC's release yesterday, numbers that are a little bit different. They have about $20 million difference in profits. So if you adjust for that, there are some unusual things where it was different from us to them, they may have -- you may have construed at 24% from them. 
As we think about the rest of the year, again, going back to the 28%. Yes, I would say second quarter is likely to be the hardest hit quarter and the deeper, the drop in revenues, it makes it difficult. We aren't just scaling back production. We're shutting lines down, we're closing shifts, we're, in some cases, closing factories and you go deeper in to the cost pool there. And I would expect that to be in the second quarter. We will experience some mix degradation. The reverse of what you saw, I mean, some of our higher-margin businesses, the residential HVAC and others will be hit. How I simply think about rest of year decrementals, though, is that we have -- we'll be hit by 2 or 3 points with JV income because there's no offsetting revenue component to the drop in earnings that we're anticipating. And then all other of the cost, the factory disruption, et cetera, is largely covered -- that and the margin mix is covered by our cost reduction. So we anticipate, if you look at the projections, we'll probably be about 30%, couple of points worse than the normal 28%."

Actually, it's absolutely underway. We've been in discussions, and we've actually seen real progress with customers, whether it's the State of Florida or with hospitals where we've distributed our new OptiClean Negative Air machines. We're coming out of the gates fast on this one because we believe it's critical not only for our business, but it's critical for society. There are a shockingly number -- high number of sick buildings out there. And one of the characteristics of a sick building is the ventilation system. You look at the room I'm in right now, you would expect a certain number of air changes per hour, say, in the 10 to 15 range. And many buildings around the world have stagnant narrow, and they don't have the number of changes per hour. You look at the filtration system in many buildings as you have the return are going to through a filtration system, you'd expect it to be able to filter out contaminants at a 0.1, 0.3 micron level and many filtration systems don't have that. We have that with our electric static filters for homes, UAV or HEPA filters in commercial buildings, many buildings don't have that. 
You want your ducts cleaned every 3 to 5 years, and that doesn't happen. So as we look at the transition to healthy buildings, I think you should expect that Carrier is going to be front and center on that. It's very real. And it's the same in our other 2 segments. You mentioned touchless. In our Fire & Security business, we already have a Blue Diamond app that can eliminate a lot of the touch points as say you go from your car to your office building, there's usually 8 to 10 touch points. And like I said in the earlier remarks, we can eliminate 80% of that as you go to open the turnstyle or you press the elevated button or you adjust the HVAC controls in your office or on your floor. There's a number of touch points that we can eliminate that are going to be critical. And it also is combined with the traceability element. So as employers want to be able in the workplace to trace folks, we have an app that can co-mingle with the other parts of the app to be able to track people in the workplace. 
And the other segment that we have in our refrigeration business, the entire cold chain is going to be just foundationally and fundamentally different. So you look at how people get their food today in a place like China, and there's a significant number of what marks. And we have a market and we have farmers markets here in the U.S. and in Europe. But you're going to see a lot more home delivery of goods, the cold chain is going to be critical for that and pharmaceuticals, and we're working on some telematics and other, what we believe to be quite cutting-edge innovative solutions to really connect the entire cold chain. So we think we can play a real pivotal role in the new normal."

As we get sales consistently in mid single-digit range and we get EPS at the high single-digit rate, and we get cash flow about equal to net income. 
We know that, that consistent track record of performance will have a significant impact on the overall valuation of Carrier, and then we're playing from a position of strength. So our number one priority is focus on execution. Our number two priority is to really take a very dispassionate look at our current portfolio. And of course, we've been doing that since for quite some time. And we said that we would put our current portfolio through a very specific set of criteria, are we the rightful owner? Does it strategically fit? Does it meet the financial criteria that we've set out for ourselves? And if it doesn't, we'll be dispassionate and do the right thing about divesting those parts of the portfolio. I think once you make that decision, you will, of course, have to look at the current environment and decide if you're going to do something like that, when would be the right time. And this is not the -- excuse me, ideal time to do something like that. But we'll look at the right time if there are parts of the portfolio that we decide don't meet the criteria that we've set. And then in terms of the third category, overall, more strategic types of transactions that is not our priority right now. We know that our peers have made themselves more pure plays SFE.

So I would expect that we should be coming out of this as we increment back up at a similar rate, 28%, give or take 1% or 2%."

The one piece of good news is that our sequential backlog in the first quarter was up, it was up about 6% in HVAC and about 1/3 of that in resi and 2/3 in commercial HVAC. So the backlog position did improve in the first quarter. We look at -- to the extent that there's any shift from the left to the right, it's really -- we think it's going to be relatively minor. We're talking a month here and there. We feel that there are some construction sites that are -- once they come back on, there's going to be really some pent-up man. What we -- our experience in China was this, was that after folks came back from the Lunar New Year, that was factories were allowed to open February 10. Basically, all of our factories, they were generally online as you got into that [ February '20 ] time frame. And we started -- we had the backlog and we started to ship the backlog. What followed was a lot of the construction sites that had the migrant workers in China, they were quarantined a little bit longer. And then they started to receive the backlog. And then that was followed by new orders ticking up as we got into April. And we think it will be a similar phenomenon is that as the construction sites come back on-site -- back online in the U.S. and Europe, they'll start to take delivery of the backlog there may be some push out a month here or there. But frankly, some of -- some places like universities or education has been taking this opportunity with folks out to actually accelerate some of the construction. So some is being accelerated. Some will naturally get pushed out. But where it gets pushed out, we're talking maybe weeks or a month or 2 here, it's not going to be significant."

You think fires a much bigger piece than the security piece. And there's a piece of the fire that's regulatory in nature. If you look at we look at the Fire & Security portfolio in 2 aspects. There's the products piece and then there's the Chubb piece. Products is about 60%. Chubb is about 40%. within the 40% that's chubb, you have a monitoring and installation and a services piece. And the services piece is where you do see some regulatory and that has generally held up during this downturn better than the installation piece, which got hit pretty hard in the March time frame into April, especially in Europe. 
On the product side, some of our businesses like Edwards, that's held up quite well because there is a regulatory piece of that. And we've actually seen we actually saw growth increases in parts of our Edwards business and others that, like GST, where we have a regulatory piece in China. Some of the security portfolio is less regulatory in nature. But what's interesting there is we are starting to see a lot more demand for some of our products that are going to be critical in this new normal. So as hotels start to think about how they're going to gear up in the new normal. We're in discussions with a number of them with our Onity system where folks can bypass the front desk, go directly to their room. And use more touchless type applications. We're seeing that with real estate brokers for our super business. So even though it's not regulatory, some parts of the security portfolio could be quite compelling. In the new normal, and we're in some pretty interesting discussions as folks -- as some of our key customers gear up for the new normal."

Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. I hope that you and your families are all healthy and safe. Our thoughts go out to everyone affected by this crisis, and our thanks go to the front line workers who are fighting this pandemic. I would also like to recognize the incredible efforts of our entire team at Carrier, which has continued to deliver essential products and services to our customers during these challenging times. I have been so impressed with our 53,000 employees. They have stepped up in a truly profound way, and I couldn't be more proud of this phenomenal team. 
Clearly, a lot has changed since we last spoke to you in February. Therefore, we are going to structure our comments as follows: first, I'll take you through the impact that COVID-19 is having on our business and how we are addressing these dynamics head on. Tim will then run you through our first quarter financials as well as provide more detail on our approach to managing our liquidity, cash and balance sheet. And then I'll provide more color on the remainder of 2020. 
Starting with Slide 2. In response to COVID-19, we jumped in a gear early and aggressively. We started daily leadership team meetings that continue today, and we established 4 priorities that have guided our decision-making. 
Our first priority is the safety of our employees. Our office employees are generally working remotely while our factory personnel have largely continued in the workplace to support our customers given the critical nature of our products and services. 
In our factories, we have gone to tremendous lengths to keep our people safe by implementing an extensive range of safety protocols, and we are now applying those best practices to our offices as we begin to transition office employees back to the workplace. 
Our second priority has been to maintain business continuity to deliver essential products and services to our customers. Like other manufacturers, we did experience temporary closures in some of our 49 factories. 
In China, where we have 9 factories and about 1,300 suppliers, all of our sites were operational within a couple of weeks after the February 10th reopening after the Lunar New Year, and our output from our sites -- from our local suppliers has been close to 100% for the past month. We have had short-term factory closures in India, Malaysia, Mexico, the EU and the U.S., but our team has done a superb job of minimizing the length of the occasional site closures and supporting our customers. 
While we continue to experience episodic supplier challenges, our supply chain team has been managing these issues as they arise. Our third priority is to effectively manage our costs and preserve cash. Tim will cover this topic in more detail, but I'm pleased with our proactive approach and early results. 
We accelerated and increased savings through Carrier 600, which is our plan to eliminate $600 million in cost over 3 years. Between our overdrive expectations on Carrier 600 for this year, together with other onetime cost actions, we will be driving $425 million in cost actions this year. For example, we have implemented a 15% pay cut for our senior leadership team, including myself, reduce the Board of Director pay, instituted a 15-day furlough, suspended merit increases. We're driving down expected incremental public company costs by about $25 million for the year, and we are aggressively managing our discretionary spend. 
We will also be reducing our CapEx from our initial plan of $350 million to $400 million to $200 million to $225 million. Though we are aggressively containing spend, we continue to invest in areas that are critical to our growth agenda, including R&D, sales and digital, all critical to our core strategy to get to sustained mid-single-digit growth levels. 
On the cash side, we are comfortable with our liquidity position. We started with $1.3 billion in cash on April 3, and we are confident in our ability to generate more than $1 billion in free cash flow this year. We have access to a $2 billion revolver if needed. So we have a strong cash position and are carefully managing it. 
Finally, our fourth priority has been to ensure that we emerge from this pandemic stronger by accelerating implementation of our strategic imperatives. And I'll give you more color on that on the next slide. So turning to Slide 3. 
It highlights how we're positioning Carrier for long-term success. Starting with our organization culture of focus and values. This truly is a new Carrier with a very different feel to it, both internally and externally. We recently launched The Carrier Way, which lays out our vision, values and behaviors. Our culture is focused on customers, winning, growth, agility, innovation and empowerment. We are breaking down barriers to enable our people to be more externally focused and empowering them to drive our long-term growth agenda. 
On people, we have made great progress in assembling a world-class leadership team with both external hires and promotions of internal talent. We launched the new Carrier operating system, which is both nimble and disciplined, and we are doubling down on our ESG commitments with a laser focus on our commitment to the environment through not only our own factories, but also more innovative energy-efficient products. And we've supplemented our focus on the environment with initiatives that support the needs of our communities by playing our part in the fight against this pandemic. 
For example, we designed and produced our new  OptiClean negative air machines in just a few weeks, and early feedback from the hospitals on our prototype units is very positive. 
Turning to our strategy and growth pillars. These remain unchanged. We continue to deliver against our 3 strategic top line priorities funded by Carrier 600. In the first pillar, growing our core, we remain well positioned within each of our segments building off of our #1 or 2 market positions. We are also adding 500 net sales employees, while we continue to make key strategic R&D and digital investments. 
We've had significant wins across the portfolio, including our largest order ever of 19DV chillers for data centers in Indonesia, an exclusive long-term resi deal with Fischer Homes in the U.S., and very significant wins across our refrigeration and F&S portfolios. 
In our second pillar, extending our products and geographic coverage, as a vote of confidence in our CO2 technology that we're using to enter warehouse refrigeration, we were selected to provide the cooling for the Beijing Olympics ice rink, and we secured a VRF win for the Sanya Olympic village apartments in China for 3,500 heat pumps and 1,000 condensing units. 
And in the third pillar, driving aftermarket and digital, we have a dedicated aftermarket team in place. We indicated that we'd get to a 30% conversion rate in commercial HVAC by the end of next year, and we are on track to do so this year. We're rolling out structured tiered offerings customized that customers' needs, and we have leaned forward on digital as a differentiator through remote monitoring, diagnostics and prognostics. 
We've had some key aftermarket wins including a 4-year chiller service agreement with the Hong Kong International Airport for 52 chillers across 17 buildings and support for Tim Hortons China operations that is projected to scale to 1,500 stores over the next 10 years. 
And on the right side of the slide, we're very proud of our essential and vital role in society. We support air conditioning systems and hospitals and nursing homes and the delivery of food and pharmaceuticals safely around the world. Looking ahead, as countries and regions around the world are preparing to reopen economies in society, we intend to play a critical role in anticipating and creating the new normal. For example, indoor air quality will be critical. We're putting the V back in HVAC, and our unique electrostatic systems can filter microscopic-size contaminants. Carrier will be a leader in transitioning buildings around the world from sick to healthy buildings. Adjusting food safety in the new normal will be paramount, and we have been making tremendous progress on holistic cold chain solutions. 
In our Fire & Security business, touchless and traceability will be very thematic in the future. With our touchless BlueDiamond solution, we can eliminate 80% of typical contact points in an office building by enabling employees to use their cellphones instead. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Tim to discuss 1Q cost and cash, and I'll come back to discuss our best sense of 2020. Tim?"

Please turn to Slide 4, where I will walk you through our Q1 results. But before I start, I want to point out that as we move from being a division of United Technologies to becoming a fully independent public company, some",1552,"Thank you, Dave. Good morning. Please turn to Slide 4, where I will walk you through our Q1 results. But before I start, I want to point out that as we move from being a division of United Technologies to becoming a fully independent public company, some of the numbers we report will not have a perfect comparison with last year's. The Form-10 carve-out statements adjusted for that in some circumstances, but not all. We'll try to help you understand those noncomparables with explanations, but it may be a bit messy and will continue to be so for the remainder of the year. With that caveat, let me jump into the results for our first quarter. 
Despite significant macroeconomic headwinds in the back half of the quarter, it started out about how we had expected and reflected a solid start to the year. Sales of $3.9 billion were down 10% from last year, 9% organically, which adjusts for a 1% FX headwind. We reported at Investor Day that we faced difficult year-on-year comparisons in each of our 3 segments. In HVAC, our residential results last year reflected a strong furnace season due to abnormally high shipments ahead of a new FER regulation. In Refrigeration, our North America truck and trailer business came off a cyclical peak in Q1 last year. And in F&S, we wound down our residential intrusion business, creating a year-on-year decline in 2020. 
Additional pressure came from the warm winter this year and resulting softness in residential furnace sales. These items accounted for about half of our Q1 decline. The remainder resulted from the impact of COVID-19 on our business in the latter part of the quarter. It first hit China, where about 8% or $1.5 billion of our revenues are derived. This had a material detrimental effect, with domestic China sales down approximately 40%. And in addition, a good part of our global factory production and supply chain sources come from China. We did, however, manage through that disruption without a material impact on our rest of world business. But then later in the quarter, the virus moved west into Europe and then on to the Americas. This pandemic accounted for about $230 million of our revenue decline in the quarter. Our teams have worked tirelessly to keep factories operational and productive to serve our customers around the world. And they continue to do so. 
Moving down the P&L. GAAP operating profit was $315 million. Adjusted operating profit of $436 million was down 16% from last year. But this adjusted number is still not comparable. Our Q1 included about $24 million of public company costs that were not included in the same quarter of 2019. Absent the impact of that, the comparable year-on-year decline was 12%. And of course, it was heavily impacted by COVID-19. While we're not happy about the negative signs here, a 12% decline for comparable adjusted operating profits versus a 9% decline in organic revenues shows we were able to offset a lot of the typical decrementals, largely preserving our operating margin. Our Q1 GAAP EPS was $0.11, and adjusted EPS was $0.35. Since we were not a public company last year, the year-over-year comparisons of EPS are not meaningful. 
I'm pleased to report that our free cash flow was favorable to last year by over $200 million. Q1 is typically a seasonal user of cash, so bringing it in almost flat reflected a solid start to the year. The decline in net income was more than offset by favorable working capital results and aided by some deferred tax payments. All things considered, our performance in the first quarter was solid with good mitigation of very difficult environment. Let's now look at how the segments performed. Please turn to Slide 5. 
HVAC was down 9% organically. Within it, North America residential was down 11% organically, with roughly half the decline due to last year's FER-driven accelerated gas furnace shipments, and the other half to slow shipments this year due to the unseasonably warm winter. Overall, furnace sales were down 30% year-over-year. The commercial business was down 8% organically, as a 5% decline in light commercial and 20% decline in applied, driven by weakness in China and Europe that was only partially offset by a flattish services business and strength in ALC and  NORESCO. Refrigeration sales were down 14% organically, with North America truck/trailer down close to 30%, Europe truck/trailer down around 15% and container down around 7%. 
A difficult truck/trailer comparison for the quarter was expected, as I mentioned earlier, but the results did deteriorate as the quarter progressed. Commercial refrigeration was down 13% organically, with weakness in both Europe and Asia. The Fire & Security segment was down 5% organically, with the products business down 4% organically. This was attributable to COVID-related project delays and shutdowns in Asia and Europe, but was partially offset by growth in our longer-cycle businesses, water mist and gas suppression, and also growth in global access solutions. 
The field business was down 5% organically due to March lockdowns across regions, with particular weakness in Hong Kong, Australasia and France. In this world of uncertainty, we're focused on controlling the controllables, and that includes aggressive cost containment actions. 
Slide 6 provides a breakdown of our cost programs. In February, we told you that we expected to achieve $175 million of savings from our Carrier 600 this year, and that we would invest $150 million of that back into the business to support our growth strategies. The current environment shifted some of our priorities to aggressively reduce cost, yet to preserve critical investment initiatives. The actions that we're taking are expected to generate $425 million of cost improvement this year, including accelerating Carrier 600, reducing our planned investments, and implementing an aggressive cost containment program. First, we will accelerate Carrier 600 and expect to deliver an additional $50 million in 2020 for a total of $225 million. Second, we have scaled back our investments in the year by $75 million in a very surgical manner. We are preserving the investments and initiatives that are most critical to our growth strategy to ensure we are well positioned as we exit this crisis. We have also initiated a $300 million cost containment program for 2020. Lastly, while COVID-19 affects volume and the drop-through of margins, it also disrupts our factories and other areas of our cost base. We're anticipating a $200 million nonrecurring headwind this year on things like factory absorption, supply chain disruption, expediting costs and inefficiencies caused by precautions for the safety of our employees. 
The $425 million of cost actions more than offset this impact and our net savings are $250 million, up from the $25 million we laid out at Investor Day in February. Dave mentioned our top priorities for 2020, one of which is to maintain ample liquidity. Please turn to Slide 7, and I'll walk you through that. 
I mentioned earlier that we performed well from a cash flow standpoint in a quarter that is typically a big user of cash. Our working capital usually seasonally spikes in Q1 as we start building for the spring/summer selling season. We managed it tightly this year and delivered better cash than planned by over $200 million. We started the quarter with a cash position of $952 million and ended it with a balance of $768 million. This resulted from a neutral free cash flow and a use of $184 million from other investing and financing activities, including a small debt repayment and the effect of foreign exchange. And at spin, UTC returned us approximately $560 million of cash, so our opening balance sheet started with just over $1.3 billion on April 3. From this base, we will continue our efforts to preserve and enhance our liquidity. We will intensify our focus on all the components and levers available to us. This will include tightly managing working capital, expanding and driving the program we began in Q1. We have also done a deep scrub of our CapEx budget for the year and cut it by 40% to 50%. It is now $200 million to $225 million, down from the $350 million to $400 million we had originally planned. In paring it back, we have prioritized those projects targeted at our strategic priorities for growth and those projects which have high returns and a quick payback. We will also assess the timing and amount of a dividend. Our Form-10 identified a possible dividend scenario that was appropriate at the time, but the environment we face today is much different from what it was then. 
With this foundation and these actions, we expect good free cash flow for the year, and it will add to our available cash. In addition to our cash position, we have a $2 billion revolving credit agreement with a strong bank group. That revolver remains undrawn and fully available to us. And finally, I will remind you that we have no debt maturities until 2023. So we feel quite good about our liquidity and are confident we have access to the capital we need to weather the storm and to operate and grow the business. 
With that, let me turn it back over to Dave to discuss how we're thinking about the balance of the year."

So what does this mean for our expectations for the full year? For our scenario planning in this uncertain global economy, we looked at 3 key indicators to frame our thinking: first, macroeconomic projections like GDP; second, indicators more",762,"Thanks, Tim. So what does this mean for our expectations for the full year? For our scenario planning in this uncertain global economy, we looked at 3 key indicators to frame our thinking: first, macroeconomic projections like GDP; second, indicators more directly tied to our business like new housing starts; and third, order trends. At a macro level, starting with GDP, our current guidepost for 2020 assume U.S. GDP declines about 25% in the second quarter and 5% to 10% for the full year. Expectations for Europe are similar. We assume China shows growth in Q2 and accelerates from there. When we look at macro indicators specific to our segments, we assume headwinds from lower replacement volumes as unemployment rates impact homeowner purchases, U.S. housing starts being down 10% to 20% this year and continued softness in non-resi construction starts in North America and Europe as we see from leading indicators like the Architectural Billings Index. 
And in our Refrigeration business, the forecast declines in North America and Europe truck/trailer will be even steeper than we had originally forecast. ACT forecasts North American truck/trailer production to be down 45% this year and European truck/trailer is likely to be down 20% to 30%. Container drops are likely to be far more muted. So then on Page 8, let me share some color with you on orders. 
We start with our China experience. Q1 orders were down 40% year-over-year, with February being the lowest month, down 50%. In the category of good news, the China recovery has been very positive. Our daily order rates returned to precrisis levels in mid-April, and our April orders in China were flat overall. The recovery has been a bit spotty and 1 month doesn't make a trend. But for us, China has declined and then its recovery were both quite steep. Our current thinking about the U.S. and EU is that the decline will be a bit shallower, but the recovery will be longer. 
For us, orders declined earlier in the EU than in the U.S., but we also expect an early recovery. Orders in 1Q were down 10% in Europe, but were down 5% in the U.S., and that accelerated into April with Europe down 30% and the U.S. down 25%. Based on a slower recovery in the EU and U.S. versus China, our internal planning assumes recovery of orders to more typical levels as we get into later 3Q and early Q4. 
So what does this all mean as we frame 2020? Turning to Slide 9. You could think of the numbers that you see here as guidepost as we look at various scenarios playing out globally. We see sales between $15 billion and $17 billion, adjusted op profit between $1.7 billion and $2 billion, and free cash flow over $1 billion. Also, with respect to the scenarios behind the sales decline for the whole company, you should think about the HVAC segment decline fairly aligned with the percentage range that you see here, with Refrigeration facing a bit more headwind and F&S is expected to be a bit at the better end of the range. Given that 80% of our sales are in the U.S. and Europe, we expect the steepest declines to occur in 2Q with improvements from there. So we have done our best to analyze the rest of the year for ourselves and for you, and we will continue to update you as this very fluid situation evolves. And though the coming months are inherently uncertain, what I do know with great confidence is that we'll get through this crisis. And over the long term, megatrends such as climate change, global urbanization and the shift towards digitalization and operating in the new normal will remain tailwinds for our business. And this takes me to our last page on Page 10. 
We remain confident that the game plan that we laid out for you on February 10 will drive the results that you see here. We are getting real traction on the 3 pillars of our top line strategy, which will propel sustained mid-single-digit top line growth. We are tenaciously driving Carrier 600 to invest in growth and to help drive margin expansion to enable high single-digit EPS growth on a steady state basis. And we are laser-focused on driving working capital improvements needed to support free cash flow equal to net income. We have a clear road map to success. We remain committed to executing on our plan with urgency, conviction and effectiveness. 
And with that, we'll open us up for questions."

But we do think there's going to be a little bit more price challenges in the overall system, but we're still looking at some net tailwind from price. And then Tim took you through the cost side, we're going to be very aggressive. You saw that we upped our Carrier 600 for this year from $175 million to $225 million. We're being very aggressive, especially on the supply chain side, where we got some tailwind from commodity pricing, but a lot of aggressiveness on the negotiations and resourcing activity. And we're also fairly seeing a lot of headwind in the factory productivity. But we are really going after G&A in this climate."

But unfortunately, in this environment, we talk about decrementals. That's about 28%. What you saw in the first quarter actually was much favorable to that, but that was largely because we had the better part of 10 percentage points worth of benefit from cost reduction in the quarter, about $40 million lower cost, and that contributed to a much lower drop-through. And interestingly, our sales in China were hit during the quarter, the hardest of ours, and China tends to carry lower general margins through, and we benefited by about 4%. So that's why you see the 14%. You actually may not see the 14%, you may see a 19%. But remember, we talked about a $24 million stand-alone cost. That's the first quarter component of the $107 million that you ultimately see for the full year. 
I will also point out that I think you may have seen from UTC's release yesterday numbers that are a little bit different. They have about $20 million difference in profits. So if you adjust for that, there are some unusual things where it was different from us to them, they may have -- you may have construed at 24% from them. 
As we think about the rest of the year, again, going back to the 28%. Yes, I would say second quarter is likely to be the hardest hit quarter. And the deeper the drop in revenues, it makes it difficult. We aren't just scaling back production. We're shutting the lines down. We're closing shifts. We're, in some cases, closing factories and you go deeper in to the cost pool there. And I would expect that to be in the second quarter. We will experience some mix degradation. The reverse of what you saw, I mean, some of our higher-margin businesses, the residential HVAC and others will be hit. How I simply think about rest of year decrementals, though, is that we have -- we'll be hit by 2 or 3 points with JV income because there's no offsetting revenue component to the drop in earnings that we're anticipating. And then all other of the cost, the factory disruption, et cetera, is largely covered -- that and the margin mix is covered by our cost reduction. So we anticipate, if you look at the projections, we'll probably be about 30%, couple of points worse than the normal 28%."

Actually, it's absolutely underway. We've been in discussions, and we've actually seen real progress with customers, whether it's the State of Florida or with hospitals where we've distributed our new OptiClean negative air machines. We're coming out of the gates fast on this one because we believe it's critical not only for our business, but it's critical for society. There are a shockingly number -- high number of sick buildings out there. And one of the characteristics of a sick building is the ventilation system. When you look at the room I'm in right now, you would expect a certain number of air changes per hour, say, in the 10 to 15 range. And many buildings around the world have stagnant air and they don't have the number of changes per hour. When you look at the filtration system in many buildings as you have the return air going to through a filtration system, you'd expect it to be able to filter out contaminants at a 0.1, 0.3 micron level, and many filtration systems don't have that. We have that with our electric static filters for homes, UAV or HEPA filters in commercial buildings. Many buildings don't have that. You want your ducts cleaned every 3 to 5 years, and that doesn't happen. So as we look at the transition to healthy buildings, I think you should expect that Carrier is going to be front and center on that. It's very real. And it's the same in our other 2 segments. 
You mentioned touchless. In our Fire & Security business, we already have a BlueDiamond app that can eliminate a lot of the touch points as, say, you go from your car to your office building, there's usually 8 to 10 touch points. And like I said in the earlier remarks, we can eliminate 80% of that as you go to open the turnstile or you press the elevator button or you adjust the HVAC controls in your office or on your floor. There's a number of touch points that we can eliminate that are going to be critical. And it also is combined with the traceability element. So as employers want to be able in the workplace to trace folks, we have an app that can co-mingle with the other parts of the app to be able to track people in the workplace. 
And the other segment that we have in our refrigeration business, the entire cold chain is going to be just foundationally and fundamentally different. So you look at how people get their food today in a place like China, and there's a significant number of wet markets, and we have farmers' markets here in the U.S. and in Europe. But you're going to see a lot more home delivery of goods. The cold chain is going to be critical for that and pharmaceuticals, and we're working on some telematics and other what we believe to be quite cutting-edge innovative solutions to really connect the entire cold chain. So we think we can play a real pivotal role in the new normal."

We really feel very strongly that we can unleash tremendous value just by doing what we said we were going to do. As we get sales consistently in mid-single-digit range and we get EPS at the high single-digit rate, and we get cash flow about equal to net income. 
We know that, that consistent track record of performance will have a significant impact on the overall valuation of Carrier, and then we're playing from a position of strength. So our #1 priority is focus on execution. Our #2 priority is to really take a very dispassionate look at our current portfolio. And of course, we've been doing that since for quite some time. And we said that we would put our current portfolio through a very specific set of criteria. Are we the rightful owner? Does it strategically fit? Does it meet the financial criteria that we've set out for ourselves? And if it doesn't, we'll be dispassionate and do the right thing about divesting those parts of the portfolio. I think once you make that decision, you will, of course, have to look at the current environment and decide if you're going to do something like that, when would be the right time. And this is not the ideal time to do something like that. But we'll look at the right time if there are parts of the portfolio that we decide don't meet the criteria that we've set. 
And then in terms of the third category, overall, more strategic types of transactions. That is not our priority right now. We know that our peers have made themselves more pure plays, as have we. But our focus right now is on that first category of execution, then on the second category of the real portfolio analysis that we've been going through. And we'll deal with that second."

We look at -- to the extent that there's any shift from the left to the right, it's really -- we think it's going to be relatively minor. We're talking a month here and there. We feel that there are some construction sites that are -- once they come back on, there's going to be really some pent-up demand. 
What we -- our experience in China was this, was that after folks came back from the Lunar New Year, that was factories were allowed to open February 10. Basically, all of our factories, they were generally online as you got into that February 20 time frame. And we started -- we had the backlog and we started to ship the backlog. What followed was a lot of the construction sites that had the migrant workers in China, they were quarantined a little bit longer. And then they started to receive the backlog. And then that was followed by new orders ticking up as we got into April. And we think it will be a similar phenomenon is that as the construction sites come back on-site -- back online in the U.S. and Europe, they'll start to take delivery of the backlog. There may be some pushout a month here or there. But frankly, some of -- some places like universities or education has been taking this opportunity with folks out to actually accelerate some of the construction. So some is being accelerated. Some will naturally get pushed out. But where it gets pushed out, we're talking maybe weeks or a month or 2 here. It's not going to be significant."

Products is about 60%, Chubb is about 40%. within the 40% that's Chubb, you have a monitoring and installation and a services piece. And the services piece is where you do see some regulatory, and that has generally held up during this downturn better than the installation piece, which got hit pretty hard in the March time frame into April, especially in Europe. 
On the product side, some of our businesses like Edwards, that's held up quite well because there is a regulatory piece of that. And we've actually seen -- we actually saw growth increases in parts of our Edwards business and others that, like GST, where we have a regulatory piece in China. Some of the security portfolio is less regulatory in nature. But what's interesting there is we are starting to see a lot more demand for some of our products that are going to be critical in this new normal. So as hotels start to think about how they're going to gear up in the new normal, we're in discussions with a number of them with our Onity system, where folks can bypass the front desk, go directly to their room and use more touchless type applications. We're seeing that with real estate brokers for our Supra business. So even though it's not regulatory, some parts of the security portfolio could be quite compelling in the new normal.

Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. I hope that you and your families are all healthy and safe. Our thoughts go out to everyone affected by this crisis, and our thanks go to the front line workers who are fighting this pandemic. I would also like to recognize the incredible efforts of our entire team at Carrier, which has continued to deliver essential products and services to our customers during these challenging times. I have been so impressed with our 53,000 employees. They have stepped up in a truly profound way, and I couldn't be more proud of this phenomenal team. 
Clearly, a lot has changed since we last spoke to you in February. Therefore, we are going to structure our comments as follows: first, I'll take you through the impact that COVID-19 is having on our business and how we are addressing these dynamics head on. Tim will then run you through our first quarter financials as well as provide more detail on our approach to managing our liquidity, cash and balance sheet. And then I'll provide more color on the remainder of 2020. 
Starting with Slide 2. In response to COVID-19, we jumped into gear early and aggressively. We started daily leadership team meetings that continue today, and we established 4 priorities that have guided our decision-making. 
Our first priority is the safety of our employees. Our office employees are generally working remotely while our factory personnel have largely continued in the workplace to support our customers given the critical nature of our products and services. 
In our factories, we have gone to tremendous lengths to keep our people safe by implementing an extensive range of safety protocols, and we are now applying those best practices to our offices as we begin to transition office employees back to the workplace. 
Our second priority has been to maintain business continuity to deliver essential products and services to our customers. Like other manufacturers, we did experience temporary closures in some of our 49 factories. 
In China, where we have 9 factories and about 1,300 suppliers, all of our sites were operational within a couple of weeks after the February 10th reopening after the Lunar New Year, and our output from our sites -- from our local suppliers has been close to 100% for the past month. We have had short-term factory closures in India, Malaysia, Mexico, the EU and the U.S., but our team has done a superb job of minimizing the length of the occasional site closures and supporting our customers. 
While we continue to experience episodic supplier challenges, our supply chain team has been managing these issues as they arise. Our third priority is to effectively manage our costs and preserve cash. Tim will cover this topic in more detail, but I'm pleased with our proactive approach and early results. 
We accelerated and increased savings through Carrier 600, which is our plan to eliminate $600 million in cost over 3 years. Between our overdrive expectations on Carrier 600 for this year, together with other onetime cost actions, we will be driving $425 million in cost actions this year. For example, we have implemented a 15% pay cut for our senior leadership team, including myself, reduced the Board of Director pay, instituted a 15-day furlough, suspended merit increases. We're driving down expected incremental public company costs by about $25 million for the year, and we are aggressively managing our discretionary spend. 
We will also be reducing our CapEx from our initial plan of $350 million to $400 million to $200 million to $225 million. Though we are aggressively containing spend, we continue to invest in areas that are critical to our growth agenda, including R&D, sales and digital, all critical to our core strategy to get to sustained mid-single-digit growth levels. 
On the cash side, we are comfortable with our liquidity position. We started with $1.3 billion in cash on April 3, and we are confident in our ability to generate more than $1 billion in free cash flow this year. We have access to a $2 billion revolver if needed. So we have a strong cash position and are carefully managing it. 
Finally, our fourth priority has been to ensure that we emerge from this pandemic stronger by accelerating implementation of our strategic imperatives. And I'll give you more color on that on the next slide. So turning to Slide 3. 
It highlights how we're positioning Carrier for long-term success. Starting with our organization culture of focus and values. This truly is a new Carrier with a very different feel to it, both internally and externally. We recently launched The Carrier Way, which lays out our vision, values and behaviors. Our culture is focused on customers, winning, growth, agility, innovation and empowerment. We are breaking down barriers to enable our people to be more externally focused and empowering them to drive our long-term growth agenda. 
On people, we have made great progress in assembling a world-class leadership team with both external hires and promotions of internal talent. We launched the new Carrier operating system, which is both nimble and disciplined, and we are doubling down on our ESG commitments with a laser focus on our commitment to the environment through not only our own factories, but also more innovative energy-efficient products. And we've supplemented our focus on the environment with initiatives that support the needs of our communities by playing our part in the fight against this pandemic. 
For example, we designed and produced our new  OptiClean negative air machines in just a few weeks, and early feedback from the hospitals on our prototype units is very positive. 
Turning to our strategy and growth pillars. These remain unchanged. We continue to deliver against our 3 strategic top line priorities funded by Carrier 600. In the first pillar, growing our core, we remain well positioned within each of our segments building off of our #1 or 2 market positions. We are also adding 500 net sales employees, while we continue to make key strategic R&D and digital investments. 
We've had significant wins across the portfolio, including our largest order ever of 19DV chillers for data centers in Indonesia, an exclusive long-term resi deal with Fischer Homes in the U.S., and very significant wins across our refrigeration and F&S portfolios. 
In our second pillar, extending our products and geographic coverage, as a vote of confidence in our CO2 technology that we're using to enter warehouse refrigeration, we were selected to provide the cooling for the Beijing Olympics ice rink, and we secured a VRF win for the Sanya Olympic village apartments in China for 3,500 heat pumps and 1,000 condensing units. 
And in the third pillar, driving aftermarket and digital, we have a dedicated aftermarket team in place. We indicated that we'd get to a 30% conversion rate in commercial HVAC by the end of next year, and we are on track to do so this year. We're rolling out structured tiered offerings customized to customers' needs, and we have leaned forward on digital as a differentiator through remote monitoring, diagnostics and prognostics. 
We've had some key aftermarket wins including a 4-year chiller service agreement with the Hong Kong International Airport for 52 chillers across 17 buildings and support for Tim Hortons China operations that is projected to scale to 1,500 stores over the next 10 years. 
And on the right side of the slide, we're very proud of our essential and vital role in society. We support air conditioning systems and hospitals and nursing homes and the delivery of food and pharmaceuticals safely around the world. Looking ahead, as countries and regions around the world are preparing to reopen economies in society, we intend to play a critical role in anticipating and creating the new normal. For example, indoor air quality will be critical. We're putting the V back in HVAC, and our unique electrostatic systems can filter microscopic-size contaminants. Carrier will be a leader in transitioning buildings around the world from sick to healthy buildings. Adjusting food safety in the new normal will be paramount, and we have been making tremendous progress on holistic cold chain solutions. 
In our Fire & Security business, touchless and traceability will be very thematic in the future. With our touchless BlueDiamond solution, we can eliminate 80% of typical contact points in an office building by enabling employees to use their cellphones instead. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Tim to discuss 1Q cost and cash, and I'll come back to discuss our best sense of 2020. Tim?"

Please turn to Slide 4, where I will walk you through our Q1 results. But before I start, I want to point out that as we move from being a division of United Technologies to becoming a fully independent public company, some",1553,"Thank you, Dave. Good morning. Please turn to Slide 4, where I will walk you through our Q1 results. But before I start, I want to point out that as we move from being a division of United Technologies to becoming a fully independent public company, some of the numbers we report will not have a perfect comparison with last year's. The Form-10 carve-out statements adjusted for that in some circumstances, but not all. We'll try to help you understand those noncomparables with explanations, but it may be a bit messy and will continue to be so for the remainder of the year. With that caveat, let me jump into the results for our first quarter. 
Despite significant macroeconomic headwinds in the back half of the quarter, it started out about how we had expected and reflected a solid start to the year. Sales of $3.9 billion were down 10% from last year, 9% organically, which adjusts for a 1% FX headwind. We reported at Investor Day that we faced difficult year-on-year comparisons in each of our 3 segments. In HVAC, our residential results last year reflected a strong furnace season due to abnormally high shipments ahead of a new FER regulation. In Refrigeration, our North America truck and trailer business came off a cyclical peak in Q1 last year. And in F&S, we wound down our residential intrusion business, creating a year-on-year decline in 2020. 
Additional pressure came from the warm winter this year and resulting softness in residential furnace sales. These items accounted for about half of our Q1 decline. The remainder resulted from the impact of COVID-19 on our business in the latter part of the quarter. It first hit China, where about 8% or $1.5 billion of our revenues are derived. This had a material detrimental effect, with domestic China sales down approximately 40%. And in addition, a good part of our global factory production and supply chain sources come from China. We did, however, manage through that disruption without a material impact on our rest of world business. But then later in the quarter, the virus moved west into Europe and then on to the Americas. This pandemic accounted for about $230 million of our revenue decline in the quarter. Our teams have worked tirelessly to keep factories operational and productive to serve our customers around the world. And they continue to do so. 
Moving down the P&L. GAAP operating profit was $315 million. Adjusted operating profit of $436 million was down 16% from last year. But this adjusted number is still not comparable. Our Q1 included about $24 million of public company costs that were not included in the same quarter of 2019. Absent the impact of that, the comparable year-on-year decline was 12%. And of course, it was heavily impacted by COVID-19. While we're not happy about the negative signs here, a 12% decline for comparable adjusted operating profits versus a 9% decline in organic revenues shows we were able to offset a lot of the typical decrementals, largely preserving our operating margin. Our Q1 GAAP EPS was $0.11, and adjusted EPS was $0.35. Since we were not a public company last year, the year-over-year comparisons of EPS are not meaningful. 
I'm pleased to report that our free cash flow was favorable to last year by over $200 million. Q1 is typically a seasonal user of cash, so bringing it in almost flat reflected a solid start to the year. The decline in net income was more than offset by favorable working capital results and aided by some deferred tax payments. All things considered, our performance in the first quarter was solid with good mitigation of a very difficult environment. Let's now look at how the segments performed. Please turn to Slide 5. 
HVAC was down 9% organically. Within it, North America residential was down 11% organically, with roughly half the decline due to last year's FER-driven accelerated gas furnace shipments, and the other half to slow shipments this year due to the unseasonably warm winter. Overall, furnace sales were down 30% year-over-year. The commercial business was down 8% organically, as a 5% decline in light commercial and 20% decline in applied, driven by weakness in China and Europe that was only partially offset by a flattish services business and strength in ALC and  NORESCO. Refrigeration sales were down 14% organically, with North America truck/trailer down close to 30%, Europe truck/trailer down around 15% and container down around 7%. 
A difficult truck/trailer comparison for the quarter was expected, as I mentioned earlier, but the results did deteriorate as the quarter progressed. Commercial refrigeration was down 13% organically, with weakness in both Europe and Asia. The Fire & Security segment was down 5% organically, with the products business down 4% organically. This was attributable to COVID-related project delays and shutdowns in Asia and Europe, but was partially offset by growth in our longer-cycle businesses, water mist and gas suppression, and also growth in global access solutions. 
The field business was down 5% organically due to March lockdowns across regions, with particular weakness in Hong Kong, Australasia and France. In this world of uncertainty, we're focused on controlling the controllables, and that includes aggressive cost containment actions. 
Slide 6 provides a breakdown of our cost programs. In February, we told you that we expected to achieve $175 million of savings from our Carrier 600 this year, and that we would invest $150 million of that back into the business to support our growth strategies. The current environment shifted some of our priorities to aggressively reduce cost, yet to preserve critical investment initiatives. The actions that we're taking are expected to generate $425 million of cost improvement this year, including accelerating Carrier 600, reducing our planned investments, and implementing an aggressive cost containment program. First, we will accelerate Carrier 600 and expect to deliver an additional $50 million in 2020 for a total of $225 million. Second, we have scaled back our investments in the year by $75 million in a very surgical manner. We are preserving the investments and initiatives that are most critical to our growth strategy to ensure we are well positioned as we exit this crisis. We have also initiated a $300 million cost containment program for 2020. Lastly, while COVID-19 affects volume and the drop-through of margins, it also disrupts our factories and other areas of our cost base. We're anticipating a $200 million nonrecurring headwind this year on things like factory absorption, supply chain disruption, expediting costs and inefficiencies caused by precautions for the safety of our employees. 
The $425 million of cost actions more than offsets this impact and our net savings are $250 million, up from the $25 million we laid out at Investor Day in February. Dave mentioned our top priorities for 2020, one of which is to maintain ample liquidity. Please turn to Slide 7, and I'll walk you through that. 
I mentioned earlier that we performed well from a cash flow standpoint in a quarter that is typically a big user of cash. Our working capital usually seasonally spikes in Q1 as we start building for the spring/summer selling season. We managed it tightly this year and delivered better cash than planned by over $200 million. We started the quarter with a cash position of $952 million and ended it with a balance of $768 million. This resulted from a neutral free cash flow and a use of $184 million from other investing and financing activities, including a small debt repayment and the effect of foreign exchange. And at spin, UTC returned us approximately $560 million of cash, so our opening balance sheet started with just over $1.3 billion on April 3. From this base, we will continue our efforts to preserve and enhance our liquidity. We will intensify our focus on all the components and levers available to us. This will include tightly managing working capital, expanding and driving the program we began in Q1. We have also done a deep scrub of our CapEx budget for the year and cut it by 40% to 50%. It is now $200 million to $225 million, down from the $350 million to $400 million we had originally planned. In paring it back, we have prioritized those projects targeted at our strategic priorities for growth and those projects which have high returns and a quick payback. We will also assess the timing and amount of a dividend. Our Form-10 identified a possible dividend scenario that was appropriate at the time, but the environment we face today is much different from what it was then. 
With this foundation and these actions, we expect good free cash flow for the year, and it will add to our available cash. In addition to our cash position, we have a $2 billion revolving credit agreement with a strong bank group. That revolver remains undrawn and fully available to us. And finally, I will remind you that we have no debt maturities until 2023. So we feel quite good about our liquidity and are confident we have access to the capital we need to weather the storm and to operate and grow the business. 
With that, let me turn it back over to Dave to discuss how we're thinking about the balance of the year."

So what does this mean for our expectations for the full year? For our scenario planning in this uncertain global economy, we looked at 3 key indicators to frame our thinking: first, macroeconomic projections like GDP; second, indicators more",761,"Thanks, Tim. So what does this mean for our expectations for the full year? For our scenario planning in this uncertain global economy, we looked at 3 key indicators to frame our thinking: first, macroeconomic projections like GDP; second, indicators more directly tied to our business like new housing starts; and third, order trends. At a macro level, starting with GDP, our current guidepost for 2020 assume U.S. GDP declines about 25% in the second quarter and 5% to 10% for the full year. Expectations for Europe are similar. We assume China shows growth in Q2 and accelerates from there. When we look at macro indicators specific to our segments, we assume headwinds from lower replacement volumes as unemployment rates impact homeowner purchases, U.S. housing starts being down 10% to 20% this year and continued softness in non-resi construction starts in North America and Europe as we see from leading indicators like the Architectural Billings Index. 
And in our Refrigeration business, the forecast declines in North America and Europe truck/trailer will be even steeper than we had originally forecast. ACT forecasts North American truck/trailer production to be down 45% this year and European truck/trailer is likely to be down 20% to 30%. Container drops are likely to be far more muted. So then on Page 8, let me share some color with you on orders. 
We start with our China experience. Q1 orders were down 40% year-over-year, with February being the lowest month, down 50%. In the category of good news, the China recovery has been very positive. Our daily order rates returned to precrisis levels in mid-April, and our April orders in China were flat overall. The recovery has been a bit spotty and 1 month doesn't make a trend. But for us, China's decline and then its recovery were both quite steep. Our current thinking about the U.S. and EU is that the decline will be a bit shallower, but the recovery will be longer. 
For us, orders declined earlier in the EU than in the U.S., but we also expect an early recovery. Orders in 1Q were down 10% in Europe, but were down 5% in the U.S., and that accelerated into April with Europe down 30% and the U.S. down 25%. Based on a slower recovery in the EU and U.S. versus China, our internal planning assumes recovery of orders to more typical levels as we get into later 3Q and early Q4. 
So what does this all mean as we frame 2020? Turning to Slide 9. You could think of the numbers that you see here as guideposts as we look at various scenarios playing out globally. We see sales between $15 billion and $17 billion, adjusted op profit between $1.7 billion and $2 billion, and free cash flow over $1 billion. Also, with respect to the scenarios behind the sales decline for the whole company, you should think about the HVAC segment decline fairly aligned with the percentage range that you see here, with Refrigeration facing a bit more headwind and F&S is expected to be a bit at the better end of the range. Given that 80% of our sales are in the U.S. and Europe, we expect the steepest declines to occur in 2Q with improvements from there. So we have done our best to analyze the rest of the year for ourselves and for you, and we will continue to update you as this very fluid situation evolves. And though the coming months are inherently uncertain, what I do know with great confidence is that we'll get through this crisis. And over the long term, megatrends such as climate change, global urbanization and the shift towards digitalization and operating in the new normal will remain tailwinds for our business. And this takes me to our last page on Page 10. 
We remain confident that the game plan that we laid out for you on February 10 will drive the results that you see here. We are getting real traction on the 3 pillars of our top line strategy, which will propel sustained mid-single-digit top line growth. We are tenaciously driving Carrier 600 to invest in growth and to help drive margin expansion to enable high single-digit EPS growth on a steady state basis. And we are laser-focused on driving working capital improvements needed to support free cash flow equal to net income. We have a clear road map to success. We remain committed to executing on our plan with urgency, conviction and effectiveness. 
And with that, we'll open us up for questions."

But we do think there's going to be a little bit more price challenges in the overall system, but we're still looking at some net tailwind from price. And then Tim took you through the cost side, we're going to be very aggressive. You saw that we upped our Carrier 600 for this year from $175 million to $225 million. We're being very aggressive, especially on the supply chain side, where we got some tailwind from commodity pricing, but a lot of aggressiveness on the negotiations and resourcing activity.

Say, as we -- as you know, we usually think of what we call it a drop-through rate decremental. Usually, I like to think of it as incremental. But unfortunately, in this environment, we talk about decrementals. That's about 28%. What you saw in the first quarter actually was much favorable to that, but that was largely because we had the better part of 10 percentage points worth of benefit from cost reduction in the quarter, about $40 million lower cost, and that contributed to a much lower drop-through. And interestingly, our sales in China were hit during the quarter, the hardest of ours, and China tends to carry lower general margins through, and we benefited by about 4%. So that's why you see the 14%. You actually may not see the 14%, you may see a 19%. But remember, we talked about a $24 million stand-alone cost. That's the first quarter component of the $107 million that you ultimately see for the full year. 
I will also point out that I think you may have seen from UTC's release yesterday numbers that are a little bit different. They have about $20 million difference in profits. So if you adjust for that, there are some unusual things where it was different from us to them, they may have -- you may have construed at 24% from them. 
As we think about the rest of the year, again, going back to the 28%. Yes, I would say second quarter is likely to be the hardest hit quarter. And the deeper the drop in revenues, it makes it difficult. We aren't just scaling back production. We're shutting the lines down. We're closing shifts. We're, in some cases, closing factories and you go deeper in to the cost pool there. And I would expect that to be in the second quarter. We will experience some mix degradation. The reverse of what you saw, I mean, some of our higher-margin businesses, the residential HVAC and others will be hit. How I simply think about rest of year decrementals, though, is that we have -- we'll be hit by 2 or 3 points with JV income because there's no offsetting revenue component to the drop in earnings that we're anticipating. And then all other of the cost, the factory disruption, et cetera, is largely covered -- that and the margin mix is covered by our cost reduction. So we anticipate, if you look at the projections, we'll probably be about 30%, couple of points worse than the normal 28%."

Actually, it's absolutely underway. We've been in discussions, and we've actually seen real progress with customers, whether it's the State of Florida or with hospitals where we've distributed our new OptiClean negative air machines. We're coming out of the gates fast on this one because we believe it's critical not only for our business, but it's critical for society. There are a shockingly number -- high number of sick buildings out there. And one of the characteristics of a sick building is the ventilation system. You look at the room I'm in right now, you would expect a certain number of air changes per hour, say, in the 10 to 15 range. And many buildings around the world have stagnant air and they don't have the number of changes per hour. You look at the filtration system in many buildings as you have the return air going to through a filtration system, you'd expect it to be able to filter out contaminants at a 0.1, 0.3 micron level, and many filtration systems don't have that. We have that with our electric static filters for homes, UAV or HEPA filters in commercial buildings. Many buildings don't have that. You want your ducts cleaned every 3 to 5 years, and that doesn't happen. So as we look at the transition to healthy buildings, I think you should expect that Carrier is going to be front and center on that. It's very real. And it's the same in our other 2 segments. 
You mentioned touchless. In our Fire & Security business, we already have a BlueDiamond app that can eliminate a lot of the touch points as, say, you go from your car to your office building, there's usually 8 to 10 touch points. And like I said in the earlier remarks, we can eliminate 80% of that as you go to open the turnstile or you press the elevator button or you adjust the HVAC controls in your office or on your floor. There's a number of touch points that we can eliminate that are going to be critical. And it also is combined with the traceability element. So as employers want to be able in the workplace to trace folks, we have an app that can co-mingle with the other parts of the app to be able to track people in the workplace. 
And the other segment that we have in our refrigeration business, the entire cold chain is going to be just foundationally and fundamentally different. So you look at how people get their food today in a place like China, and there's a significant number of wet markets, and we have wet markets and we have farmers' markets here in the U.S. and in Europe. But you're going to see a lot more home delivery of goods. The cold chain is going to be critical for that and pharmaceuticals, and we're working on some telematics and other what we believe to be quite cutting-edge innovative solutions to really connect the entire cold chain. So we think we can play a real pivotal role in the new normal."

We know that, that consistent track record of performance will have a significant impact on the overall valuation of Carrier, and then we're playing from a position of strength. So our #1 priority is focus on execution. Our #2 priority is to really take a very dispassionate look at our current portfolio. And of course, we've been doing that since for quite some time. And we said that we would put our current portfolio through a very specific set of criteria. Are we the rightful owner? Does it strategically fit? Does it meet the financial criteria that we've set out for ourselves? And if it doesn't, we'll be dispassionate and do the right thing about divesting those parts of the portfolio. I think once you make that decision, you will, of course, have to look at the current environment and decide if you're going to do something like that, when would be the right time. And this is not the ideal time to do something like that. But we'll look at the right time if there are parts of the portfolio that we decide don't meet the criteria that we've set. 
And then in terms of that third category, overall, more strategic types of transactions. That is not our priority right now. We know that our peers have made themselves more pure plays, as have we.

How should we think about exit rate, incrementals being above or below that target number just as some of these temporary costs come back?"

It was up about 6% in HVAC and about 1/3 of that in resi and 2/3 in commercial HVAC. So the backlog position did improve in the first quarter. We look at -- to the extent that there's any shift from the left to the right, it's really -- we think it's going to be relatively minor. We're talking a month here and there. We feel that there are some construction sites that are -- once they come back on, there's going to be really some pent-up demand. 
What we -- our experience in China was this, was that after folks came back from the Lunar New Year, that was factories were allowed to open February 10. Basically, all of our factories, they were generally online as you got into that February 20 time frame. And we started -- we had the backlog and we started to ship the backlog. What followed was a lot of the construction sites that had the migrant workers in China, they were quarantined a little bit longer. And then they started to receive the backlog. And then that was followed by new orders ticking up as we got into April. And we think it will be a similar phenomenon is that as the construction sites come back on-site -- back online in the U.S. and Europe, they'll start to take delivery of the backlog. There may be some pushout a month here or there. But frankly, some of -- some places like universities or education has been taking this opportunity with folks out to actually accelerate some of the construction. So some is being accelerated. Some will naturally get pushed out. But where it gets pushed out, we're talking maybe weeks or a month or 2 here. It's not going to be significant."

This $75 million that we pulled out will be pushed in, likely invested next year, so we'll kind of push out that schedule a little bit. And the $300 million is really onetime actions. It was furloughing most -- all of our salaried employees. It was deferring merit. It was cutting back on. Obviously, it wasn't hard to cut back on travel because there isn't any travel anyway, but it's reducing services, supplies, et cetera.

We look at -- there's a piece of the fire portfolio you think -- fire's a much bigger piece than the security piece. And there's a piece of the fire that's regulatory in nature. If you look at -- we look at the Fire & Security portfolio in 2 aspects. There's the products piece and then there's the Chubb piece. Products is about 60%, Chubb is about 40%. within the 40% that's Chubb, you have a monitoring and installation and a services piece. And the services piece is where you do see some regulatory, and that has generally held up during this downturn better than the installation piece, which got hit pretty hard in the March time frame into April, especially in Europe. 
On the product side, some of our businesses like Edwards, that's held up quite well because there is a regulatory piece of that. And we've actually seen -- we actually saw growth increases in parts of our Edwards business and others that, like GST, where we have a regulatory piece in China. Some of the security portfolio is less regulatory in nature. But what's interesting there is we are starting to see a lot more demand for some of our products that are going to be critical in this new normal. So as hotels start to think about how they're going to gear up in the new normal, we're in discussions with a number of them with our Onity system, where folks can bypass the front desk, go directly to their room and use more touchless type applications. We're seeing that with real estate brokers for our Supra business. So even though it's not regulatory, some parts of the security portfolio could be quite compelling in the new normal. And we're in some pretty interesting discussions as folks -- as some of our key customers gear up for the new normal."

Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. I hope that you and your families are all healthy and safe. Our thoughts go out to everyone affected by this crisis, and our thanks go to the front line workers who are fighting this pandemic. I would also like to recognize the incredible efforts of our entire team at Carrier, which has continued to deliver essential products and services to our customers during these challenging times. I have been so impressed with our 53,000 employees. They have stepped up in a truly profound way, and I couldn't be more proud of this phenomenal team. 
Clearly, a lot has changed since we last spoke to you in February. Therefore, we are going to structure our comments as follows: first, I'll take you through the impact that COVID-19 is having on our business and how we are addressing these dynamics head on. Tim will then run you through our first quarter financials as well as provide more detail on our approach to managing our liquidity, cash and balance sheet. And then I'll provide more color on the remainder of 2020. 
Starting with Slide 2. In response to COVID-19, we jumped into gear early and aggressively. We started daily leadership team meetings that continue today, and we established 4 priorities that have guided our decision-making. 
Our first priority is the safety of our employees. Our office employees are generally working remotely while our factory personnel have largely continued in the workplace to support our customers given the critical nature of our products and services. 
In our factories, we have gone to tremendous lengths to keep our people safe by implementing an extensive range of safety protocols, and we are now applying those best practices to our offices as we begin to transition office employees back to the workplace. 
Our second priority has been to maintain business continuity to deliver essential products and services to our customers. Like other manufacturers, we did experience temporary closures in some of our 49 factories. 
In China, where we have 9 factories and about 1,300 suppliers, all of our sites were operational within a couple of weeks after the February 10th reopening after the Lunar New Year, and our output from our sites -- from our local suppliers has been close to 100% for the past month. We have had short-term factory closures in India, Malaysia, Mexico, the EU and the U.S., but our team has done a superb job of minimizing the length of the occasional site closures and supporting our customers. 
While we continue to experience episodic supplier challenges, our supply chain team has been managing these issues as they arise. Our third priority is to effectively manage our costs and preserve cash. Tim will cover this topic in more detail, but I'm pleased with our proactive approach and early results. 
We accelerated and increased savings through Carrier 600, which is our plan to eliminate $600 million in cost over 3 years. Between our overdrive expectations on Carrier 600 for this year, together with other onetime cost actions, we will be driving $425 million in cost actions this year. For example, we have implemented a 15% pay cut for our senior leadership team, including myself, reduced the Board of Director pay, instituted a 15-day furlough, suspended merit increases. We're driving down expected incremental public company costs by about $25 million for the year, and we are aggressively managing our discretionary spend. 
We will also be reducing our CapEx from our initial plan of $350 million to $400 million to $200 million to $225 million. Though we are aggressively containing spend, we continue to invest in areas that are critical to our growth agenda, including R&D, sales and digital, all critical to our core strategy to get to sustained mid-single-digit growth levels. 
On the cash side, we are comfortable with our liquidity position. We started with $1.3 billion in cash on April 3, and we are confident in our ability to generate more than $1 billion in free cash flow this year. We have access to a $2 billion revolver if needed. So we have a strong cash position and are carefully managing it. 
Finally, our fourth priority has been to ensure that we emerge from this pandemic stronger by accelerating implementation of our strategic imperatives. And I'll give you more color on that on the next slide. So turning to Slide 3. 
It highlights how we're positioning Carrier for long-term success. Starting with our organization culture of focus and values. This truly is a new Carrier with a very different feel to it, both internally and externally. We recently launched The Carrier Way, which lays out our vision, values and behaviors. Our culture is focused on customers, winning, growth, agility, innovation and empowerment. We are breaking down barriers to enable our people to be more externally focused and empowering them to drive our long-term growth agenda. 
On people, we have made great progress in assembling a world-class leadership team with both external hires and promotions of internal talent. We launched the new Carrier operating system, which is both nimble and disciplined, and we are doubling down on our ESG commitments with a laser focus on our commitment to the environment through not only our own factories, but also more innovative energy-efficient products. And we've supplemented our focus on the environment with initiatives that support the needs of our communities by playing our part in the fight against this pandemic. 
For example, we designed and produced our new OptiClean negative air machines in just a few weeks, and early feedback from the hospitals on our prototype units is very positive. 
Turning to our strategy and growth pillars. These remain unchanged. We continue to deliver against our 3 strategic top line priorities funded by Carrier 600. In the first pillar, growing our core, we remain well positioned within each of our segments building off of our #1 or 2 market positions. We are also adding 500 net sales employees, while we continue to make key strategic R&D and digital investments. 
We've had significant wins across the portfolio, including our largest order ever of 19DV chillers for data centers in Indonesia, an exclusive long-term resi deal with Fischer Homes in the U.S., and very significant wins across our refrigeration and F&S portfolios. 
In our second pillar, extending our products and geographic coverage, as a vote of confidence in our CO2 technology that we're using to enter warehouse refrigeration, we were selected to provide the cooling for the Beijing Olympics ice rink, and we secured a VRF win for the Sanya Olympic village apartments in China for 3,500 heat pumps and 1,000 condensing units. 
And in the third pillar, driving aftermarket and digital, we have a dedicated aftermarket team in place. We indicated that we'd get to a 30% conversion rate in commercial HVAC by the end of next year, and we are on track to do so this year. We're rolling out structured tiered offerings customized to customers' needs, and we have leaned forward on digital as a differentiator through remote monitoring, diagnostics and prognostics. 
We've had some key aftermarket wins including a 4-year chiller service agreement with the Hong Kong International Airport for 52 chillers across 17 buildings and support for Tim Hortons China operations that is projected to scale to 1,500 stores over the next 10 years. 
And on the right side of the slide, we're very proud of our essential and vital role in society. We support air conditioning systems and hospitals and nursing homes and the delivery of food and pharmaceuticals safely around the world. Looking ahead, as countries and regions around the world are preparing to reopen economies in society, we intend to play a critical role in anticipating and creating the new normal. For example, indoor air quality will be critical. We're putting the V back in HVAC, and our unique electrostatic systems can filter microscopic-size contaminants. Carrier will be a leader in transitioning buildings around the world from sick to healthy buildings. Adjusting food safety in the new normal will be paramount, and we have been making tremendous progress on holistic cold chain solutions. 
In our Fire & Security business, touchless and traceability will be very thematic in the future. With our touchless BlueDiamond solution, we can eliminate 80% of typical contact points in an office building by enabling employees to use their cellphones instead. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Tim to discuss 1Q cost and cash, and I'll come back to discuss our best sense of 2020. Tim?"

Please turn to Slide 4, where I will walk you through our Q1 results. But before I start, I want to point out that as we move from being a division of United Technologies to becoming a fully independent public company, some",1553,"Thank you, Dave. Good morning. Please turn to Slide 4, where I will walk you through our Q1 results. But before I start, I want to point out that as we move from being a division of United Technologies to becoming a fully independent public company, some of the numbers we report will not have a perfect comparison with last year's. The Form-10 carve-out statements adjusted for that in some circumstances, but not all. We'll try to help you understand those noncomparables with explanations, but it may be a bit messy and will continue to be so for the remainder of the year. With that caveat, let me jump into the results for our first quarter. 
Despite significant macroeconomic headwinds in the back half of the quarter, it started out about how we had expected and reflected a solid start to the year. Sales of $3.9 billion were down 10% from last year, 9% organically, which adjusts for a 1% FX headwind. We reported at Investor Day that we faced difficult year-on-year comparisons in each of our 3 segments. In HVAC, our residential results last year reflected a strong furnace season due to abnormally high shipments ahead of a new FER regulation. In Refrigeration, our North America truck and trailer business came off a cyclical peak in Q1 last year. And in F&S, we wound down our residential intrusion business, creating a year-on-year decline in 2020. 
Additional pressure came from the warm winter this year and resulting softness in residential furnace sales. These items accounted for about half of our Q1 decline. The remainder resulted from the impact of COVID-19 on our business in the latter part of the quarter. It first hit China, where about 8% or $1.5 billion of our revenues are derived. This had a material detrimental effect, with domestic China sales down approximately 40%. And in addition, a good part of our global factory production and supply chain sources come from China. We did, however, manage through that disruption without a material impact on our rest of world business. But then later in the quarter, the virus moved west into Europe and then on to the Americas. This pandemic accounted for about $230 million of our revenue decline in the quarter. Our teams have worked tirelessly to keep factories operational and productive to serve our customers around the world. And they continue to do so. 
Moving down the P&L. GAAP operating profit was $315 million. Adjusted operating profit of $436 million was down 16% from last year. But this adjusted number is still not comparable. Our Q1 included about $24 million of public company costs that were not included in the same quarter of 2019. Absent the impact of that, the comparable year-on-year decline was 12%. And of course, it was heavily impacted by COVID-19. While we're not happy about the negative signs here, a 12% decline for comparable adjusted operating profits versus a 9% decline in organic revenues shows we were able to offset a lot of the typical decrementals, largely preserving our operating margin. Our Q1 GAAP EPS was $0.11, and adjusted EPS was $0.35. Since we were not a public company last year, the year-over-year comparisons of EPS are not meaningful. 
I'm pleased to report that our free cash flow was favorable to last year by over $200 million. Q1 is typically a seasonal user of cash, so bringing it in almost flat reflected a solid start to the year. The decline in net income was more than offset by favorable working capital results and aided by some deferred tax payments. All things considered, our performance in the first quarter was solid with good mitigation of a very difficult environment. Let's now look at how the segments performed. Please turn to Slide 5. 
HVAC was down 9% organically. Within it, North America residential was down 11% organically, with roughly half the decline due to last year's FER-driven accelerated gas furnace shipments, and the other half to slow shipments this year due to the unseasonably warm winter. Overall, furnace sales were down 30% year-over-year. The commercial business was down 8% organically, as a 5% decline in light commercial and 20% decline in applied, driven by weakness in China and Europe that was only partially offset by a flattish services business and strength in ALC and NORESCO. Refrigeration sales were down 14% organically, with North America truck/trailer down close to 30%, Europe truck/trailer down around 15% and container down around 7%. 
A difficult truck/trailer comparison for the quarter was expected, as I mentioned earlier, but the results did deteriorate as the quarter progressed. Commercial refrigeration was down 13% organically, with weakness in both Europe and Asia. The Fire & Security segment was down 5% organically, with the products business down 4% organically. This was attributable to COVID-related project delays and shutdowns in Asia and Europe, but was partially offset by growth in our longer-cycle businesses, water mist and gas suppression, and also growth in global access solutions. 
The field business was down 5% organically due to March lockdowns across regions, with particular weakness in Hong Kong, Australasia and France. In this world of uncertainty, we're focused on controlling the controllables, and that includes aggressive cost containment actions. 
Slide 6 provides a breakdown of our cost programs. In February, we told you that we expected to achieve $175 million of savings from our Carrier 600 this year, and that we would invest $150 million of that back into the business to support our growth strategies. The current environment shifted some of our priorities to aggressively reduce cost, yet to preserve critical investment initiatives. The actions that we're taking are expected to generate $425 million of cost improvement this year, including accelerating Carrier 600, reducing our planned investments, and implementing an aggressive cost containment program. First, we will accelerate Carrier 600 and expect to deliver an additional $50 million in 2020 for a total of $225 million. Second, we have scaled back our investments in the year by $75 million in a very surgical manner. We are preserving the investments and initiatives that are most critical to our growth strategy to ensure we are well positioned as we exit this crisis. We have also initiated a $300 million cost containment program for 2020. Lastly, while COVID-19 affects volume and the drop-through of margins, it also disrupts our factories and other areas of our cost base. We're anticipating a $200 million nonrecurring headwind this year on things like factory absorption, supply chain disruption, expediting costs and inefficiencies caused by precautions for the safety of our employees. 
The $425 million of cost actions more than offsets this impact and our net savings are $250 million, up from the $25 million we laid out at Investor Day in February. Dave mentioned our top priorities for 2020, one of which is to maintain ample liquidity. Please turn to Slide 7, and I'll walk you through that. 
I mentioned earlier that we performed well from a cash flow standpoint in a quarter that is typically a big user of cash. Our working capital usually seasonally spikes in Q1 as we start building for the spring/summer selling season. We managed it tightly this year and delivered better cash than planned by over $200 million. We started the quarter with a cash position of $952 million and ended it with a balance of $768 million. This resulted from a neutral free cash flow and a use of $184 million from other investing and financing activities, including a small debt repayment and the effect of foreign exchange. And at spin, UTC returned us approximately $560 million of cash, so our opening balance sheet started with just over $1.3 billion on April 3. From this base, we will continue our efforts to preserve and enhance our liquidity. We will intensify our focus on all the components and levers available to us. This will include tightly managing working capital, expanding and driving the program we began in Q1. We have also done a deep scrub of our CapEx budget for the year and cut it by 40% to 50%. It is now $200 million to $225 million, down from the $350 million to $400 million we had originally planned. In paring it back, we have prioritized those projects targeted at our strategic priorities for growth and those projects which have high returns and a quick payback. We will also assess the timing and amount of a dividend. Our Form-10 identified a possible dividend scenario that was appropriate at the time, but the environment we face today is much different from what it was then. 
With this foundation and these actions, we expect good free cash flow for the year, and it will add to our available cash. In addition to our cash position, we have a $2 billion revolving credit agreement with a strong bank group. That revolver remains undrawn and fully available to us. And finally, I will remind you that we have no debt maturities until 2023. So we feel quite good about our liquidity and are confident we have access to the capital we need to weather the storm and to operate and grow the business. 
With that, let me turn it back over to Dave to discuss how we're thinking about the balance of the year."

So what does this mean for our expectations for the full year? For our scenario planning in this uncertain global economy, we looked at 3 key indicators to frame our thinking: first, macroeconomic projections like GDP; second, indicators more",761,"Thanks, Tim. So what does this mean for our expectations for the full year? For our scenario planning in this uncertain global economy, we looked at 3 key indicators to frame our thinking: first, macroeconomic projections like GDP; second, indicators more directly tied to our business like new housing starts; and third, order trends. At a macro level, starting with GDP, our current guidepost for 2020 assume U.S. GDP declines about 25% in the second quarter and 5% to 10% for the full year. Expectations for Europe are similar. We assume China shows growth in Q2 and accelerates from there. When we look at macro indicators specific to our segments, we assume headwinds from lower replacement volumes as unemployment rates impact homeowner purchases, U.S. housing starts being down 10% to 20% this year and continued softness in non-resi construction starts in North America and Europe as we see from leading indicators like the Architectural Billings Index. 
And in our Refrigeration business, the forecast declines in North America and Europe truck/trailer will be even steeper than we had originally forecast. ACT forecasts North American truck/trailer production to be down 45% this year and European truck/trailer is likely to be down 20% to 30%. Container drops are likely to be far more muted. So then on Page 8, let me share some color with you on orders. 
We start with our China experience. Q1 orders were down 40% year-over-year, with February being the lowest month, down 50%. In the category of good news, the China recovery has been very positive. Our daily order rates returned to precrisis levels in mid-April, and our April orders in China were flat overall. The recovery has been a bit spotty and 1 month doesn't make a trend. But for us, China's decline and then its recovery were both quite steep. Our current thinking about the U.S. and EU is that the decline will be a bit shallower, but the recovery will be longer. 
For us, orders declined earlier in the EU than in the U.S., but we also expect an early recovery. Orders in 1Q were down 10% in Europe, but were down 5% in the U.S., and that accelerated into April with Europe down 30% and the U.S. down 25%. Based on a slower recovery in the EU and U.S. versus China, our internal planning assumes recovery of orders to more typical levels as we get into later 3Q and early Q4. 
So what does this all mean as we frame 2020? Turning to Slide 9. You could think of the numbers that you see here as guideposts as we look at various scenarios playing out globally. We see sales between $15 billion and $17 billion, adjusted op profit between $1.7 billion and $2 billion, and free cash flow over $1 billion. Also, with respect to the scenarios behind the sales decline for the whole company, you should think about the HVAC segment decline fairly aligned with the percentage range that you see here, with Refrigeration facing a bit more headwind and F&S is expected to be a bit at the better end of the range. Given that 80% of our sales are in the U.S. and Europe, we expect the steepest declines to occur in 2Q with improvements from there. So we have done our best to analyze the rest of the year for ourselves and for you, and we will continue to update you as this very fluid situation evolves. And though the coming months are inherently uncertain, what I do know with great confidence is that we'll get through this crisis. And over the long term, megatrends such as climate change, global urbanization and the shift towards digitalization and operating in the new normal will remain tailwinds for our business. And this takes me to our last page on Page 10. 
We remain confident that the game plan that we laid out for you on February 10 will drive the results that you see here. We are getting real traction on the 3 pillars of our top line strategy, which will propel sustained mid-single-digit top line growth. We are tenaciously driving Carrier 600 to invest in growth and to help drive margin expansion to enable high single-digit EPS growth on a steady state basis. And we are laser-focused on driving working capital improvements needed to support free cash flow equal to net income. We have a clear road map to success. We remain committed to executing on our plan with urgency, conviction and effectiveness. 
And with that, we'll open us up for questions."

And then Tim took you through the cost side, we're going to be very aggressive. You saw that we upped our Carrier 600 for this year from $175 million to $225 million. We're being very aggressive, especially on the supply chain side, where we got some tailwind from commodity pricing, but a lot of aggressiveness on the negotiations and resourcing activity.

What you saw in the first quarter actually was much favorable to that, but that was largely because we had the better part of 10 percentage points worth of benefit from cost reduction in the quarter, about $40 million lower cost, and that contributed to a much lower drop-through. And interestingly, our sales in China were hit during the quarter, the hardest of ours, and China tends to carry lower general margins through, and we benefited by about 4%. So that's why you see the 14%. You actually may not see the 14%, you may see a 19%. But remember, we talked about a $24 million stand-alone cost. That's the first quarter component of the $107 million that you ultimately see for the full year. 
I will also point out that I think you may have seen from UTC's release yesterday numbers that are a little bit different. They have about $20 million difference in profits. So if you adjust for that, there are some unusual things where it was different from us to them, they may have -- you may have construed at 24% from them. 
As we think about the rest of the year, again, going back to the 28%. Yes, I would say second quarter is likely to be the hardest hit quarter. And the deeper the drop in revenues, it makes it difficult. We aren't just scaling back production. We're shutting the lines down. We're closing shifts. We're, in some cases, closing factories and you go deeper in to the cost pool there. And I would expect that to be in the second quarter. We will experience some mix degradation. The reverse of what you saw, I mean, some of our higher-margin businesses, the residential HVAC and others will be hit. How I simply think about rest of year decrementals, though, is that we have -- we'll be hit by 2 or 3 points with JV income because there's no offsetting revenue component to the drop in earnings that we're anticipating. And then all other of the cost, the factory disruption, et cetera, is largely covered -- that and the margin mix is covered by our cost reduction. So we anticipate, if you look at the projections, we'll probably be about 30%, couple of points worse than the normal 28%."

Actually, it's absolutely underway. We've been in discussions, and we've actually seen real progress with customers, whether it's the State of Florida or with hospitals where we've distributed our new OptiClean negative air machines. We're coming out of the gates fast on this one because we believe it's critical not only for our business, but it's critical for society. There are a shockingly number -- high number of sick buildings out there. And one of the characteristics of a sick building is the ventilation system. You look at the room I'm in right now, you would expect a certain number of air changes per hour, say, in the 10 to 15 range. And many buildings around the world have stagnant air and they don't have the number of changes per hour. You look at the filtration system in many buildings as you have the return air going to through a filtration system, you'd expect it to be able to filter out contaminants at a 0.1, 0.3 micron level, and many filtration systems don't have that. We have that with our electric static filters for homes, UAV or HEPA filters in commercial buildings. Many buildings don't have that. You want your ducts cleaned every 3 to 5 years, and that doesn't happen. So as we look at the transition to healthy buildings, I think you should expect that Carrier is going to be front and center on that. It's very real. And it's the same in our other 2 segments. 
You mentioned touchless. In our Fire & Security business, we already have a BlueDiamond app that can eliminate a lot of the touch points as, say, you go from your car to your office building, there's usually 8 to 10 touch points. And like I said in the earlier remarks, we can eliminate 80% of that as you go to open the turnstile or you press the elevator button or you adjust the HVAC controls in your office or on your floor. There's a number of touch points that we can eliminate that are going to be critical. And it also is combined with the traceability element. So as employers want to be able in the workplace to trace folks, we have an app that can co-mingle with the other parts of the app to be able to track people in the workplace. 
And the other segment that we have in our refrigeration business, the entire cold chain is going to be just foundationally and fundamentally different. So you look at how people get their food today in a place like China, and there's a significant number of wet markets, and we have farmers' markets here in the U.S. and in Europe. But you're going to see a lot more home delivery of goods. The cold chain is going to be critical for that and pharmaceuticals, and we're working on some telematics and other what we believe to be quite cutting-edge innovative solutions to really connect the entire cold chain. So we think we can play a real pivotal role in the new normal."

We really feel very strongly that we can unleash tremendous value just by doing what we said we were going to do. As we get sales consistently in mid-single-digit range and we get EPS at the high single-digit rate, and we get cash flow about equal to net income. 
We know that, that consistent track record of performance will have a significant impact on the overall valuation of Carrier, and then we're playing from a position of strength. So our #1 priority is focus on execution. Our #2 priority is to really take a very dispassionate look at our current portfolio. And of course, we've been doing that since for quite some time. And we said that we would put our current portfolio through a very specific set of criteria. Are we the rightful owner? Does it strategically fit? Does it meet the financial criteria that we've set out for ourselves? And if it doesn't, we'll be dispassionate and do the right thing about divesting those parts of the portfolio. I think once you make that decision, you will, of course, have to look at the current environment and decide if you're going to do something like that, when would be the right time. And this is not the ideal time to do something like that. But we'll look at the right time if there are parts of the portfolio that we decide don't meet the criteria that we've set. 
And then in terms of that third category, overall, more strategic types of transactions. That is not our priority right now. We know that our peers have made themselves more pure plays, as have we. But our focus right now is on that first category of execution and on the second category of the real portfolio analysis that we've been going through. And we'll deal with that second."

We feel that there are some construction sites that are -- once they come back on, there's going to be really some pent-up demand. 
What we -- our experience in China was this, was that after folks came back from the Lunar New Year, that was factories were allowed to open February 10. Basically, all of our factories, they were generally online as you got into that February 20 time frame. And we started -- we had the backlog and we started to ship the backlog. What followed was a lot of the construction sites that had the migrant workers in China, they were quarantined a little bit longer. And then they started to receive the backlog. And then that was followed by new orders ticking up as we got into April. And we think it will be a similar phenomenon is that as the construction sites come back on-site -- back online in the U.S. and Europe, they'll start to take delivery of the backlog. There may be some pushout a month here or there. But frankly, some of -- some places like universities or education has been taking this opportunity with folks out to actually accelerate some of the construction. So some is being accelerated. Some will naturally get pushed out. But where it gets pushed out, we're talking maybe weeks or a month or 2 here. It's not going to be significant."

Within the 40% that's Chubb, you have a monitoring and installation and a services piece. And the services piece is where you do see some regulatory, and that has generally held up during this downturn better than the installation piece, which got hit pretty hard in the March time frame into April, especially in Europe. 
On the product side, some of our businesses like Edwards, that's held up quite well because there is a regulatory piece of that. And we've actually seen -- we actually saw growth increases in parts of our Edwards business and others that, like GST, where we have a regulatory piece in China. Some of the security portfolio is less regulatory in nature. But what's interesting there is we are starting to see a lot more demand for some of our products that are going to be critical in this new normal. So as hotels start to think about how they're going to gear up in the new normal, we're in discussions with a number of them with our Onity system, where folks can bypass the front desk, go directly to their room and use more touchless type applications. We're seeing that with real estate brokers for our Supra business. So even though it's not regulatory, some parts of the security portfolio could be quite compelling in the new normal.

Here is the quick summary. The second quarter was better than we expected, driven by our continued cost reduction actions, progress on our top line initiatives and improvement in the U.S. in June. We are raising",1691,"Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. Here is the quick summary. The second quarter was better than we expected, driven by our continued cost reduction actions, progress on our top line initiatives and improvement in the U.S. in June. We are raising the low end of our prior outlook for sales, adjusted operating profit and cash flow enabling us to add back some targeted growth investments that we had previously scaled back.
Before we get into details on our Q2 results and the outlook for the rest of the year, let me start with some context. Slide 2 shows the 4 priorities that we established at the outset of the COVID pandemic. Our team has continued to respond aggressively and effectively on all of them. It starts with protecting and supporting our people. Our operations and field teams have continued in the workplace with limited interruption, and we have gone to great lengths to ensure a safe environment for our people. We have distributed 2.5 million masks, instituted thermal screen for 100% of our employees at our scale locations and deployed Carrier's healthy building program solution in our facilities to provide our people with a safe and environment as we possibly can.
Our second priority has been to maintain business continuity to support our customers. While we experienced some short-term shutdowns. By the end of the second quarter, our factories and suppliers had resumed operations, and we are now more than 95% of our production capacity availability.
Our third priority is to effectively manage cost and cash. Carrier 600, our program targeting $600 million of run rate savings within 3 years had initially targeted $175 million of savings in 2020. After 1Q, we increased that to $225 million of savings this year, and we are now tracking to $250 million of recurring in your savings. We also announced onetime cost actions of $300 million. We remain on track there, delivering $115 million in Q2.
On cash, we have close to $5 billion of liquidity. We have $2.7 billion in cash on the balance sheet, and we have access to a $2 billion revolver. With updated covenants on that revolver and our term loan, we are very comfortable with our liquidity position. We are pleased that Q2 cash flow was materially higher than we had internally projected, and we are now comfortable projecting at least $1.1 billion of free cash flow, up from our prior estimate of at least $1 billion. We also declared our first dividend in Q2, demonstrating our confidence in the business.
And fourth, we remain laser-focused on ensuring that we position Carrier to emerge stronger from this pandemic. We are accelerating implementation of our strategic initiatives and investing in 2 key emerging trends: healthy, safe and sustainable buildings and cold chain solutions. The COVID pandemic has underscored the role of buildings in helping ensure public health, and we moved quickly to launch our healthy Buildings program. You see on Slide 3, where we stand on all our overall strategic priorities and our progress as a public company. As a stand-alone company, we launched the Carrier operating system and the Carrier way and both are yielding early results. Our operating system includes a disciplined global deployment of lean in our factories.
I was recently in our Charlotte factory, and it was night and day versus a year ago. In just 1 year, our efficiency in that factory has improved by almost 15%. Our quality has improved by over 25%, and our on-time delivery improved from 85% to 95% despite the challenging environment. The Carrier way speaks to our behaviors, culture and values. There is a new energy within Carrier that is focused on customers, winning agility, speed and innovation. And that combination is resulting in some key new wins. And as we advance in our mission of creating solutions that matter for people in our planet, we recently released our first ESG report that highlights our progress on our environmental targets, our commitment to effective and ethical corporate governance, actions to significantly improve our diversity and inclusion and helping to establish Carrier as the employer of choice. ESG is not a side activity at Carrier. It's core to our business, always has been, and we take pride in being leaders in this effort.
We've also been consistent in focusing on our 3 strategic pillars to drive sustained growth. In order to strengthen and grow our core business, which is our first pillar, we continue to invest in R&D, salespeople and digital. We originally plan to spend an incremental $150 million in these 3 key areas this year. And after COVID hit, we scaled it back to $75 million. As we said, our incremental strategic investments would increase as we achieve more traction during the year. So with our improved outlook, we are bringing our incremental strategic investments up to approximately $100 million for this year.
In terms of innovation, we continue to drive key new product introductions. For example, in Q2, we launched the Infinity 26 air conditioner and Infinity 24 heat pump that have the highest energy efficiency ratings amongst all ducted systems. Carrier Transicold launched its innovative vector multi temperature trailer refrigeration unit that addresses a key market need and initial demand has been very positive. And in our Fire & Security business, Kidde is launching new TrueSense smoke detectors that are first to market compliant with the new UL standards and will significantly reduce nuisance alarms. And we are on track to add the 500 sales and support people that we previously planned.
In our second pillar, which includes geographic expansion, we continue to make strong progress in China, with a key VRF win with the Sana International Sports Industrial Park and also in China, our GST fire business had an important win with Hongxing Lear's 1.3 million square foot commercial complex.
And in the third pillar, driving aftermarket and digital. We introduced the Blue edge service platform providing customized tiered solutions across the business. We remain on track to achieving 30% attachment rates in our commercial HVAC business this year helped by the launch of our Assurance One program and digitally enabled life cycle offerings are a clear focus for us, and we're seeing traction. Our new digital platform for our residential and commercial national accounts achieved $100 million in e-commerce revenues in June. Our super business signed a contract with 6 St. Louis Area Realtor Associations to provide subscription-based access solutions to over 9,500 key holders. And British supermarket retailer as signed a long-term support and telematics deal in conjunction with its order of more than 165 Carrier Transicold vector refrigeration units. And we are truly leaning in on the global imperative around healthy and safe buildings. We have a comprehensive product offering that includes all aspects of indoor air quality, including filtration, ventilation and humidity, along with sensing and controls. We've complemented this with our Fire & Security portfolio to include touchless and traceability offerings.
And our LenelS2 business announced a strategic collaboration with FLIR Systems, the world's largest and leading company specializing in thermal imaging cameras, where we will resell FLIR's EST thermal imaging screening solutions with LenelS2's Onguard access control system. We are integrating these multiple healthy and safe building offerings to provide our 7 targeted verticals with a one-stop shop solution. Society needs confidence in the safety and health of indoor environments, and customers are increasingly turning to Carrier for critical solutions as they reopen.
As recent proof points, we signed a healthy buildings deal with Cushman & Wakefield to collaborate on deploying leading edge Carrier solutions. And we are working with Emery University to upgrade IAQ sensing and controls in their intelligent building focused on customer health and experience. We continue to fund these exciting growth initiatives through tenacious progress on Carrier 600 and G&A transformation. We remain focused on our overall business simplification that makes us more agile and externally focused. We launched Carrier Alliance to reduce our 6,000 suppliers and align with fewer, more strategic partners. We are reviewing our 58 JVs for opportunities to improve our focus on growth initiatives. We have approved a project in our commercial HVAC business to digitize our internal and customer-facing interface points in our European operations. And we are assessing our overall back office footprint for reduction and consolidation by moving to a back-office shared service center of excellence model. So lots of exciting progress strategically.
Let me give you some color on orders on Page 4. We shared trends back in Q1 that showed the U.S. and Europe still struggling, while China had returned to prior year levels. Here, we show detailed color on what we're seeing in this very fluid environment. Recall that the U.S. and EU make up 80% of our sales. In those regions, April and May were weak as expected, with April orders down 25% and May down 15% year-over-year on a combined basis. The surprise was the strength of U.S. orders in June, up 40% from last year. U.S. strength was led by resi, where we saw orders up 100% in June, helped by an increase in cooling degree days, pent-up demand and suppressed inventory levels. Also, in the U.S., Fire & Security products orders grew in the high single digits in June after being down 30% to 40% in April and May, and commercial HVAC orders were up low single digits in the U.S. in June after being down 25% in April and May.
The encouraging trends that we saw in June have carried forward to July, where U.S. and China orders have been up more than 20%. The EU orders have been down modestly compared to last year, while South Asia remains very challenged. But despite a couple of good months of order trends, COVID cases continue to rise and economic visibility is uncertain. Therefore, we will continue to focus on what we control. Effectively managing the business during times of uncertainty and volatility and remaining flexible and opportunistic.
With that, let me turn it over to Tim, and I'll come back to summarize before we open it up for Q&A."

June, however, saw a significant pickup in activity in the U.S. as the economy reopened. That led to a substantial improvement in demand in North America residential HVAC, residential fire, and North America trailer.
Due to the strong North America shipments in June, sales of almost $4 billion for the quarter were better than we had anticipated. They were, however, still down 20% compared to last year due to the COVID-related shutdowns. And we continue to expect that the Q2 year-on-year sales decline will be the low point for the year.
GAAP operating profit was $442 million. Adjusted operating profit of $476 million was down 42% from last year. The COVID-related volume and factory inefficiency pressure were partially offset by our aggressive cost actions. Our decremental margin was 34%. Absent some onetime items, the decremental margins would have been closer to 30%.
Our Q2 GAAP EPS was $0.30 and adjusted EPS was $0.33. Since we were not a public company last year, the year-over-year comparisons are not meaningful. Our free cash flow was considerably higher than our expectations. This was largely attributable to favorable earnings and timing benefits in working capital and also the timing of other payments. These results were higher than would normally be reflected in our seasonal pattern. So all things considered, our performance in the second quarter was better than we would have expected in a very difficult environment.
Let's now look at how the segments performed. Please turn to Slide 6. And note that the year-over-year numbers I will refer to on this slide are organic comparisons. The HVAC segment sales were down 15% from last year. Within the segment, North America residential sales were down 13%. As mentioned earlier, the opening up of many states, combined with the warmer weather, led to a substantial pickup in the month of June. We exited the quarter with a backlog about twice last year's level and inventories in the field down about 25%. So we expect strength to continue in the third quarter. The commercial HVAC business was down 17% with declines in most of the businesses. We saw a decline of around 20% in light commercial, a low double-digit decline in Applied and a mid-teens decline in the services business. China sales were up high single digits in the quarter, but South Asia was weak, especially in India, which was heavily impacted by a prolonged lockdown.
Applied sales were down less than overall commercial HVAC due to entering this slowdown with a healthy backlog in this longer cycle business. Light commercial was down more than the group because 80% of light commercial is replacement, and many of those units are having very light-duty, if at all. We did start to see an improvement in demand toward the end of the quarter as the markets began to reopen. This is an encouraging sign, but we still expect it to remain down year-over-year in the second half.
Now over to Refrigeration, where sales were down 25%. North America truck trailer was down about 50%. Europe truck trailer was down close to 30% and container was down about 10%. We have, however, seen improved order activity with almost a tripling of the average weekly order rates from May to June for North America trailer. Container order activity was also encouraging in June. These are cyclical businesses that were declining from last year but the recent activities suggest this Q2 could be the bottom for those markets.
Commercial refrigeration was down almost 20%, with weakness in Europe that more than offset a mid-teens increase in China. But we are encouraged to see order and quotation activity improving in both geographies.
The Fire & Security segment was down 22%. The products business was down consistent with the segment, declines in the Americas and Europe were partially offset by a recovery in China. We did see sequential improvement through the quarter as the declines in April and May tempered somewhat in June. The point-of-sale data for our residential fire products improved in June, and we expect that to continue into Q3. The field business was down 23% due to March lockdowns across virtually all regions, with particular weakness in Europe and Asia. While about 40% of this business is recurring, having lower limited access to sites did put pressure on the installation and service portion of the business. Bottom line, there were some encouraging signs in several of our businesses in the back half of the quarter. But with the ever-changing environment, we remain flexible as an organization and ready to pivot as needed to market conditions. So we remain focused on controlling the controllables, and an aggressive cost containment actions that will help us fund investments to position ourselves for future growth.
Please turn to Slide 7. I will provide an update on our cost programs. In our Q1 call, we told you that we were taking aggressive cost actions in response to the economic weakness caused by the pandemic. We accelerated Carrier 600 savings, reduced investment spending and initiated a $300 million cost containment program. These actions will more than offset the productivity and absorption impact from the lower volume by $250 million. Through the first half, the savings are tracking ahead of the pace of those for full year targets. Our intense focus on managing through the crisis in Q2 resulted in lighter investment spend in the quarter. As the markets recover and our results improve, we plan to restore some of the earlier investment cutbacks.
We still expect to generate net savings of $250 million. But we have upped the 2020 target for Carrier 600 by $25 million and expect to redirect that increment to restore investments in R&D, sales force and digital. These are expected to support growth in 2021 and to enable us to capitalize on some of the market trends emerging from the crisis.
Continuing on Slide 8. As Dave mentioned, one of our top priorities for 2020 is to maintain ample liquidity. We performed well from a cash flow standpoint in the quarter and for the first half. The better-than-expected earnings, tightly managed working capital, aided by some timing benefits led to much stronger cash flows for the first half than we had expected.
On our first quarter call, we showed you our cash balance walk from the beginning of the year. With our favorable cash flow in Q2 and the issuance of $750 million in bonds, we ended the quarter with $2.7 billion in cash. We were able to modify the covenants in our term loan and revolving credit agreement. Together with the bond issuance, the modifications further enhanced our liquidity and financial flexibility during this pandemic.
With this solid cash balance and undrawn revolver and expected cash flow, we feel quite good about our liquidity and are confident we have access to the capital we need to weather this storm and to operate and grow the business. We told you last quarter, we would assess the timing and level of our dividend. In June, our Board declared an $0.08 per share dividend, which was paid just last week.
Please turn to Slide 9, and I'll review our outlook. On our Q1 call, we discussed a number of scenarios based on a combination of macroeconomic projections like GDP, indicators more directly tied to our business like new housing starts, order trends, reasonable expectations as the severity and duration of the crisis and likely recovery path. In light of our more favorable second quarter performance, combined with a broader improvement in the market conditions, we are raising the bottom end of our prior outlook range for full year 2020. We now expect sales between $15.5 billion and $17 billion, given the pleasant surprise of a stronger demand in June, especially in the Americas. This raises the lower end by $500 million.
We also increased the bottom end of the adjusted operating profit range by $100 million, and are now projecting adjusted operating profit to be between $1.8 billion and $2 billion. And as mentioned earlier, we have taken this opportunity to restore $25 million of the investment cutbacks we announced in the Q1 call. This is consistent with our comments at that time that the pace and timing of bringing it back would track the recovery.
Lastly, while much of the Q2 cash flow favorability was due to timing, we are now comfortable projecting at least $1.1 billion of free cash flow this year, up from at least $1 billion identified in our previous outlook. This comes even after restoring some of the capital spending reductions we made earlier in the year. Capital spending is now expected to be in the $250 million to $275 million range compared to the prior $200 million to $225 million as we invest for future growth.
We continue to reiterate that our outlook expects the current momentum in orders and sales to continue. One additional note is that a number of the items you may need to bridge the adjusted operating profit EPS, such as interest expense, tax rates and share count are in the appendix of this presentation.
With that, let me turn it back over to Dave to say a few words before we open up for your questions."

So when you look at the share numbers from AHRI, you're really comparing the sales from our distributors direct to the dealer network, comparing to some of our competitors that ship direct. What was very encouraging to us is a few things coming out of the quarter. Number one, as I mentioned in the remarks, June was the highest orders month that we've had in our company's history, was plus 100%. And a lot of that strength in orders has continued into July where resi orders in July have continued to be extremely strong, north of 50% year-over-year. The inventory levels at our distributors ending last quarter were down about 25%. So we're really -- we started the quarter with low inventory levels at our distributors. We've done our best to react to this very strong demand that we saw coming into July. That's continued into June. That's continued into July. So we feel pretty well set up for 3Q.

We're more heavily weighted towards OE versus service on the implied side. When we look back at 2Q and then we'll kind of look forward with you. We feel on the applied side that we had strength in the U.S. and China, I think in terms of share, we felt positive. We had committed, Chris had committed to getting us to #1 within 5 years, which really looks at about 50 bps of improvement a year, and we felt pretty positive about the share gains that we saw in the U.S. and China. We lagged in Europe and we need to fix that, and we will. But we felt positive about U.S. and China on the OE side.
Services is an area where when we look at it, some of our peers had a quicker jump on that trend than we did. So we're playing a little bit of catch-up there. There's a lot of focus, a lot of momentum. We're putting the framework in place to really lean forward on services. But that's an area that there's a huge opportunity ahead. When you look at some of the macro trends overall, ABI is a really good leading indicator, of course, the architectural billing index you want that north of 50. It had been north of 50 coming into March, April, May, it dropped down into the 30s. And then June, it was back up to 40s. So a positive trend there, and we'll see if that bodes well as we look out 6 months. Light commercial was pretty rugged in April and May.

And the second one is really an accounting adjustment to our long-term liabilities is about 3%. So that brings you back to kind of the target 30% that we usually expect to see.
With respect to the second half, again, if you do the calculations, I mean, we are -- we would prefer not to -- for everybody to assume that we will be at the midpoint of each of the sales, operating income, et cetera. But if you did take that, you would calculate probably a 45% decremental and about 10 percentage points of that is attributable to investments. You recall, so I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we really -- if you think about it, we didn't do much as we were part of UTC in the first quarter. Second quarter, we were quite distracted by responding to the COVID crisis and our customers and keeping our employees safe, et cetera, that Dave mentioned. So we spent very lightly on those investments. So the majority of what we had said was $75 million, now incremented by $25 million, so $100 million in the second half of the year is about 10 percentage points. And the remainder, about 5% to bring us down to that 30% range would be attributable to the public company costs that will step-up in the second half of the year as we particularly exit a lot of the TSAs and so forth from United Technologies and digital spend, et cetera."

We're seeing it with some of our touchless offerings. We're seeing it even last night, we announced this partnership with FLIR, where we're going to be reselling their thermal imaging camera capabilities, and we're going to integrate that into the BlueDiamond app. So when you look at a holistic set of one-stop shop ecosystem of healthy buildings, the Fire & Security product portfolio fits very, very well.

Here is the quick summary. The second quarter was better than we expected, driven by our continued cost reduction actions, progress on our top line initiatives and improvement in the U.S. in June. We are raising",1683,"Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. Here is the quick summary. The second quarter was better than we expected, driven by our continued cost reduction actions, progress on our top line initiatives and improvement in the U.S. in June. We are raising the low end of our prior outlook for sales, adjusted operating profit and cash flow enabling us to add back some targeted growth investments that we had previously scaled back. 
Before we get into details on our Q2 results and the outlook for the rest of the year, let me start with some context. Slide 2 shows the 4 priorities that we established at the outset of the COVID pandemic. Our team has continued to respond aggressively and effectively on all of them. It starts with protecting and supporting our people. Our operations and field teams have continued in the workplace with limited interruption, and we have gone to great lengths to ensure a safe environment for our people. We have distributed 2.5 million masks, instituted thermal screening for 100% of our employees at our scale locations and deployed Carrier's Healthy Building Program solution in our facilities to provide our people with a safe and environment as we possibly can. 
Our second priority has been to maintain business continuity to support our customers. While we experienced some short-term shutdowns. By the end of the second quarter, our factories and suppliers had resumed operations, and we are now more than 95% of our production capacity availability. 
Our third priority is to effectively manage cost and cash. Carrier 600, our program targeting $600 million of run rate savings within 3 years had initially targeted $175 million of savings in 2020. After 1Q, we increased that to $225 million of savings this year, and we are now tracking to $250 million of recurring in your savings. We also announced onetime cost actions of $300 million. We remain on track there, delivering $115 million in Q2. 
On cash, we have close to $5 billion of liquidity. We have $2.7 billion in cash on the balance sheet, and we have access to a $2 billion revolver. With updated covenants on that revolver and our term loan, we are very comfortable with our liquidity position. We are pleased that Q2 cash flow was materially higher than we had internally projected, and we are now comfortable projecting at least $1.1 billion of free cash flow, up from our prior estimate of at least $1 billion. 
We also declared our first dividend in Q2, demonstrating our confidence in the business. 
And fourth, we remain laser-focused on ensuring that we position Carrier to emerge stronger from this pandemic. We are accelerating implementation of our strategic initiatives and investing in 2 key emerging trends: healthy, safe and sustainable buildings and cold chain solutions. The COVID pandemic has underscored the role of buildings in helping ensure public health, and we moved quickly to launch our Healthy Buildings Program. You see on Slide 3, where we stand on all our overall strategic priorities and our progress as a public company. As a stand-alone company, we launched the Carrier Operating System and the Carrier Way and both are yielding early results. Our operating system includes a disciplined global deployment of lean in our factories. 
I was recently in our Charlotte factory, and it was night and day versus a year ago. In just 1 year, our efficiency in that factory has improved by almost 15%. Our quality has improved by over 25%, and our on-time delivery improved from 85% to 95% despite the challenging environment. The Carrier Way speaks to our behaviors, culture and values. There is a new energy within Carrier that is focused on customers, winning agility, speed and innovation. And that combination is resulting in some key new wins. And as we advance in our mission of creating solutions that matter for people and our planet, we recently released our first ESG report that highlights our progress on our environmental targets, our commitment to effective and ethical corporate governance, actions to significantly improve our diversity and inclusion and helping to establish Carrier as the employer of choice. ESG is not a side activity at Carrier. It's core to our business, always has been, and we take pride in being leaders in this effort. 
We've also been consistent in focusing on our 3 strategic pillars to drive sustained growth. In order to strengthen and grow our core business, which is our first pillar, we continue to invest in R&D, salespeople and digital. We originally plan to spend an incremental $150 million in these 3 key areas this year. And after COVID hit, we scaled it back to $75 million. As we said, our incremental strategic investments would increase as we achieve more traction during the year. So with our improved outlook, we are bringing our incremental strategic investments up to approximately $100 million for this year. 
In terms of innovation, we continue to drive key new product introductions. For example, in Q2, we launched the Infinity 26 air conditioner and Infinity 24 heat pump that have the highest energy efficiency ratings amongst all ducted systems. Carrier Transicold launched its innovative vector multi-temperature trailer refrigeration unit that addresses a key market need and initial demand has been very positive. And in our Fire & Security business, Kidde is launching new TruSense smoke detectors that are first-to-market compliant with the new UL standards and will significantly reduce nuisance alarms. And we are on track to add the 500 sales and support people that we previously planned. 
In our second pillar, which includes geographic expansion, we continue to make strong progress in China, with a key VRF win with the Sanya International Sports Industrial Park and also in China, our GST fire business had an important win with Zhongshan Lu's 1.3 million square foot commercial complex. 
And in the third pillar, driving aftermarket and digital. We introduced the BlueEdge Service Platform providing customized tiered solutions across the business. We remain on track to achieving 30% attachment rates in our commercial HVAC business this year helped by the launch of our AssuranceONE program and digitally enabled life cycle offerings are a clear focus for us, and we're seeing traction. Our new digital platform for our residential and commercial national accounts achieved $100 million in e-commerce revenues in June. Our Supra business signed a contract with 6 St. Louis Area Realtor Associations to provide subscription-based access solutions to over 9,500 key holders. And British supermarket retailer Asda signed a long-term support and telematics deal in conjunction with its order of more than 165 Carrier Transicold vector refrigeration units. And we are truly leaning in on the global imperative around healthy and safe buildings. We have a comprehensive product offering that includes all aspects of indoor air quality, including filtration, ventilation and humidity, along with sensing and controls. We've complemented this with our Fire & Security portfolio to include touchless and traceability offerings. 
And our LenelS2 business announced a strategic collaboration with FLIR Systems, the world's largest and leading company specializing in thermal imaging cameras, where we will resell FLIR's EST thermal imaging screening solutions with LenelS2's OnGuard access control system. We are integrating these multiple healthy and safe building offerings to provide our 7 targeted verticals with a one-stop-shop solution. Society needs confidence in the safety and health of indoor environments, and customers are increasingly turning to Carrier for critical solutions as they reopen. 
As recent proof points, we signed a healthy buildings deal with Cushman & Wakefield to collaborate on deploying leading-edge Carrier solutions. And we are working with Emory University to upgrade IAQ sensing and controls in their intelligent building focused on customer health and experience. We continue to fund these exciting growth initiatives through tenacious progress on Carrier 600 and G&A transformation. We remain focused on our overall business simplification that makes us more agile and externally focused. We launched Carrier Alliance to reduce our 6,000 suppliers and align with fewer, more strategic partners. We are reviewing our 58 JVs for opportunities to improve our focus on growth initiatives. We have approved a project in our commercial HVAC business to digitize our internal and customer-facing interface points in our European operations. And we are assessing our overall back-office footprint for reduction and consolidation by moving to a back-office shared service center of excellence model. So lots of exciting progress strategically. 
Let me give you some color on orders on Page 4. We shared trends back in Q1 that showed the U.S. and Europe still struggling, while China had returned to prior year levels. Here, we show detailed color on what we're seeing in this very fluid environment. Recall that the U.S. and EU make up 80% of our sales. In those regions, April and May were weak as expected, with April orders down 25% and May down 15% year-over-year on a combined basis. The surprise was the strength of U.S. orders in June, up 40% from last year. U.S. strength was led by resi, where we saw orders up 100% in June, helped by an increase in cooling degree days, pent-up demand and suppressed inventory levels. Also, in the U.S., Fire & Security products orders grew in the high single digits in June after being down 30% to 40% in April and May, and commercial HVAC orders were up low single digits in the U.S. in June after being down 25% in April and May. 
The encouraging trends that we saw in June have carried forward to July, where U.S. and China orders have been up more than 20%. The EU orders have been down modestly compared to last year, while South Asia remains very challenged. But despite a couple of good months of order trends, COVID cases continue to rise and economic visibility is uncertain. Therefore, we will continue to focus on what we control. Effectively managing the business during times of uncertainty and volatility and remaining flexible and opportunistic. 
With that, let me turn it over to Tim, and I'll come back to summarize before we open it up for Q&A."

June, however, saw a significant pickup in activity in the U.S. as the economy reopened. That led to a substantial improvement in demand in North America residential HVAC, residential fire, and North America trailer. 
Due to the strong North America shipments in June, sales of almost $4 billion for the quarter were better than we had anticipated. They were, however, still down 20% compared to last year due to the COVID-related shutdowns. And we continue to expect that the Q2 year-on-year sales decline will be the low point for the year. 
GAAP operating profit was $442 million. Adjusted operating profit of $476 million was down 42% from last year. The COVID-related volume and factory inefficiency pressure were partially offset by our aggressive cost actions. Our decremental margin was 34%. Absent some onetime items, the decremental margins would have been closer to 30%. 
Our Q2 GAAP EPS was $0.30 and adjusted EPS was $0.33. Since we were not a public company last year, the year-over-year comparisons are not meaningful. Our free cash flow was considerably higher than our expectations. This was largely attributable to favorable earnings and timing benefits in working capital and also the timing of other payments. These results were higher than would normally be reflected in our seasonal pattern. So all things considered, our performance in the second quarter was better than we would have expected in a very difficult environment. 
Let's now look at how the segments performed. Please turn to Slide 6. And note that the year-over-year numbers I will refer to on this slide are organic comparisons. The HVAC segment sales were down 15% from last year. Within the segment, North America residential sales were down 13%. As mentioned earlier, the opening up of many states, combined with the warmer weather, led to a substantial pickup in the month of June. We exited the quarter with a backlog about twice last year's level and inventories in the field down about 25%. So we expect strengths to continue in the third quarter. The commercial HVAC business was down 17% with declines in most of the businesses. We saw a decline of around 20% in light commercial, a low double-digit decline in applied and a mid-teens decline in the services business. China sales were up high single digits in the quarter, but South Asia was weak, especially in India, which was heavily impacted by a prolonged lockdown. 
Applied sales were down less than overall commercial HVAC due to entering this slowdown with a healthy backlog in this longer cycle business. Light commercial was down more than the group because 80% of light commercial is replacement, and many of those units are having very light-duty, if at all. We did start to see an improvement in demand toward the end of the quarter as the markets began to reopen. This is an encouraging sign, but we still expect it to remain down year-over-year in the second half. 
Now over to Refrigeration, where sales were down 25%. North America truck/trailer was down about 50%. Europe truck/trailer was down close to 30% and container was down about 10%. We have, however, seen improved order activity with almost a tripling of the average weekly order rates from May to June for North America trailer. Container order activity was also encouraging in June. These are cyclical businesses that were declining from last year but the recent activities suggest this Q2 could be the bottom for those markets. 
Commercial refrigeration was down almost 20%, with weakness in Europe that more than offset a mid-teens increase in China. But we are encouraged to see order and quotation activity improving in both geographies. 
The Fire & Security segment was down 22%. The products business was down consistent with the segment. Declines in the Americas and Europe were partially offset by a recovery in China. We did see sequential improvement through the quarter as the declines in April and May tempered somewhat in June. The point-of-sale data for our residential fire products improved in June, and we expect that to continue into Q3. The field business was down 23% due to March lockdowns across virtually all regions, with particular weakness in Europe and Asia. While about 40% of this business is recurring, having no or limited access to sites did put pressure on the installation and service portion of the business. Bottom line, there were some encouraging signs in several of our businesses in the back half of the quarter. But with the ever-changing environment, we remain flexible as an organization and ready to pivot as needed to market conditions. So we remain focused on controlling the controllables and an aggressive cost containment actions that will help us fund investments to position ourselves for future growth. 
Please turn to Slide 7. I will provide an update on our cost programs. In our Q1 call, we told you that we were taking aggressive cost actions in response to the economic weakness caused by the pandemic. We accelerated Carrier 600 savings, reduced investment spending and initiated a $300 million cost containment program. These actions will more than offset the productivity and absorption impact from the lower volume by $250 million. Through the first half, the savings are tracking ahead of the pace of those for full year targets. Our intense focus on managing through the crisis in Q2 resulted in lighter investment spend in the quarter. As the markets recover and our results improve, we plan to restore some of the earlier investment cutbacks. 
We still expect to generate net savings of $250 million. But we have upped the 2020 target for Carrier 600 by $25 million and expect to redirect that increment to restore investments in R&D, sales force and digital. These are expected to support growth in 2021 and to enable us to capitalize on some of the market trends emerging from the crisis. 
Continuing on Slide 8. As Dave mentioned, one of our top priorities for 2020 is to maintain ample liquidity. We performed well from a cash flow standpoint in the quarter and for the first half. The better-than-expected earnings, tightly managed working capital, aided by some timing benefits led to much stronger cash flows for the first half than we had expected. 
On our first quarter call, we showed you our cash balance walk from the beginning of the year. With our favorable cash flow in Q2 and the issuance of $750 million in bonds, we ended the quarter with $2.7 billion in cash. We were able to modify the covenants in our term loan and revolving credit agreement. Together with the bond issuance, the modifications further enhanced our liquidity and financial flexibility during this pandemic. 
With this solid cash balance and undrawn revolver and expected cash flow, we feel quite good about our liquidity and are confident we have access to the capital we need to weather this storm and to operate and grow the business. We told you last quarter, we would assess the timing and level of our dividend. In June, our Board declared an $0.08 per share dividend, which was paid just last week. 
Please turn to Slide 9, and I'll review our outlook. On our Q1 call, we discussed a number of scenarios based on a combination of macroeconomic projections like GDP, indicators more directly tied to our business like new housing starts, order trends, reasonable expectations as the severity and duration of the crisis and likely recovery path. In light of our more favorable second quarter performance, combined with a broader improvement in the market conditions, we are raising the bottom end of our prior outlook range for full year 2020. We now expect sales between $15.5 billion and $17 billion, given the pleasant surprise of a stronger demand in June, especially in the Americas. This raises the lower end by $500 million.
We also increased the bottom end of the adjusted operating profit range by $100 million, and are now projecting adjusted operating profit to be between $1.8 billion and $2 billion. And as mentioned earlier, we have taken this opportunity to restore $25 million of the investment cutbacks we announced in the Q1 call. This is consistent with our comments at that time that the pace and timing of bringing it back would track the recovery.
Lastly, while much of the Q2 cash flow favorability was due to timing, we are now comfortable projecting at least $1.1 billion of free cash flow this year, up from at least $1 billion identified in our previous outlook. This comes even after restoring some of the capital spending reductions we made earlier in the year. Capital spending is now expected to be in the $250 million to $275 million range compared to the prior $200 million to $225 million as we invest for future growth.
We continue to reiterate that our outlook expects the current momentum in orders and sales to continue. One additional note is that a number of the items you may need to bridge the adjusted operating profit, the EPS, such as interest expense, tax rates and share count are in the appendix of this presentation.
With that, let me turn it back over to Dave to say a few words before we open up for your questions."

So when you look at the share numbers from AHRI, you're really comparing the sales from our distributors direct to the dealer network, comparing to some of our competitors that ship direct. What was very encouraging to us is a few things coming out of the quarter. Number one, as I mentioned in the remarks, June was the highest orders month that we've had in our company's history, it was plus 100%. And a lot of that strength in orders has continued into July where resi orders in July have continued to be extremely strong, north of 50% year-over-year. The inventory levels at our distributors ending last quarter were down about 25%. So we're really -- we started the quarter with low inventory levels at our distributors. We've done our best to react to this very strong demand that we saw coming into July. That's continued into June. That's continued into July. So we feel pretty well set up for 3Q.

We're more heavily weighted towards OE versus service on the applied side. When we look back at 2Q and then we'll kind of look forward with you. We feel on the applied side that we had strength in the U.S. and China, I think in terms of share, we felt positive. We had committed, Chris had committed to getting us to #1 within 5 years, which really looks at about 50 bps of improvement a year, and we felt pretty positive about the share gains that we saw in the U.S. and China. We lagged in Europe, and we need to fix that, and we will. But we felt positive about U.S. and China on the OE side.
Services is an area where when we look at it, some of our peers had a quicker jump on that trend than we did. So we're playing a little bit of catch-up there. There's a lot of focus, a lot of momentum. We're putting the framework in place to really lean forward on services. But that's an area that there's a huge opportunity ahead. When you look at some of the macro trends overall, ABI is a really good leading indicator, of course, the Architectural Billing Index, you want that north of 50. It had been north of 50. Coming into March, April, May, it dropped down into the 30s. And then June, it was back up to 40s. So a positive trend there, and we'll see if that bodes well as we look out 6 months. Light commercial was pretty rugged in April and May. It's started to show a better signs of progress as we got into June and July, but that for us is 80-20 on replacement over OE. So we're starting to see more activity in the light commercial space, but some of those end markets remained challenged."

I think you've got it about right, Julian. So the adjustment.

And the second one is really an accounting adjustment to our long-term liabilities is about 3%. So that brings you back to kind of the target 30% that we usually expect to see.
With respect to the second half, again, if you do the calculations, I mean, we are -- we would prefer not to -- for everybody to assume that we will be at the midpoint of each of the sales, operating income, et cetera. But if you did take that, you would calculate probably a 45% decremental and about 10 percentage points of that is attributable to investments. You recall, so I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we really -- if you think about it, we didn't do much as we're part of UTC in the first quarter. Second quarter, we were quite distracted by responding to the COVID crisis and our customers and keeping our employees safe, et cetera, that Dave mentioned. So we spent very lightly on those investments. So the majority of what we had said was $75 million, now incremented by $25 million, so $100 million in the second half of the year is about 10 percentage points. And the remainder, about 5% to bring us down to that 30% range would be attributable to the public company costs that will step-up in the second half of the year as we particularly exit a lot of the TSAs and so forth from United Technologies and digital spend, et cetera."

The products piece that 60% of the business, what we are finding is there is tremendous synergy on the product side between that and our healthy building initiative. We're seeing it with some of our touchless offerings. We're seeing it -- even last night, we announced this partnership with FLIR, where we're going to be reselling their thermal imaging camera capabilities, and we're going to integrate that into the BlueDiamond app. So when you look at a holistic set of one-stop-shop ecosystem of healthy buildings, the Fire & Security product portfolio fits very, very well. And we see that in terms of real application. Normally, we would measure CO2 levels and then adjust the ventilation system. But you can use the Fire & Security contact tracing to anticipate CO2 level rises and get into artificial intelligence and then use that to preventilate.

And this is basically a showcase of our capabilities. And it's also kind of an existing lab we have to make it the best-in-class building for healthy and safe indoor environment. So for example, we have significantly more ambient air in this facility than most commercial buildings. We have a designated outdoor air system. So we continue to leverage that to maximize the amount of ambient air. When COVID hit, we started to use more bipolar ionization. We have a relationship with a company called GPS. So we implemented their capabilities in our filtration system there. It's combined with a HEPA filter as well. So we've been using this building to really validate a lot of our apps. So we have our BlueDiamond app. That's part of our LenelS2 business. And what we're hearing from our employees in this building because right now, for office employees at Carrier, it's still voluntary whether to come back to the office. But we're seeing an uptake in people coming back to the office because they know we're investing in the health and safety of the indoor environment. They see it when they get their temperature taken when they come in, in the morning. They can see it through their app interfaces. So it's really having a direct correlation to employees coming back and the investments that we're making."

Here is the quick summary. The second quarter was better than we expected, driven by our continued cost reduction actions, progress on our top line initiatives and improvement in the U.S. in June. We are raising",1683,"Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. Here is the quick summary. The second quarter was better than we expected, driven by our continued cost reduction actions, progress on our top line initiatives and improvement in the U.S. in June. We are raising the low end of our prior outlook for sales, adjusted operating profit and cash flow enabling us to add back some targeted growth investments that we had previously scaled back. 
Before we get into details on our Q2 results and the outlook for the rest of the year, let me start with some context. Slide 2 shows the 4 priorities that we established at the outset of the COVID pandemic. Our team has continued to respond aggressively and effectively on all of them. It starts with protecting and supporting our people. Our operations and field teams have continued in the workplace with limited interruption, and we have gone to great lengths to ensure a safe environment for our people. We have distributed 2.5 million masks, instituted thermal screening for 100% of our employees at our scale locations and deployed Carrier's Healthy Building Program solution in our facilities to provide our people with a safe and environment as we possibly can. 
Our second priority has been to maintain business continuity to support our customers. While we experienced some short-term shutdowns. By the end of the second quarter, our factories and suppliers had resumed operations, and we are now more than 95% of our production capacity availability. 
Our third priority is to effectively manage cost and cash. Carrier 600, our program targeting $600 million of run rate savings within 3 years had initially targeted $175 million of savings in 2020. After 1Q, we increased that to $225 million of savings this year, and we are now tracking to $250 million of recurring in your savings. We also announced onetime cost actions of $300 million. We remain on track there, delivering $115 million in Q2. 
On cash, we have close to $5 billion of liquidity. We have $2.7 billion in cash on the balance sheet, and we have access to a $2 billion revolver. With updated covenants on that revolver and our term loan, we are very comfortable with our liquidity position. We are pleased that Q2 cash flow was materially higher than we had internally projected, and we are now comfortable projecting at least $1.1 billion of free cash flow, up from our prior estimate of at least $1 billion. 
We also declared our first dividend in Q2, demonstrating our confidence in the business. 
And fourth, we remain laser-focused on ensuring that we position Carrier to emerge stronger from this pandemic. We are accelerating implementation of our strategic initiatives and investing in 2 key emerging trends: healthy, safe and sustainable buildings and cold chain solutions. The COVID pandemic has underscored the role of buildings in helping ensure public health, and we moved quickly to launch our Healthy Buildings Program. You see on Slide 3, where we stand on all our overall strategic priorities and our progress as a public company. As a stand-alone company, we launched the Carrier Operating System and the Carrier Way and both are yielding early results. Our operating system includes a disciplined global deployment of lean in our factories. 
I was recently in our Charlotte factory, and it was night and day versus a year ago. In just 1 year, our efficiency in that factory has improved by almost 15%. Our quality has improved by over 25%, and our on-time delivery improved from 85% to 95% despite the challenging environment. The Carrier Way speaks to our behaviors, culture and values. There is a new energy within Carrier that is focused on customers, winning agility, speed and innovation. And that combination is resulting in some key new wins. And as we advance in our mission of creating solutions that matter for people and our planet, we recently released our first ESG report that highlights our progress on our environmental targets, our commitment to effective and ethical corporate governance, actions to significantly improve our diversity and inclusion and helping to establish Carrier as the employer of choice. ESG is not a side activity at Carrier. It's core to our business, always has been, and we take pride in being leaders in this effort. 
We've also been consistent in focusing on our 3 strategic pillars to drive sustained growth. In order to strengthen and grow our core business, which is our first pillar, we continue to invest in R&D, salespeople and digital. We originally plan to spend an incremental $150 million in these 3 key areas this year. And after COVID hit, we scaled it back to $75 million. As we said, our incremental strategic investments would increase as we achieve more traction during the year. So with our improved outlook, we are bringing our incremental strategic investments up to approximately $100 million for this year. 
In terms of innovation, we continue to drive key new product introductions. For example, in Q2, we launched the Infinity 26 air conditioner and Infinity 24 heat pump that have the highest energy efficiency ratings amongst all ducted systems. Carrier Transicold launched its innovative vector multi-temperature trailer refrigeration unit that addresses a key market need and initial demand has been very positive. And in our Fire & Security business, Kidde is launching new TruSense smoke detectors that are first-to-market compliant with the new UL standards and will significantly reduce nuisance alarms. And we are on track to add the 500 sales and support people that we previously planned. 
In our second pillar, which includes geographic expansion, we continue to make strong progress in China, with a key VRF win with the Sanya International Sports Industrial Park and also in China, our GST fire business had an important win with Zhongshan Lu's 1.3 million square foot commercial complex. 
And in the third pillar, driving aftermarket and digital. We introduced the BlueEdge Service Platform providing customized tiered solutions across the business. We remain on track to achieving 30% attachment rates in our commercial HVAC business this year helped by the launch of our AssuranceONE program and digitally enabled life cycle offerings are a clear focus for us, and we're seeing traction. Our new digital platform for our residential and commercial national accounts achieved $100 million in e-commerce revenues in June. Our Supra business signed a contract with 6 St. Louis Area Realtor Associations to provide subscription-based access solutions to over 9,500 key holders. And British supermarket retailer Asda signed a long-term support and telematics deal in conjunction with its order of more than 165 Carrier Transicold vector refrigeration units. And we are truly leaning in on the global imperative around healthy and safe buildings. We have a comprehensive product offering that includes all aspects of indoor air quality, including filtration, ventilation and humidity, along with sensing and controls. We've complemented this with our Fire & Security portfolio to include touchless and traceability offerings. 
And our LenelS2 business announced a strategic collaboration with FLIR Systems, the world's largest and leading company specializing in thermal imaging cameras, where we will resell FLIR's EST thermal imaging screening solutions with LenelS2's OnGuard access control system. We are integrating these multiple healthy and safe building offerings to provide our 7 targeted verticals with a one-stop-shop solution. Society needs confidence in the safety and health of indoor environments, and customers are increasingly turning to Carrier for critical solutions as they reopen. 
As recent proof points, we signed a healthy buildings deal with Cushman & Wakefield to collaborate on deploying leading-edge Carrier solutions. And we are working with Emory University to upgrade IAQ sensing and controls in their intelligent building focused on customer health and experience. We continue to fund these exciting growth initiatives through tenacious progress on Carrier 600 and G&A transformation. We remain focused on our overall business simplification that makes us more agile and externally focused. We launched Carrier Alliance to reduce our 6,000 suppliers and align with fewer, more strategic partners. We are reviewing our 58 JVs for opportunities to improve our focus on growth initiatives. We have approved a project in our commercial HVAC business to digitize our internal and customer-facing interface points in our European operations. And we are assessing our overall back-office footprint for reduction and consolidation by moving to a back-office shared service center of excellence model. So lots of exciting progress strategically. 
Let me give you some color on orders on Page 4. We shared trends back in Q1 that showed the U.S. and Europe still struggling, while China had returned to prior year levels. Here, we show detailed color on what we're seeing in this very fluid environment. Recall that the U.S. and EU make up 80% of our sales. In those regions, April and May were weak as expected, with April orders down 25% and May down 15% year-over-year on a combined basis. The surprise was the strength of U.S. orders in June, up 40% from last year. U.S. strength was led by resi, where we saw orders up 100% in June, helped by an increase in cooling degree days, pent-up demand and suppressed inventory levels. Also, in the U.S., Fire & Security products orders grew in the high single digits in June after being down 30% to 40% in April and May, and commercial HVAC orders were up low single digits in the U.S. in June after being down 25% in April and May. 
The encouraging trends that we saw in June have carried forward to July, where U.S. and China orders have been up more than 20%. The EU orders have been down modestly compared to last year, while South Asia remains very challenged. But despite a couple of good months of order trends, COVID cases continue to rise and economic visibility is uncertain. Therefore, we will continue to focus on what we control. Effectively managing the business during times of uncertainty and volatility and remaining flexible and opportunistic. 
With that, let me turn it over to Tim, and I'll come back to summarize before we open it up for Q&A."

June, however, saw a significant pickup in activity in the U.S. as the economy reopened. That led to a substantial improvement in demand in North America residential HVAC, residential fire, and North America trailer. 
Due to the strong North America shipments in June, sales of almost $4 billion for the quarter were better than we had anticipated. They were, however, still down 20% compared to last year due to the COVID-related shutdowns. And we continue to expect that the Q2 year-on-year sales decline will be the low point for the year. 
GAAP operating profit was $442 million. Adjusted operating profit of $476 million was down 42% from last year. The COVID-related volume and factory inefficiency pressure were partially offset by our aggressive cost actions. Our decremental margin was 34%. Absent some onetime items, the decremental margins would have been closer to 30%. 
Our Q2 GAAP EPS was $0.30 and adjusted EPS was $0.33. Since we were not a public company last year, the year-over-year comparisons are not meaningful. Our free cash flow was considerably higher than our expectations. This was largely attributable to favorable earnings and timing benefits in working capital and also the timing of other payments. These results were higher than would normally be reflected in our seasonal pattern. So all things considered, our performance in the second quarter was better than we would have expected in a very difficult environment. 
Let's now look at how the segments performed. Please turn to Slide 6. And note that the year-over-year numbers I will refer to on this slide are organic comparisons. The HVAC segment sales were down 15% from last year. Within the segment, North America residential sales were down 13%. As mentioned earlier, the opening up of many states, combined with the warmer weather, led to a substantial pickup in the month of June. We exited the quarter with a backlog about twice last year's level and inventories in the field down about 25%. So we expect strengths to continue in the third quarter. The commercial HVAC business was down 17% with declines in most of the businesses. We saw a decline of around 20% in light commercial, a low double-digit decline in applied and a mid-teens decline in the services business. China sales were up high single digits in the quarter, but South Asia was weak, especially in India, which was heavily impacted by a prolonged lockdown. 
Applied sales were down less than overall commercial HVAC due to entering this slowdown with a healthy backlog in this longer cycle business. Light commercial was down more than the group because 80% of light commercial is replacement, and many of those units are having very light-duty, if at all. We did start to see an improvement in demand toward the end of the quarter as the markets began to reopen. This is an encouraging sign, but we still expect it to remain down year-over-year in the second half. 
Now over to Refrigeration, where sales were down 25%. North America truck/trailer was down about 50%. Europe truck/trailer was down close to 30% and container was down about 10%. We have, however, seen improved order activity with almost a tripling of the average weekly order rates from May to June for North America trailer. Container order activity was also encouraging in June. These are cyclical businesses that were declining from last year but the recent activities suggest this Q2 could be the bottom for those markets. 
Commercial refrigeration was down almost 20%, with weakness in Europe that more than offset a mid-teens increase in China. But we are encouraged to see order and quotation activity improving in both geographies. 
The Fire & Security segment was down 22%. The products business was down consistent with the segment. Declines in the Americas and Europe were partially offset by a recovery in China. We did see sequential improvement through the quarter as the declines in April and May tempered somewhat in June. The point-of-sale data for our residential fire products improved in June, and we expect that to continue into Q3. The field business was down 23% due to March lockdowns across virtually all regions, with particular weakness in Europe and Asia. While about 40% of this business is recurring, having no or limited access to sites did put pressure on the installation and service portion of the business. Bottom line, there were some encouraging signs in several of our businesses in the back half of the quarter. But with the ever-changing environment, we remain flexible as an organization and ready to pivot as needed to market conditions. So we remain focused on controlling the controllables and an aggressive cost containment actions that will help us fund investments to position ourselves for future growth. 
Please turn to Slide 7. I will provide an update on our cost programs. In our Q1 call, we told you that we were taking aggressive cost actions in response to the economic weakness caused by the pandemic. We accelerated Carrier 600 savings, reduced investment spending and initiated a $300 million cost containment program. These actions will more than offset the productivity and absorption impact from the lower volume by $250 million. Through the first half, the savings are tracking ahead of the pace of those for full year targets. Our intense focus on managing through the crisis in Q2 resulted in lighter investment spend in the quarter. As the markets recover and our results improve, we plan to restore some of the earlier investment cutbacks. 
We still expect to generate net savings of $250 million. But we have upped the 2020 target for Carrier 600 by $25 million and expect to redirect that increment to restore investments in R&D, sales force and digital. These are expected to support growth in 2021 and to enable us to capitalize on some of the market trends emerging from the crisis. 
Continuing on Slide 8. As Dave mentioned, one of our top priorities for 2020 is to maintain ample liquidity. We performed well from a cash flow standpoint in the quarter and for the first half. The better-than-expected earnings, tightly managed working capital, aided by some timing benefits led to much stronger cash flows for the first half than we had expected. 
On our first quarter call, we showed you our cash balance walk from the beginning of the year. With our favorable cash flow in Q2 and the issuance of $750 million in bonds, we ended the quarter with $2.7 billion in cash. We were able to modify the covenants in our term loan and revolving credit agreement. Together with the bond issuance, the modifications further enhanced our liquidity and financial flexibility during this pandemic. 
With this solid cash balance and undrawn revolver and expected cash flow, we feel quite good about our liquidity and are confident we have access to the capital we need to weather this storm and to operate and grow the business. We told you last quarter, we would assess the timing and level of our dividend. In June, our Board declared an $0.08 per share dividend, which was paid just last week. 
Please turn to Slide 9, and I'll review our outlook. On our Q1 call, we discussed a number of scenarios based on a combination of macroeconomic projections like GDP, indicators more directly tied to our business like new housing starts, order trends, reasonable expectations as the severity and duration of the crisis and likely recovery path. In light of our more favorable second quarter performance, combined with a broader improvement in the market conditions, we are raising the bottom end of our prior outlook range for full year 2020. We now expect sales between $15.5 billion and $17 billion, given the pleasant surprise of a stronger demand in June, especially in the Americas. This raises the lower end by $500 million.
We also increased the bottom end of the adjusted operating profit range by $100 million, and are now projecting adjusted operating profit to be between $1.8 billion and $2 billion. And as mentioned earlier, we have taken this opportunity to restore $25 million of the investment cutbacks we announced in the Q1 call. This is consistent with our comments at that time that the pace and timing of bringing it back would track the recovery.
Lastly, while much of the Q2 cash flow favorability was due to timing, we are now comfortable projecting at least $1.1 billion of free cash flow this year, up from at least $1 billion identified in our previous outlook. This comes even after restoring some of the capital spending reductions we made earlier in the year. Capital spending is now expected to be in the $250 million to $275 million range compared to the prior $200 million to $225 million as we invest for future growth.
We continue to reiterate that our outlook expects the current momentum in orders and sales to continue. One additional note is that a number of the items you may need to bridge the adjusted operating profit, the EPS, such as interest expense, tax rates and share count are in the appendix of this presentation.
With that, let me turn it back over to Dave to say a few words before we open up for your questions."

And a lot of that strength in orders has continued into July where resi orders in July have continued to be extremely strong, north of 50% year-over-year. The inventory levels at our distributors ending last quarter were down about 25%. So we're really -- we started the quarter with low inventory levels at our distributors. We've done our best to react to this very strong demand that we saw coming into July. That's continued into June. That's continued into July. So we feel pretty well set up for 3Q. The biggest challenge we have right now is supporting that demand operationally and with our logistics team."

We're more heavily weighted towards OE versus service on the applied side. When we look back at 2Q and then we'll kind of look forward with you. We feel on the applied side that we had strength in the U.S. and China, I think in terms of share, we felt positive. We had committed, Chris had committed to getting us to #1 within 5 years, which really looks at about 50 bps of improvement a year, and we felt pretty positive about the share gains that we saw in the U.S. and China. We lagged in Europe, and we need to fix that, and we will. But we felt positive about U.S. and China on the OE side.
Services is an area where when we look at it, some of our peers had a quicker jump on that trend than we did. So we're playing a little bit of catch-up there. There's a lot of focus, a lot of momentum. We're putting the framework in place to really lean forward on services. But that's an area that there's a huge opportunity ahead. When you look at some of the macro trends overall, ABI is a really good leading indicator, of course, the Architectural Billing Index, you want that north of 50. It had been north of 50. Coming into March, April, May, it dropped down into the 30s. And then June, it was back up to 40s. So a positive trend there, and we'll see if that bodes well as we look out 6 months. Light commercial was pretty rugged in April and May. It's started to show a better signs of progress as we got into June and July, but that for us is 80-20 on replacement over OE. So we're starting to see more activity in the light commercial space, but some of those end markets remained challenged."

And the second one is really an accounting adjustment to our long-term liabilities is about 3%. So that brings you back to kind of the target 30% that we usually expect to see.
With respect to the second half, again, if you do the calculations, I mean, we are -- we would prefer not to -- for everybody to assume that we will be at the midpoint of each of the sales, operating income, et cetera. But if you did take that, you would calculate probably a 45% decremental and about 10 percentage points of that is attributable to investments. You recall, so I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we really -- if you think about it, we didn't do much as we're part of UTC in the first quarter. Second quarter, we were quite distracted by responding to the COVID crisis and our customers and keeping our employees safe, et cetera, that Dave mentioned. So we spent very lightly on those investments. So the majority of what we had said was $75 million, now incremented by $25 million, so $100 million in the second half of the year is about 10 percentage points. And the remainder, about 5% to bring us down to that 30% range would be attributable to the public company costs that will step-up in the second half of the year as we particularly exit a lot of the TSAs and so forth from United Technologies and digital spend, et cetera."

We're seeing it with some of our touchless offerings. We're seeing it -- even last night, we announced this partnership with FLIR, where we're going to be reselling their thermal imaging camera capabilities, and we're going to integrate that into the BlueDiamond app. So when you look at a holistic set of one-stop-shop ecosystem of healthy buildings, the Fire & Security product portfolio fits very, very well.

We're using bipolar ionization, and we have capabilities around UVC. So we have a pretty comprehensive portfolio when it comes to filtration. But the same comes with our ability to do customized ventilation approaches because it is very application-specific. And the same with controlling humidity levels. Then you get into the controls, and we have our ALC business that has a controls capability. And then when you integrate all of the HVAC and sensing and controls capability that we have there with our Fire & Security portfolio, and then you can make it a one-stop shop for customers through a natural interface point, where, as you picture walking into a restaurant, and you look at a computer screen, it can give you a red, yellow, green on all aspects of that healthy and safe indoor environment. So we can provide the controls, we can provide the user interface experience for our customers, whether it's through the control system or an overlay control system. We have the ability to connect the dots, I think, in a fairly unique way for our customers."

So we continue to leverage that to maximize the amount of ambient air. When COVID hit, we started to use more bipolar ionization. We have a relationship with a company called GPS. So we implemented their capabilities in our filtration system there. It's combined with a HEPA filter as well. So we've been using this building to really validate a lot of our apps. So we have our BlueDiamond app. That's part of our LenelS2 business. And what we're hearing from our employees in this building because right now, for office employees at Carrier, it's still voluntary whether to come back to the office. But we're seeing an uptake in people coming back to the office because they know we're investing in the health and safety of the indoor environment. They see it when they get their temperature taken when they come in, in the morning. They can see it through their app interfaces.

Here is the quick summary. The second quarter was better than we expected, driven by our continued cost reduction actions, progress on our top line initiatives and improvement in the U.S. in June. We are raising",1683,"Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. Here is the quick summary. The second quarter was better than we expected, driven by our continued cost reduction actions, progress on our top line initiatives and improvement in the U.S. in June. We are raising the low end of our prior outlook for sales, adjusted operating profit and cash flow enabling us to add back some targeted growth investments that we had previously scaled back. 
Before we get into details on our Q2 results and the outlook for the rest of the year, let me start with some context. Slide 2 shows the 4 priorities that we established at the outset of the COVID pandemic. Our team has continued to respond aggressively and effectively on all of them. It starts with protecting and supporting our people. Our operations and field teams have continued in the workplace with limited interruption, and we have gone to great lengths to ensure a safe environment for our people. We have distributed 2.5 million masks, instituted thermal screening for 100% of our employees at our scale locations and deployed Carrier's Healthy Building Program solution in our facilities to provide our people with a safe and environment as we possibly can. 
Our second priority has been to maintain business continuity to support our customers. While we experienced some short-term shutdowns. By the end of the second quarter, our factories and suppliers had resumed operations, and we are now more than 95% of our production capacity availability. 
Our third priority is to effectively manage cost and cash. Carrier 600, our program targeting $600 million of run rate savings within 3 years had initially targeted $175 million of savings in 2020. After 1Q, we increased that to $225 million of savings this year, and we are now tracking to $250 million of recurring in your savings. We also announced onetime cost actions of $300 million. We remain on track there, delivering $115 million in Q2. 
On cash, we have close to $5 billion of liquidity. We have $2.7 billion in cash on the balance sheet, and we have access to a $2 billion revolver. With updated covenants on that revolver and our term loan, we are very comfortable with our liquidity position. We are pleased that Q2 cash flow was materially higher than we had internally projected, and we are now comfortable projecting at least $1.1 billion of free cash flow, up from our prior estimate of at least $1 billion. 
We also declared our first dividend in Q2, demonstrating our confidence in the business. 
And fourth, we remain laser-focused on ensuring that we position Carrier to emerge stronger from this pandemic. We are accelerating implementation of our strategic initiatives and investing in 2 key emerging trends: healthy, safe and sustainable buildings and cold chain solutions. The COVID pandemic has underscored the role of buildings in helping ensure public health, and we moved quickly to launch our Healthy Buildings Program. You see on Slide 3, where we stand on all our overall strategic priorities and our progress as a public company. As a stand-alone company, we launched the Carrier Operating System and the Carrier Way and both are yielding early results. Our operating system includes a disciplined global deployment of lean in our factories. 
I was recently in our Charlotte factory, and it was night and day versus a year ago. In just 1 year, our efficiency in that factory has improved by almost 15%. Our quality has improved by over 25%, and our on-time delivery improved from 85% to 95% despite the challenging environment. The Carrier Way speaks to our behaviors, culture and values. There is a new energy within Carrier that is focused on customers, winning agility, speed and innovation. And that combination is resulting in some key new wins. And as we advance in our mission of creating solutions that matter for people and our planet, we recently released our first ESG report that highlights our progress on our environmental targets, our commitment to effective and ethical corporate governance, actions to significantly improve our diversity and inclusion and helping to establish Carrier as the employer of choice. ESG is not a side activity at Carrier. It's core to our business, always has been, and we take pride in being leaders in this effort. 
We've also been consistent in focusing on our 3 strategic pillars to drive sustained growth. In order to strengthen and grow our core business, which is our first pillar, we continue to invest in R&D, salespeople and digital. We originally plan to spend an incremental $150 million in these 3 key areas this year. And after COVID hit, we scaled it back to $75 million. As we said, our incremental strategic investments would increase as we achieve more traction during the year. So with our improved outlook, we are bringing our incremental strategic investments up to approximately $100 million for this year. 
In terms of innovation, we continue to drive key new product introductions. For example, in Q2, we launched the Infinity 26 air conditioner and Infinity 24 heat pump that have the highest energy efficiency ratings amongst all ducted systems. Carrier Transicold launched its innovative vector multi-temperature trailer refrigeration unit that addresses a key market need and initial demand has been very positive. And in our Fire & Security business, Kidde is launching new TruSense smoke detectors that are first-to-market compliant with the new UL standards and will significantly reduce nuisance alarms. And we are on track to add the 500 sales and support people that we previously planned. 
In our second pillar, which includes geographic expansion, we continue to make strong progress in China, with a key VRF win with the Sanya International Sports Industrial Park and also in China, our GST fire business had an important win with Zhongshan Lu's 1.3 million square foot commercial complex. 
And in the third pillar, driving aftermarket and digital. We introduced the BlueEdge Service Platform providing customized tiered solutions across the business. We remain on track to achieving 30% attachment rates in our commercial HVAC business this year helped by the launch of our AssuranceONE program and digitally enabled life cycle offerings are a clear focus for us, and we're seeing traction. Our new digital platform for our residential and commercial national accounts achieved $100 million in e-commerce revenues in June. Our Supra business signed a contract with 6 St. Louis Area Realtor Associations to provide subscription-based access solutions to over 9,500 key holders. And British supermarket retailer Asda signed a long-term support and telematics deal in conjunction with its order of more than 165 Carrier Transicold vector refrigeration units. And we are truly leaning in on the global imperative around healthy and safe buildings. We have a comprehensive product offering that includes all aspects of indoor air quality, including filtration, ventilation and humidity, along with sensing and controls. We've complemented this with our Fire & Security portfolio to include touchless and traceability offerings. 
And our LenelS2 business announced a strategic collaboration with FLIR Systems, the world's largest and leading company specializing in thermal imaging cameras, where we will resell FLIR's EST thermal imaging screening solutions with LenelS2's OnGuard access control system. We are integrating these multiple healthy and safe building offerings to provide our 7 targeted verticals with a one-stop-shop solution. Society needs confidence in the safety and health of indoor environments, and customers are increasingly turning to Carrier for critical solutions as they reopen. 
As recent proof points, we signed a healthy buildings deal with Cushman & Wakefield to collaborate on deploying leading-edge Carrier solutions. And we are working with Emory University to upgrade IAQ sensing and controls in their intelligent building focused on customer health and experience. We continue to fund these exciting growth initiatives through tenacious progress on Carrier 600 and G&A transformation. We remain focused on our overall business simplification that makes us more agile and externally focused. We launched Carrier Alliance to reduce our 6,000 suppliers and align with fewer, more strategic partners. We are reviewing our 58 JVs for opportunities to improve our focus on growth initiatives. We have approved a project in our commercial HVAC business to digitize our internal and customer-facing interface points in our European operations. And we are assessing our overall back-office footprint for reduction and consolidation by moving to a back-office shared service center of excellence model. So lots of exciting progress strategically. 
Let me give you some color on orders on Page 4. We shared trends back in Q1 that showed the U.S. and Europe still struggling, while China had returned to prior year levels. Here, we show detailed color on what we're seeing in this very fluid environment. Recall that the U.S. and EU make up 80% of our sales. In those regions, April and May were weak as expected, with April orders down 25% and May down 15% year-over-year on a combined basis. The surprise was the strength of U.S. orders in June, up 40% from last year. U.S. strength was led by resi, where we saw orders up 100% in June, helped by an increase in cooling degree days, pent-up demand and suppressed inventory levels. Also, in the U.S., Fire & Security products orders grew in the high single digits in June after being down 30% to 40% in April and May, and commercial HVAC orders were up low single digits in the U.S. in June after being down 25% in April and May. 
The encouraging trends that we saw in June have carried forward to July, where U.S. and China orders have been up more than 20%. The EU orders have been down modestly compared to last year, while South Asia remains very challenged. But despite a couple of good months of order trends, COVID cases continue to rise and economic visibility is uncertain. Therefore, we will continue to focus on what we control. Effectively managing the business during times of uncertainty and volatility and remaining flexible and opportunistic. 
With that, let me turn it over to Tim, and I'll come back to summarize before we open it up for Q&A."

June, however, saw a significant pickup in activity in the U.S. as the economy reopened. That led to a substantial improvement in demand in North America residential HVAC, residential fire, and North America trailer. 
Due to the strong North America shipments in June, sales of almost $4 billion for the quarter were better than we had anticipated. They were, however, still down 20% compared to last year due to the COVID-related shutdowns. And we continue to expect that the Q2 year-on-year sales decline will be the low point for the year. 
GAAP operating profit was $442 million. Adjusted operating profit of $476 million was down 42% from last year. The COVID-related volume and factory inefficiency pressure were partially offset by our aggressive cost actions. Our decremental margin was 34%. Absent some onetime items, the decremental margins would have been closer to 30%. 
Our Q2 GAAP EPS was $0.30 and adjusted EPS was $0.33. Since we were not a public company last year, the year-over-year comparisons are not meaningful. Our free cash flow was considerably higher than our expectations. This was largely attributable to favorable earnings and timing benefits in working capital and also the timing of other payments. These results were higher than would normally be reflected in our seasonal pattern. So all things considered, our performance in the second quarter was better than we would have expected in a very difficult environment. 
Let's now look at how the segments performed. Please turn to Slide 6. And note that the year-over-year numbers I will refer to on this slide are organic comparisons. The HVAC segment sales were down 15% from last year. Within the segment, North America residential sales were down 13%. As mentioned earlier, the opening up of many states, combined with the warmer weather, led to a substantial pickup in the month of June. We exited the quarter with a backlog about twice last year's level and inventories in the field down about 25%. So we expect strengths to continue in the third quarter. The commercial HVAC business was down 17% with declines in most of the businesses. We saw a decline of around 20% in light commercial, a low double-digit decline in applied and a mid-teens decline in the services business. China sales were up high single digits in the quarter, but South Asia was weak, especially in India, which was heavily impacted by a prolonged lockdown. 
Applied sales were down less than overall commercial HVAC due to entering this slowdown with a healthy backlog in this longer cycle business. Light commercial was down more than the group because 80% of light commercial is replacement, and many of those units are having very light-duty, if at all. We did start to see an improvement in demand toward the end of the quarter as the markets began to reopen. This is an encouraging sign, but we still expect it to remain down year-over-year in the second half. 
Now over to Refrigeration, where sales were down 25%. North America truck/trailer was down about 50%. Europe truck/trailer was down close to 30% and container was down about 10%. We have, however, seen improved order activity with almost a tripling of the average weekly order rates from May to June for North America trailer. Container order activity was also encouraging in June. These are cyclical businesses that were declining from last year but the recent activities suggest this Q2 could be the bottom for those markets. 
Commercial refrigeration was down almost 20%, with weakness in Europe that more than offset a mid-teens increase in China. But we are encouraged to see order and quotation activity improving in both geographies. 
The Fire & Security segment was down 22%. The products business was down consistent with the segment. Declines in the Americas and Europe were partially offset by a recovery in China. We did see sequential improvement through the quarter as the declines in April and May tempered somewhat in June. The point-of-sale data for our residential fire products improved in June, and we expect that to continue into Q3. The field business was down 23% due to March lockdowns across virtually all regions, with particular weakness in Europe and Asia. While about 40% of this business is recurring, having no or limited access to sites did put pressure on the installation and service portion of the business. Bottom line, there were some encouraging signs in several of our businesses in the back half of the quarter. But with the ever-changing environment, we remain flexible as an organization and ready to pivot as needed to market conditions. So we remain focused on controlling the controllables and an aggressive cost containment actions that will help us fund investments to position ourselves for future growth. 
Please turn to Slide 7. I will provide an update on our cost programs. In our Q1 call, we told you that we were taking aggressive cost actions in response to the economic weakness caused by the pandemic. We accelerated Carrier 600 savings, reduced investment spending and initiated a $300 million cost containment program. These actions will more than offset the productivity and absorption impact from the lower volume by $250 million. Through the first half, the savings are tracking ahead of the pace of those for full year targets. Our intense focus on managing through the crisis in Q2 resulted in lighter investment spend in the quarter. As the markets recover and our results improve, we plan to restore some of the earlier investment cutbacks. 
We still expect to generate net savings of $250 million. But we have upped the 2020 target for Carrier 600 by $25 million and expect to redirect that increment to restore investments in R&D, sales force and digital. These are expected to support growth in 2021 and to enable us to capitalize on some of the market trends emerging from the crisis. 
Continuing on Slide 8. As Dave mentioned, one of our top priorities for 2020 is to maintain ample liquidity. We performed well from a cash flow standpoint in the quarter and for the first half. The better-than-expected earnings, tightly managed working capital, aided by some timing benefits led to much stronger cash flows for the first half than we had expected. 
On our first quarter call, we showed you our cash balance walk from the beginning of the year. With our favorable cash flow in Q2 and the issuance of $750 million in bonds, we ended the quarter with $2.7 billion in cash. We were able to modify the covenants in our term loan and revolving credit agreement. Together with the bond issuance, the modifications further enhanced our liquidity and financial flexibility during this pandemic. 
With this solid cash balance and undrawn revolver and expected cash flow, we feel quite good about our liquidity and are confident we have access to the capital we need to weather this storm and to operate and grow the business. We told you last quarter, we would assess the timing and level of our dividend. In June, our Board declared an $0.08 per share dividend, which was paid just last week. 
Please turn to Slide 9, and I'll review our outlook. On our Q1 call, we discussed a number of scenarios based on a combination of macroeconomic projections like GDP, indicators more directly tied to our business like new housing starts, order trends, reasonable expectations as the severity and duration of the crisis and likely recovery path. In light of our more favorable second quarter performance, combined with a broader improvement in the market conditions, we are raising the bottom end of our prior outlook range for full year 2020. We now expect sales between $15.5 billion and $17 billion, given the pleasant surprise of a stronger demand in June, especially in the Americas. This raises the lower end by $500 million.
We also increased the bottom end of the adjusted operating profit range by $100 million, and are now projecting adjusted operating profit to be between $1.8 billion and $2 billion. And as mentioned earlier, we have taken this opportunity to restore $25 million of the investment cutbacks we announced in the Q1 call. This is consistent with our comments at that time that the pace and timing of bringing it back would track the recovery.
Lastly, while much of the Q2 cash flow favorability was due to timing, we are now comfortable projecting at least $1.1 billion of free cash flow this year, up from at least $1 billion identified in our previous outlook. This comes even after restoring some of the capital spending reductions we made earlier in the year. Capital spending is now expected to be in the $250 million to $275 million range compared to the prior $200 million to $225 million as we invest for future growth.
We continue to reiterate that our outlook expects the current momentum in orders and sales to continue. One additional note is that a number of the items you may need to bridge the adjusted operating profit, the EPS, such as interest expense, tax rates and share count are in the appendix of this presentation.
With that, let me turn it back over to Dave to say a few words before we open up for your questions."

That enables us to increase the low end of our previous outlook while investing more in the second half to position us for growth in 2021 and 2022.
Key trends around healthy, safe and sustainable buildings and cold chain solutions positioned Carrier well for sustained growth. We feel confident in our medium-term outlook of mid-single-digit sales growth, high single-digit EPS growth and cash flow equal to net income.
With that, we'll open this up for questions."

So when you look at the share numbers from AHRI, you're really comparing the sales from our distributors direct to the dealer network, comparing to some of our competitors that ship direct. What was very encouraging to us is a few things coming out of the quarter. Number one, as I mentioned in the remarks, June was the highest orders month that we've had in our company's history, it was plus 100%. And a lot of that strength in orders has continued into July where resi orders in July have continued to be extremely strong, north of 50% year-over-year. The inventory levels at our distributors ending last quarter were down about 25%. So we're really -- we started the quarter with low inventory levels at our distributors. We've done our best to react to this very strong demand that we saw coming into July. That's continued into June. That's continued into July. So we feel pretty well set up for 3Q. The biggest challenge we have right now is supporting that demand operationally and with our logistics team."

We're more heavily weighted towards OE versus service on the applied side. When we look back at 2Q and then we'll kind of look forward with you. We feel on the applied side that we had strength in the U.S. and China, I think in terms of share, we felt positive. We had committed, Chris had committed to getting us to #1 within 5 years, which really looks at about 50 bps of improvement a year, and we felt pretty positive about the share gains that we saw in the U.S. and China. We lagged in Europe, and we need to fix that, and we will. But we felt positive about U.S. and China on the OE side.
Services is an area where when we look at it, some of our peers had a quicker jump on that trend than we did. So we're playing a little bit of catch-up there. There's a lot of focus, a lot of momentum. We're putting the framework in place to really lean forward on services. But that's an area that there's a huge opportunity ahead. When you look at some of the macro trends overall, ABI is a really good leading indicator, of course, the Architectural Billing Index, you want that north of 50. It had been north of 50. Coming into March, April, May, it dropped down into the 30s. And then June, it was back up to 40s. So a positive trend there, and we'll see if that bodes well as we look out 6 months. Light commercial was pretty rugged in April and May. It's started to show a better signs of progress as we got into June and July, but that for us is 80-20 on replacement over OE. So we're starting to see more activity in the light commercial space, but some of those end markets remained challenged."

And the second one is really an accounting adjustment to our long-term liabilities is about 3%. So that brings you back to kind of the target 30% that we usually expect to see.
With respect to the second half, again, if you do the calculations, I mean, we are -- we would prefer not to -- for everybody to assume that we will be at the midpoint of each of the sales, operating income, et cetera. But if you did take that, you would calculate probably a 45% decremental and about 10 percentage points of that is attributable to investments. You recall, so I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we really -- if you think about it, we didn't do much as we're part of UTC in the first quarter. Second quarter, we were quite distracted by responding to the COVID crisis and our customers and keeping our employees safe, et cetera, that Dave mentioned. So we spent very lightly on those investments. So the majority of what we had said was $75 million, now incremented by $25 million, so $100 million in the second half of the year is about 10 percentage points. And the remainder, about 5% to bring us down to that 30% range would be attributable to the public company costs that will step-up in the second half of the year as we particularly exit a lot of the TSAs and so forth from United Technologies and digital spend, et cetera."

Phase 2, which you saw with FLIR last night is we're starting to add partners and fill other gaps into the ecosystem. So Carrier does become the go-to place for healthy and safe indoor environments."

So we continue to leverage that to maximize the amount of ambient air. When COVID hit, we started to use more bipolar ionization. We have a relationship with a company called GPS. So we implemented their capabilities in our filtration system there. It's combined with a HEPA filter as well. So we've been using this building to really validate a lot of our apps. So we have our BlueDiamond app. That's part of our LenelS2 business. And what we're hearing from our employees in this building because right now, for office employees at Carrier, it's still voluntary whether to come back to the office. But we're seeing an uptake in people coming back to the office because they know we're investing in the health and safety of the indoor environment.

Before we get going, let me first comment on the upcoming CFO transition that we announced last week. Patrick Goris, currently the CFO of Rockwell Automation, will be joining us as our CFO in a couple of weeks. At that point, Tim will take on the role of senior adviser, helping us with a smooth transition to Patrick, and taking on specific key projects until his retirement in mid-February. For context, when we hired Tim, he was very clear with us, that his role would be to help effectively stand us up as a public company, including building the finance team and function, strengthening the balance sheet, helping us establish our strategic priorities, working with the rating agencies and investment community and charting the course for his successor. Doing all that and more, Tim has been the perfect CFO at the perfect time. I can't thank him enough for everything he has done for me personally and for Carrier. After a thorough search, I could not be happier to have Patrick joining us. I suspect most of you know him well. During his time at Rockwell, Patrick transformed the finance function, helped drive industry-leading top and bottom line performance and a shift toward a recurring revenue model, and he was instrumental in guiding strategic capital allocation and portfolio optimization. We look forward to welcoming Patrick to the Carrier team. 
With that, please turn to Slide 2, where I'll discuss our Q3 highlights. In short, Q3 was a very encouraging quarter. Sales of $5 billion were up 4% year-over-year and substantially exceeded our expectations. Adjusted operating profit was up 6% year-over-year. We had strong incrementals in the quarter, putting our reported year-to-date decrementals at 30%, but operationally at 26%, factoring in the $53 million of additional public company costs. Our performance was driven by continued strength in North America residential HVAC, which was up 46% in the quarter, and by continued traction on our cost and growth initiatives. In resi, this was our highest quarter ever for both sales and operating profit. We are pleased with our free cash flow generation in the quarter, which was $880 million, primarily driven by higher net income and better working capital performance, and we realized $300 million of cash before taxes from our sale of 9 million shares in bare. We continue to aggressively reduce costs via a strategic disciplined approach, including reducing G&A and simplifying the back office. As a result, we are now raising Carrier 600 to Carrier 700, which calls for $700 million of recurring cost takeout by the end of 2022. This will allow us to fund investments in growth, while driving margin expansion. We remain on track to invest an incremental $100 million in growth initiatives this year. 
Based on our Q3 strength, we are again raising our 2020 full year outlook on sales, adjusted operating profit and free cash flow. Given that we had $3.8 billion of cash at the end of the quarter, we plan to pay down $1.5 billion of debt in the fourth quarter. Next year, we expect to do more while supporting our dividend and preserving flexibility for M&A opportunities. 
Pivoting now to Slide 3 on our progress on our overall priorities. We put in place a playbook that is gaining traction. Adoption of the Carrier way has created a profound cultural transformation, which is resulting in an agile, innovative, aggressive, winning focused organization, all of which is helping fuel our growth agenda. It starts with ensuring a performance culture, putting our customers first, and through a rigorous deployment of Carrier excellence in our supplier excellence program, our on-time delivery has increased to 96%, and our quality and performance has improved 30% year-to-date. We continue to invest in our growth initiatives. We have added an incremental 450 sales and sales support personnel this year, and have introduced a number of innovative offerings, including the first fully autonomous, all-electric, engineless refrigerated trailer system in Europe, and a new multipurpose cloud connected commercial fire detector that combines smoke detection with advanced sensing capabilities. And in terms of services, aftermarket and digital initiatives, our commercial HVAC business closed the quarter at a 27% attachment rate globally, on track to achieve 30% by the end of this year. We have signed over 300 BlueEdge contracts since the program launched in June. We are also continuing to drive connected offerings across the network. For example, in the commercial refrigeration business, we completed a very successful pilot on our condition-based maintenance program, improving uptime by about 33% and  improving technician productivity by over 20%. In Fire & Security, our Kidde Fire Systems business shipped its first orders for IntelliSite, a remote health monitoring service for industrial fire alarm and suppression system control units. At a Carrier enterprise level, we are truly leaning into the emerging trends around healthy, safe and sustainable building and cold chain solutions, which you'll see on Slide 4. 
Starting with healthy, safe and sustainable buildings. Our strategy here is to be the leading one-stop shop provider, which is driving strong customer interest and new product introductions that continue to gain traction. We obtained independent validation through a rigorous testing process that our Infinity air purifiers capture and kill technology inactivates 99% of coronavirus trapped on the filter, the first of its kind. Orders for those filtration systems were up 140% year-over-year in the third quarter. We also have orders for nearly 15,000 OptiClean units, and we are working an active pipeline for thousands more. Through our relationship with Cushman & Wakefield, we were able to upgrade a Denver area office campus with air purification systems with needle point bipolar ionization technology for every rooftop unit on its campus, along with service by Carrier's BlueEdge platform. And we just signed a strategic HVAC deal at the 50-floor one-court Square Tower in Long Island City, which we estimate will save up to 20% in energy cost annually and deliver improved comfort and air quality. For the healthy building space overall, we now have an active pipeline of potential order activity of $150 million, and we're still in the early stages of putting the comprehensive strategy in place to maximize our offerings and capture the opportunity ahead of us. 
Similarly, we recently launched our healthy, safe and sustainable cold chain program. I am thrilled with our new relationship with Amazon Web Services, with whom we are partnering to develop a robust and powerful data ecosystem for cold chain operations. We also introduced Carrier pods monitored by our Sensitech business to support added mobile cold chain capacity and cargo insights. With key partners we're working to connect the dots to provide a one-stop shop approach for cold chain solutions for both food and pharma distribution. So we've made progress on our financial results, our performance culture, strategic growth initiatives and capital allocation. 
Before I turn it over to Tim, let me give you some color on current order trends. Slide 5 outlines our 3 segments, which we have broken into 2 key business lines each. We also provide color by geographic region. Starting with HVAC. You see here that our residential and light commercial orders were up 60% year-over-year in the quarter, driven by resi. Movement from distribution to dealers with strong and distribution inventory levels are now in balance. For commercial HVAC, orders improved from down about 15% in Q2 to almost flat in Q3. In our Refrigeration segment's transport business, order trends indicate that Q2 was the bottom for our truck trailer business. Unit order rates more than doubled from June to September. Container orders were down in Q3, but these tend to be lumpy, and we have seen solid October orders. Commercial refrigeration orders were also down in the quarter but improved sequentially from Q2. 
For Fire & Security products, orders improved from down 20% in Q2 to down about 10%. We saw improvement in commercial and residential fire, China and the controls business, while the small- and medium-sized business, oil and gas and hospitality markets were weak. The F&S field business orders improved from down almost 30% in Q2 to down around 5% in Q3. Installation and nonrecurring service orders were down around 10%, given the discretionary nature of that work, while recurring service and monitoring orders were flat. 
Our business has reflected the bifurcated macro economy, where residential, health care, education, data centers and warehouses have remained strong, while the oil and gas, small and medium businesses and hospitality verticals remain challenged. Fortunately, the latter verticals are a much smaller part of our portfolio. We see the same bifurcation geographically, where the U.S. and China remains strong, Europe is recovering and Asia, excluding China, is very challenged. While we're encouraged by Q3 order trends, we recognize the continued global uncertainty, and we remain prepared to adapt. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Tim and then come back to summarize before Q&A. Tim?"
620281,691303394,2121843,"Carrier Global Corporation, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2020",2020-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Carrier Global Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Dave. Good morning. Please turn to Slide 6. As Dave just mentioned, the quarter surpassed what we had expected as we saw very strong demand in residential HVAC and continued recovery in the broader markets in which we participate. Recall that last",1428,"Thanks, Dave. Good morning. Please turn to Slide 6. As Dave just mentioned, the quarter surpassed what we had expected as we saw very strong demand in residential HVAC and continued recovery in the broader markets in which we participate. Recall that last quarter, we said that we believe the Q2 year-on-year sales decline would be the low point for the year. That proved to be the case as Q3 sales of $5 billion did not decline, but in fact, were up almost 4% over the prior year and 3% organically. This was driven primarily by residential HVAC. While we saw sequential improvement across the company since the second quarter, we still had modest year-over-year sales declines in the majority of our businesses in Q3. GAAP operating profit was $1.1 billion, and that includes a $252 million gain on the sale of about 9 million shares in Bayer. Adjusted operating profit of $867 million was up 6% from last year. Our incremental margin was 27%, and this number would be materially higher absent the incremental public company and TSA costs. Accelerated productivity and continued cost control drove the strong performance on margins. 
Our Q3 GAAP EPS was $0.84, and adjusted EPS was $0.67. Since we were not a public company last year, the year-over-year comparisons are not meaningful. Our free cash flow was strong, considerably higher than we had expected. The biggest driver was higher net income, but we also saw working capital improvement and a favorable timing impact from interest and tax payments. All things considered, a very strong third quarter for Carrier in a very difficult environment. 
Let's now look at how the segments performed. Please turn to Slide 7, and note that the year-over-year numbers to which I will refer are organic comparisons. The HVAC segment sales were up 11% from last year. Within the segment, residential was up 46%. We are very proud of how well the team executed on unprecedented levels of demand that enabled us to gain share. Recall that we ended Q2 with field inventory levels down about 25%. At the end of Q3, we saw field inventories back to prior year levels and expect a more normalized Q4 in that business. COVID created very atypical seasonality for residential as Q2 was down materially, and Q3 was unusually strong, and we expect the full year 2020 will likely end up as a fairly normal year in total. 
In North America light commercial, we saw a sales decline of 13%. We did see sequential improvement during the Q3 as reopenings continued, but we expect light commercial to continue to lag this year. Commercial HVAC sales were down 7%, with modest declines in most of its business lines. We saw a low single-digit decline in applied and a high single-digit decline in the services businesses. Applied sales were down less than the overall commercial HVAC, as we entered this slowdown with a healthy backlog in this longer cycle business. All of these year-over-year declines improved from those in the second quarter. 
From a regional perspective for commercial HVAC, China sales were up about 10% in the quarter, but Asia, excluding China, was weak, especially India as it remains heavily impacted by disruptions related to COVID. We are confident we gained share in China and North America in applied. 
Now over to Refrigeration, where segment sales were down 6%. North America truck/trailer was down about 30%, but that reflects almost a 50% improvement from the trough we saw in Q2. Europe truck trailer was down close to 10% and container was up mid-single digits. We saw improving order trends for both North America and Europe truck/trailer, and believe we have turned the corner on the down cycle in both businesses. Commercial refrigeration sales were flat in the quarter, as a modest decline in EMEA was offset by mid single-digit growth in Asia. 
Moving over to Fire & Security segment, which was down 7%. The products business was down consistent with the segment, declines in the Americas and Europe were partially offset by double-digit growth in China. Within the Americas, our residential fire products business grew low single digits, which was offset by declines at some of our security businesses that are more impacted by the slowdown in the small business and hospitality markets. The field business is also down in line with the segment, as restricted building access and lagging commercial construction activity drove mid- to high single-digit declines on install and repair jobs. That effect was partially offset by low single-digit growth in the recurring service piece of the business. Bottom line, we saw continued encouraging trends across the company, with the pace of recovery differing in some areas. While we have observed more normalizing market conditions, we continue to focus on controlling the controllables and an aggressive cost management that will help us fund investments to position us for future growth. 
Please turn to Slide 8. I will provide an update on our cost programs. And each quarter this year, we have accelerated our in-year savings plan for Carrier 600. With that success, we are now confident in increasing the 3-year target to $700 million, and renaming the program, Carrier 700. On the slide, you'll see that the $250 million target for 2020 for Carrier 700, and the planned investment of $100 million remain unchanged. We had previously discussed spending about $300 million over 3 years for investments in R&D, digital and sales, and we still expect to do so. You'll notice that our savings from cost containment actions is now $250 million, down from $300 million that we discussed last quarter. Because the business has been executing at a much higher level, in the fourth quarter, we are restoring some of the temporary people-related cost actions taken earlier this year. Also updated from last quarter is the headwind from productivity and absorption issues related to the pandemic. Better-than-expected volumes as well as strong execution has resulted in the absorption headwinds not being quite as bad as we had anticipated. If you recall, our original model for Carrier 600 was that the savings we generated would fully fund our growth in investments, and the remainder would drop through. With about $100 million in year-over-year headwind expected for 2021 from the reversal of onetime cost containment measures, it will require a larger portion of our Carrier 700 benefits. This means less of the savings should drop to the bottom line and could impact our incremental margins next year. 
Continuing on Slide 9. As we've said, a key priority during the pandemic has been to maintain ample liquidity. And as you see on this slide, our strong focus on cash has enabled very good free cash flow, which was driven by better-than-expected earnings and tightly managed working capital. We exited the quarter with $3.8 billion in cash on the balance sheet, which was helped by the partial sale of our shares in Bayer. As conditions in the market have improved, we now plan to pay down $1.5 billion in debt before the end of the year, a big step towards our debt repayment plans. With a healthy balance sheet, we are well positioned to emerge from the pandemic on a stronger footing and capitalize on the opportunities as we return to a more normalized environment. As a result, we expect to be in a position to communicate more details on our capital allocation priorities early next year. 
Please turn to Slide 10, and I'll review our outlook. On our Q2 call, we gave you guidance ranges that reflected the broader uncertainty associated with the economic climate we were experiencing. Now with 2 months to go in the year, we can provide a more precise and improved outlook from what we gave you in July. We now expect sales to be about $17.3 billion, higher than the high end of our prior guidance range. This is based on the significant strength we saw in residential HVAC in Q3, and the broader economic improvement. We expect adjusted operating profit of approximately $2.2 billion, which is also above the high end of our prior range. This reflects the drop-through from the higher sales outlook. 
On free cash flow, we now expect to generate about $1.5 billion in 2020, a significant improvement from our prior outlook of at least $1.1 billion. The biggest driver of the cash flow is higher net income, along with continued tight working capital management and a few timing items. 
With that, I'll hand it back to Dave to wrap things up before Q&A."

Well, in 4Q, we have some -- I mean, yes, resi was particularly strong in Q3, and that drove a lot of our Q3 favorability. We're expecting a bit more normalized Q4 as they are transitioning kind of from splits of air conditioners into furnaces, so it will be a bit more normalized than we saw in Q3. But also in Q4, we are anticipating. Remember, we have about $25 million of quarterly impact from year-on-year effect from our public company costs. And we do anticipate that we're going to spend about $75 million of the $100 million that we've set aside for investments. You might ask the question, why so back-end loaded? But the reality of it is, this year, we started out with an expectation we're going to invest $150 million before the COVID hit, we scaled that back considerably, and now we reinstated as things are looking better, but it takes a little bit of time to ramp down and ramp back up. So we have baked in there about $75 million of our investment to hit. And there's about $20 million of other kind of transition-related things from UTC as we stand-alone as a public company. So adjusting for those things, you would see that it's much more normalized fourth quarter."

I mean, we haven't set up -- think about the  average remaining of 450 on the Carrier 700 versus the 250 we've experienced already, and then subtract out the investments, and then probably we'll use a little bit of the Carrier 700 remaining to cover some of that year-on-year decrement."

We were really 2x the overall market. So clearly, we picked up share in the third quarter. But it's really not, I think, fair for us to look at it just 1 quarter time. If you look at it over a 12-month period, we picked up about 100 basis points of share, which is, I think, a better indicator. But look, we've said that we were going to really lean into growth and focus on really winning out in the marketplace. And I think our team, Chris Nelson, Justin [indiscernible] and the team have done a really nice job of that, partnering with our distributors. So we've seen it really across the U.S., and it's not just splits. We've seen it on the furnace side as well. I think part of it was the fact that, operationally, we were able to perform and provide units to the dealers. There's been some dealer conversion. And I think the other factor is that we came into the quarter with somewhat depressed inventory levels with our distribution channels. Inventory levels coming into 3Q were down about 25% year-over-year, and then you kind of look at the sudden spike we saw in orders in June that carried forward into July and August, we really had to turn up the heat to make sure that we could support our customers. And frankly, it was a challenge. Our customers have done a great job working with us. But we did -- it was quite a ramp to support them. But on balance, we've been very pleased with the share gains. The key is that we sustain that going forward. I think in terms of the salespeople, the 450 we referred to is that's really mostly outside of resi, where we've been looking at that in both the applied space on the OE side as well as in services and aftermarket. And that's very much a global phenomenon. We've been adding those mostly in China and North America, a little bit in Europe, which has been a bit more challenged to add them there. But -- and I don't think that's the end of it. We had come into this year saying that we had a deficit versus some of our competitors. We said we'd add 500, we've added 450, and I think we'll end up adding more as we go into next year."

And we've been consistent that incrementals would be in that 30% range, give or take, various moving parts in the system. And then you have all of these cost puts and takes between our increase on Carrier 700, so we have $450 million to go, you could probably consider $225 million a year next year and the year after that. We have the $100 million of sort of onetime headwinds going into next year because of the onetime -- $100 million of onetime savings that we incurred this year, and then we have incremental investments.

We're seeing continued strength globally, especially in China and the U.S. Education has picked up quite well, not only K-12, but universities. Commercial building is a bit of a watch item. We know there are some real headwinds, things like retail, hospitality, restaurants that has a more acute impact on our light commercial business. So when we look at it, one encouraging metric that we did see pop up a bit was ABI, the architectural billing index, which is a good forward looking indicator. It's been hovering around 40, we saw it go up to 47, we would like to see that north of 50. Dodge construction year-to-date is down about 20%, but only about 15% of our business ties to that metric. So I think when you put that all together, it's a watch item. There are some encouraging areas, and where it's strong, I think we've really leaned into and seen some share gains. China has been particularly strong, and I'm quite proud of the team there and North America has been continuing to recover.

It starts with the premise that people spend 90% of their time indoors. So if you're 50 years old, you've spent 45 years on this Earth indoors. And you look at the amount of indoor square footage, that's going to double over the next 40 years. So when you look at something like COVID, it's really shined the light on the criticality of making sure that people have healthy, safe and sustainable indoor air environment. So the way we've approached it is really twofold: one is introduce new products, things like OptiClean, the certification of our electrostatic filters for the home. We're working on air purifiers. We're working on new types of filtration, whether it's UV or bipolar ionization and really round out the portfolio and get those to market, and there's been significant pull. On top of that, we've been working on more customized solutions that look at more broader ventilation solutions about airflow and air changes per hour that are more holistic changes. And then the broader solution is ultimately going to be something that gets into independent assessments about the healthy and safe indoor air quality. We'll work on a digital solution, so tenants have visibility to whether or not the indoor air environment is up to standard. And then we'll be rolling that out in a more holistic way. When we look at the market size, we get this question a lot, and here's what I'd say. If you look at the products that we sell into, our HVAC systems, our Fire & Security systems, that total market is about $90 billion to $100 billion. And we think that the additional opportunity created through IAQ is about 10%. So call it, $9 billion to $10 billion, and one thing I can tell you is that I'm extremely confident that we'll get more than our fair share of that piece. Now it takes some time to build up. I talked about a pipeline of $150 million. We continue to see real traction, real customers making orders. So it's going to take some time to build up to that number, but we do think it's certainly within our sights over time."

First, I will say, when you look at decrementals for that segment of the business, in Refrigeration, first of all, you get kind of what I call the law of small numbers. There was a $46 million decline in sales, and the operating profit decline was a small piece of that. But within it, you had a mix between CCR, our commercial refrigeration business and transport. Commercial was top line pretty flat and modestly down on the bottom line. Transport, obviously, our high-margin business was down about 10% on balance across that business, and down, say, $15 million to $20 million on the bottom line. There were a couple of other small charges in there. So that really explains the very high decremental for the business. But it -- I would say, to your last question, when we see that turnaround, and we expect that we're kind of at the bottom or have seen the bottom of that cycle, you will see very strong incrementals on the way back up. It's -- the transport is a nice, very attractive margin business, and you will see strong incrementals as we see that recover."

So you're seeing a lot of the purchases we had for that as positive cash flow in Q3, that interchange between them, we'll pay those mostly back in the fourth quarter, maybe a little bit will bleed into the first quarter of next year. And then also somewhat COVID-related and somewhat start-up related, we have some tax deferrals for practical purposes. So for instance, there's $50 million, $60 million of tax on the sale of Bayer, we obviously recognize the gain in the third quarter, we will pay the tax for it in the fourth quarter.

And then in 2022, we would expect to finish out that program at $100 million. And we'll have to see from there what further investment may make sense. So that's kind of that, and that's all baked into what we said earlier. From a CapEx standpoint, we do expect considerable still $125 million, $150 million of capital spend in the fourth quarter of this year that also contributes to the -- what you might consider a weaker cash flow in the fourth quarter. So there is considerable capital spend there. You also may recall back at Investor Day, we said we would spend $350 million to $400 million as kind of foundational capital expenditure in 2020 that was scaled back considerably because of the COVID, but we do expect that, that will push out into 2021.

And we just reviewed with our Board, our specific targets that we will be committing ourselves to and we'll be releasing publicly. Obviously, it's going to be a big focus on sustainability, and I think folks will be quite pleased by how we're stepping up around our sustainability targets. But it includes everything from D&I, where I really believe that we leaned into the moment around diversity and inclusion, and that's just the profound impact that, that's had on us this year that's going to be sustainable. And all other aspects of D&I, how we deal with our suppliers in various elements in our own operations. So I think this will be very, very thematic for Carrier. It's thematic for our space, but we're really looking to differentiate ourselves, and I think you would expect us to be within the top quartile on an ESG basis."

Before we get going, let me first comment on the upcoming CFO transition that we announced last week. Patrick Goris, currently the CFO of Rockwell Automation, will be joining us as our CFO in a couple of weeks",1499,"Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. 
Before we get going, let me first comment on the upcoming CFO transition that we announced last week. Patrick Goris, currently the CFO of Rockwell Automation, will be joining us as our CFO in a couple of weeks. At that point, Tim will take on the role of senior adviser, helping us with a smooth transition to Patrick and taking on specific key projects until his retirement in mid-February. 
For context, when we hired Tim, he was very clear with us that his role would be to help effectively stand us up as a public company, including building the finance team and function, strengthening the balance sheet, helping us establish our strategic priorities, working with the rating agencies and investment community and charting the course for his successor. Doing all that and more, Tim has been the perfect CFO at the perfect time. I can't thank him enough for everything he has done for me personally and for Carrier. 
After a thorough search, I could not be happier to have Patrick joining us. I suspect most of you know him well. During his time at Rockwell, Patrick transformed the finance function, helped drive industry-leading top and bottom line performance and a shift toward a recurring revenue model, and he was instrumental in guiding strategic capital allocation and portfolio optimization. We look forward to welcoming Patrick to the Carrier team.  
With that, please turn to Slide 2, where I'll discuss our Q3 highlights. In short, Q3 was a very encouraging quarter. Sales of $5 billion were up 4% year-over-year and substantially exceeded our expectations. Adjusted operating profit was up 6% year-over-year. We had strong incrementals in the quarter, putting our reported year-to-date decrementals at 30%, but operationally at 26%, factoring in the $53 million of additional public company costs. Our performance was driven by continued strength in North America residential HVAC, which was up 46% in the quarter, and by continued traction on our cost and growth initiatives. 
In resi, this was our highest quarter ever for both sales and operating profit. We are pleased with our free cash flow generation in the quarter, which was $880 million, primarily driven by higher net income and better working capital performance, and we realized $300 million of cash before taxes from our sale of 9 million shares in Beijer. 
We continue to aggressively reduce costs via a strategic disciplined approach, including reducing G&A and simplifying the back office. As a result, we are now raising Carrier 600 to Carrier 700, which calls for $700 million of recurring cost takeout by the end of 2022. This will allow us to fund investments in growth while driving margin expansion. We remain on track to invest an incremental $100 million in growth initiatives this year.  
Based on our Q3 strength, we are again raising our 2020 full year outlook on sales, adjusted operating profit and free cash flow. Given that we had $3.8 billion of cash at the end of the quarter, we plan to pay down $1.5 billion of debt in the fourth quarter. Next year, we expect to do more while supporting our dividend and preserving flexibility for M&A opportunities.  
Pivoting now to Slide 3 on our progress on our overall priorities. We've put in place a playbook that is gaining traction. Adoption of the Carrier Way has created a profound cultural transformation, which is resulting in an agile, innovative, aggressive, winning-focused organization, all of which is helping fuel our growth agenda. 
It starts with ensuring a performance culture, putting our customers first, and through a rigorous deployment of Carrier Excellence in our supplier excellence program, our on-time delivery has increased to 96%, and our quality and performance has improved 30% year-to-date. 
We continue to invest in our growth initiatives. We have added an incremental 450 sales and sales support personnel this year, and have introduced a number of innovative offerings, including the first fully autonomous, all-electric, engineless refrigerated trailer system in Europe; and a new multipurpose cloud-connected commercial fire detector that combines smoke detection with advanced sensing capabilities. And in terms of services, aftermarket and digital initiatives, our commercial HVAC business closed the quarter at a 27% attachment rate globally, on track to achieve 30% by the end of this year. 
We have signed over 300 BlueEdge contracts since the program launched in June. 
We are also continuing to drive connected offerings across the network. For example, in the commercial refrigeration business, we completed a very successful pilot on our condition-based maintenance program, improving uptime by about 33%, and improving technician productivity by over 20%. 
In Fire & Security, our Kidde Fire Systems business shipped its first orders for IntelliSite, a remote health monitoring service for industrial fire alarm and suppression system control units. At a Carrier enterprise level, we are truly leaning into the emerging trends around healthy, safe and sustainable building and cold chain solutions, which you'll see on Slide 4.  
Starting with healthy, safe and sustainable buildings. Our strategy here is to be the leading one-stop shop provider, which is driving strong customer interest and new product introductions that continue to gain traction. We obtained independent validation through a rigorous testing process that our Infinity air purifier's capture and kill (sic) [ Captures & Kills ] technology inactivates 99% of coronavirus trapped on the filter, the first of its kind. Orders for those filtration systems were up 140% year-over-year in the third quarter. We also have orders for nearly 15,000 OptiClean units, and we are working an active pipeline for thousands more. 
Through our relationship with Cushman & Wakefield, we were able to upgrade a Denver area office campus with air purification systems with needlepoint bipolar ionization technology for every rooftop unit on its campus, along with service by Carrier's BlueEdge platform. And we just signed a strategic HVAC deal at the 50-floor One Court Square Tower in Long Island City, which we estimate will save up to 20% in energy cost annually and deliver improved comfort and air quality. 
For the healthy building space overall, we now have an active pipeline of potential order activity of $150 million, and we're still in the early stages of putting the comprehensive strategy in place to maximize our offerings and capture the opportunity ahead of us.  
Similarly, we recently launched our Healthy, Safe and Sustainable Cold Chain Program. I am thrilled with our new relationship with Amazon Web Services, with whom we are partnering to develop a robust and powerful data ecosystem for cold chain operations. We also introduced Carrier Pods monitored by our Sensitech business to support added mobile cold chain capacity and cargo insights. With key partners, we're working to connect the dots to provide a one-stop shop approach for cold chain solutions for both food and pharma distribution. 
So we've made progress on our financial results, our performance culture, strategic growth initiatives and capital allocation.  
Before I turn it over to Tim, let me give you some color on current order trends. Slide 5 outlines our 3 segments, which we have broken into 2 key business lines each. We also provide color by geographic region. Starting with HVAC. You see here that our residential and light commercial orders were up 60% year-over-year in the quarter, driven by resi. Movement from distribution to dealers was strong and distribution inventory levels are now in balance. For commercial HVAC, orders improved from down about 15% in Q2 to almost flat in Q3. 
In our Refrigeration segment's transport business, order trends indicate that Q2 was the bottom for our truck trailer business. Unit order rates more than doubled from June to September. Container orders were down in Q3, but these tend to be lumpy, and we have seen solid October orders. Commercial refrigeration orders were also down in the quarter but improved sequentially from Q2.  
For Fire & Security products, orders improved from down 20% in Q2 to down about 10%. We saw improvement in commercial and residential fire, China and the controls business, while the small- and medium-sized business, oil and gas and hospitality markets were weak. The F&S field business orders improved from down almost 30% in Q2 to down around 5% in Q3. Installation and nonrecurring service orders were down around 10%, given the discretionary nature of that work, while recurring service and monitoring orders were flat. 
Our business has reflected the bifurcated macro economy, where residential, health care, education, data centers and warehouses have remained strong, while the oil and gas, small and medium businesses and hospitality verticals remain challenged. Fortunately, the latter verticals are a much smaller part of our portfolio. We see the same bifurcation geographically, where the U.S. and China remains strong, Europe is recovering and Asia, excluding China, is very challenged. While we're encouraged by Q3 order trends, we recognize the continued global uncertainty, and we remain prepared to adapt.  
With that, I'll turn it over to Tim and then come back to summarize before Q&A. Tim?"

Please turn to Slide 6. As Dave just mentioned, the quarter surpassed what we had expected as we saw very strong demand in residential HVAC and continued recovery in the broader markets in which we participate. Recall that la",1428,"Thanks, Dave. Good morning. 
Please turn to Slide 6. As Dave just mentioned, the quarter surpassed what we had expected as we saw very strong demand in residential HVAC and continued recovery in the broader markets in which we participate. Recall that last quarter, we said that we believe the Q2 year-on-year sales decline would be the low point for the year. That proved to be the case as Q3 sales of $5 billion did not decline, but in fact, were up almost 4% over the prior year and 3% organically. This was driven primarily by residential HVAC. While we saw sequential improvement across the company since the second quarter, we still had modest year-over-year sales declines in the majority of our businesses in Q3. 
GAAP operating profit was $1.1 billion, and that includes a $252 million gain on the sale of about 9 million shares in Beijer. Adjusted operating profit of $867 million was up 6% from last year. Our incremental margin was 27%, and this number would be materially higher absent the incremental public company and TSA costs. Accelerated productivity and continued cost control drove the strong performance on margins.  
Our Q3 GAAP EPS was $0.84, and adjusted EPS was $0.67. Since we were not a public company last year, the year-over-year comparisons are not meaningful. 
Our free cash flow was strong, considerably higher than we had expected. The biggest driver was higher net income, but we also saw working capital improvement and a favorable timing impact from interest and tax payments. All things considered, a very strong third quarter for Carrier in a very difficult environment.  
Let's now look at how the segments performed. Please turn to Slide 7, and note that the year-over-year numbers to which I will refer are organic comparisons. 
The HVAC segment sales were up 11% from last year. Within the segment, residential was up 46%. We are very proud of how well the team executed on unprecedented levels of demand that enabled us to gain share. Recall that we ended Q2 with field inventory levels down about 25%. At the end of Q3, we saw field inventories back to prior year levels and expect a more normalized Q4 in that business. COVID created very atypical seasonality for residential as Q2 was down materially, and Q3 was unusually strong, and we expect the full year 2020 will likely end up as a fairly normal year in total.  
In North America light commercial, we saw a sales decline of 13%. We did see sequential improvement during the Q3 as reopenings continued, but we expect light commercial to continue to lag this year. Commercial HVAC sales were down 7%, with modest declines in most of its business lines. We saw a low single-digit decline in applied and a high single-digit decline in the services businesses. Applied sales were down less than the overall commercial HVAC, as we entered this slowdown with a healthy backlog in this longer cycle business. All of these year-over-year declines improved from those in the second quarter.  
From a regional perspective for commercial HVAC, China sales were up about 10% in the quarter, but Asia, excluding China, was weak, especially India, as it remains heavily impacted by disruptions related to COVID. We are confident we gained share in China and North America in applied.  
Now over to Refrigeration, where segment sales were down 6%. North America truck/trailer was down about 30%, but that reflects almost a 50% improvement from the trough we saw in Q2. Europe truck trailer was down close to 10%, and container was up mid-single digits. We saw improving order trends for both North America and Europe truck/trailer, and believe we have turned the corner on the down cycle in both businesses. Commercial refrigeration sales were flat in the quarter, as a modest decline in EMEA was offset by mid single-digit growth in Asia.  
Moving over to Fire & Security segment, which was down 7%. The products business was down consistent with the segment. Declines in the Americas and Europe were partially offset by double-digit growth in China. Within the Americas, our residential fire products business grew low single digits, which was offset by declines at some of our security businesses that are more impacted by the slowdown in the small business and hospitality markets. The field business is also down in line with the segment, as restricted building access and lagging commercial construction activity drove mid to high single-digit declines on install and repair jobs. That effect was partially offset by low single-digit growth in the recurring service piece of the business. 
Bottom line, we saw continued encouraging trends across the company, with the pace of recovery differing in some areas. While we have observed more normalizing market conditions, we continue to focus on controlling the controllables and an aggressive cost management that will help us fund investments to position us for future growth.  
Please turn to Slide 8. I will provide an update on our cost programs. And each quarter this year, we have accelerated our in-year savings plan for Carrier 600. With that success, we are now confident in increasing the 3-year target to $700 million, and renaming the program, Carrier 700. 
On the slide, you'll see that the $250 million target for 2020 for Carrier 700, and the planned investment of $100 million remain unchanged. We had previously discussed spending about $300 million over 3 years for investments in R&D, digital and sales, and we still expect to do so. You'll notice that our savings from cost containment actions is now $250 million, down from $300 million that we discussed last quarter. Because the business has been executing at a much higher level, in the fourth quarter, we are restoring some of the temporary people-related cost actions taken earlier this year. 
Also updated from last quarter is the headwind from productivity and absorption issues related to the pandemic. Better-than-expected volumes as well as strong execution has resulted in the absorption headwinds not being quite as bad as we had anticipated. If you recall, our original model for Carrier 600 was that the savings we generated would fully fund our growth in investments, and the remainder would drop through. With about $100 million in year-over-year headwind expected for 2021 from the reversal of onetime cost containment measures, it will require a larger portion of our Carrier 700 benefits. This means less of the savings should drop to the bottom line and could impact our incremental margins next year.  
Continuing on Slide 9. As we've said, a key priority during the pandemic has been to maintain ample liquidity. And as you see on this slide, our strong focus on cash has enabled very good free cash flow, which was driven by better-than-expected earnings and tightly managed working capital. We exited the quarter with $3.8 billion in cash on the balance sheet, which was helped by the partial sale of our shares in Beijer. As conditions in the market have improved, we now plan to pay down $1.5 billion in debt before the end of the year, a big step towards our debt repayment plans. 
With a healthy balance sheet, we are well positioned to emerge from the pandemic on a stronger footing and capitalize on the opportunities as we return to a more normalized environment. As a result, we expect to be in a position to communicate more details on our capital allocation priorities early next year.  
Please turn to Slide 10, and I'll review our outlook. On our Q2 call, we gave you guidance ranges that reflected the broader uncertainty associated with the economic climate we were experiencing. Now with 2 months to go in the year, we can provide a more precise and improved outlook from what we gave you in July. We now expect sales to be about $17.3 billion, higher than the high end of our prior guidance range. This is based on the significant strength we saw in residential HVAC in Q3 and the broader economic improvement. We expect adjusted operating profit of approximately $2.2 billion, which is also above the high end of our prior range. This reflects the drop-through from the higher sales outlook.  
On free cash flow, we now expect to generate about $1.5 billion in 2020, a significant improvement from our prior outlook of at least $1.1 billion. The biggest driver of the cash flow is higher net income, along with continued tight working capital management and a few timing items.  
With that, I'll hand it back to Dave to wrap things up before Q&A."

Well, in 4Q, we have some -- I mean, yes, resi was particularly strong in Q3, and that drove a lot of our Q3 favorability. We're expecting a bit more normalized Q4 as they are transitioning kind of from splits of air conditioners into furnaces, so it will be a bit more normalized than we saw in Q3. But also in Q4, we are anticipating -- remember, we have about $25 million of quarterly impact from year-on-year effect from our public company costs. And we do anticipate that we're going to spend about $75 million of the $100 million that we've set aside for investments. 
You might ask the question, why so back-end loaded? But the reality of it is, this year, we started out with an expectation we're going to invest $150 million. Before the COVID hit, we scaled that back considerably, and now we reinstated as things are looking better. But it takes a little bit of time to ramp down and ramp back up. So we have baked in there about $75 million of our investment to hit. And there's about $20 million of other kind of transition-related things from UTC as we stand-alone as a public company. So adjusting for those things, you would see that it's much more normalized fourth quarter."

On balance across that, we probably have $100 million of headwind, net headwind from those actions.

I mean, we haven't set up -- think about the  average remaining of $450 million on the Carrier 700 versus the $250 million we've experienced already, and then subtract out the investments, and then probably we'll use a little bit of the Carrier 700 remaining to cover some of that year-on-year decrement."

We were really 2x the overall market. So clearly, we picked up share in the third quarter. But it's really not, I think, fair for us to look at it just 1 quarter at a time. If you look at it over a 12-month period, we picked up about 100 basis points of share, which is, I think, a better indicator. But look, we've said that we were going to really lean into growth and focus on really winning out in the marketplace. And I think our team, Chris Nelson, Justin Keppy and the team have done a really nice job of that, partnering with our distributors. 
So we've seen it really across the U.S., and it's not just splits. We've seen it on the furnace side as well. I think part of it was the fact that, operationally, we were able to perform and provide units to the dealers. There's been some dealer conversion. 
And I think the other factor is that we came into the quarter with somewhat depressed inventory levels with our distribution channels. Inventory levels coming into 3Q were down about 25% year-over-year, and then you kind of look at the sudden spike we saw in orders in June that carried forward into July and August, we really had to turn up the heat to make sure that we could support our customers. And frankly, it was a challenge. Our customers have done a great job working with us. But we did -- it was quite a ramp to support them. But on balance, we've been very pleased with the share gains. The key is that we sustain that going forward. 
I think in terms of the salespeople, the 450 we referred to is that's really mostly outside of resi, where we've been looking at that in both the applied space on the OE side as well as in services and aftermarket. And that's very much a global phenomenon. We've been adding those mostly in China and North America, a little bit in Europe, which has been a bit more challenge to add them there. But -- and I don't think that's the end of it. We had come into this year saying that we had a deficit versus some of our competitors. We said we'd add 500, we've added 450, and I think we'll end up adding more as we go into next year."

But we've been a bit surprised by the resi strength that we've seen over the last couple of months. So it's probably still mid-single digits, but more at the low end of that. And we've been consistent that incrementals would be in that 30% range, give or take various moving parts in the system. 
And then you have all of these costs, puts and takes between our increase on Carrier 700, so we have $450 million to go, you could probably consider $225 million a year, next year and the year after that. We have the $100 million of sort of onetime headwinds going into next year because of the onetime -- $100 million of onetime savings that we incurred this year.

When you look at things like data centers and health care and warehouses, we're seeing continued strength globally, especially in China and the U.S. Education has picked up quite well, not only K-12, but universities. 
Commercial building is a bit of a watch item. We know there are some real headwinds, things like retail hospitality, restaurants that has a more acute impact on our light commercial business. 
So when we look at it, one encouraging metric that we did see pop up a bit was ABI, the architectural billing index, which is a good forward-looking indicator. It's been hovering around 40, we saw it go up to 47. We would like to see that north of 50. Dodge Construction year-to-date is down about 20%, but only about 15% of our business ties to that metric. 
So I think when you put that all together, it's a watch item. There are some encouraging areas, and where it's strong, I think we've really leaned into and seen some share gains. China has been particularly strong, and I'm quite proud of the team there, and North America has been continuing to recover. So I look at it, I think we're going to exit this year with our applied business backlog up around 5% or 10% going into next year.

Josh, I would tell you that we are very encouraged by not only the trends we're seeing in IAQ but the opportunity. It starts with the premise that people spend 90% of their time indoors. So if you're 50 years old, you've spent 45 years on this Earth",386,"Yes. Josh, I would tell you that we are very encouraged by not only the trends we're seeing in IAQ but the opportunity. It starts with the premise that people spend 90% of their time indoors. So if you're 50 years old, you've spent 45 years on this Earth indoors. And you look at the amount of indoor square footage, that's going to double over the next 40 years. So when you look at something like COVID, it's really shined the light on the criticality of making sure that people have healthy, safe and sustainable indoor air environment. 
So the way we've approached it is really twofold. One is introduce new products, things like OptiClean, the certification of our electrostatic filters for the home. We're working on air purifiers. We're working on new types of filtration, whether it's UV or bipolar ionization and really round out the portfolio and get those to market, and there's been significant pull. 
On top of that, we've been working on more customized solutions that look at more broader ventilation solutions about airflow and air changes per hour that are more holistic changes. And then the broader solution is ultimately going to be something that gets into independent assessments about the healthy and safe indoor air quality. We'll work on a digital solution so tenants have visibility to whether or not the indoor air environment is up to standard. And then we'll be rolling that out in a more holistic way. 
When we look at the market size, we get this question a lot, and here's what I'd say. If you look at the products that we sell into, our HVAC systems, our Fire & Security systems, that total market is about $90 billion to $100 billion. And we think that the additional opportunity created through IAQ is about 10%. So call it, $9 billion to $10 billion, and one thing I can tell you is that I'm extremely confident that we'll get more than our fair share of that piece. Now it takes some time to build up. I talked about a pipeline of $150 million. We continue to see real traction, real customers making orders. So it's going to take some time to build up to that number, but we do think it's certainly within our sights over time."

Transport, obviously, our high-margin business was down about 10% on balance across that business, and down, say, $15 million to $20 million on the bottom line. 
There were a couple of other small charges in there. So that really explains the very high decremental for the business.

We'll pay those mostly back in the fourth quarter, maybe a little bit will bleed into the first quarter of next year. 
And then also, somewhat COVID-related and somewhat start-up related, we have some tax deferrals, for practical purposes. So for instance, there's $50 million, $60 million of tax on the sale of Beijer. We obviously recognize the gain in the third quarter. We will pay the tax for it in the fourth quarter.

We know what we have to do. The feet on the street, as you mentioned, will help. 
Look, I see that number getting up to 50% over the next few years. We just got to keep chipping away at it. I will say that a couple of our peers had a bit of a jump-start on us with their focus on things like modernizations and attachment rates. So in all candor, we're playing a little bit of catch-up, but we know what to do. We know the playbook, we have confidence in it. If you look at our overall service backlog, it's actually up about 30% because some of the orders that we've had have been pushing out to the right when you look at some customers pushing out modernizations and some other task. So as we get into next year, we think that we'll see some real growth on the service side."

Our light commercial business is down 10% to 15%. But that's very much a replacement business. 80/20 is replacement. So eventually, as those start to come back, we would expect that to recover as we get into '21. But we have seen -- I'm really, really proud of the China team. They've continued to pick up share and do a very nice job. And in North America, we've seen some real traction here and some recent wins even over the last few weeks.

And as COVID hit, it kind of changed that pacing. So we're $100 million this year. Again, I said earlier, we've spent $25 million to date. Most in the third quarter. We're anticipating $75 million in the fourth quarter. That will be the $100 million. In 2021, we expect another $100 million. And then in 2022, we would expect to finish out that program at $100 million. And we'll have to see from there what further investment may make sense. So that's kind of that, and that's all baked into what we said earlier. 
From a CapEx standpoint, we do expect considerable, still $125 million, $150 million, of capital spend in the fourth quarter of this year that also contributes to the -- what you might consider a weaker cash flow in the fourth quarter. So there is considerable capital spend there. 
You also may recall back at Investor Day, we said we would spend $350 million to $400 million as kind of foundational capital expenditure in 2020. That was scaled back considerably because of the COVID. But we do expect that, that will push out into 2021. So you would see that level in 2021. So there will be some cash headwind there."

And I was looking at our top 20 projects where we've been pulled into the project that I mentioned in Colorado, where, through Cushman & Wakefield, we would have had a typical chiller sale, which would have been significant. But we added a number of UV lights and other kind of bipolar ionization, other kind of filtration add-ons to an otherwise typical order. That was really quite significant. 
We've seen it with a university in Southeast Asia, where we had a very significant dedicated IAQ sale, where they were very focused on as they were welcoming students back. 
So look, some are firm orders. Some are, I think, soon to be converted into firm orders. And it really has been primarily on the HVAC side. But Jurgen and his team have some really creative offerings. The Blue Diamond piece is going to be part of our overall digital solution because that's the piece that can have that customer intimacy where you can look at your smartphone and you can use that to see how are the actual indicators for IAQ, whether it's your CO2 levels or your -- the amount of ventilation that you're seeing or other things that you may be measuring. We were looking at about 7 attributes that we'll be looking at. And BlueDiamond will be a great source for us to kind of monitor those 7 attributes and also give the end customer insight into those attributes. 
BlueDiamond also gives you capabilities around contact tracing. We have the announcement that Jurgen and team drove with FLIR around thermal scanning. So there's a number of things in his portfolio that are attractive but become a lot more attractive when they're part of the Carrier solution."

Before we get going, let me first comment on the upcoming CFO transition that we announced last week. Patrick Goris, currently the CFO of Rockwell Automation, will be joining us as our CFO in a couple of weeks",1499,"Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. 
Before we get going, let me first comment on the upcoming CFO transition that we announced last week. Patrick Goris, currently the CFO of Rockwell Automation, will be joining us as our CFO in a couple of weeks. At that point, Tim will take on the role of senior adviser, helping us with a smooth transition to Patrick and taking on specific key projects until his retirement in mid-February. 
For context, when we hired Tim, he was very clear with us that his role would be to help effectively stand us up as a public company, including building the finance team and function, strengthening the balance sheet, helping us establish our strategic priorities, working with the rating agencies and investment community and charting the course for his successor. Doing all that and more, Tim has been the perfect CFO at the perfect time. I can't thank him enough for everything he has done for me personally and for Carrier. 
After a thorough search, I could not be happier to have Patrick joining us. I suspect most of you know him well. During his time at Rockwell, Patrick transformed the finance function, helped drive industry-leading top and bottom line performance and a shift toward a recurring revenue model, and he was instrumental in guiding strategic capital allocation and portfolio optimization. We look forward to welcoming Patrick to the Carrier team.  
With that, please turn to Slide 2, where I'll discuss our Q3 highlights. In short, Q3 was a very encouraging quarter. Sales of $5 billion were up 4% year-over-year and substantially exceeded our expectations. Adjusted operating profit was up 6% year-over-year. We had strong incrementals in the quarter, putting our reported year-to-date decrementals at 30%, but operationally at 26%, factoring in the $53 million of additional public company costs. Our performance was driven by continued strength in North America residential HVAC, which was up 46% in the quarter, and by continued traction on our cost and growth initiatives. 
In resi, this was our highest quarter ever for both sales and operating profit. We are pleased with our free cash flow generation in the quarter, which was $880 million, primarily driven by higher net income and better working capital performance, and we realized $300 million of cash before taxes from our sale of 9 million shares in Beijer. 
We continue to aggressively reduce costs via a strategic disciplined approach, including reducing G&A and simplifying the back office. As a result, we are now raising Carrier 600 to Carrier 700, which calls for $700 million of recurring cost takeout by the end of 2022. This will allow us to fund investments in growth while driving margin expansion. We remain on track to invest an incremental $100 million in growth initiatives this year.  
Based on our Q3 strength, we are again raising our 2020 full year outlook on sales, adjusted operating profit and free cash flow. Given that we had $3.8 billion of cash at the end of the quarter, we plan to pay down $1.5 billion of debt in the fourth quarter. Next year, we expect to do more while supporting our dividend and preserving flexibility for M&A opportunities.  
Pivoting now to Slide 3 on our progress on our overall priorities. We've put in place a playbook that is gaining traction. Adoption of the Carrier Way has created a profound cultural transformation, which is resulting in an agile, innovative, aggressive, winning-focused organization, all of which is helping fuel our growth agenda. 
It starts with ensuring a performance culture, putting our customers first, and through a rigorous deployment of Carrier Excellence in our supplier excellence program, our on-time delivery has increased to 96%, and our quality and performance has improved 30% year-to-date. 
We continue to invest in our growth initiatives. We have added an incremental 450 sales and sales support personnel this year, and have introduced a number of innovative offerings, including the first fully autonomous, all-electric, engineless refrigerated trailer system in Europe; and a new multipurpose cloud-connected commercial fire detector that combines smoke detection with advanced sensing capabilities. And in terms of services, aftermarket and digital initiatives, our commercial HVAC business closed the quarter at a 27% attachment rate globally, on track to achieve 30% by the end of this year. 
We have signed over 300 BlueEdge contracts since the program launched in June. 
We are also continuing to drive connected offerings across the network. For example, in the commercial refrigeration business, we completed a very successful pilot on our condition-based maintenance program, improving uptime by about 33%, and improving technician productivity by over 20%. 
In Fire & Security, our Kidde Fire Systems business shipped its first orders for IntelliSite, a remote health monitoring service for industrial fire alarm and suppression system control units. At a Carrier enterprise level, we are truly leaning into the emerging trends around healthy, safe and sustainable building and cold chain solutions, which you'll see on Slide 4.  
Starting with healthy, safe and sustainable buildings. Our strategy here is to be the leading one-stop shop provider, which is driving strong customer interest and new product introductions that continue to gain traction. We obtained independent validation through a rigorous testing process that our Infinity air purifier's capture and kill (sic) [ Captures & Kills ] technology inactivates 99% of coronavirus trapped on the filter, the first of its kind. Orders for those filtration systems were up 140% year-over-year in the third quarter. We also have orders for nearly 15,000 OptiClean units, and we are working an active pipeline for thousands more. 
Through our relationship with Cushman & Wakefield, we were able to upgrade a Denver area office campus with air purification systems with needlepoint bipolar ionization technology for every rooftop unit on its campus, along with service by Carrier's BlueEdge platform. And we just signed a strategic HVAC deal at the 50-floor One Court Square Tower in Long Island City, which we estimate will save up to 20% in energy cost annually and deliver improved comfort and air quality. 
For the healthy building space overall, we now have an active pipeline of potential order activity of $150 million, and we're still in the early stages of putting the comprehensive strategy in place to maximize our offerings and capture the opportunity ahead of us.  
Similarly, we recently launched our Healthy, Safe and Sustainable Cold Chain Program. I am thrilled with our new relationship with Amazon Web Services, with whom we are partnering to develop a robust and powerful data ecosystem for cold chain operations. We also introduced Carrier Pods monitored by our Sensitech business to support added mobile cold chain capacity and cargo insights. With key partners, we're working to connect the dots to provide a one-stop shop approach for cold chain solutions for both food and pharma distribution. 
So we've made progress on our financial results, our performance culture, strategic growth initiatives and capital allocation.  
Before I turn it over to Tim, let me give you some color on current order trends. Slide 5 outlines our 3 segments, which we have broken into 2 key business lines each. We also provide color by geographic region. Starting with HVAC. You see here that our residential and light commercial orders were up 60% year-over-year in the quarter, driven by resi. Movement from distribution to dealers was strong and distribution inventory levels are now in balance. For commercial HVAC, orders improved from down about 15% in Q2 to almost flat in Q3. 
In our Refrigeration segment's transport business, order trends indicate that Q2 was the bottom for our truck trailer business. Unit order rates more than doubled from June to September. Container orders were down in Q3, but these tend to be lumpy, and we have seen solid October orders. Commercial refrigeration orders were also down in the quarter but improved sequentially from Q2.  
For Fire & Security products, orders improved from down 20% in Q2 to down about 10%. We saw improvement in commercial and residential fire, China and the controls business, while the small- and medium-sized business, oil and gas and hospitality markets were weak. The F&S field business orders improved from down almost 30% in Q2 to down around 5% in Q3. Installation and nonrecurring service orders were down around 10%, given the discretionary nature of that work, while recurring service and monitoring orders were flat. 
Our business has reflected the bifurcated macro economy, where residential, health care, education, data centers and warehouses have remained strong, while the oil and gas, small and medium businesses and hospitality verticals remain challenged. Fortunately, the latter verticals are a much smaller part of our portfolio. We see the same bifurcation geographically, where the U.S. and China remains strong, Europe is recovering and Asia, excluding China, is very challenged. While we're encouraged by Q3 order trends, we recognize the continued global uncertainty, and we remain prepared to adapt.  
With that, I'll turn it over to Tim and then come back to summarize before Q&A. Tim?"

Please turn to Slide 6. As Dave just mentioned, the quarter surpassed what we had expected as we saw very strong demand in residential HVAC and continued recovery in the broader markets in which we participate. Recall that la",1428,"Thanks, Dave. Good morning. 
Please turn to Slide 6. As Dave just mentioned, the quarter surpassed what we had expected as we saw very strong demand in residential HVAC and continued recovery in the broader markets in which we participate. Recall that last quarter, we said that we believe the Q2 year-on-year sales decline would be the low point for the year. That proved to be the case as Q3 sales of $5 billion did not decline, but in fact, were up almost 4% over the prior year and 3% organically. This was driven primarily by residential HVAC. While we saw sequential improvement across the company since the second quarter, we still had modest year-over-year sales declines in the majority of our businesses in Q3. 
GAAP operating profit was $1.1 billion, and that includes a $252 million gain on the sale of about 9 million shares in Beijer. Adjusted operating profit of $867 million was up 6% from last year. Our incremental margin was 27%, and this number would be materially higher absent the incremental public company and TSA costs. Accelerated productivity and continued cost control drove the strong performance on margins.  
Our Q3 GAAP EPS was $0.84, and adjusted EPS was $0.67. Since we were not a public company last year, the year-over-year comparisons are not meaningful. 
Our free cash flow was strong, considerably higher than we had expected. The biggest driver was higher net income, but we also saw working capital improvement and a favorable timing impact from interest and tax payments. All things considered, a very strong third quarter for Carrier in a very difficult environment.  
Let's now look at how the segments performed. Please turn to Slide 7, and note that the year-over-year numbers to which I will refer are organic comparisons. 
The HVAC segment sales were up 11% from last year. Within the segment, residential was up 46%. We are very proud of how well the team executed on unprecedented levels of demand that enabled us to gain share. Recall that we ended Q2 with field inventory levels down about 25%. At the end of Q3, we saw field inventories back to prior year levels and expect a more normalized Q4 in that business. COVID created very atypical seasonality for residential as Q2 was down materially, and Q3 was unusually strong, and we expect the full year 2020 will likely end up as a fairly normal year in total.  
In North America light commercial, we saw a sales decline of 13%. We did see sequential improvement during the Q3 as reopenings continued, but we expect light commercial to continue to lag this year. Commercial HVAC sales were down 7%, with modest declines in most of its business lines. We saw a low single-digit decline in applied and a high single-digit decline in the services businesses. Applied sales were down less than the overall commercial HVAC, as we entered this slowdown with a healthy backlog in this longer cycle business. All of these year-over-year declines improved from those in the second quarter.  
From a regional perspective for commercial HVAC, China sales were up about 10% in the quarter, but Asia, excluding China, was weak, especially India, as it remains heavily impacted by disruptions related to COVID. We are confident we gained share in China and North America in applied.  
Now over to Refrigeration, where segment sales were down 6%. North America truck/trailer was down about 30%, but that reflects almost a 50% improvement from the trough we saw in Q2. Europe truck trailer was down close to 10%, and container was up mid-single digits. We saw improving order trends for both North America and Europe truck/trailer, and believe we have turned the corner on the down cycle in both businesses. Commercial refrigeration sales were flat in the quarter, as a modest decline in EMEA was offset by mid single-digit growth in Asia.  
Moving over to Fire & Security segment, which was down 7%. The products business was down consistent with the segment. Declines in the Americas and Europe were partially offset by double-digit growth in China. Within the Americas, our residential fire products business grew low single digits, which was offset by declines at some of our security businesses that are more impacted by the slowdown in the small business and hospitality markets. The field business is also down in line with the segment, as restricted building access and lagging commercial construction activity drove mid to high single-digit declines on install and repair jobs. That effect was partially offset by low single-digit growth in the recurring service piece of the business. 
Bottom line, we saw continued encouraging trends across the company, with the pace of recovery differing in some areas. While we have observed more normalizing market conditions, we continue to focus on controlling the controllables and an aggressive cost management that will help us fund investments to position us for future growth.  
Please turn to Slide 8. I will provide an update on our cost programs. And each quarter this year, we have accelerated our in-year savings plan for Carrier 600. With that success, we are now confident in increasing the 3-year target to $700 million, and renaming the program, Carrier 700. 
On the slide, you'll see that the $250 million target for 2020 for Carrier 700, and the planned investment of $100 million remain unchanged. We had previously discussed spending about $300 million over 3 years for investments in R&D, digital and sales, and we still expect to do so. You'll notice that our savings from cost containment actions is now $250 million, down from $300 million that we discussed last quarter. Because the business has been executing at a much higher level, in the fourth quarter, we are restoring some of the temporary people-related cost actions taken earlier this year. 
Also updated from last quarter is the headwind from productivity and absorption issues related to the pandemic. Better-than-expected volumes as well as strong execution has resulted in the absorption headwinds not being quite as bad as we had anticipated. If you recall, our original model for Carrier 600 was that the savings we generated would fully fund our growth in investments, and the remainder would drop through. With about $100 million in year-over-year headwind expected for 2021 from the reversal of onetime cost containment measures, it will require a larger portion of our Carrier 700 benefits. This means less of the savings should drop to the bottom line and could impact our incremental margins next year.  
Continuing on Slide 9. As we've said, a key priority during the pandemic has been to maintain ample liquidity. And as you see on this slide, our strong focus on cash has enabled very good free cash flow, which was driven by better-than-expected earnings and tightly managed working capital. We exited the quarter with $3.8 billion in cash on the balance sheet, which was helped by the partial sale of our shares in Beijer. As conditions in the market have improved, we now plan to pay down $1.5 billion in debt before the end of the year, a big step towards our debt repayment plans. 
With a healthy balance sheet, we are well positioned to emerge from the pandemic on a stronger footing and capitalize on the opportunities as we return to a more normalized environment. As a result, we expect to be in a position to communicate more details on our capital allocation priorities early next year.  
Please turn to Slide 10, and I'll review our outlook. On our Q2 call, we gave you guidance ranges that reflected the broader uncertainty associated with the economic climate we were experiencing. Now with 2 months to go in the year, we can provide a more precise and improved outlook from what we gave you in July. We now expect sales to be about $17.3 billion, higher than the high end of our prior guidance range. This is based on the significant strength we saw in residential HVAC in Q3 and the broader economic improvement. We expect adjusted operating profit of approximately $2.2 billion, which is also above the high end of our prior range. This reflects the drop-through from the higher sales outlook.  
On free cash flow, we now expect to generate about $1.5 billion in 2020, a significant improvement from our prior outlook of at least $1.1 billion. The biggest driver of the cash flow is higher net income, along with continued tight working capital management and a few timing items.  
With that, I'll hand it back to Dave to wrap things up before Q&A."

Well, in 4Q, we have some -- I mean, yes, resi was particularly strong in Q3, and that drove a lot of our Q3 favorability. We're expecting a bit more normalized Q4 as they are transitioning kind of from splits of air conditioners into furnaces, so it will be a bit more normalized than we saw in Q3. But also in Q4, we are anticipating -- remember, we have about $25 million of quarterly impact from year-on-year effect from our public company costs. And we do anticipate that we're going to spend about $75 million of the $100 million that we've set aside for investments. 
You might ask the question, why so back-end loaded? But the reality of it is, this year, we started out with an expectation we're going to invest $150 million. Before the COVID hit, we scaled that back considerably, and now we reinstated as things are looking better. But it takes a little bit of time to ramp down and ramp back up. So we have baked in there about $75 million of our investment to hit. And there's about $20 million of other kind of transition-related things from UTC as we stand-alone as a public company. So adjusting for those things, you would see that it's much more normalized fourth quarter."

On balance across that, we probably have $100 million of headwind, net headwind from those actions.

I mean, we haven't set up -- think about the  average remaining of $450 million on the Carrier 700 versus the $250 million we've experienced already, and then subtract out the investments, and then probably we'll use a little bit of the Carrier 700 remaining to cover some of that year-on-year decrement."

We were really 2x the overall market. So clearly, we picked up share in the third quarter. But it's really not, I think, fair for us to look at it just 1 quarter at a time. If you look at it over a 12-month period, we picked up about 100 basis points of share, which is, I think, a better indicator. But look, we've said that we were going to really lean into growth and focus on really winning out in the marketplace. And I think our team, Chris Nelson, Justin Keppy and the team have done a really nice job of that, partnering with our distributors. 
So we've seen it really across the U.S., and it's not just splits. We've seen it on the furnace side as well. I think part of it was the fact that, operationally, we were able to perform and provide units to the dealers. There's been some dealer conversion. 
And I think the other factor is that we came into the quarter with somewhat depressed inventory levels with our distribution channels. Inventory levels coming into 3Q were down about 25% year-over-year, and then you kind of look at the sudden spike we saw in orders in June that carried forward into July and August, we really had to turn up the heat to make sure that we could support our customers. And frankly, it was a challenge. Our customers have done a great job working with us. But we did -- it was quite a ramp to support them. But on balance, we've been very pleased with the share gains. The key is that we sustain that going forward. 
I think in terms of the salespeople, the 450 we referred to is that's really mostly outside of resi, where we've been looking at that in both the applied space on the OE side as well as in services and aftermarket. And that's very much a global phenomenon. We've been adding those mostly in China and North America, a little bit in Europe, which has been a bit more challenge to add them there. But -- and I don't think that's the end of it. We had come into this year saying that we had a deficit versus some of our competitors. We said we'd add 500, we've added 450, and I think we'll end up adding more as we go into next year."

I know it's not really a channel, especially on applied, where there's inventory. But anything from a replenishment standpoint or a comp that we should keep in mind? Because, I guess, just given the mix of business there and what we're seeing in nonres construction, there should at least be a little bit of headwind. So that surprises me as being particularly strong."

Look, I think that it's quite bifurcated. There's some real strength in applied. When you look at things like data centers and health care and warehouses, we're seeing continued strength globally, especially in China and the U.S. Education has picked up quite well, not only K-12, but universities. 
Commercial building is a bit of a watch item. We know there are some real headwinds, things like retail hospitality, restaurants that has a more acute impact on our light commercial business. 
So when we look at it, one encouraging metric that we did see pop up a bit was ABI, the architectural billing index, which is a good forward-looking indicator. It's been hovering around 40, we saw it go up to 47. We would like to see that north of 50. Dodge Construction year-to-date is down about 20%, but only about 15% of our business ties to that metric. 
So I think when you put that all together, it's a watch item. There are some encouraging areas, and where it's strong, I think we've really leaned into and seen some share gains. China has been particularly strong, and I'm quite proud of the team there, and North America has been continuing to recover. So I look at it, I think we're going to exit this year with our applied business backlog up around 5% or 10% going into next year. But it's clearly a watch item, and we'll have to keep monitoring it."

Josh, I would tell you that we are very encouraged by not only the trends we're seeing in IAQ but the opportunity. It starts with the premise that people spend 90% of their time indoors. So if you're 50 years old, you've spent 45 years on this Earth",386,"Yes. Josh, I would tell you that we are very encouraged by not only the trends we're seeing in IAQ but the opportunity. It starts with the premise that people spend 90% of their time indoors. So if you're 50 years old, you've spent 45 years on this Earth indoors. And you look at the amount of indoor square footage, that's going to double over the next 40 years. So when you look at something like COVID, it's really shined the light on the criticality of making sure that people have healthy, safe and sustainable indoor air environment. 
So the way we've approached it is really twofold. One is introduce new products, things like OptiClean, the certification of our electrostatic filters for the home. We're working on air purifiers. We're working on new types of filtration, whether it's UV or bipolar ionization and really round out the portfolio and get those to market, and there's been significant pull. 
On top of that, we've been working on more customized solutions that look at more broader ventilation solutions about airflow and air changes per hour that are more holistic changes. And then the broader solution is ultimately going to be something that gets into independent assessments about the healthy and safe indoor air quality. We'll work on a digital solution so tenants have visibility to whether or not the indoor air environment is up to standard. And then we'll be rolling that out in a more holistic way. 
When we look at the market size, we get this question a lot, and here's what I'd say. If you look at the products that we sell into, our HVAC systems, our Fire & Security systems, that total market is about $90 billion to $100 billion. And we think that the additional opportunity created through IAQ is about 10%. So call it, $9 billion to $10 billion, and one thing I can tell you is that I'm extremely confident that we'll get more than our fair share of that piece. Now it takes some time to build up. I talked about a pipeline of $150 million. We continue to see real traction, real customers making orders. So it's going to take some time to build up to that number, but we do think it's certainly within our sights over time."

First, I will say, when you look at decrementals for that segment of the business, in Refrigeration, first of all, you get kind of what I call the law of small numbers. There was a $46 million decline in sales, and the operating profit decline was a small piece of that. But within it, you had a mix between CCR, our commercial refrigeration business and transport. Commercial was top line, pretty flat and modestly down on the bottom line. Transport, obviously, our high-margin business was down about 10% on balance across that business, and down, say, $15 million to $20 million on the bottom line. 
There were a couple of other small charges in there. So that really explains the very high decremental for the business. But it -- I would say, to your last question, when we see that turnaround, and we expect that we're kind of at the bottom or have seen the bottom of that cycle, you will see very strong incrementals on the way back up.

Some of that is the strength we had in resi and the relatively short receivable terms and our long payable terms. So you're seeing a lot of the purchases we had for that as positive cash flow in Q3, that interchange between them. We'll pay those mostly back in the fourth quarter, maybe a little bit will bleed into the first quarter of next year. 
And then also, somewhat COVID-related and somewhat start-up related, we have some tax deferrals, for practical purposes. So for instance, there's $50 million, $60 million of tax on the sale of Beijer. We obviously recognize the gain in the third quarter. We will pay the tax for it in the fourth quarter.

So if you recall back at Investor Day, we kind of dimensionalized the investment back into the business to position it for growth was $150 million, $100 million and then $50 million. And as COVID hit, it kind of changed that",243,"Yes. So let me start on that. So if you recall back at Investor Day, we kind of dimensionalized the investment back into the business to position it for growth was $150 million, $100 million and then $50 million. And as COVID hit, it kind of changed that pacing. So we're $100 million this year. Again, I said earlier, we've spent $25 million to date. Most in the third quarter. We're anticipating $75 million in the fourth quarter. That will be the $100 million. In 2021, we expect another $100 million. And then in 2022, we would expect to finish out that program at $100 million. And we'll have to see from there what further investment may make sense. So that's kind of that, and that's all baked into what we said earlier. 
From a CapEx standpoint, we do expect considerable, still $125 million, $150 million, of capital spend in the fourth quarter of this year that also contributes to the -- what you might consider a weaker cash flow in the fourth quarter. So there is considerable capital spend there. 
You also may recall back at Investor Day, we said we would spend $350 million to $400 million as kind of foundational capital expenditure in 2020. That was scaled back considerably because of the COVID. But we do expect that, that will push out into 2021. So you would see that level in 2021. So there will be some cash headwind there."

And I was looking at our top 20 projects where we've been pulled into the project that I mentioned in Colorado, where, through Cushman & Wakefield, we would have had a typical chiller sale, which would have been significant. But we added a number of UV lights and other kind of bipolar ionization, other kind of filtration add-ons to an otherwise typical order. That was really quite significant. 
We've seen it with a university in Southeast Asia, where we had a very significant dedicated IAQ sale, where they were very focused on as they were welcoming students back. 
So look, some are firm orders. Some are, I think, soon to be converted into firm orders. And it really has been primarily on the HVAC side. But Jurgen and his team have some really creative offerings. The Blue Diamond piece is going to be part of our overall digital solution because that's the piece that can have that customer intimacy where you can look at your smartphone and you can use that to see how are the actual indicators for IAQ, whether it's your CO2 levels or your -- the amount of ventilation that you're seeing or other things that you may be measuring. We were looking at about 7 attributes that we'll be looking at. And BlueDiamond will be a great source for us to kind of monitor those 7 attributes and also give the end customer insight into those attributes. 
BlueDiamond also gives you capabilities around contact tracing. We have the announcement that Jurgen and team drove with FLIR around thermal scanning. So there's a number of things in his portfolio that are attractive but become a lot more attractive when they're part of the Carrier solution."

Before we get going, let me first comment on the upcoming CFO transition that we announced last week. Patrick Goris, currently the CFO of Rockwell Automation, will be joining us as our CFO in a couple of weeks",1499,"Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. 
Before we get going, let me first comment on the upcoming CFO transition that we announced last week. Patrick Goris, currently the CFO of Rockwell Automation, will be joining us as our CFO in a couple of weeks. At that point, Tim will take on the role of senior adviser, helping us with a smooth transition to Patrick and taking on specific key projects until his retirement in mid-February. 
For context, when we hired Tim, he was very clear with us that his role would be to help effectively stand us up as a public company, including building the finance team and function, strengthening the balance sheet, helping us establish our strategic priorities, working with the rating agencies and investment community and charting the course for his successor. Doing all that and more, Tim has been the perfect CFO at the perfect time. I can't thank him enough for everything he has done for me personally and for Carrier. 
After a thorough search, I could not be happier to have Patrick joining us. I suspect most of you know him well. During his time at Rockwell, Patrick transformed the finance function, helped drive industry-leading top and bottom line performance and a shift toward a recurring revenue model, and he was instrumental in guiding strategic capital allocation and portfolio optimization. We look forward to welcoming Patrick to the Carrier team.  
With that, please turn to Slide 2, where I'll discuss our Q3 highlights. In short, Q3 was a very encouraging quarter. Sales of $5 billion were up 4% year-over-year and substantially exceeded our expectations. Adjusted operating profit was up 6% year-over-year. We had strong incrementals in the quarter, putting our reported year-to-date decrementals at 30%, but operationally at 26%, factoring in the $53 million of additional public company costs. Our performance was driven by continued strength in North America residential HVAC, which was up 46% in the quarter, and by continued traction on our cost and growth initiatives. 
In resi, this was our highest quarter ever for both sales and operating profit. We are pleased with our free cash flow generation in the quarter, which was $880 million, primarily driven by higher net income and better working capital performance, and we realized $300 million of cash before taxes from our sale of 9 million shares in Beijer. 
We continue to aggressively reduce costs via a strategic disciplined approach, including reducing G&A and simplifying the back office. As a result, we are now raising Carrier 600 to Carrier 700, which calls for $700 million of recurring cost takeout by the end of 2022. This will allow us to fund investments in growth while driving margin expansion. We remain on track to invest an incremental $100 million in growth initiatives this year.  
Based on our Q3 strength, we are again raising our 2020 full year outlook on sales, adjusted operating profit and free cash flow. Given that we had $3.8 billion of cash at the end of the quarter, we plan to pay down $1.5 billion of debt in the fourth quarter. Next year, we expect to do more while supporting our dividend and preserving flexibility for M&A opportunities.  
Pivoting now to Slide 3 on our progress on our overall priorities. We've put in place a playbook that is gaining traction. Adoption of the Carrier Way has created a profound cultural transformation, which is resulting in an agile, innovative, aggressive, winning-focused organization, all of which is helping fuel our growth agenda. 
It starts with ensuring a performance culture, putting our customers first, and through a rigorous deployment of Carrier Excellence in our supplier excellence program, our on-time delivery has increased to 96%, and our quality and performance has improved 30% year-to-date. 
We continue to invest in our growth initiatives. We have added an incremental 450 sales and sales support personnel this year, and have introduced a number of innovative offerings, including the first fully autonomous, all-electric, engineless refrigerated trailer system in Europe; and a new multipurpose cloud-connected commercial fire detector that combines smoke detection with advanced sensing capabilities. And in terms of services, aftermarket and digital initiatives, our commercial HVAC business closed the quarter at a 27% attachment rate globally, on track to achieve 30% by the end of this year. 
We have signed over 300 BlueEdge contracts since the program launched in June. 
We are also continuing to drive connected offerings across the network. For example, in the commercial refrigeration business, we completed a very successful pilot on our condition-based maintenance program, improving uptime by about 33%, and improving technician productivity by over 20%. 
In Fire & Security, our Kidde Fire Systems business shipped its first orders for IntelliSite, a remote health monitoring service for industrial fire alarm and suppression system control units. At a Carrier enterprise level, we are truly leaning into the emerging trends around healthy, safe and sustainable building and cold chain solutions, which you'll see on Slide 4.  
Starting with healthy, safe and sustainable buildings. Our strategy here is to be the leading one-stop shop provider, which is driving strong customer interest and new product introductions that continue to gain traction. We obtained independent validation through a rigorous testing process that our Infinity air purifier's capture and kill (sic) [ Captures & Kills ] technology inactivates 99% of coronavirus trapped on the filter, the first of its kind. Orders for those filtration systems were up 140% year-over-year in the third quarter. We also have orders for nearly 15,000 OptiClean units, and we are working an active pipeline for thousands more. 
Through our relationship with Cushman & Wakefield, we were able to upgrade a Denver area office campus with air purification systems with needlepoint bipolar ionization technology for every rooftop unit on its campus, along with service by Carrier's BlueEdge platform. And we just signed a strategic HVAC deal at the 50-floor One Court Square Tower in Long Island City, which we estimate will save up to 20% in energy cost annually and deliver improved comfort and air quality. 
For the healthy building space overall, we now have an active pipeline of potential order activity of $150 million, and we're still in the early stages of putting the comprehensive strategy in place to maximize our offerings and capture the opportunity ahead of us.  
Similarly, we recently launched our Healthy, Safe and Sustainable Cold Chain Program. I am thrilled with our new relationship with Amazon Web Services, with whom we are partnering to develop a robust and powerful data ecosystem for cold chain operations. We also introduced Carrier Pods monitored by our Sensitech business to support added mobile cold chain capacity and cargo insights. With key partners, we're working to connect the dots to provide a one-stop shop approach for cold chain solutions for both food and pharma distribution. 
So we've made progress on our financial results, our performance culture, strategic growth initiatives and capital allocation.  
Before I turn it over to Tim, let me give you some color on current order trends. Slide 5 outlines our 3 segments, which we have broken into 2 key business lines each. We also provide color by geographic region. Starting with HVAC. You see here that our residential and light commercial orders were up 60% year-over-year in the quarter, driven by resi. Movement from distribution to dealers was strong and distribution inventory levels are now in balance. For commercial HVAC, orders improved from down about 15% in Q2 to almost flat in Q3. 
In our Refrigeration segment's transport business, order trends indicate that Q2 was the bottom for our truck trailer business. Unit order rates more than doubled from June to September. Container orders were down in Q3, but these tend to be lumpy, and we have seen solid October orders. Commercial refrigeration orders were also down in the quarter but improved sequentially from Q2.  
For Fire & Security products, orders improved from down 20% in Q2 to down about 10%. We saw improvement in commercial and residential fire, China and the controls business, while the small- and medium-sized business, oil and gas and hospitality markets were weak. The F&S field business orders improved from down almost 30% in Q2 to down around 5% in Q3. Installation and nonrecurring service orders were down around 10%, given the discretionary nature of that work, while recurring service and monitoring orders were flat. 
Our business has reflected the bifurcated macro economy, where residential, health care, education, data centers and warehouses have remained strong, while the oil and gas, small and medium businesses and hospitality verticals remain challenged. Fortunately, the latter verticals are a much smaller part of our portfolio. We see the same bifurcation geographically, where the U.S. and China remains strong, Europe is recovering and Asia, excluding China, is very challenged. While we're encouraged by Q3 order trends, we recognize the continued global uncertainty, and we remain prepared to adapt.  
With that, I'll turn it over to Tim and then come back to summarize before Q&A. Tim?"

Please turn to Slide 6.

Recall that la",1427,"Thanks, Dave. Good morning. 
Please turn to Slide 6. As Dave just mentioned, the quarter surpassed what we had expected as we saw very strong demand in residential HVAC and continued recovery in the broader markets in which we participate. Recall that last quarter, we said that we believe the Q2 year-on-year sales decline would be the low point for the year. That proved to be the case as Q3 sales of $5 billion did not decline, but in fact, were up almost 4% over the prior year and 3% organically. This was driven primarily by residential HVAC. While we saw sequential improvement across the company since the second quarter, we still had modest year-over-year sales declines in the majority of our businesses in Q3. 
GAAP operating profit was $1.1 billion, and that includes a $252 million gain on the sale of about 9 million shares in Beijer. Adjusted operating profit of $867 million was up 6% from last year. Our incremental margin was 27%, and this number would be materially higher absent the incremental public company and TSA costs. Accelerated productivity and continued cost control drove the strong performance on margins.  
Our Q3 GAAP EPS was $0.84, and adjusted EPS was $0.67. Since we were not a public company last year, the year-over-year comparisons are not meaningful. 
Our free cash flow was strong, considerably higher than we had expected. The biggest driver was higher net income, but we also saw working capital improvement and a favorable timing impact from interest and tax payments. All things considered, a very strong third quarter for Carrier in a very difficult environment.  
Let's now look at how the segments performed. Please turn to Slide 7, and note that the year-over-year numbers to which I will refer are organic comparisons. 
The HVAC segment sales were up 11% from last year. Within the segment, residential was up 46%. We are very proud of how well the team executed on unprecedented levels of demand that enabled us to gain share. Recall that we ended Q2 with field inventory levels down about 25%. At the end of Q3, we saw field inventories back to prior year levels and expect a more normalized Q4 in that business. COVID created very atypical seasonality for residential as Q2 was down materially, and Q3 was unusually strong, and we expect the full year 2020 will likely end up as a fairly normal year in total.  
In North America light commercial, we saw a sales decline of 13%. We did see sequential improvement during the Q3 as reopenings continued, but we expect light commercial to continue to lag this year. Commercial HVAC sales were down 7%, with modest declines in most of its business lines. We saw a low single-digit decline in applied and a high single-digit decline in the services businesses. Applied sales were down less than the overall commercial HVAC, as we entered this slowdown with a healthy backlog in this longer cycle business. All of these year-over-year declines improved from those in the second quarter.  
From a regional perspective for commercial HVAC, China sales were up about 10% in the quarter, but Asia, excluding China, was weak, especially India, as it remains heavily impacted by disruptions related to COVID. We are confident we gained share in China and North America in applied.  
Now over to Refrigeration, where segment sales were down 6%. North America truck/trailer was down about 30%, but that reflects almost a 50% improvement from the trough we saw in Q2. Europe truck trailer was down close to 10%, and container was up mid-single digits. We saw improving order trends for both North America and Europe truck/trailer, and believe we have turned the corner on the down cycle in both businesses. Commercial refrigeration sales were flat in the quarter, as a modest decline in EMEA was offset by mid-single-digit growth in Asia.  
Moving over to Fire & Security segment, which was down 7%. The products business was down consistent with the segment. Declines in the Americas and Europe were partially offset by double-digit growth in China. Within the Americas, our residential fire products business grew low single digits, which was offset by declines at some of our security businesses that are more impacted by the slowdown in the small business and hospitality markets. The field business is also down in line with the segment, as restricted building access and lagging commercial construction activity drove mid to high single-digit declines on install and repair jobs. That effect was partially offset by low single-digit growth in the recurring service piece of the business. 
Bottom line, we saw continued encouraging trends across the company, with the pace of recovery differing in some areas. While we have observed more normalizing market conditions, we continue to focus on controlling the controllables and an aggressive cost management that will help us fund investments to position us for future growth.  
Please turn to Slide 8. I will provide an update on our cost programs. And each quarter this year, we have accelerated our in-year savings plan for Carrier 600. With that success, we are now confident in increasing the 3-year target to $700 million, and renaming the program, Carrier 700. 
On the slide, you'll see that the $250 million target for 2020 for Carrier 700, and the planned investment of $100 million remain unchanged. We had previously discussed spending about $300 million over 3 years for investments in R&D, digital and sales, and we still expect to do so. You'll notice that our savings from cost containment actions is now $250 million, down from $300 million that we discussed last quarter. Because the business has been executing at a much higher level, in the fourth quarter, we are restoring some of the temporary people-related cost actions taken earlier this year. 
Also updated from last quarter is the headwind from productivity and absorption issues related to the pandemic. Better-than-expected volumes as well as strong execution has resulted in the absorption headwinds not being quite as bad as we had anticipated. If you recall, our original model for Carrier 600 was that the savings we generated would fully fund our growth in investments, and the remainder would drop through. With about $100 million in year-over-year headwind expected for 2021 from the reversal of onetime cost containment measures, it will require a larger portion of our Carrier 700 benefits. This means less of the savings should drop to the bottom line and could impact our incremental margins next year.  
Continuing on Slide 9. As we've said, a key priority during the pandemic has been to maintain ample liquidity. And as you see on this slide, our strong focus on cash has enabled very good free cash flow, which was driven by better-than-expected earnings and tightly managed working capital. We exited the quarter with $3.8 billion in cash on the balance sheet, which was helped by the partial sale of our shares in Beijer. As conditions in the market have improved, we now plan to pay down $1.5 billion in debt before the end of the year, a big step towards our debt repayment plans. 
With a healthy balance sheet, we are well positioned to emerge from the pandemic on a stronger footing and capitalize on the opportunities as we return to a more normalized environment. As a result, we expect to be in a position to communicate more details on our capital allocation priorities early next year.  
Please turn to Slide 10, and I'll review our outlook. On our Q2 call, we gave you guidance ranges that reflected the broader uncertainty associated with the economic climate we were experiencing. Now with 2 months to go in the year, we can provide a more precise and improved outlook from what we gave you in July. We now expect sales to be about $17.3 billion, higher than the high end of our prior guidance range. This is based on the significant strength we saw in residential HVAC in Q3 and the broader economic improvement. We expect adjusted operating profit of approximately $2.2 billion, which is also above the high end of our prior range. This reflects the drop-through from the higher sales outlook.  
On free cash flow, we now expect to generate about $1.5 billion in 2020, a significant improvement from our prior outlook of at least $1.1 billion. The biggest driver of the cash flow is higher net income, along with continued tight working capital management and a few timing items.  
With that, I'll hand it back to Dave to wrap things up before Q&A."

Well, in 4Q, we have some -- I mean, yes, resi was particularly strong in Q3, and that drove a lot of our Q3 favorability. We're expecting a bit more normalized Q4 as they are transitioning kind of from splits of air conditioners into furnaces, so it will be a bit more normalized than we saw in Q3. But also in Q4, we are anticipating -- remember, we have about $25 million of quarterly impact from year-on-year effect from our public company costs. And we do anticipate that we're going to spend about $75 million of the $100 million that we've set aside for investments. 
You might ask the question, why so back-end loaded? But the reality of it is, this year, we started out with an expectation we're going to invest $150 million. Before the COVID hit, we scaled that back considerably, and now we reinstated as things are looking better. But it takes a little bit of time to ramp down and ramp back up. So we have baked in there about $75 million of our investment to hit. And there's about $20 million of other kind of transition-related things from UTC as we stand-alone as a public company. So adjusting for those things, you would see that it's much more normalized fourth quarter."

I mean, we haven't set up -- think about the  average remaining of $450 million on the Carrier 700 versus the $250 million we've experienced already, and then subtract out the investments, and then probably we'll use a little bit of the Carrier 700 remaining to cover some of that year-on-year decrement."

We were really 2x the overall market. So clearly, we picked up share in the third quarter. But it's really not, I think, fair for us to look at it just 1 quarter at a time. If you look at it over a 12-month period, we picked up about 100 basis points of share, which is, I think, a better indicator. But look, we've said that we were going to really lean into growth and focus on really winning out in the marketplace. And I think our team, Chris Nelson, Justin Keppy and the team have done a really nice job of that, partnering with our distributors. 
So we've seen it really across the U.S., and it's not just splits. We've seen it on the furnace side as well. I think part of it was the fact that, operationally, we were able to perform and provide units to the dealers. There's been some dealer conversion. 
And I think the other factor is that we came into the quarter with somewhat depressed inventory levels with our distribution channels. Inventory levels coming into 3Q were down about 25% year-over-year, and then you kind of look at the sudden spike we saw in orders in June that carried forward into July and August, we really had to turn up the heat to make sure that we could support our customers. And frankly, it was a challenge. Our customers have done a great job working with us. But we did -- it was quite a ramp to support them. But on balance, we've been very pleased with the share gains. The key is that we sustain that going forward. 
I think in terms of the salespeople, the 450 we referred to is that's really mostly outside of resi, where we've been looking at that in both the applied space on the OE side as well as in services and aftermarket. And that's very much a global phenomenon. We've been adding those mostly in China and North America, a little bit in Europe, which has been a bit more challenge to add them there. But -- and I don't think that's the end of it. We had come into this year saying that we had a deficit versus some of our competitors. We said we'd add 500, we've added 450, and I think we'll end up adding more as we go into next year."

And then you have all of these costs, puts and takes between our increase on Carrier 700, so we have $450 million to go, you could probably consider $225 million a year, next year and the year after that.

When you look at things like data centers and health care and warehouses, we're seeing continued strength globally, especially in China and the U.S. Education has picked up quite well, not only K-12, but universities. 
Commercial building is a bit of a watch item. We know there are some real headwinds, things like retail hospitality, restaurants that has a more acute impact on our light commercial business. 
So when we look at it, one encouraging metric that we did see pop up a bit was ABI, the architectural billing index, which is a good forward-looking indicator. It's been hovering around 40, we saw it go up to 47. We would like to see that north of 50. Dodge Construction year-to-date is down about 20%, but only about 15% of our business ties to that metric. 
So I think when you put that all together, it's a watch item. There are some encouraging areas, and where it's strong, I think we've really leaned into and seen some share gains. China has been particularly strong, and I'm quite proud of the team there, and North America has been continuing to recover.

It starts with the premise that people spend 90% of their time indoors. So if you're 50 years old, you've spent 45 years on this Earth indoors. And you look at the amount of indoor square footage, that's going to double over the next 40 years. So when you look at something like COVID, it's really shined the light on the criticality of making sure that people have healthy, safe and sustainable indoor air environment. 
So the way we've approached it is really twofold. One is introduce new products, things like OptiClean, the certification of our electrostatic filters for the home. We're working on air purifiers. We're working on new types of filtration, whether it's UV or bipolar ionization and really round out the portfolio and get those to market, and there's been significant pull. 
On top of that, we've been working on more customized solutions that look at more broader ventilation solutions about airflow and air changes per hour that are more holistic changes. And then the broader solution is ultimately going to be something that gets into independent assessments about the healthy and safe indoor air quality. We'll work on a digital solution so tenants have visibility to whether or not the indoor air environment is up to standard. And then we'll be rolling that out in a more holistic way. 
When we look at the market size, we get this question a lot, and here's what I'd say. If you look at the products that we sell into, our HVAC systems, our Fire & Security systems, that total market is about $90 billion to $100 billion. And we think that the additional opportunity created through IAQ is about 10%. So call it, $9 billion to $10 billion, and one thing I can tell you is that I'm extremely confident that we'll get more than our fair share of that piece. Now it takes some time to build up. I talked about a pipeline of $150 million. We continue to see real traction, real customers making orders. So it's going to take some time to build up to that number, but we do think it's certainly within our sights over time."

First, I will say, when you look at decrementals for that segment of the business, in Refrigeration, first of all, you get kind of what I call the law of small numbers. There was a $46 million decline in sales, and the operating profit decline was a small piece of that. But within it, you had a mix between CCR, our commercial refrigeration business and transport. Commercial was top line, pretty flat and modestly down on the bottom line. Transport, obviously, our high-margin business was down about 10% on balance across that business, and down, say, $15 million to $20 million on the bottom line. 
There were a couple of other small charges in there. So that really explains the very high decremental for the business. But it -- I would say, to your last question, when we see that turnaround, and we expect that we're kind of at the bottom or have seen the bottom of that cycle, you will see very strong incrementals on the way back up.

So you're seeing a lot of the purchases we had for that as positive cash flow in Q3, that interchange between them. We'll pay those mostly back in the fourth quarter, maybe a little bit will bleed into the first quarter of next year. 
And then also, somewhat COVID-related and somewhat start-up related, we have some tax deferrals, for practical purposes. So for instance, there's $50 million, $60 million of tax on the sale of Beijer. We obviously recognize the gain in the third quarter. We will pay the tax for it in the fourth quarter.

So in all candor, we're playing a little bit of catch-up, but we know what to do. We know the playbook, we have confidence in it. If you look at our overall service backlog, it's actually up about 30% because some of the orders that we've had have been pushing out to the right when you look at some customers pushing out modernizations and some other task.

And then in 2022, we would expect to finish out that program at $100 million. And we'll have to see from there what further investment may make sense. So that's kind of that, and that's all baked into what we said earlier. 
From a CapEx standpoint, we do expect considerable, still $125 million, $150 million, of capital spend in the fourth quarter of this year that also contributes to the -- what you might consider a weaker cash flow in the fourth quarter. So there is considerable capital spend there. 
You also may recall back at Investor Day, we said we would spend $350 million to $400 million as kind of foundational capital expenditure in 2020.

We've factored in what does it take to consistently grow in that mid-single-digit range, and that's where we've come up with that investment level. And we've also consistently said that we would expect to improve ROS 50 bps a year. So we keep all that in balance in our algorithm. 
But I could tell you something that is very -- a little bit new, but very thematic at Carrier is that we are going to grow. We are going to invest in growth, and we're going to be consistent. We're not going to do a lot of fits and starts. We're going to make commitments on growth areas, and we're going to stick to them."

And just -- if you just give us the context of the $150 million orders that you called out, that would -- we should group that as part of your -- the bucket of the assessment for the healthy buildings and so forth. How does that split between equipment sales and then the recurring side of this, the BlueDiamond piece?"

The $150 million, that was the pipeline. We are in active -- they're not all firm orders yet. We've actually -- we have a number of firm orders, like I mentioned, with the OptiClean and others. And we actually have -- we -- this is something, obvious",339,"Yes. The $150 million, that was the pipeline. We are in active -- they're not all firm orders yet. We've actually -- we have a number of firm orders, like I mentioned, with the OptiClean and others. And we actually have -- we -- this is something, obviously, we review often. And I was looking at our top 20 projects where we've been pulled into the project that I mentioned in Colorado, where, through Cushman & Wakefield, we would have had a typical chiller sale, which would have been significant. But we added a number of UV lights and other kind of bipolar ionization, other kind of filtration add-ons to an otherwise typical order. That was really quite significant. 
We've seen it with a university in Southeast Asia, where we had a very significant dedicated IAQ sale, where they were very focused on as they were welcoming students back. 
So look, some are firm orders. Some are, I think, soon to be converted into firm orders. And it really has been primarily on the HVAC side. But Jurgen and his team have some really creative offerings. The Blue Diamond piece is going to be part of our overall digital solution because that's the piece that can have that customer intimacy where you can look at your smartphone and you can use that to see how are the actual indicators for IAQ, whether it's your CO2 levels or your -- the amount of ventilation that you're seeing or other things that you may be measuring. We were looking at about 7 attributes that we'll be looking at. And BlueDiamond will be a great source for us to kind of monitor those 7 attributes and also give the end customer insight into those attributes. 
BlueDiamond also gives you capabilities around contact tracing. We have the announcement that Jurgen and team drove with FLIR around thermal scanning. So there's a number of things in his portfolio that are attractive but become a lot more attractive when they're part of the Carrier solution."

And we just reviewed with our Board our specific targets that we will be committing ourselves to and we'll be releasing publicly. 
Obviously, it's going to be a big focus on sustainability, and I think folks will be quite pleased by how we're stepping up around our sustainability targets. But it includes everything from D&I, where I really believe that we've leaned into the moment around diversity and inclusion And that's just the profound impact that, that's had on us this year that's going to be sustainable. And all other aspects of D&I, how we deal with our suppliers in various elements, in our own operations. 
So I think this will be very, very thematic for Carrier. It's thematic for our space, but we're really looking to differentiate ourselves and I think you would expect us to be within the top quartile on an ESG basis."
