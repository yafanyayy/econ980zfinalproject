With me is Paul Adler, Cintas Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our third quarter results for fiscal 2020. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and provides a safe harbor of litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. 
Before discussing the financials, I want to say that our thoughts go out to all of those impacted by the COVID-19 coronavirus. This is a challenging time for all of us, and we can't thank enough our partners -- our employees, and we call partners, for doing all that they can to keep our customers' places of business clean, safe and ready for the day. We currently find ourselves at the peak of uncertainty as it relates to the pandemic impact on the economy. The response of our country in each state evolves daily. A week ago, we hadn't seen much impact to our business, and we were expecting today to increase revenue and EPS guidance based on our year-to-date results and fourth quarter outlook. However, much has changed in a matter of days and more changes are likely to come. Due to this uncertainty, including the severity and duration of the pandemic, we are not providing guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 at this time. We certainly remain focused, though, on the safety and well-being of our employee partners and the care of our customers. 
So let's move to providing our third quarter results, and then we will open it up for questions. Our fiscal 2020 third quarter revenue was $1.81 billion, an increase of 7.6% over last year's third quarter. Earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations were $2.16, an increase of 17.4% over last year's third quarter, adjusted for G&K integration expenses. 
Free cash flow for this year's third quarter was $300 million, an increase of 17.2%. The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and differences in the number of work days was 5.7% for the third quarter of fiscal '20. The organic growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment was 4.8%, and the organic growth rate for the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment was 12.5%. Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal '20 of $824.4 million, increased 9.2%. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 45.5% for the third quarter of fiscal '20 compared to 44.9% in the third quarter of fiscal '19. Operating income for the third quarter of fiscal '20 of $314.7 million increased 13.1%. Operating margin was 17.4% in the third quarter of fiscal '20 compared to 16.5% in fiscal '19. 
Net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal '20 was $234.5 million, and reported earnings per diluted share were $2.16. Excluding the G&K acquisition integration expenses in fiscal '19, EPS increased 17.4%. In addition to the solid financial performance, we continue to generate strong cash flow and commit to effectively deploying cash to increase shareholder value. Third quarter free cash flow was $300 million, an increase of 17.2% compared to last year. In the third quarter of fiscal '20, we paid an annual dividend totaling $268 million. The dividend of $2.55 per share was an increase of 24.4% over last year's annual dividend. In addition to the annual dividend, we purchased $393.1 million of Cintas stock in fiscal '20 to date, including $200 million in March. The amount remaining under our buyback authorization is $1.1 billion. 
We ended our third quarter with fiscal year-to-date revenue growth of 7.2%, an organic growth rate of 7.1%. Operating income, excluding last year's G&K integration expenses, increased 14.7%. EPS adjusted for last year's special items increased 22.2%, and finally, free cash flow for the third quarter year-to-date increased 61%. Our employee partners have really done a great job this year. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Paul for additional details for our third quarter results."

We have 2 reportable operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other.

We have 2 reportable operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as other services on the income statement. 
Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.45 billion, an increase of 6.6%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate changes and the difference in number of workdays, the organic growth rate was 4.8%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 45.8% for the third quarter compared to 44.9% in last year's third quarter, an improvement of 90 basis points. Gross margins have strengthened for many reasons, including strong revenue growth and realization of cost synergies from the acquisition of G&K. 
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the third quarter was $170.5 million. The organic growth rate for the segment was 12.5%. The First Aid segment gross margin was 48.0% in the third quarter compared to 48.2% in last year's third quarter. The difference in gross margin was due to revenue mix in the quarter, which consists of service, product sales and training. The strong organic revenue growth benefited from more safety and personal protective equipment product sales, which generally have lower margins than the other revenue categories. 
Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. Our Fire business continues to grow each year at a strong pace. Uniform Direct Sale business growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. Uniform Direct Sale, however, is a key business for us, and its customers are often significant opportunities to cross-sell and provide products and services from our other business units. 
All Other revenue was $192.1 million, an increase of 9.9%. The organic growth rate was 7.1%. The Fire business organic growth rate was 4.1%. Fire revenue was weighed down by the loss of a struggling national account in the retail sector that recently disclosed the closing of over 100 stores, by mild winter weather that resulted in less sprinkler repair service revenue from freezing and bursting water pipes, and by a decline in sales rep productivity through the Christmas and New Year's holidays. Uniform Direct Sale business organic growth rate was 11.1% and benefited from additional sales from the rollout last quarter of Carhartt branded garments to a Fortune 100 customer. All Other gross margin was 41.3% for the third quarter of this fiscal year compared to 42.3% last year. 
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.2% in the third quarter of fiscal '20 and 28.3% in the third quarter of fiscal '19. G&A labor expense as a percent of revenue improved year-over-year. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal '20 was 18.9% compared to 20.1% last year. The tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. 
Our cash and equivalents balance as of February 29 was $234.4 million. Of that amount, $144.7 million was in the United States and unrestricted. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $63.2 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $50.2 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $10.1 million in First Aid and Safety and $2.9 million in All Other. Year-to-date, free cash flow was $745.2 million, an increase of 61% compared to the prior year period. Free cash flow increased because of strong earnings growth and improvements in working capital, particularly accounts receivable, inventories, uniforms and other rental items in service and accounts payable. 
As of February 29, our balance sheet remains strong. Our leverage was 1.7x debt to EBITDA. We have an untapped credit facility of $1 billion. No debt maturities in the next 12 months, and no material debt maturities in the next 2 years. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

We're -- as of a week ago, we didn't really see much impact to our revenue. And so we're going about trying to get a better understanding of that as we go through this week and into the future. But let me remind you, we have a very diverse customer base. About 30% of our revenues from industrials, 70% from service providing -- the service proving businesses. That includes health care, retail, distribution centers, food service, hospitality, and all of these are being affected in different ways. If you think about health care, for example, they really need us now. They -- we -- they need our scrubs, they need our microfiber wipes. They need our cleaning chemicals. They need our fire protection. If you think about restaurants, some were closed. Some were opened to only carry out, and we're learning as we visit them this week, what are their needs. They may still need some chef works, some hygiene products, first aid and safety, but we're going to -- it's going to take a little bit of time to understand what those needs are. Office environments, they're looking to stay clean more than ever. And so we're seeing some nice movement there in terms of our First Aid and Safety, our personal protective equipment like gloves. And then you think about hotels, casinos arenas, they aren't doing very much business right now. And so we are in the midst of better understanding the collective impact to the business model. And gosh, we're so early in that process, that it's really hard to break it down because in addition, to the details that I just provided and keeping in mind, if you think about 3 digit codes, we don't have revenue of greater than 10% in any of those 3 digit codes. But also keep in mind, as I talked about revenue per vertical, it's quite different from geography to geography today. So if you think about some of those different businesses that are on the coasts, they may be impacted more severely than those same kind of businesses in the same verticals in the middle of the country. And so this is -- it's going to take a little bit of time for us to really get clarity on the collective impact to the business, and we're just not there yet."

That's a -- holiday manufacturing shutdowns are a good example of that. Semester breaks at school is a good example of that. What we're talking about right now is quite different. And so we have to understand from our customers how long do they think they will be closed, and many of them right now, don't know. But for how long do we think they're going to be closed and what are the needs of the business today versus maybe where they were a couple of weeks ago? And so it's going to be all over the board, Andy, from small businesses to large businesses and different kinds of verticals in different geographies and as I said, we're working through that to gain clarity."

I think another -- over 20 states have closed the restaurants. That's -- I mean, that's unprecedented. And it's not like our customers are going out of business over time or even had the chance to reduce their workforce. They're kind of closing many of them on orders of municipalities. And so there's going to be a little -- there's going to be certainly a more immediate impact. What is that impact? Look, one of the reasons that we did not provide guidance is, it's really hard to tell. We've never been through a pandemic, and in this pandemic, we're seeing things that we really haven't seen in the 90 years of Cintas of running the business. And so we're -- we need a little bit of time for clarity. As I said, we haven't seen much of an impact as of a week ago, but there's going to be an impact coming.

So if you think about the the fixed versus variable and how can we -- how will we manage the business, right, through this disruption. And right now, there is a fair amount of uncertainty, as I've mentioned a number of times. And we need a little bit more clarity. And the clarity and as it relates to this is really around what's the depth of this, what's the breadth of this, how long will this last, what's the severity and duration. If we start to believe that the -- that for example, the severity is pretty high, but we don't expect the duration to last very long, then we may not be as aggressive because we don't want to harm the long-term opportunities and the performance of the business as we move into next fiscal year. As we go into this, if we feel like the duration is going to be longer, then we may take different steps to pull down some of those variable expenses. And so we're going to need a little bit of time to understand what our best expectations are for severity and duration, and we'll manage accordingly that. 
I can tell you, as we sit here today, we are generally -- and we have been for a long time, in a mode of growing the business and adding routes and adding laundry capacity. And as we sit here today, I would -- we have not -- or at least we've slowed CapEx, for example, to only those things that are essential. And so in other words, we're not looking to add routes right now. That will reduce CapEx. We're not looking to expand capacities in our wash alleys, add extra -- open new processing facilities, that's going to reduce CapEx. Along those lines, that means we likely won't be hiring people to staff those new routes to staff the added capacity. And so those are -- there are certainly things that we can do today to say we expect to get into a period where the growth isn't going to be what it was in the first 3 quarters. And so we can pull back on that a little bit. And that certainly is going to help the cash flow. But as it relates to then being more aggressive, we are -- we're here for the long term. And if we feel like this is a short duration disruption, we'll likely treat that a little bit differently than a longer-term duration."

The question is, are they variable to the point where we can turn them off immediately and do we want to turn them off immediately? That's the biggest question that we're dealing with. And it's really -- I think it'd be responsible of me to give you a percentage of just total variable costs because we have to manage the business and we're managing it for the long term. And so I'm not -- I don't want to throw out some variable number where you think we will cut to the bone our business. So let me give you some examples, though. When you think about the material cost of the business, we've got a lot of cost of disposable products like paper, soaps. We have direct sale like our catalog business. Those are highly variable. And if we're not selling them, we don't have those costs. We also have the gas, water and energy. The gas for our trucks, the water and energy for running the facilities, there certainly is a variable component of that, but there's also a bit of a fixed and it just depends on how much of that capacity we may decide or not to pull back on. Then if you think about the laundry capacity, there are a lot of different pieces that go into that, including labor. And then when you think about our route capacity, we've got the cost of our drivers. And so there are a lot of variable costs. Our goal is to make sure that our business remains strong for the long term. And so if we start to see a longer duration then there are certainly some things that we will do like pull back even a little harder on capital expenditures and other growth pieces of what we do. We may do some things through attrition. And we'll have to ensure we understand the capacity utilization and knowing that we want to manage to that. If you go back to '09 and '10, we did close facilities, but that was a little bit different than that. It was a longer period of a recession. This is potentially deep, but we just don't know the duration. And we do not want to -- we do not want to impact the business for the long-term until we really have to."

This is, again, this is not a normal kind of ramping down a trending down of the business. This is kind of an abrupt closure of a lot of different customers. But let's remember something else about our business. As I mentioned a little bit earlier, there are a number of -- there are many businesses that really need our products and services. And I don't want that to be lost. There have been a couple municipalities and areas within the country, particularly on the coasts, and we have been identified as an essential provider. And so even though other businesses may be shutting down, we are operating because our customers need us. And we're going to, over the course of the next few weeks, we're going to understand the collective impact. But let's keep in mind that while some of our customers are going to be impacted negatively, there are others that really need us. We're seeing an increase in what they need, and we're going to do everything we can to take care of them. So it's a mix and we're going to -- it's going to take a little bit of time to understand that and give some clarity."

It's going to just -- there's going to be some period of disruption that we have to work ourselves through. I think it's -- I think we have to be careful about comparing this to a prior recession.

And so for example, all of our customers in New Rose Shell they're hard to get to, as you can imagine, with the National Guard controlling the streets there. That's been difficult. There are others that have been difficult on the West Coast as well. But collectively, it wasn't that big of an impact. I expect that we will start to see some impact as we go through the rest of this week and certainly then in next week. And that's when we're going to start to be able to get a little clarity on what's the initial response of our customers and what might their needs be as we move through.

And so we're -- we've been pretty efficient and, I'd say, prudent in CapEx throughout the year.

Now whether that has to do with China in the early parts of the quarter, not sure or the uncertainty around this, that's really hard to put our finger on, but we certainly did see some choppiness in that side of the business, and that contributed to a little bit of a deceleration there. Pricing was a bit more aggressive in the quarter. We talked a little bit about that in our second quarter and that remained here in the third quarter. And the holidays, I mentioned this in the second quarter call back in December. The holidays are tough. When you've got 2 holidays on a Wednesday, generally speaking, our sales people have a really hard time of setting appointments. And so if you think about a 2-week period of time, where you've got many customers because it's on a Wednesday, taken the whole week off or in and out, it's really hard to set appointments. And so we saw -- we did see some impact to our sales rep productivity. Paul mentioned in Fire and also in Rental. And that was a bit of a contributor as well. So collectively, those things were what we saw in the third quarter. Let's set aside the pandemic. The business has been operating at a very healthy pace, and we've really liked the execution of it. And while the disruption is coming, we think we're poised pretty well to manage through that and get back on to our business once we get through this."

With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our third quarter results for fiscal 2020. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.
Before discussing the financials, I want to say that our thoughts go out to all of those impacted by the COVID-19 coronavirus. This is a challenging time for all of us, and we can't thank enough our partners -- our employees, whom we call partners, for doing all that they can to keep our customers' places of business clean, safe and ready for the work day. We currently find ourselves at the peak of uncertainty as it relates to the pandemic's impact on the economy. The response of our country in each state evolves daily. A week ago, we hadn't seen much impact to our business, and we were expecting today to increase revenue and EPS guidance based on our year-to-date results and fourth quarter outlook. However, much has changed in a matter of days and more changes are likely to come. Due to this uncertainty, including the severity and duration of the pandemic, we are not providing guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 at this time. We certainly remain focused, though, on the safety and well-being of our employee partners and the care of our customers. 
So let's move to providing our third quarter results, and then we will open it up for questions. Our fiscal 2020 third quarter revenue was $1.81 billion, an increase of 7.6% over last year's third quarter. Earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations were $2.16, an increase of 17.4% over last year's third quarter, adjusted for G&K integration expenses. 
Free cash flow for this year's third quarter was $300 million, an increase of 17.2%. The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and differences in the number of work days was 5.7% for the third quarter of fiscal '20. The organic growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment was 4.8%, and the organic growth rate for the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment was 12.5%. 
Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal '20 of $824.4 million, increased 9.2%. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 45.5% for the third quarter of fiscal '20 compared to 44.9% in the third quarter of fiscal '19. Operating income for the third quarter of fiscal '20 of $314.7 million increased 13.1%. Operating margin was 17.4% in the third quarter of fiscal '20 compared to 16.5% in fiscal '19.
Net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal '20 was $234.5 million, and reported earnings per diluted share were $2.16. Excluding the G&K acquisition integration expenses in fiscal '19, EPS increased 17.4%. In addition to the solid financial performance, we continue to generate strong cash flow and commit to effectively deploying cash to increase shareholder value. Third quarter free cash flow was $300 million, an increase of 17.2% compared to last year. In the third quarter of fiscal '20, we paid an annual dividend totaling $268 million. The dividend of $2.55 per share was an increase of 24.4% over last year's annual dividend. In addition to the annual dividend, we purchased $393.1 million of Cintas stock in fiscal '20 to date, including $200 million in [ March ]. The amount remaining under our buyback authorization is $1.1 billion. 
We ended our third quarter with fiscal year-to-date revenue growth of 7.2%, and an organic growth rate of 7.1%. Operating income, excluding last year's G&K integration expenses, increased 14.7%. EPS adjusted for last year's special items increased 22.2%. And finally, free cash flow for the third quarter year-to-date increased 61%. Our employee partners have really done a great job this year. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Paul for additional details for our third quarter results."

We have 2 reportable operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as other services on the income statement.
Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.45 billion, an increase of 6.6%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate changes and the difference in number of workdays, the organic growth rate was 4.8%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 45.8% for the third quarter compared to 44.9% in last year's third quarter, an improvement of 90 basis points. Gross margins have strengthened for many reasons, including strong revenue growth and realization of cost synergies from the acquisition of G&K. 
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the third quarter was $170.5 million. The organic growth rate for the segment was 12.5%. The First Aid segment gross margin was 48.0% in the third quarter compared to 48.2% in last year's third quarter. The difference in gross margin was due to revenue mix in the quarter, which consists of service, product sales and training. The strong organic revenue growth benefited from more safety and personal protective equipment product sales, which generally have lower margins than the other revenue categories. 
Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. Our Fire business continues to grow each year at a strong pace. The Uniform Direct Sale business growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. Uniform Direct Sale, however, is a key business for us, and its customers are often significant opportunities to cross-sell and provide products and services from our other business units.
All Other revenue was $192.1 million, an increase of 9.9%. The organic growth rate was 7.1%. The Fire business organic growth rate was 4.1%. Fire revenue was weighed down by the loss of a struggling national account in the retail sector that recently disclosed the closing of over 100 stores, by mild winter weather that resulted in less sprinkler repair service revenue from freezing and bursting water pipes, and by a decline in sales rep productivity through the Christmas and New Year's holidays. 
Uniform Direct Sale business organic growth rate was 11.1% and benefited from additional sales from the rollout last quarter of Carhartt-branded garments to a Fortune 100 customer. All Other gross margin was 41.3% for the third quarter of this fiscal year compared to 42.3% last year.
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.2% in the third quarter of fiscal '20 and 28.3% in the third quarter of fiscal '19. G&A labor expense as a percent of revenue improved year-over-year. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal '20 was 18.9% compared to 20.1% last year. The tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense.
Our cash and equivalents balance as of February 29 was $234.4 million. Of that amount, $144.7 million was in the United States and unrestricted. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $63.2 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $50.2 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services; $10.1 million in First Aid and Safety; and $2.9 million in All Other. 
Year-to-date, free cash flow was $745.2 million, an increase of 61% compared to the prior year period. Free cash flow increased because of strong earnings growth and improvements in working capital, particularly accounts receivable, inventories, uniforms and other rental items in service and accounts payable. 
As of February 29, our balance sheet remains strong. Our leverage was 1.7x debt to EBITDA. We have an untapped credit facility of $1 billion. No debt maturities in the next 12 months, and no material debt maturities in the next 2 years.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

We're -- as of a week ago, we didn't really see much impact to our revenue. And so we're going about trying to get a better understanding of that as we go through this week and into the future. But let me remind you, we have a very diverse customer base, about 30% of our revenues from industrials, 70% from service providing -- the service proving businesses. That includes health care, retail, distribution centers, food service, hospitality, and all of these are being affected in different ways. If you think about health care, for example, they really need us now. They -- we -- they need our scrubs, they need our microfiber wipes. They need our cleaning chemicals. They need our fire protection. If you think about restaurants, some were closed, some were opened only carry out. And we're learning as we visit them this week, what are their needs. They may still need some chef works, some hygiene products, first aid and safety, but we're going to -- it's going to take a little bit of time to understand what those needs are. 
Office environments, they're looking to stay clean more than ever. And so we're seeing some nice movement there in terms of our First Aid and Safety, our personal protective equipment like gloves. And then you think about hotels, casinos, arenas, they aren't doing very much business right now. And so we are in the midst of better understanding the collective impact to the business model. And gosh, we're so early in that process that it's really hard to break it down. Because in addition to the details that I just provided and, keeping in mind, if you think about 3-digit NAICS codes, we don't have revenue of greater than 10% in any of those 3-digit NAICS codes. But also keep in mind, as I talked about revenue per vertical, it's quite different from geography to geography today. So if you think about some of those different businesses that are on the coasts, they may be impacted more severely than those same kind of businesses in the same verticals in the middle of the country. And so this is -- it's going to take a little bit of time for us to really get clarity on the collective impact to the business, and we're just not there yet."

And it's not like our customers are going out of business over time or even had the chance to reduce their workforce. They're kind of closing many of them on the orders of municipalities. And so there's going to be a little -- there's going to be certainly a more immediate impact. What is that impact? Look, one of the reasons that we did not provide guidance is it's really hard to tell. We've never been through a pandemic. And in this pandemic, we're seeing things that we really haven't seen in the 90 years of Cintas -- of running the business. And so we're -- we need a little bit of time for clarity.

So if you think about the fixed versus variable and how can we -- how will we manage the business, right, through this disruption? And right now, there is a fair amount of uncertainty, as I've mentioned a number of times. And we need a little bit more clarity. And the clarity and as it relates to this is really around what's the depth of this, what's the breadth of this, how long will this last, what's the severity and duration. If we start to believe that the -- that for example, the severity is pretty high, but we don't expect the duration to last very long, then we may not be as aggressive, because we don't want to harm the long-term opportunities and the performance of the business as we move into next fiscal year. 
As we go into this, if we feel like the duration is going to be longer, then we may take different steps to pull down some of those variable expenses. And so, we're going to need a little bit of time to understand what our best expectations are for severity and duration, and we'll manage accordingly to that.
I can tell you, as we sit here today, we are generally, and we have been for a long time, in a mode of growing the business and adding routes and adding laundry capacity. And as we sit here today, I would -- we have not -- or at least we've slowed CapEx, for example, to only those things that are essential. And so in other words, we're not looking to add routes right now. That will reduce CapEx. We're not looking to expand capacities in our wash alleys, add extra -- open new processing facilities that's going to reduce CapEx. Along those lines, that means we likely won't be hiring people to staff those new routes, to staff the added capacity. And so those are -- there are certainly things that we can do today to say we expect to get into a period where the growth isn't going to be what it was in the first 3 quarters. And so we can pull back on that a little bit. And that certainly is going to help the cash flow. But as it relates to then being more aggressive, we are -- we're here for the long term. And if we feel like this is a short duration disruption, we'll likely treat that a little bit differently than a longer-term duration."

The question is, are they variable to the point where we can turn them off immediately? And do we want to turn them off immediately? That's the biggest question that we're dealing with. And it's really -- I think it'd be responsible of me to give you a percentage of just total variable costs, because we have to manage the business and we're managing it for the long term. And so I'm not -- I don't want to throw out some variable number that, where you think, we will cut to the bone our business. 
So let me give you some examples, though. When you think about the material cost of the business, we've got a lot of cost of disposable products like paper, soaps. We have direct sale like our catalog business. Those are highly variable. And if we're not selling them, we don't have those costs. We also have the gas, water and energy, the gas for our trucks, the water and energy for running the facilities. There certainly is a variable component of that, but there's also a bit of a fixed, and it just depends on how much of that capacity we may decide or not to pull back on. Then if you think about the laundry capacity, there are a lot of different pieces that go into that, including labor. And then when you think about our route capacity, we've got the cost of our drivers. And so there are a lot of variable costs. Our goal is to make sure that our business remains strong for the long term. And so if we start to see a longer duration, then there are certainly some things that we will do like pull back even a little harder on capital expenditures and other growth pieces of what we do. We may do some things through attrition. And we'll have to ensure we understand the capacity utilization and knowing that we want to manage to that. If you go back to '09 and '10, we did close facilities, but that was a little bit different in that it was a longer period of a recession. This is potentially deep, but we just don't know the duration. And we do not want to -- we do not want to impact the business for the long-term until we really have to."

And I don't want that to be lost. There have been a couple municipalities and areas within the country, particularly on the coasts, and we have been identified as an essential provider.

I expect that we will start to see some impact as we go through the rest of this week and certainly then in next week. And that's when we're going to start to be able to get a little clarity on what the initial response of our customers and what might their needs be as we move through. And like I said, there are going to be some customers where their needs have really increased. There are going to be others who have -- who are closed and we're going to be talking about a different -- there's a different conversation there. We need to get through all of those conversations though."

But we've also -- keep in mind, we've gotten some capacity through the G&K deal, and we've gotten some efficiency through projects within the facilities. And our routes -- the revenue per route has been growing. And so we've become a little bit more efficient. And so we're -- we've been pretty efficient and, I'd say, prudent in CapEx throughout the year. But having said that, going forward, we've been at a, let's call it, a $60 million to $65 million quarterly clip. And certainly, that's going to come down probably by half. Now I don't have a very -- I don't have a -- that's not a scientific measurement, but it's going to come down quite a bit as we think about the fourth quarter. Beyond the fourth quarter, it's going to get back to our expectation for the severity and duration of this."

We've talked a little bit over the last 2 quarters about the choppiness that we had seen in industrials, and we certainly saw that pick up a little bit in our third quarter. Now whether that has to do with China in the early parts of the quarter, not sure, or the uncertainty around this, that's really hard to put our finger on. But we certainly did see some choppiness in that side of the business, and that contributed to a little bit of a deceleration there. 
Pricing was a bit more aggressive in the quarter. We talked a little bit about that in our second quarter, and that remained here in the third quarter. And the holidays, I mentioned this in the second quarter call back in December, the holidays are tough. When you've got 2 holidays on a Wednesday, generally speaking, our sales people have a really hard time of setting appointments. And so you -- if you think about a 2-week period of time, where you've got many customers because it's on a Wednesday, taken the whole week off or in and out, it's really hard to set appointments. And so we saw -- we did see some impact to our sales rep productivity. Paul mentioned in Fire and also in Rental, and that was a bit of a contributor as well. So collectively, those things were what we saw in the third quarter. Let's set aside the pandemic. The business has been operating at a very healthy pace, and we really like the execution of it. And while the disruption is coming, we think we're poised pretty well to manage through that and get back on to our business once we get through this."

In the meantime, we are well positioned to enter this period of disruption with a strong cash flow, a very solid balance sheet and an untapped $1 billion credit facility.

We will discuss our third quarter results for fiscal 2020. 
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.
Before discussing the financials, I want to say that our thoughts go out to all of those impacted by the COVID-19 coronavirus. This is a challenging time for all of us, and we can't thank enough our partners -- our employees, whom we call partners, for doing all that they can to keep our customers' places of business clean, safe and Ready for the Workday. We currently find ourselves at the peak of uncertainty as it relates to the pandemic's impact on the economy. The response of our country in each state evolves daily. A week ago, we hadn't seen much impact to our business, and we were expecting today to increase revenue and EPS guidance based on our year-to-date results and fourth quarter outlook. However, much has changed in a matter of days and more changes are likely to come. Due to this uncertainty, including the severity and duration of the pandemic, we are not providing guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 at this time. We certainly remain focused, though, on the safety and well-being of our employee partners and the care of our customers. 
So let's move to providing our third quarter results, and then we will open it up for questions. Our fiscal 2020 third quarter revenue was $1.81 billion, an increase of 7.6% over last year's third quarter. Earnings per diluted share, or EPS, from continuing operations were $2.16, an increase of 17.4% over last year's third quarter, adjusted for G&K integration expenses. Free cash flow for this year's third quarter was $300 million, an increase of 17.2%. 
The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and differences in the number of work days was 5.7% for the third quarter of fiscal '20. The organic growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment was 4.8%, and the organic growth rate for the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment was 12.5%. 
Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal '20 of $824.4 million increased 9.2%. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 45.5% for the third quarter of fiscal '20 compared to 44.9% in the third quarter of fiscal '19. 
Operating income for the third quarter of fiscal '20 of $314.7 million increased 13.1%. Operating margin was 17.4% in the third quarter of fiscal '20 compared to 16.5% in fiscal '19.
Net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal '20 was $234.5 million, and our reported earnings per diluted share were $2.16. Excluding the G&K acquisition integration expenses in fiscal '19, EPS increased 17.4%. 
In addition to the solid financial performance, we continue to generate strong cash flow and commit to effectively deploying cash to increase shareholder value. Third quarter free cash flow was $300 million, an increase of 17.2% compared to last year. 
In the third quarter of fiscal '20, we paid an annual dividend totaling $268 million. The dividend of $2.55 per share was an increase of 24.4% over last year's annual dividend. In addition to the annual dividend, we purchased $393.1 million of Cintas stock in fiscal '20 to date, including $200 million in March. The amount remaining under our buyback authorization is $1.1 billion. 
We ended our third quarter with fiscal year-to-date revenue growth of 7.2% and an organic growth rate of 7.1%. Operating income, excluding last year's G&K integration expenses, increased 14.7%. EPS adjusted for last year's special items increased 22.2%. And finally, free cash flow for the third quarter year-to-date increased 61%. Our employee partners have really done a great job this year. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Paul for additional details for our third quarter results."
260725,658421498,1941832,"Cintas Corporation, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Mar 19, 2020",2020-03-19,"Earnings Calls","Cintas Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike. We have 2 reportable operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other.

We have 2 reportable operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sales business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as other services on the income statement.
Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.45 billion, an increase of 6.6%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate changes and the difference in number of workdays, the organic growth rate was 4.8%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 45.8% for the third quarter compared to 44.9% in last year's third quarter, an improvement of 90 basis points. Gross margins have strengthened for many reasons, including strong revenue growth and realization of cost synergies from the acquisition of G&K. 
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the third quarter was $170.5 million. The organic growth rate for this segment was 12.5%. The First Aid segment gross margin was 48.0% in the third quarter compared to 48.2% in last year's third quarter. The difference in gross margin was due to revenue mix in the quarter, which consists of service, product sales and training. The strong organic revenue growth benefited from more safety and personal protective equipment product sales, which generally have lower margins than the other revenue categories. 
Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sales businesses are reported in the All Other category. Our Fire business continues to grow each year at a strong pace. The Uniform Direct Sales business growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. Uniform Direct Sales, however, is a key business for us, and its customers have often significant opportunities to cross-sell and provide products and services from our other business units.
All Other revenue was $192.1 million, an increase of 9.9%. The organic growth rate was 7.1%. The Fire business organic growth rate was 4.1%. Fire revenue was weighed down by the loss of a struggling national account in the retail sector that recently disclosed the closing of over 100 stores by mild winter weather that resulted in less sprinkler repair service revenue from freezing and bursting water pipes and by a decline in sales rep productivity through the Christmas and New Year's holidays. Uniform Direct Sales business organic growth rate was 11.1% and benefited from additional sales from the rollout last quarter of Carhartt-branded garments to a Fortune 100 customer. All Other gross margin was 41.3% for the third quarter of this fiscal year compared to 42.3% last year.
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.2% in the third quarter of fiscal '20 and 28.3% in the third quarter of fiscal '19. G&A labor expense as a percent of revenue improved year-over-year. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal '20 was 18.9% compared to 20.1% last year. The tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense.
Our cash and equivalents balance as of February 29 was $234.4 million. Of that amount, $144.7 million was in the United States and unrestricted. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $63.2 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $50.2 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $10.1 million in First Aid and Safety and $2.9 million in All Other. Year-to-date, free cash flow was $745.2 million, an increase of 61% compared to the prior year period. Free cash flow increased because of strong earnings growth and improvements in working capital, particularly accounts receivable, inventories, uniforms and other rental items in service and accounts payable. 
As of February 29, our balance sheet remains strong. Our leverage was 1.7x debt to EBITDA. We have an untapped credit facility of $1 billion. No debt maturities in the next 12 months and no material debt maturities in the next 2 years.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

We're -- as of a week ago, we didn't really see much impact to our revenue. And so we're going about trying to get a better understanding of that as we go through this week and into the future. But let me remind you, we have a very diverse customer base, about 30% of our revenues from industrials, 70% from service-providing businesses. That includes health care, retail, distribution centers, foodservice, hospitality, and all of these are being affected in different ways. If you think about health care, for example, they really need us now. They need our scrubs, they need our microfiber wipes. They need our cleaning chemicals. They need our fire protection. If you think about restaurants, while some are closed, some are opened only carryout. And we're learning, as we visit them this week, what are their needs. They may still need some chef works, some hygiene products, first aid and safety, but we're going to -- it's going to take a little bit of time to understand what those needs are. 
Office environments, they're looking to stay clean more than ever. And so we're seeing some nice movement there in terms of our First Aid and Safety, our personal protective equipment like gloves. And then you think about hotels, casinos, arenas, they aren't doing very much business right now. And so we are in the midst of better understanding the collective impact to the business, Manav. And gosh, we're so early in that process that it's really hard to break it down because in addition to the details that I just provided and keeping in mind, if you think about 3-digit NAICS codes, we don't have revenue of greater than 10% in any of those 3-digit NAICS codes. But also keep in mind, as I talked about revenue per vertical, it's quite different from geography to geography today. So if you think about some of those different businesses that are on the coasts, they may be impacted more severely than those same kind of businesses in the same verticals in the middle of the country. And so this is -- it's going to take a little bit of time for us to really get clarity on the collective impact to the business, and we're just not there yet."

That's a -- holiday manufacturing shutdowns are a good example of that. Semester breaks at school is a good example of that. What we're talking about right now is quite different. And so we have to understand from our customers how long do they think they will be closed, and many of them right now don't know, but for how long do we think they're going to be closed and what are the needs of the business today versus maybe where they were a couple of weeks ago. And so it's going to be all over the board, Andy, from small businesses to large businesses and different kinds of verticals in different geographies and, as I said, we're working through that to gain clarity."

And it's not like our customers are going out of business over time or even had the chance to reduce their workforce. They're kind of closing, many of them, on the orders of municipalities. And so there's going to be a little -- there's going to be certainly a more immediate impact. What is that impact? Look, one of the reasons that we did not provide guidance is it's really hard to tell. We've never been through a pandemic. And in this pandemic, we're seeing things that we really haven't seen in the 90 years of Cintas -- of running the business. And so we're -- we need a little bit of time for clarity.

So if you think about the fixed versus variable and how can we -- how will we manage the business, right, through this disruption. And right now, there is a fair amount of uncertainty, as I've mentioned a number of times. And we need a little bit more clarity. And the clarity in -- as it relates to this is really around what's the depth of this, what's the breadth of this, how long will this last, what's the severity and duration. If we start to believe that the -- that, for example, the severity is pretty high, but we don't expect the duration to last very long, then we may not be as aggressive because we don't want to harm the long-term opportunities and the performance of the business as we move into next fiscal year. As we go into this, if we feel like the duration is going to be longer, then we may take different steps to pull down some of those variable expenses. And so we're going to need a little bit of time to understand what our best expectations are for severity and duration, and we'll manage accordingly to that.
I can tell you, as we sit here today, we are generally, and we have been for a long time, in a mode of growing the business and adding routes and adding laundry capacity. And as we sit here today, I would -- we have not -- or at least we've slowed CapEx, for example, to only those things that are essential. And so in other words, we're not looking to add routes right now. That will reduce CapEx. We're not looking to expand capacities in our wash alleys, add extra -- open new processing facilities that's going to reduce CapEx. Along those lines, that means we likely won't be hiring people to staff those new routes, to staff the added capacity. And so those are -- there are certainly things that we can do today to say we expect to get into a period where the growth isn't going to be what it was in the first 3 quarters. And so we can pull back on that a little bit. And that certainly is going to help the cash flow. But as it relates to then being more aggressive, we are -- we're here for the long term. And if we feel like this is a short-duration disruption, we'll likely treat that a little bit differently than a longer-term duration."

The question is are they variable to the point where we can turn them off immediately and do we want to turn them off immediately. That's the biggest question that we're dealing with. And it's really -- I think it'd be responsible of me to give you a percentage of just total variable costs because we have to manage the business and we're managing it for the long term. And so I'm not -- I don't want to throw out some variable number where you think we will cut to the bone our business. 
So let me give you some examples, though. When you think about the material cost of the business, we've got a lot of cost of disposable products like paper, soaps. We have direct sale like our catalog business. Those are highly variable. And if we're not selling them, we don't have those costs. We also have the gas, water and energy, the gas for our trucks, the water and energy for running the facilities. There certainly is a variable component of that, but there's also a bit of a fixed, and it just depends on how much of that capacity we may decide or not to pull back on. Then if you think about the laundry capacity, there are a lot of different pieces that go into that, including labor. And then when you think about our route capacity, we've got the cost of our drivers. And so there are a lot of variable costs. 
Our goal is to make sure that our business remains strong for the long term. And so if we start to see a longer duration, then there are certainly some things that we will do like pull back even a little harder on capital expenditures and other growth pieces of what we do. We may do some things through attrition. And we'll have to ensure we understand the capacity utilization and knowing that we want to manage to that. If you go back to '09 and '10, we did close facilities, but that was a little bit different in that it was a longer period of a recession. This is potentially deep, but we just don't know the duration. And we do not want to impact the business for the long-term until we really have to."

But let's remember something else about our business. As I mentioned a little bit earlier, there are a number of -- there are many businesses that really need our products and services. And I don't want that to be lost. There have been a couple municipalities and areas within the country, particularly on the coasts, and we have been identified as an essential provider. And so even though other businesses may be shutting down, we are operating because our customers need us. And we're going to -- over the course of the next few weeks, we're going to understand that collective impact. But let's keep in mind that while some of our customers are going to be impacted negatively, there are others that really need us.

Pricing was a bit more aggressive in the quarter. We talked a little bit about that in our second quarter, and that remained here in the third quarter. And the holidays, I mentioned this in the second quarter call back in December, the holidays are tough. When you've got 2 holidays on a Wednesday, generally speaking, our salespeople have a really hard time of setting appointments. And so you -- if you think about a 2-week period of time, where you've got many customers, because it's on a Wednesday, taken the whole week off or in and out, it's really hard to set appointments. And so we saw -- we did see some impact to our sales rep productivity, Paul mentioned in Fire and also in Rental, and that was a bit of a contributor as well.

This is a challenging time for all of us, and we can't thank enough our partners -- our employees, whom we call partners, for doing all that they can to keep our customers' places of business clean, safe and Ready for the Workday. We currently find ourselves at the peak of uncertainty as it relates to the pandemic's impact on the economy. The response of our country in each state evolves daily. A week ago, we hadn't seen much impact to our business, and we were expecting today to increase revenue and EPS guidance based on our year-to-date results and fourth quarter outlook. However, much has changed in a matter of days and more changes are likely to come. Due to this uncertainty, including the severity and duration of the pandemic, we are not providing guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 at this time. We certainly remain focused, though, on the safety and well-being of our employee partners and the care of our customers. 
So let's move to providing our third quarter results, and then we will open it up for questions. Our fiscal 2020 third quarter revenue was $1.81 billion, an increase of 7.6% over last year's third quarter. Earnings per diluted share, or EPS, from continuing operations were $2.16, an increase of 17.4% over last year's third quarter, adjusted for G&K integration expenses. Free cash flow for this year's third quarter was $300 million, an increase of 17.2%. 
The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and differences in the number of workdays was 5.7% for the third quarter of fiscal '20. The organic growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment was 4.8%, and the organic growth rate for the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment was 12.5%. 
Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal '20 of $824.4 million increased 9.2%. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 45.5% for the third quarter of fiscal '20 compared to 44.9% in the third quarter of fiscal '19. 
Operating income for the third quarter of fiscal '20 of $314.7 million increased 13.1%. Operating margin was 17.4% in the third quarter of fiscal '20 compared to 16.5% in fiscal '19.
Net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal '20 was $234.5 million, and our reported earnings per diluted share were $2.16. Excluding the G&K acquisition integration expenses in fiscal '19, EPS increased 17.4%. 
In addition to the solid financial performance, we continue to generate strong cash flow and commit to effectively deploying cash to increase shareholder value. Third quarter free cash flow was $300 million, an increase of 17.2% compared to last year. 
In the third quarter of fiscal '20, we paid an annual dividend totaling $268 million. The dividend of $2.55 per share was an increase of 24.4% over last year's annual dividend. In addition to the annual dividend, we purchased $393.1 million of Cintas stock in fiscal '20 to date, including $200 million in March. The amount remaining under our buyback authorization is $1.1 billion. 
We ended our third quarter with fiscal year-to-date revenue growth of 7.2% and an organic growth rate of 7.1%. Operating income, excluding last year's G&K integration expenses, increased 14.7%. EPS adjusted for last year's special items increased 22.2%. And finally, free cash flow for the third quarter year-to-date increased 61%. Our employee partners have really done a great job this year. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Paul for additional details for our third quarter results."
260725,658421498,1943370,"Cintas Corporation, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Mar 19, 2020",2020-03-19,"Earnings Calls","Cintas Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike. We have 2 reportable operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other.

We have 2 reportable operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sales business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as other services on the income statement.
Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.45 billion, an increase of 6.6%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate changes and the difference in number of workdays, the organic growth rate was 4.8%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 45.8% for the third quarter compared to 44.9% in last year's third quarter, an improvement of 90 basis points. Gross margins have strengthened for many reasons, including strong revenue growth and realization of cost synergies from the acquisition of G&K. 
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the third quarter was $170.5 million. The organic growth rate for this segment was 12.5%. The First Aid segment gross margin was 48.0% in the third quarter compared to 48.2% in last year's third quarter. The difference in gross margin was due to revenue mix in the quarter, which consists of service, product sales and training. The strong organic revenue growth benefited from more safety and personal protective equipment product sales, which generally have lower margins than the other revenue categories. 
Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sales businesses are reported in the All Other category. Our Fire business continues to grow each year at a strong pace. The Uniform Direct Sales business growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. Uniform Direct Sales, however, is a key business for us, and its customers have often significant opportunities to cross-sell and provide products and services from our other business units.
All Other revenue was $192.1 million, an increase of 9.9%. The organic growth rate was 7.1%. The Fire business organic growth rate was 4.1%. Fire revenue was weighed down by the loss of a struggling national account in the retail sector that recently disclosed the closing of over 100 stores by mild winter weather that resulted in less sprinkler repair service revenue from freezing and bursting water pipes and by a decline in sales rep productivity through the Christmas and New Year's holidays. Uniform Direct Sales business organic growth rate was 11.1% and benefited from additional sales from the rollout last quarter of Carhartt-branded garments to a Fortune 100 customer. All Other gross margin was 41.3% for the third quarter of this fiscal year compared to 42.3% last year.
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.2% in the third quarter of fiscal '20 and 28.3% in the third quarter of fiscal '19. G&A labor expense as a percent of revenue improved year-over-year. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal '20 was 18.9% compared to 20.1% last year. The tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense.
Our cash and equivalents balance as of February 29 was $234.4 million. Of that amount, $144.7 million was in the United States and unrestricted. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $63.2 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $50.2 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $10.1 million in First Aid and Safety and $2.9 million in All Other. Year-to-date, free cash flow was $745.2 million, an increase of 61% compared to the prior year period. Free cash flow increased because of strong earnings growth and improvements in working capital, particularly accounts receivable, inventories, uniforms and other rental items in service and accounts payable. 
As of February 29, our balance sheet remains strong. Our leverage was 1.7x debt to EBITDA. We have an untapped credit facility of $1 billion. No debt maturities in the next 12 months and no material debt maturities in the next 2 years.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

We're -- as of a week ago, we didn't really see much impact to our revenue. And so we're going about trying to get a better understanding of that as we go through this week and into the future. But let me remind you, we have a very diverse customer base, about 30% of our revenues from industrials, 70% from service-providing businesses. That includes health care, retail, distribution centers, foodservice, hospitality, and all of these are being affected in different ways. If you think about health care, for example, they really need us now. They need our scrubs, they need our microfiber wipes. They need our cleaning chemicals. They need our fire protection. If you think about restaurants, while some are closed, some are opened only carryout. And we're learning, as we visit them this week, what are their needs. They may still need some chef works, some hygiene products, first aid and safety, but we're going to -- it's going to take a little bit of time to understand what those needs are. 
Office environments, they're looking to stay clean more than ever. And so we're seeing some nice movement there in terms of our First Aid and Safety, our personal protective equipment like gloves. And then you think about hotels, casinos, arenas, they aren't doing very much business right now. And so we are in the midst of better understanding the collective impact to the business, Manav. And gosh, we're so early in that process that it's really hard to break it down because in addition to the details that I just provided and keeping in mind, if you think about 3-digit NAICS codes, we don't have revenue of greater than 10% in any of those 3-digit NAICS codes. But also keep in mind, as I talked about revenue per vertical, it's quite different from geography to geography today. So if you think about some of those different businesses that are on the coasts, they may be impacted more severely than those same kind of businesses in the same verticals in the middle of the country. And so this is -- it's going to take a little bit of time for us to really get clarity on the collective impact to the business, and we're just not there yet."

That's a -- holiday manufacturing shutdowns are a good example of that. Semester breaks at school is a good example of that. What we're talking about right now is quite different. And so we have to understand from our customers how long do they think they will be closed, and many of them right now don't know, but for how long do we think they're going to be closed and what are the needs of the business today versus maybe where they were a couple of weeks ago. And so it's going to be all over the board, Andy, from small businesses to large businesses and different kinds of verticals in different geographies and, as I said, we're working through that to gain clarity."

And it's not like our customers are going out of business over time or even had the chance to reduce their workforce. They're kind of closing, many of them, on the orders of municipalities. And so there's going to be a little -- there's going to be certainly a more immediate impact. What is that impact? Look, one of the reasons that we did not provide guidance is it's really hard to tell. We've never been through a pandemic. And in this pandemic, we're seeing things that we really haven't seen in the 90 years of Cintas -- of running the business. And so we're -- we need a little bit of time for clarity.

So if you think about the fixed versus variable and how can we -- how will we manage the business, right, through this disruption. And right now, there is a fair amount of uncertainty, as I've mentioned a number of times. And we need a little bit more clarity. And the clarity in -- as it relates to this is really around what's the depth of this, what's the breadth of this, how long will this last, what's the severity and duration. If we start to believe that the -- that, for example, the severity is pretty high, but we don't expect the duration to last very long, then we may not be as aggressive because we don't want to harm the long-term opportunities and the performance of the business as we move into next fiscal year. As we go into this, if we feel like the duration is going to be longer, then we may take different steps to pull down some of those variable expenses. And so we're going to need a little bit of time to understand what our best expectations are for severity and duration, and we'll manage accordingly to that.
I can tell you, as we sit here today, we are generally, and we have been for a long time, in a mode of growing the business and adding routes and adding laundry capacity. And as we sit here today, I would -- we have not -- or at least we've slowed CapEx, for example, to only those things that are essential. And so in other words, we're not looking to add routes right now. That will reduce CapEx. We're not looking to expand capacities in our wash alleys, add extra -- open new processing facilities that's going to reduce CapEx. Along those lines, that means we likely won't be hiring people to staff those new routes, to staff the added capacity. And so those are -- there are certainly things that we can do today to say we expect to get into a period where the growth isn't going to be what it was in the first 3 quarters. And so we can pull back on that a little bit. And that certainly is going to help the cash flow. But as it relates to then being more aggressive, we are -- we're here for the long term. And if we feel like this is a short-duration disruption, we'll likely treat that a little bit differently than a longer-term duration."

The question is are they variable to the point where we can turn them off immediately and do we want to turn them off immediately. That's the biggest question that we're dealing with. And it's really -- I think it'd be responsible of me to give you a percentage of just total variable costs because we have to manage the business and we're managing it for the long term. And so I'm not -- I don't want to throw out some variable number where you think we will cut to the bone our business. 
So let me give you some examples, though. When you think about the material cost of the business, we've got a lot of cost of disposable products like paper, soaps. We have direct sale like our catalog business. Those are highly variable. And if we're not selling them, we don't have those costs. We also have the gas, water and energy, the gas for our trucks, the water and energy for running the facilities. There certainly is a variable component of that, but there's also a bit of a fixed, and it just depends on how much of that capacity we may decide or not to pull back on. Then if you think about the laundry capacity, there are a lot of different pieces that go into that, including labor. And then when you think about our route capacity, we've got the cost of our drivers. And so there are a lot of variable costs. 
Our goal is to make sure that our business remains strong for the long term. And so if we start to see a longer duration, then there are certainly some things that we will do like pull back even a little harder on capital expenditures and other growth pieces of what we do. We may do some things through attrition. And we'll have to ensure we understand the capacity utilization and knowing that we want to manage to that. If you go back to '09 and '10, we did close facilities, but that was a little bit different in that it was a longer period of a recession. This is potentially deep, but we just don't know the duration. And we do not want to impact the business for the long-term until we really have to."

But let's remember something else about our business. As I mentioned a little bit earlier, there are a number of -- there are many businesses that really need our products and services. And I don't want that to be lost. There have been a couple municipalities and areas within the country, particularly on the coasts, and we have been identified as an essential provider.

But let's keep in mind that while some of our customers are going to be impacted negatively, there are others that really need us. We're seeing an increase in what they need, and we're going to do everything we can to take care of them. So it's a mix, and we're going to -- it's going to take a little bit of time to understand that and give some clarity."

It's going to just -- there's going to be some period of disruption that we have to work ourselves through. I think it's -- I think we have to be careful about comparing this to a prior recession. This is a pandemic. That's quite different, and the disruption is going to be a little bit more abrupt and immediate. The question is how long will it last. And boy, if we can get through this as a country in the next 60, 90 days, we look forward to getting back to normal operations. But we got to see what that looks like first."

There are others that have been difficult on the West Coast as well. But collectively, it wasn't that big of an impact. I expect that we will start to see some impact as we go through the rest of this week and certainly then in next week. And that's when we're going to start to be able to get a little clarity on what the initial response of our customers and what might their needs be as we move, too.

But we certainly did see some choppiness in that side of the business, and that contributed to a little bit of a deceleration there. 
Pricing was a bit more aggressive in the quarter. We talked a little bit about that in our second quarter, and that remained here in the third quarter. And the holidays, I mentioned this in the second quarter call back in December, the holidays are tough. When you've got 2 holidays on a Wednesday, generally speaking, our salespeople have a really hard time of setting appointments. And so you -- if you think about a 2-week period of time, where you've got many customers, because it's on a Wednesday, taken the whole week off or in and out, it's really hard to set appointments. And so we saw -- we did see some impact to our sales rep productivity, Paul mentioned in Fire and also in Rental, and that was a bit of a contributor as well. So collectively, those things were what we saw in the third quarter. 
Let's set aside the pandemic. The business has been operating at a very healthy pace, and we really like the execution of it. And while the disruption is coming, we think we're poised pretty well to manage through that and get back on to our business once we get through this."

As you know, this continues to be a challenging time for all of us, and we can't thank our employees, who we call partners, for doing all that they can to keep our customers' places of business clean, safe and ready for the workday. 
On May 13, we provided an update on how Cintas's business has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and how we were managing the business. COVID-19 continues to be a significant disruption to our economy and to business. Our priorities are unchanged. They include keeping our employees healthy and safe and remaining committed to serving our customers in any way possible. I believe we're succeeding at both. 
Our employee partners have been consistent and diligent in their care of our customers, providing essential products and services to health care facilities, pharmaceutical companies, grocery store chains, food processing plants and many others. We've provided health care customers with clean scrubs and microfiber towels and [ mats. ] We've provided tens of thousands of customers with disinfectant and sanitizer spray services. And we've provided tremendous amounts of personal protective equipment, including face masks, face fields and other items to our customers to keep their employees safe. 
Our supply chain has worked feverishly to satisfy this demand. The demand for items like hand sanitizers and N95 respirators has increased tenfold in this pandemic. Our existing suppliers around the world have been key to us meeting this demand, and we thank them for their support. In addition, our scale enabled us to establish additional relationships with dozens of vendors to secure these scarce products. We continue to work to aid existing customers with the products and services that they desperately need, and our ability to access these products that others can't has enabled us to win new customers. We continue to communicate with our customers who remain idled who are -- and are considered on hold, and our focus is on being there to help them when they reopen. 
Before turning the call back to Mike, I want to conclude by stating that I'm thankful for the tremendous dedication of our employee partners. I'm proud of their ability to adapt in persevere in the midst of unprecedented adversity. In addition, I'm as excited as ever about our principal objective of exceeding our customers' expectations to maximize the long-term value of Cintas for our shareholders and working partners. 
Our value proposition of getting businesses ready for the workday by providing essential, unparalleled image, safety, cleanliness and compliance arguably has never resonated more than it does today. This pandemic will not soon be forgotten, and its impact on society is likely transformative. We believe a new trend of greater focus on health, readiness and outsourcing of noncore activities is underway. More health care scrubs are being professionally laundered and managed, so fewer are when public. Businesses, including universities and retail establishments, are requiring huge quantities of sanitizer and related services. Most businesses are providing larger budgets to align with proper cleaning protocols and supply chains of these key items are moving to the U.S. to reduce dependence on other nations. We believe Cintas is well positioned to benefit from this new normal. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Mike."

Our fiscal '20 fourth quarter revenue was $1.62 billion, a decrease of 9.7% compared to last year's fourth quarter.

Our fiscal '20 fourth quarter revenue was $1.62 billion, a decrease of 9.7% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations were $1.38, a decrease of [ 34.8% ] compared to last year's fourth quarter. Free cash flow for this year's fourth quarter was the highest it had been all year at $316 million. 
Organic revenue, adjusted for acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and differences in the number of workdays, declined 8.4% for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. Organic revenue for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment declined 9.6%. Organic revenue for First Aid and Safety Services operating segment increased 21.9%.
Gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 of $708 million decreased 14.1%. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 43.7% for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 compared to 45.9% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '19. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 30.9% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 and 28.3% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '19. Operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 of $207 million decreased 34%. Operating margin was 12.8% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 compared to 17.5% in fiscal '19. 
Our fiscal fourth quarter contained 1 less workday than the prior year fourth quarter. 1 less workday in a quarter has an impact of approximately 50 basis points on operating margin due to many large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation expense and amortization expense being determined on a monthly basis instead of a workday basis. 
Fourth quarter of fiscal '20 operating income was affected by many items caused by COVID-19, including additional reserves on accounts receivable and inventory, severance and asset impairment expenses and lower incentive compensation expense. Excluding these items, the operating margin was 15.5%. All of these items were recorded in selling and administrative expense. The additional inventory reserves account for slow moving inventory, mostly in our Uniform Direct Sales business, where customers in some of the most severely impacted industries such as airlines and hotels exist. 
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 was 20.4% compared to 21.7% last year. The tax rate can move from period-to-period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. Net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 was $145 million, and reported earnings per diluted share were $1.35. At the onset of the pandemic, we drew on our credit facility in the amount of $200 million. This was for defensive purposes. We have a great cash flow business. And as the quarter progressed, cash generation exceeded our expectations. Cash generated was used not only to repay the $200 million borrowed against the revolver but also to pay off a $200 million term loan. We ended the quarter carrying no variable debt. Our leverage calculation for our credit facility definition was 1.6x debt to EBITDA. Our balance sheet is strong. We have an untapped credit facility of $1 billion and no material debt maturities in the next 12 months. 
Free cash flow for the year exceeded $1 billion and increased 34.1% over the prior fiscal year. We remain steadfast in our commitment to effectively deploying cash to increase shareholder value. We purchased $393 million of Cintas stock in fiscal '20 under our buyback authorizations, including $200 million in early March before the COVID-19 pandemic. The amount remaining under our buyback authorization is $1.1 billion. 
Looking ahead to fiscal '21, please note that there will be 1 more workday than in fiscal '20. 1 more workday will benefit fiscal '21 total revenue growth by 40 basis points. 1 more workday also benefits operating margin and EPS. Fiscal '21 operating margin will be about 12.5 basis points better in comparison to fiscal '20 due to 1 more day of revenue. By quarter, in comparison to fiscal '20, the fiscal '21 first quarter will contain 1 more workday. The second quarter will contain the same number of workdays. The third quarter will contain 1 less work day, and the fourth quarter will contain 1 more workday. Please keep the quarterly day differences in mind when modeling our fiscal '21 results. 
Before turning the call over to Todd Schneider to discuss the performance of each of our businesses, I want to comment on fiscal '21 financial guidance. Due to the recent increases in the number of people contracting COVID-19 and the actions governments are taking again in response, uncertainty remains about the pace of the economic recovery. Therefore, we are not providing annual guidance at this time. However, since we are more than halfway through our quarter, we are willing to provide our first quarter financial expectations, and they are as follows: revenue in the range of $1.675 billion to $1.7 billion; uniform Rental and Facility Services segment organic revenue decline of 8% to 9%; First Aid and Safety Services segment organic revenue increase, approaching 10%; earnings per diluted share of $2 to $2.20; and  that implies a total operating margin in the range of 16.5% to 18% at the revenue midpoint. 
As Scott was quoted in today's earnings release, despite the uncertainty, we are confident in our ability to manage the short-term and maintain focus on our long-term objectives. Todd will now make some comments about the performance of each of our businesses. Todd?"

As Scott mentioned, our focus has been on the safety of our partners and fulfilling the needs of our customers. At the onset of the pandemic, our leadership team attacked the crisis like a major acquisition or investment. Leaders from all areas of the company met daily to gather information, strategize and execute. Daunting challenges were overcome, and many were viewed as opportunities, facilitated by our strong corporate culture, which is rooted in positivity, competitive urgency and concern for employees, customers and other key stakeholders. The results have included a safe and healthy workforce and a rise in Net Promoter Scores from our customers. 
Our approach was to be highly flexible and take a long-term view of our relationship with our customers. Fortunately, we were deemed an essential service in all markets we operate in. However, many of our customers were closed. And even for those who were open, the impact on our financials of their business was substantial. For those customers who are open or ready to reopen, we were able to provide products and services that were critical to providing confidence to their employees and customers that they were in a safe environment, products like soap, hand sanitizer, masks and disinfectant spray services. 
I'll now turn to the fourth quarter financial performance of our businesses. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, health care scrubs, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies, hand sanitizers and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.27 billion, a decrease of 11%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate changes and the difference in the number of workdays, organic revenue declined 9.6%. 
Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 43.6% for the fourth quarter,compared to 46.0% in last year's fourth quarter. We had 1 less workday in our fourth quarter, which had a negative impact of about 40 basis points in the current quarter. Lower production and service expenses as a percent of revenue compared to last year's fourth quarter were more than offset by amortization expense on uniforms, dust mats, towels and other items rented to customers. Amortization expense was 300 basis points higher this fourth quarter compared to last. This noncash expense is a significant headwind in the short term but will improve in ensuing quarters because purchases of new items were reduced and more existing items will become fully amortized. 
As Mike stated, selling and administrative expenses were negatively affected by many items caused by the COVID-19 coronavirus. Excluding the impact of the applicable aforementioned items, Uniform Rental and Facility Services' operating margin was 16.1% compared to 18.5% in the prior year period, a decremental margin of 37%. 
Our First Aid and Safety services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and sourcing of first aid products, personal protective equipment and training. This segment's revenue for the fourth quarter was $196.3 million. Organic revenue for the segment increased 21.9%. Revenue from servicing the first aid [ cabinets ] decreased due to the business closures from staying-in-place orders. However, our business of providing personal protective equipment surged, overcoming the revenue declines of cabinet servicing. Sales, service, supply chain, finance and others work quickly to provide current customers with masks, respirators, sanitizer and other critical items needed. In addition, the division secured new business through our ability to source scarce resources quickly. The result was a 40.8% organic revenue growth rate in May. Businesses are echoing our mantra of there is nothing more important than the health and safety of our employees and customers. 
The first aid segment gross margin was 46.1% in the fourth quarter compared to 47.7% in last year's fourth quarter. Lower production and service expenses as a percent of revenue compared to last year's fourth quarter were more than offset by cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold was 840 basis points higher this fourth quarter compared to last and is attributable to the increased proportion of revenue from personal protective equipment. Excluding the impact of the applicable previously mentioned items triggered by the COVID-19 coronavirus, the First Aid and Safety Services operating margin was 18.2% compared to 15.4% in the prior year period, an incremental margin of 32%. 
Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. Fire Protection Services include the performance of testing, inspection and maintenance of fire protection equipment, including extinguishers, alarms, sprinklers and emergency lights. Uniform Direct Sale business includes the provision of custom-tailored apparel. All Other revenue was $152 million, a decrease of 24.5%. Organic revenue declined 24.5%. 
The fire business organic revenue declined 12.4% due to the inability to access many businesses because of closures from stay-at-home orders. The Uniform Direct Sale business, organic revenue declined 39.5%. Revenue from our airline, cruise line, hospitality and gaming customers largely falls within this segment. These industries have been amongst the hardest hit by the pandemic. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

I think that you've all probably seen news reports of health care workers after work, going to grocery stores or some other place and being harassed by other customers because the customers were afraid that their clothing was contaminated. And hospitals realize that, health care workers realize that. Traditionally, particularly in the nursing end of health care, the nurses have bought their own scrubs and taking them home and watch them themselves. There has been a conversion to professional laundering of those scrubs so that health care workers don't take them home, don't wear them out of the hospital and so forth. And that would be something that we could handle for them. We have seen customers who have used our services relative to scrub rental in portions of the hospital, expand that into other areas of the hospital. And I think that, that is the beginning of a movement, we will see more and more of as I look to the future."

I would add that I think as a general statement, one of the reasons we saw the big spike of these sales in May is because there was really a rush by just about every business out there to find personal protective gear, hand sanitizer, the things that they need to keep their workplace open and clean. And if they could find somebody who had it, they were buying months' worth of supply because they were afraid that if they came back out into the market again to buy it, it may not be there. So it was almost, to me, like what we would see when we would sell a large direct sale customer. We get a big first upfront order as everybody gets their close, and then it drops off to a more typical run rate after that. I think that we're going to continue to see the demand for the masks and the hand sanitizers and that sort of thing, but there was a big upfront purchase, a race to make sure that you had enough of it. And it will settle back into an ongoing demand, certainly not at that 40% run rate. Now relative to the hygiene services, my read on that is that that's a long-term change in the marketplace. I said in the May call that I think that what this pandemic has done to workplace cleanliness and sanitation is similar to what 9/11 did to public building security. We have customers right now that have come to us and said, look, I have 7,000 branches. I need and sanitizer stations at all of them. I need somebody to come by on a regular basis and make sure that they're full. That's for my employees and my customers. We've seen large universities, big 10, Pac 10 universities come to us and have thousands of these hand sanitizer stations put up in their buildings across their campuses. They want us to do this because not only do we have the sanitizer and the station available but the service to come by on a regular basis and make sure that they have the supply that they need as opposed to worrying about buying a whole bunch of sort of retail pump bottles, trying to put them in places and having those disappear because people grab them and walk away with them. So I think that our service and our service model in these areas is playing a big role in the marketplace today with our existing customers and our ability to sign new customers. And once they start talking to us about things like hand sanitizers and surface sanitizer, spray services and things like that, they start talking about their restroom services. And if they have people that need uniforms, we start talking about uniforms and entrance mats and the rest of the things that go along with that. So from a hygiene standpoint, I'm confident that this trend is going to continue."

And our supply chain folks did a fantastic job going out and reacting to that. And I said on the last call that I think our supply chain has become a competitive advantage for us. We are in -- good and getting better stock position on most of these items, and we have competitors that are still struggling to source it at all. And so I think that our supply chain has done a great job. So I would say disruption, no, I don't think there's been any disruption. There were some a little bit at the beginning when we first started trying to find some of these things, but they've done a great job in meeting the demand."

So we really do like the opportunity as we move forward, but it's pretty difficult to put a specific number on it right now."

And so it's tough for me to say that this is better than others. But there are people that, when I first started going to the trade association meetings, didn't think the entire industry of the rental industry could do the kind of revenue that our company alone is doing now. And so we've been able to grow through all of this. I look out into the future and I say I'm very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for us relative to our current position, the things that we have to offer businesses across so many different segments that they really, really need right now. I think we're in a very good position. And we -- obviously, all of us need to resolve this pandemic. And I read some great news this morning that one of the reports I saw, I think it was in the Wall Street Journal, said Pfizer thinks that they might have approval sometime in October for a rollout of a vaccine in January. And whether it's January or February or whenever it is, if you think about it, this is July, end of July. And so we're closing in on this race for a vaccine. And hopefully, when that happens, we'll get back to a new normal where all the businesses can open back up. And I think when that happens, we can really maximize our opportunities."

Certainly, those folks, those customers in the hospitality business, the travel industry, let's say, have been -- they're facing some serious headwinds.

But we're working with them at very high levels. And in the case of a few, specifically, we work on teams to help them with their cleaning protocols to help them establish how to provide a safe environment for their guests. And it really all gets back to confidence that the guests have to feel confident that they can travel and be safe. And we are an important portion of that. Now certainly, they're not buying certain products such as garments from us at the rates that we would like, and frankly, that they would like. But we do have other products and services that they need to help restore confidence. And that is an important investment that they have to make prior to even their revenues coming back at large -- to a large degree. So they see that much value in it that they're investing in it in the near term and hoping that the guest traffic comes back. And as you know, that is really a subject that depends upon where they are geographically, what type of properties, et cetera.

As you know, this continues to be a challenging time for all of us, and we can't thank enough our employees, who we call partners, for doing all that they can to keep our customers' places of business clean, safe and ready for the workday.
On May 13, we provided an update on how Cintas' business has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and how we were managing the business. COVID-19 continues to be a significant disruption to our economy and to business. Our priorities are unchanged. They include keeping our employees healthy and safe and remaining committed to serving our customers in any way possible. I believe we're succeeding at both.
Our employee partners have been consistent and diligent in their care of our customers, providing essential products and services to health care facilities, pharmaceutical companies, grocery store chains, food processing plants and many others. We've provided health care customers with clean scrubs and microfiber towels and mats.  We've provided tens of thousands of customers with disinfectant and sanitizer spray services. And we've provided tremendous amounts of personal protective equipment, including face masks, face shields and other items to our customers to keep their employees safe.
Our supply chain has worked feverishly to satisfy this demand. The demand for items like hand sanitizers and N95 respirators has increased tenfold in this pandemic. Our existing suppliers around the world have been key to us meeting this demand, and we thank them for their support. In addition, our scale enabled us to establish additional relationships with dozens of vendors to secure these scarce products. We continue to work to aid existing customers with the products and services that they desperately need, and our ability to access these products that others can't has enabled us to win new customers. We continue to communicate with our customers who remain idled who are -- and are considered on hold, and our focus is on being there to help them when they reopen.
Before turning the call back to Mike, I want to conclude by stating that I'm thankful for the tremendous dedication of our employee partners. I'm proud of their ability to adapt and persevere in the midst of unprecedented adversity. In addition, I'm as excited as ever about our principal objective of exceeding our customers' expectations to maximize the long-term value of Cintas for our shareholders and working partners. Our value proposition of getting businesses Ready for the Workday by providing essential, unparalleled image, safety, cleanliness and compliance arguably has never resonated more than it does today. This pandemic will not soon be forgotten, and its impact on society is likely transformative.
We believe a new trend of greater focus on health, readiness and outsourcing of noncore activities is underway. More health care scrubs are being professionally laundered and managed, so fewer are worn in public. Businesses, including universities and retail establishments, are requiring huge quantities of sanitizer and related services. Most businesses are providing larger budgets to align with proper cleaning protocols and supply chains of these key items are moving to the U.S. to reduce dependence on other nations. We believe Cintas is well positioned to benefit from this new normal.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Mike."

Our fiscal '20 fourth quarter revenue was $1.62 billion, a decrease of 9.7% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations were $1.38, a decrease of 34.8% compared to last year's fourth",902,"Thanks, Scott. Our fiscal '20 fourth quarter revenue was $1.62 billion, a decrease of 9.7% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations were $1.38, a decrease of 34.8% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Free cash flow for this year's fourth quarter was the highest it had been all year at $316 million.
Organic revenue adjusted for acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and differences in the number of workdays, declined 8.4% for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. Organic revenue for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment declined 9.6%. Organic revenue for First Aid and Safety Services operating segment increased 21.9%.
Gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 of $708 million decreased 14.1%. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 43.7% for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 compared to 45.9% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '19. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 30.9% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 and 28.3% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '19. Operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 of $207 million decreased 34%. Operating margin was 12.8% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 compared to 17.5% in fiscal '19.
Our fiscal fourth quarter contained one less workday than the prior year fourth quarter. One less workday in a quarter has an impact of approximately 50 basis points on operating margin due to many large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation expense and amortization expense being determined on a monthly basis instead of a workday basis.
Fourth quarter of fiscal '20 operating income was affected by many items caused by COVID-19, including additional reserves on accounts receivable and inventory, severance and asset impairment expenses and lower incentive compensation expense. Excluding these items, the operating margin was 15.5%. All of these items were recorded in selling and administrative expense. The additional inventory reserves account for slow-moving inventory, mostly in our Uniform Direct Sales business, where customers in some of the most severely-impacted industries such as airlines and hotels exist.
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 was 20.4% compared to 21.7% last year. The tax rate can move from period-to-period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. Net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 was $145 million, and reported earnings per diluted share were $1.35.
At the onset of the pandemic, we drew on our credit facility in the amount of $200 million. This was for defensive purposes. We have a great cash flow business. And as the quarter progressed, cash generation exceeded our expectations. Cash generated was used not only to repay the $200 million borrowed against the revolver but also to pay off a $200 million term loan. We ended the quarter carrying no variable debt. Our leverage calculation for our credit facility definition was 1.6x debt to EBITDA. Our balance sheet is strong. We have an untapped credit facility of $1 billion and no material debt maturities in the next 12 months.
Free cash flow for the year exceeded $1 billion and increased 34.1% over the prior fiscal year. We remain steadfast in our commitment to effectively deploying cash to increase shareholder value. We purchased $393 million of Cintas stock in fiscal '20 under our buyback authorizations, including $200 million in early March before the COVID-19 pandemic. The amount remaining under our buyback authorization is $1.1 billion.
Looking ahead to fiscal '21, please note that there will be one more workday than in fiscal '20.  One more workday will benefit fiscal '21 total revenue growth by 40 basis points. One more workday also benefits operating margin and EPS. Fiscal '21 operating margin will be about 12.5 basis points better in comparison to fiscal '20 due to one more day of revenue. By quarter, in comparison to fiscal '20, the fiscal '21 first quarter will contain one more workday. The second quarter will contain the same number of workdays. The third quarter will contain one less work day, and the fourth quarter will contain one more workday. Please keep the quarterly day differences in mind when modeling our fiscal '21 results.
Before turning the call over to Todd Schneider to discuss the performance of each of our businesses, I want to comment on fiscal '21 financial guidance. Due to the recent increases in the number of people contracting COVID-19 and the actions governments are taking again in response, uncertainty remains about the pace of the economic recovery. Therefore, we are not providing annual guidance at this time. However, since we are more than halfway through our quarter, we are willing to provide our first quarter financial expectations, and they are as follows: revenue in the range of $1.675 billion to $1.7 billion; Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment organic revenue decline of 8% to 9%; First Aid and Safety Services segment organic revenue increase approaching 10%; earnings per diluted share of $2 to $2.20; and that implies a total operating margin in the range of 16.5% to 18% at the revenue midpoint.
As Scott was quoted in today's earnings release, despite the uncertainty, we are confident in our ability to manage the short-term and maintain focus on our long-term objectives. Todd will now make some comments about the performance of each of our businesses. Todd?"
260725,676099589,2044396,"Cintas Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2020",2020-07-23,"Earnings Calls","Cintas Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mike.

As Scott mentioned, our focus has been on the safety of our partners and fulfilling the needs of our customers. At the onset of the pandemic, our leadership team attacked the crisis like a major acquisition or investment. Leaders from all areas of the company met daily to gather information, strategize and execute. Daunting challenges were overcome, and many were viewed as opportunities, facilitated by our strong corporate culture, which is rooted in positivity, competitive urgency and concern for employees, customers and other key stakeholders. The results have included a safe and healthy workforce and a rise in Net Promoter Scores from our customers.
Our approach was to be highly flexible and take a long-term view of our relationship with our customers. Fortunately, we were deemed an essential service in all markets we operate in. However, many of our customers were closed. And even for those who were open, the impact on the financials of their business was substantial. For those customers who are open or ready to reopen, we were able to provide products and services that were critical to providing confidence to their employees and customers that they were in a safe environment. Products like soap, hand sanitizer, masks and disinfectant spray services.
I'll now turn to the fourth quarter financial performance of our businesses. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, health care scrubs, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies, hand sanitizers and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.27 billion, a decrease of 11%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate changes and the difference in the number of workdays, organic revenue declined 9.6%.
Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 43.6% for the fourth quarter, compared to 46.0% in last year's fourth quarter. We had one less workday in our fourth quarter, which had a negative impact of about 40 basis points in the current quarter. Lower production and service expenses as a percent of revenue compared to last year's fourth quarter were more than offset by amortization expense on uniforms, dust mats, towels and other items rented to customers. Amortization expense was 300 basis points higher this fourth quarter compared to last. This noncash expense is a significant headwind in the short term but will improve in ensuing quarters because purchases of new items were reduced and more existing items will become fully amortized.
As Mike stated, selling and administrative expenses were negatively affected by many items caused by the COVID-19 coronavirus. Excluding the impact of the applicable aforementioned items, Uniform Rental and Facility Services' operating margin was 16.1% compared to 18.5% in the prior year period, a decremental margin of 37%.
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, personal protective equipment and training. This segment's revenue for the fourth quarter was $196.3 million. Organic revenue for the segment increased 21.9%. Revenue from servicing the first aid cabinets decreased due to the business closures from staying-in-place orders. However, our business of providing personal protective equipment surged, overcoming the revenue declines of cabinet servicing. Sales, service, supply chain, finance and others work quickly to provide current customers with masks, respirators, sanitizer and other critical items needed. In addition, the division secured new business through our ability to source scarce resources quickly. The result was a 40.8% organic revenue growth rate in May. Businesses are echoing our mantra of, ""There is nothing more important than the health and safety of our employees and customers.""
The first aid segment gross margin was 46.1% in the fourth quarter compared to 47.7% in last year's fourth quarter. Lower production and service expenses as a percent of revenue compared to last year's fourth quarter were more than offset by cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold was 840 basis points higher this fourth quarter compared to last and is attributable to the increased proportion of revenue from personal protective equipment. Excluding the impact of the applicable previously mentioned items triggered by the COVID-19 coronavirus, the First Aid and Safety Services operating margin was 18.2% compared to 15.4% in the prior year period, an incremental margin of 32%.
Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sales businesses are reported in the All Other category. Fire Protection Services include the performance of testing, inspection and maintenance of fire protection equipment, including extinguishers, alarms, sprinklers and emergency lights. Uniform Direct Sales business includes the provision of custom-tailored apparel. All Other revenue was $152 million, a decrease of 24.5%. Organic revenue declined 24.5%.
The fire business organic revenue declined 12.4% due to the inability to access many businesses because of closures from stay-at-home orders. The Uniform Direct Sales business organic revenue declined 39.5%. Revenue from our airline, cruise line, hospitality and gaming customers largely falls within this segment. These industries have been amongst the hardest hit by the pandemic.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

We have, for the last few years, had health care as a vertical that we've spent a lot of time and effort trying to cultivate. I think that you've all probably seen news reports of health care workers after work, going to grocery stores or some other place and being harassed by other customers because the customers were afraid that their clothing was contaminated. And hospitals realize that, health care workers realize that, traditionally, particularly in the nursing end of health care, the nurses have bought their own scrubs and taking them home and wash them themselves. There has been a conversion to professional laundering of those scrubs so that health care workers don't take them home, don't wear them out of the hospital and so forth. And that would be something that we could handle for them.
We have seen customers who have used our services relative to scrub rental in portions of the hospital expand that into other areas of the hospital. And I think that, that is the beginning of a movement we will see more and more of as I look to the future."

There is a -- there is -- we announced that we're shutting down an operation in Minnesota. And that was one that we had been looking at for some time. It was an acquired operation. It was an older facility with older equipment and inefficient layout. And in that market, we have capacity to move the volume into other facilities that are more efficient, more modern.

I would add that I think as a general statement, one of the reasons we saw the big spike of these sales in May is because there was really a rush by just about every business out there to find personal protective gear, hand sanitize",501,"Hamzah, this is Scott. I would add that I think as a general statement, one of the reasons we saw the big spike of these sales in May is because there was really a rush by just about every business out there to find personal protective gear, hand sanitizer, the things that they need to keep their workplace open and clean. And if they could find somebody who had it, they were buying months' worth of supply because they were afraid that if they came back out into the market again to buy it, it may not be there. So it was almost, to me, like what we would see when we would sell a large direct sale customer. We get a big first upfront order as everybody gets their close, and then it drops off to a more typical run rate after that.
I think that we're going to continue to see the demand for the masks and the hand sanitizers and that sort of thing, but there was a big upfront purchase, a race to make sure that you had enough of it. And it will settle back into an ongoing demand, certainly not at that 40% run rate.
Now relative to the hygiene services, my read on that is that, that's a long-term change in the marketplace. I said in the May call that I think that what this pandemic has done to workplace cleanliness and sanitation is similar to what 9/11 did to public building security. We have customers right now that have come to us and said, ""Look, I have 7,000 branches. I need hand sanitizer stations at all of them. I need somebody to come by on a regular basis and make sure that they're full. That's for my employees and my customers."" We've seen large universities, big 10, Pac-10 universities come to us and have thousands of these hand sanitizer stations put up in their buildings across their campuses.
They want us to do this because not only do we have the sanitizer and the station available but the service to come by on a regular basis and make sure that they have the supply that they need as opposed to worrying about buying a whole bunch of sort of retail pump bottles, trying to put them in places and having those disappear because people grab them and walk away with them.
So I think that our service and our service model in these areas is playing a big role in the marketplace today with our existing customers and our ability to sign new customers. And once they start talking to us about things like hand sanitizers and surface sanitizers, spray services and things like that, we start talking about their restroom services. And if they have people that need uniforms, we start talking about uniforms and entrance mats and the rest of the things that go along with that. So from a hygiene standpoint, I'm confident that this trend is going to continue."

I think the other item is, Scott mentioned that our supply chain organization has done an incredible job in helping position us to service our customers properly, and I completely agree with that. But one of the decisions we made very early on in one of the meetings that Scott has -- we've referenced earlier is that even if we're in a position where we are so unique because we have product that others don't, we're going to take a very long-term approach on how we handle that with the customers. We are going to be extremely fair on pricing and approach it as though it's not a onetime sale. It's going to be a long-term customer.
And so that's how we approached it. Generally speaking, the environment -- the competitive market is, I would say, Andrew, I haven't seen any real change to the landscape besides some one-off items of lack of supply, those types of things where we've garnered an opportunity to -- that we've levered."

We have -- we've eliminated -- we announced that we're going to close one of our operations. That's more of a permanent or at least a longer-term type of thing.
But we do all of the above, and we'll continue to look at the changing nature of this and we can head in either direction. We can manage the cost as we grow into it. Or if it -- I think in May, there were 44 states that had stay-in-place orders, general business restrictions that shut down businesses in those states. If it goes back to that, well, we know what that world looks like. We've been there. We're off mid- to high teens in revenue, and we know what we need to do to rightsize, to go back to that point. I don't think that direction is going to happen, but we're ready to go in either direction to manage the costs the way they need to be managed in order to continue to help the P&L statement and make a good margin."

But our conversations with them is that they're looking at it long term. They're certainly worried about business travel coming back. Leisure travel, they think, will bounce back faster. But we're working with them at very high levels. And in the case of a few, specifically, we work on teams to help them with their cleaning protocols to help them establish how to provide a safe environment for their guests. And it really all gets back to confidence that the guests have to feel confident that they can travel and be safe. And we are an important portion of that.
Now certainly, they're not buying certain products such as garments from us at the rates that we would like, and frankly, that they would like. But we do have other products and services that they need to help restore confidence. And that is an important investment that they have to make prior to even their revenues coming back at large -- to a large degree. So they see that much value in it that they're investing in it in the near term and hoping that the guest traffic comes back. And as you know, that is really a subject that depends upon where they are geographically, what type of properties, et cetera. But we're all in hopes that, as Scott mentioned, that we get to remedies and certainly a vaccine very quickly. That way, the ultimate confidence can be restored."

But at some point, looking out into the future, I think we all agree that we're going to travel somewhere. We're going to stay some place when we get there.
And as Todd says, their ability to show us as customers of theirs that we're safe, that we are on a clean airplane and staying in a clean hotel and eating at a clean restaurant, the sooner all that happens and they can gain our confidence, the more likely it is that we're all going to begin to take advantage of what they have to offer. But those industries are going to be around. They're not going to go away. This may change it in some ways, but they will be out there, and they will recover."

When and how much and things like that depend on what opportunities present themselves, but our priorities really haven't changed.

As you know, this continues to be a challenging time for all of us, and we can't thank enough our employees, who we call partners, for doing all that they can to keep our customers' places of business clean, safe and ready for the workday.
On May 13, we provided an update on how Cintas' business has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and how we were managing the business. COVID-19 continues to be a significant disruption to our economy and to business. Our priorities are unchanged. They include keeping our employees healthy and safe and remaining committed to serving our customers in any way possible. I believe we're succeeding at both.
Our employee partners have been consistent and diligent in their care of our customers, providing essential products and services to health care facilities, pharmaceutical companies, grocery store chains, food processing plants and many others. We've provided health care customers with clean scrubs and microfiber towels and mats. We've provided tens of thousands of customers with disinfectant and sanitizer spray services. And we've provided tremendous amounts of personal protective equipment, including face masks, face shields and other items to our customers to keep their employees safe.
Our supply chain has worked feverishly to satisfy this demand. The demand for items like hand sanitizers and N95 respirators has increased tenfold in this pandemic. Our existing suppliers around the world have been key to us meeting this demand, and we thank them for their support. In addition, our scale enabled us to establish additional relationships with dozens of vendors to secure these scarce products. We continue to work to aid existing customers with the products and services that they desperately need, and our ability to access these products that others can't has enabled us to win new customers. We continue to communicate with our customers who remain idled who are -- and are considered on hold, and our focus is on being there to help them when they reopen.
Before turning the call back to Mike, I want to conclude by stating that I'm thankful for the tremendous dedication of our employee partners. I'm proud of their ability to adapt and persevere in the midst of unprecedented adversity. In addition, I'm as excited as ever about our principal objective of exceeding our customers' expectations to maximize the long-term value of Cintas for our shareholders and working partners. Our value proposition of getting businesses Ready for the Workday by providing essential, unparalleled image, safety, cleanliness and compliance arguably has never resonated more than it does today. This pandemic will not soon be forgotten, and its impact on society is likely transformative.
We believe a new trend of greater focus on health, readiness and outsourcing of noncore activities is underway. More health care scrubs are being professionally laundered and managed, so fewer are worn in public. Businesses, including universities and retail establishments, are requiring huge quantities of sanitizer and related services. Most businesses are providing larger budgets to align with proper cleaning protocols and supply chains of these key items are moving to the U.S. to reduce dependence on other nations. We believe Cintas is well positioned to benefit from this new normal.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Mike."

Our fiscal '20 fourth quarter revenue was $1.62 billion, a decrease of 9.7% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations were $1.38, a decrease of 34.8% compared to last year's fourth",902,"Thanks, Scott. Our fiscal '20 fourth quarter revenue was $1.62 billion, a decrease of 9.7% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations were $1.38, a decrease of 34.8% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Free cash flow for this year's fourth quarter was the highest it had been all year at $316 million.
Organic revenue adjusted for acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and differences in the number of workdays, declined 8.4% for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. Organic revenue for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment declined 9.6%. Organic revenue for First Aid and Safety Services operating segment increased 21.9%.
Gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 of $708 million decreased 14.1%. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 43.7% for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 compared to 45.9% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '19. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 30.9% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 and 28.3% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '19. Operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 of $207 million decreased 34%. Operating margin was 12.8% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 compared to 17.5% in fiscal '19.
Our fiscal fourth quarter contained one less workday than the prior year fourth quarter. One less workday in a quarter has an impact of approximately 50 basis points on operating margin due to many large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation expense and amortization expense being determined on a monthly basis instead of a workday basis.
Fourth quarter of fiscal '20 operating income was affected by many items caused by COVID-19, including additional reserves on accounts receivable and inventory, severance and asset impairment expenses and lower incentive compensation expense. Excluding these items, the operating margin was 15.5%. All of these items were recorded in selling and administrative expense. The additional inventory reserves account for slow-moving inventory, mostly in our Uniform Direct Sales business, where customers in some of the most severely-impacted industries such as airlines and hotels exist.
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 was 20.4% compared to 21.7% last year. The tax rate can move from period-to-period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. Net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 was $145 million, and reported earnings per diluted share were $1.35.
At the onset of the pandemic, we drew on our credit facility in the amount of $200 million. This was for defensive purposes. We have a great cash flow business. And as the quarter progressed, cash generation exceeded our expectations. Cash generated was used not only to repay the $200 million borrowed against the revolver but also to pay off a $200 million term loan. We ended the quarter carrying no variable debt. Our leverage calculation for our credit facility definition was 1.6x debt to EBITDA. Our balance sheet is strong. We have an untapped credit facility of $1 billion and no material debt maturities in the next 12 months.
Free cash flow for the year exceeded $1 billion and increased 34.1% over the prior fiscal year. We remain steadfast in our commitment to effectively deploying cash to increase shareholder value. We purchased $393 million of Cintas stock in fiscal '20 under our buyback authorizations, including $200 million in early March before the COVID-19 pandemic. The amount remaining under our buyback authorization is $1.1 billion.
Looking ahead to fiscal '21, please note that there will be one more workday than in fiscal '20. One more workday will benefit fiscal '21 total revenue growth by 40 basis points. One more workday also benefits operating margin and EPS. Fiscal '21 operating margin will be about 12.5 basis points better in comparison to fiscal '20 due to one more day of revenue. By quarter, in comparison to fiscal '20, the fiscal '21 first quarter will contain one more workday. The second quarter will contain the same number of workdays. The third quarter will contain one less work day, and the fourth quarter will contain one more workday. Please keep the quarterly day differences in mind when modeling our fiscal '21 results.
Before turning the call over to Todd Schneider to discuss the performance of each of our businesses, I want to comment on fiscal '21 financial guidance. Due to the recent increases in the number of people contracting COVID-19 and the actions governments are taking again in response, uncertainty remains about the pace of the economic recovery. Therefore, we are not providing annual guidance at this time. However, since we are more than halfway through our quarter, we are willing to provide our first quarter financial expectations, and they are as follows: revenue in the range of $1.675 billion to $1.7 billion; Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment organic revenue decline of 8% to 9%; First Aid and Safety Services segment organic revenue increase approaching 10%; earnings per diluted share of $2 to $2.20; and that implies a total operating margin in the range of 16.5% to 18% at the revenue midpoint.
As Scott was quoted in today's earnings release, despite the uncertainty, we are confident in our ability to manage the short-term and maintain focus on our long-term objectives. Todd will now make some comments about the performance of each of our businesses. Todd?"

As Scott mentioned, our focus has been on the safety of our partners and fulfilling the needs of our customers. At the onset of the pandemic, our leadership team attacked the crisis like a major acquisition or investment. Leaders from all areas of the company met daily to gather information, strategize and execute. Daunting challenges were overcome, and many were viewed as opportunities, facilitated by our strong corporate culture, which is rooted in positivity, competitive urgency and concern for employees, customers and other key stakeholders. The results have included a safe and healthy workforce and a rise in Net Promoter Scores from our customers.
Our approach was to be highly flexible and take a long-term view of our relationship with our customers. Fortunately, we were deemed an essential service in all markets we operate in. However, many of our customers were closed. And even for those who were open, the impact on the financials of their business was substantial. For those customers who are open or ready to reopen, we were able to provide products and services that were critical to providing confidence to their employees and customers that they were in a safe environment. Products like soap, hand sanitizer, masks and disinfectant spray services.
I'll now turn to the fourth quarter financial performance of our businesses. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, health care scrubs, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies, hand sanitizers and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.27 billion, a decrease of 11%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate changes and the difference in the number of workdays, organic revenue declined 9.6%.
Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 43.6% for the fourth quarter, compared to 46.0% in last year's fourth quarter. We had one less workday in our fourth quarter, which had a negative impact of about 40 basis points in the current quarter. Lower production and service expenses as a percent of revenue compared to last year's fourth quarter were more than offset by amortization expense on uniforms, dust mats, towels and other items rented to customers. Amortization expense was 300 basis points higher this fourth quarter compared to last. This noncash expense is a significant headwind in the short term but will improve in ensuing quarters because purchases of new items were reduced and more existing items will become fully amortized.
As Mike stated, selling and administrative expenses were negatively affected by many items caused by the COVID-19 coronavirus. Excluding the impact of the applicable aforementioned items, Uniform Rental and Facility Services' operating margin was 16.1% compared to 18.5% in the prior year period, a decremental margin of 37%.
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, personal protective equipment and training. This segment's revenue for the fourth quarter was $196.3 million. Organic revenue for the segment increased 21.9%. Revenue from servicing the first aid cabinets decreased due to the business closures from staying-in-place orders. However, our business of providing personal protective equipment surged, overcoming the revenue declines of cabinet servicing. Sales, service, supply chain, finance and others work quickly to provide current customers with masks, respirators, sanitizer and other critical items needed. In addition, the division secured new business through our ability to source scarce resources quickly. The result was a 40.8% organic revenue growth rate in May. Businesses are echoing our mantra of, ""There is nothing more important than the health and safety of our employees and customers.""
The first aid segment gross margin was 46.1% in the fourth quarter compared to 47.7% in last year's fourth quarter. Lower production and service expenses as a percent of revenue compared to last year's fourth quarter were more than offset by cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold was 840 basis points higher this fourth quarter compared to last and is attributable to the increased proportion of revenue from personal protective equipment. Excluding the impact of the applicable previously mentioned items triggered by the COVID-19 coronavirus, the First Aid and Safety Services operating margin was 18.2% compared to 15.4% in the prior year period, an incremental margin of 32%.
Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sales businesses are reported in the All Other category. Fire Protection Services include the performance of testing, inspection and maintenance of fire protection equipment, including extinguishers, alarms, sprinklers and emergency lights. Uniform Direct Sales business includes the provision of custom-tailored apparel. All Other revenue was $152 million, a decrease of 24.5%. Organic revenue declined 24.5%.
The fire business organic revenue declined 12.4% due to the inability to access many businesses because of closures from stay-at-home orders. The Uniform Direct Sales business organic revenue declined 39.5%. Revenue from our airline, cruise line, hospitality and gaming customers largely falls within this segment. These industries have been amongst the hardest hit by the pandemic.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

We have, for the last few years, had health care as a vertical that we've spent a lot of time and effort trying to cultivate. I think that you've all probably seen news reports of health care workers after work, going to grocery stores or some other place and being harassed by other customers because the customers were afraid that their clothing was contaminated. And hospitals realize that, health care workers realize that, traditionally, particularly in the nursing end of health care, the nurses have bought their own scrubs and taking them home and wash them themselves. There has been a conversion to professional laundering of those scrubs so that health care workers don't take them home, don't wear them out of the hospital and so forth. And that would be something that we could handle for them.
We have seen customers who have used our services relative to scrub rental in portions of the hospital expand that into other areas of the hospital. And I think that, that is the beginning of a movement we will see more and more of as I look to the future."

And how do we take temperature? Where do we get the thermometer? All that sort of thing. And then from there, moving into the customers.

There is a -- there is -- we announced that we're shutting down an operation in Minnesota. And that was one that we had been looking at for some time. It was an acquired operation. It was an older facility with older equipment and inefficient layout. And in that market, we have capacity to move the volume into other facilities that are more efficient, more modern.

I would add that I think as a general statement, one of the reasons we saw the big spike of these sales in May is because there was really a rush by just about every business out there to find personal protective gear, hand sanitize",501,"Hamzah, this is Scott. I would add that I think as a general statement, one of the reasons we saw the big spike of these sales in May is because there was really a rush by just about every business out there to find personal protective gear, hand sanitizer, the things that they need to keep their workplace open and clean. And if they could find somebody who had it, they were buying months' worth of supply because they were afraid that if they came back out into the market again to buy it, it may not be there. So it was almost, to me, like what we would see when we would sell a large direct sale customer. We get a big first upfront order as everybody gets their close, and then it drops off to a more typical run rate after that.
I think that we're going to continue to see the demand for the masks and the hand sanitizers and that sort of thing, but there was a big upfront purchase, a race to make sure that you had enough of it. And it will settle back into an ongoing demand, certainly not at that 40% run rate.
Now relative to the hygiene services, my read on that is that, that's a long-term change in the marketplace. I said in the May call that I think that what this pandemic has done to workplace cleanliness and sanitation is similar to what 9/11 did to public building security. We have customers right now that have come to us and said, ""Look, I have 7,000 branches. I need hand sanitizer stations at all of them. I need somebody to come by on a regular basis and make sure that they're full. That's for my employees and my customers."" We've seen large universities, big 10, Pac-10 universities come to us and have thousands of these hand sanitizer stations put up in their buildings across their campuses.
They want us to do this because not only do we have the sanitizer and the station available but the service to come by on a regular basis and make sure that they have the supply that they need as opposed to worrying about buying a whole bunch of sort of retail pump bottles, trying to put them in places and having those disappear because people grab them and walk away with them.
So I think that our service and our service model in these areas is playing a big role in the marketplace today with our existing customers and our ability to sign new customers. And once they start talking to us about things like hand sanitizers and surface sanitizers, spray services and things like that, we start talking about their restroom services. And if they have people that need uniforms, we start talking about uniforms and entrance mats and the rest of the things that go along with that. So from a hygiene standpoint, I'm confident that this trend is going to continue."

Or if it -- I think in May, there were 44 states that had stay-in-place orders, general business restrictions that shut down businesses in those states. If it goes back to that, well, we know what that world looks like. We've been there. We're off mid- to high teens in revenue, and we know what we need to do to rightsize, to go back to that point. I don't think that direction is going to happen, but we're ready to go in either direction to manage the costs the way they need to be managed in order to continue to help the P&L statement and make a good margin."

Now certainly, they're not buying certain products such as garments from us at the rates that we would like, and frankly, that they would like.

As you know, this continues to be a challenging time for all of us, and we can't thank enough our employees, who we call partners, for doing all that they can to keep our customers' places of business clean, safe and ready for the workday.
On May 13, we provided an update on how Cintas' business has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and how we were managing the business. COVID-19 continues to be a significant disruption to our economy and to business. Our priorities are unchanged. They include keeping our employees healthy and safe and remaining committed to serving our customers in any way possible. I believe we're succeeding at both.
Our employee partners have been consistent and diligent in their care of our customers, providing essential products and services to health care facilities, pharmaceutical companies, grocery store chains, food processing plants and many others. We've provided health care customers with clean scrubs and microfiber towels and mats. We've provided tens of thousands of customers with disinfectant and sanitizer spray services. And we've provided tremendous amounts of personal protective equipment, including face masks, face shields and other items to our customers to keep their employees safe.
Our supply chain has worked feverishly to satisfy this demand. The demand for items like hand sanitizers and N95 respirators has increased tenfold in this pandemic. Our existing suppliers around the world have been key to us meeting this demand, and we thank them for their support. In addition, our scale enabled us to establish additional relationships with dozens of vendors to secure these scarce products. We continue to work to aid existing customers with the products and services that they desperately need, and our ability to access these products that others can't has enabled us to win new customers. We continue to communicate with our customers who remain idled who are -- and are considered on hold, and our focus is on being there to help them when they reopen.
Before turning the call back to Mike, I want to conclude by stating that I'm thankful for the tremendous dedication of our employee partners. I'm proud of their ability to adapt and persevere in the midst of unprecedented adversity. In addition, I'm as excited as ever about our principal objective of exceeding our customers' expectations to maximize the long-term value of Cintas for our shareholders and working partners. Our value proposition of getting businesses Ready for the Workday by providing essential, unparalleled image, safety, cleanliness and compliance arguably has never resonated more than it does today. This pandemic will not soon be forgotten, and its impact on society is likely transformative.
We believe a new trend of greater focus on health, readiness and outsourcing of noncore activities is underway. More health care scrubs are being professionally laundered and managed, so fewer are worn in public. Businesses, including universities and retail establishments, are requiring huge quantities of sanitizer and related services. Most businesses are providing larger budgets to align with proper cleaning protocols and supply chains of these key items are moving to the U.S. to reduce dependence on other nations. We believe Cintas is well positioned to benefit from this new normal.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Mike."
260725,676099589,2085255,"Cintas Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2020",2020-07-23,"Earnings Calls","Cintas Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Scott. Our fiscal '20 fourth quarter revenue was $1.62 billion, a decrease of 9.7% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations were $1.38, a decrease of 34.8% compared to last year's fourth",902,"Thanks, Scott. Our fiscal '20 fourth quarter revenue was $1.62 billion, a decrease of 9.7% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations were $1.38, a decrease of 34.8% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Free cash flow for this year's fourth quarter was the highest it had been all year at $316 million.
Organic revenue adjusted for acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and differences in the number of workdays, declined 8.4% for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. Organic revenue for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment declined 9.6%. Organic revenue for First Aid and Safety Services operating segment increased 21.9%.
Gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 of $708 million decreased 14.1%. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 43.7% for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 compared to 45.9% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '19. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 30.9% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 and 28.3% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '19. Operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 of $207 million decreased 34%. Operating margin was 12.8% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 compared to 17.5% in fiscal '19.
Our fiscal fourth quarter contained one less workday than the prior year fourth quarter. One less workday in a quarter has an impact of approximately 50 basis points on operating margin due to many large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation expense and amortization expense being determined on a monthly basis instead of a workday basis.
Fourth quarter of fiscal '20 operating income was affected by many items caused by COVID-19, including additional reserves on accounts receivable and inventory, severance and asset impairment expenses and lower incentive compensation expense. Excluding these items, the operating margin was 15.5%. All of these items were recorded in selling and administrative expense. The additional inventory reserves account for slow-moving inventory, mostly in our Uniform Direct Sales business, where customers in some of the most severely-impacted industries such as airlines and hotels exist.
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 was 20.4% compared to 21.7% last year. The tax rate can move from period-to-period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. Net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 was $145 million, and reported earnings per diluted share were $1.35.
At the onset of the pandemic, we drew on our credit facility in the amount of $200 million. This was for defensive purposes. We have a great cash flow business. And as the quarter progressed, cash generation exceeded our expectations. Cash generated was used not only to repay the $200 million borrowed against the revolver but also to pay off a $200 million term loan. We ended the quarter carrying no variable debt. Our leverage calculation for our credit facility definition was 1.6x debt to EBITDA. Our balance sheet is strong. We have an untapped credit facility of $1 billion and no material debt maturities in the next 12 months.
Free cash flow for the year exceeded $1 billion and increased 34.1% over the prior fiscal year. We remain steadfast in our commitment to effectively deploying cash to increase shareholder value. We purchased $393 million of Cintas stock in fiscal '20 under our buyback authorizations, including $200 million in early March before the COVID-19 pandemic. The amount remaining under our buyback authorization is $1.1 billion.
Looking ahead to fiscal '21, please note that there will be one more workday than in fiscal '20. One more workday will benefit fiscal '21 total revenue growth by 40 basis points. One more workday also benefits operating margin and EPS. Fiscal '21 operating margin will be about 12.5 basis points better in comparison to fiscal '20 due to one more day of revenue. By quarter, in comparison to fiscal '20, the fiscal '21 first quarter will contain one more workday. The second quarter will contain the same number of workdays. The third quarter will contain one less work day, and the fourth quarter will contain one more workday. Please keep the quarterly day differences in mind when modeling our fiscal '21 results.
Before turning the call over to Todd Schneider to discuss the performance of each of our businesses, I want to comment on fiscal '21 financial guidance. Due to the recent increases in the number of people contracting COVID-19 and the actions governments are taking again in response, uncertainty remains about the pace of the economic recovery. Therefore, we are not providing annual guidance at this time. However, since we are more than halfway through our quarter, we are willing to provide our first quarter financial expectations, and they are as follows: revenue in the range of $1.675 billion to $1.7 billion; Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment organic revenue decline of 8% to 9%; First Aid and Safety Services segment organic revenue increase approaching 10%; earnings per diluted share of $2 to $2.20; and that implies a total operating margin in the range of 16.5% to 18% at the revenue midpoint.
As Scott was quoted in today's earnings release, despite the uncertainty, we are confident in our ability to manage the short-term and maintain focus on our long-term objectives. Todd will now make some comments about the performance of each of our businesses. Todd?"
260725,676099589,2085255,"Cintas Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2020",2020-07-23,"Earnings Calls","Cintas Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mike.

As Scott mentioned, our focus has been on the safety of our partners and fulfilling the needs of our customers. At the onset of the pandemic, our leadership team attacked the crisis like a major acquisition or investment. Leaders from all areas of the company met daily to gather information, strategize and execute. Daunting challenges were overcome, and many were viewed as opportunities, facilitated by our strong corporate culture, which is rooted in positivity, competitive urgency and concern for employees, customers and other key stakeholders. The results have included a safe and healthy workforce and a rise in Net Promoter Scores from our customers.
Our approach was to be highly flexible and take a long-term view of our relationship with our customers. Fortunately, we were deemed an essential service in all markets we operate in. However, many of our customers were closed. And even for those who were open, the impact on the financials of their business was substantial. For those customers who are open or ready to reopen, we were able to provide products and services that were critical to providing confidence to their employees and customers that they were in a safe environment. Products like soap, hand sanitizer, masks and disinfectant spray services.
I'll now turn to the fourth quarter financial performance of our businesses. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, health care scrubs, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies, hand sanitizers and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.27 billion, a decrease of 11%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate changes and the difference in the number of workdays, organic revenue declined 9.6%.
Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 43.6% for the fourth quarter, compared to 46.0% in last year's fourth quarter. We had one less workday in our fourth quarter, which had a negative impact of about 40 basis points in the current quarter. Lower production and service expenses as a percent of revenue compared to last year's fourth quarter were more than offset by amortization expense on uniforms, dust mats, towels and other items rented to customers. Amortization expense was 300 basis points higher this fourth quarter compared to last. This noncash expense is a significant headwind in the short term but will improve in ensuing quarters because purchases of new items were reduced and more existing items will become fully amortized.
As Mike stated, selling and administrative expenses were negatively affected by many items caused by the COVID-19 coronavirus. Excluding the impact of the applicable aforementioned items, Uniform Rental and Facility Services' operating margin was 16.1% compared to 18.5% in the prior year period, a decremental margin of 37%.
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, personal protective equipment and training. This segment's revenue for the fourth quarter was $196.3 million. Organic revenue for the segment increased 21.9%. Revenue from servicing the first aid cabinets decreased due to the business closures from staying-in-place orders. However, our business of providing personal protective equipment surged, overcoming the revenue declines of cabinet servicing. Sales, service, supply chain, finance and others work quickly to provide current customers with masks, respirators, sanitizer and other critical items needed. In addition, the division secured new business through our ability to source scarce resources quickly. The result was a 40.8% organic revenue growth rate in May. Businesses are echoing our mantra of, ""There is nothing more important than the health and safety of our employees and customers.""
The first aid segment gross margin was 46.1% in the fourth quarter compared to 47.7% in last year's fourth quarter. Lower production and service expenses as a percent of revenue compared to last year's fourth quarter were more than offset by cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold was 840 basis points higher this fourth quarter compared to last and is attributable to the increased proportion of revenue from personal protective equipment. Excluding the impact of the applicable previously mentioned items triggered by the COVID-19 coronavirus, the First Aid and Safety Services operating margin was 18.2% compared to 15.4% in the prior year period, an incremental margin of 32%.
Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sales businesses are reported in the All Other category. Fire Protection Services include the performance of testing, inspection and maintenance of fire protection equipment, including extinguishers, alarms, sprinklers and emergency lights. Uniform Direct Sales business includes the provision of custom-tailored apparel. All Other revenue was $152 million, a decrease of 24.5%. Organic revenue declined 24.5%.
The fire business organic revenue declined 12.4% due to the inability to access many businesses because of closures from stay-at-home orders. The Uniform Direct Sales business organic revenue declined 39.5%. Revenue from our airline, cruise line, hospitality and gaming customers largely falls within this segment. These industries have been amongst the hardest hit by the pandemic.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

I think that you've all probably seen news reports of health care workers after work, going to grocery stores or some other place and being harassed by other customers because the customers were afraid that their clothing was contaminated. And hospitals realize that, health care workers realize that, traditionally, particularly in the nursing end of health care, the nurses have bought their own scrubs and taking them home and wash them themselves. There has been a conversion to professional laundering of those scrubs so that health care workers don't take them home, don't wear them out of the hospital and so forth. And that would be something that we could handle for them.
We have seen customers who have used our services relative to scrub rental in portions of the hospital expand that into other areas of the hospital. And I think that, that is the beginning of a movement we will see more and more of as I look to the future."

There is a -- there is -- we announced that we're shutting down an operation in Minnesota. And that was one that we had been looking at for some time. It was an acquired operation. It was an older facility with older equipment and inefficient layout. And in that market, we have capacity to move the volume into other facilities that are more efficient, more modern. And so we announced that we're going to do that. We consistently review the operations and our capacity on a market-to-market basis, and we'll continue to do that looking forward. Todd, you got anything you want to add?"

I would add that I think as a general statement, one of the reasons we saw the big spike of these sales in May is because there was really a rush by just about every business out there to find personal protective gear, hand sanitizer, the things that they need to keep their workplace open and clean. And if they could find somebody who had it, they were buying months' worth of supply because they were afraid that if they came back out into the market again to buy it, it may not be there. So it was almost, to me, like what we would see when we would sell a large direct sale customer. We get a big first upfront order as everybody gets their close, and then it drops off to a more typical run rate after that.
I think that we're going to continue to see the demand for the masks and the hand sanitizers and that sort of thing, but there was a big upfront purchase, a race to make sure that you had enough of it. And it will settle back into an ongoing demand, certainly not at that 40% run rate.
Now relative to the hygiene services, my read on that is that, that's a long-term change in the marketplace. I said in the May call that I think that what this pandemic has done to workplace cleanliness and sanitation is similar to what 9/11 did to public building security. We have customers right now that have come to us and said, ""Look, I have 7,000 branches. I need hand sanitizer stations at all of them. I need somebody to come by on a regular basis and make sure that they're full. That's for my employees and my customers."" We've seen large universities, big 10, Pac-10 universities come to us and have thousands of these hand sanitizer stations put up in their buildings across their campuses.
They want us to do this because not only do we have the sanitizer and the station available but the service to come by on a regular basis and make sure that they have the supply that they need as opposed to worrying about buying a whole bunch of sort of retail pump bottles, trying to put them in places and having those disappear because people grab them and walk away with them.
So I think that our service and our service model in these areas is playing a big role in the marketplace today with our existing customers and our ability to sign new customers. And once they start talking to us about things like hand sanitizers and surface sanitizers, spray services and things like that, we start talking about their restroom services. And if they have people that need uniforms, we start talking about uniforms and entrance mats and the rest of the things that go along with that. So from a hygiene standpoint, I'm confident that this trend is going to continue."

And so the conversation is around what are your plans? When do you hope to reopen? Help us understand what you think will happen in your business and how we can help you. Have you furloughed or let go any of your people? We have large customers who have turned to us to help them develop cleaning protocol for their business. We can share some of that with you. Prior to the pandemic, you were just using these services. We have some other services that might help you to make sure that your workplace is clean and sanitized with various products and services that we can provide. Would you like us to help you get set up with those type of things?
But really, it's to help them get to a point where they reopen. We look at it and say the lifetime value of these customers is really important to us. And we're not here today to talk about the contract and that sort of thing. We're here today to help you get reopened. As your business starts to come back, we can get into all the rest of the details of that sort of thing. And I would tell you, Tim, that we use the Net Promoter Score system to evaluate our customer satisfaction, if you will, with our services. And we have seen a dramatic increase in Net Promoter Scores as we have moved through this pandemic because of the way that we've helped them, because of the advice and the tools and the services that we can have. I would tell you that we're getting letters from presidents and CEOs of pretty big companies because of what we've done to help them, but it has improved our relationship with -- as a general statement, across the board with our customers as we help them through this. And I'm proud of the way that our frontline people have been handling this, and we look forward to helping more and more of these customers come back online."

But generally speaking, most are being -- were impacted, even those who remained open. And we work with them. We work with the customers, and we said, they said, ""Hey, we can only afford so much."" We said, ""Well, let's take the -- let's adjust your spend with us down in this area, but we can help you with these areas that are so critical to restoring confidence in your employees and your customers that they're operating in a safe environment.""

And so it's tough for me to say that this is better than others. But there are people that, when I first started going to the trade association meetings, didn't think the entire industry of the rental industry could do the kind of revenue that our company alone is doing now. And so we've been able to grow through all of this.
I look out into the future and I say I'm very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for us relative to our current position, the things that we have to offer businesses across so many different segments that they really, really need right now. I think we're in a very good position. And we -- obviously, all of us need to resolve this pandemic. And I read some great news this morning that one of the reports I saw, I think it was in the Wall Street Journal, said Pfizer thinks that they might have approval sometime in October for a rollout of a vaccine in January. And whether it's January or February or whenever it is, if you think about it, this is July, end of July. And so we're closing in on this race for a vaccine.

Certainly, those folks, those customers in the hospitality business, the travel industry, let's say, have been -- they're facing some serious headwinds. But our conversations with them is that they're looking at it long term. They're certainly worried about business travel coming back. Leisure travel, they think, will bounce back faster. But we're working with them at very high levels. And in the case of a few, specifically, we work on teams to help them with their cleaning protocols to help them establish how to provide a safe environment for their guests. And it really all gets back to confidence that the guests have to feel confident that they can travel and be safe. And we are an important portion of that.
Now certainly, they're not buying certain products such as garments from us at the rates that we would like, and frankly, that they would like. But we do have other products and services that they need to help restore confidence. And that is an important investment that they have to make prior to even their revenues coming back at large -- to a large degree. So they see that much value in it that they're investing in it in the near term and hoping that the guest traffic comes back.

Our fleet partners remain diligent in their care of our customers, providing essential products and services. And they have remained diligent in their care of each other, and we can't thank them enough for their truly impressive achievements. 
Before we get into the financial results, I'd like to provide you with some examples of our interactions with our customers in the first quarter of our fiscal year, so you have a better understanding of our business. The hospital system in Michigan provided isolation gowns to their staff and laundered them in the hospital. These garments are fluid resistant protective clothing worn by doctors and nurses. The hospital had difficulty staffing the laundry and suffered quality issues. Hospital system, a no programmer, as we called it, decided to outsource the procurement and laundering to Cintas so they could concentrate on patient care. 
Another note programmer, a dental alliance with 55 locations in 3 states, signed with us for scrubs in a rental program for 550 wearers. Due to their satisfaction with the service, they are in discussions with us to add facility services products and first aid supplies. 
In California, 1 university system with many campuses, signed a multiyear agreement for hand sanitizer service. In addition, our first aid business is providing them with $0.5 million of hard-to-find gloves. To another university system in California, our first aid division is providing over 1 million face masks. 
A restaurant chain that has been a customer since 2007 had been struggling in the first few months of the pandemic. In talking with the customer, we listened and were empathetic and adjusted service frequencies and inventories in partnership with them. They were so pleased with the way that we treated them that they renewed our service agreement and had enhanced sanitizer stand service to every one of their restaurants. 
A casino customer in Ohio recently reopened after being dormant due to COVID-19 restrictions. In order to conduct business in the new environment, the casino added rental mask services and additional items to increase cleaning protocols, including dust masks and microfiber mops and towels. 
And a city government in Texas was a no programmer until they came to us for a hand sanitizer program for all of their government buildings. They were so happy with the execution that we gained their trust and provide some of their personal protective equipment needs as well. And we're impressed with our ability to deliver hundreds of thousands of masks within days. 
These examples are just a handful of the many and were offered to highlight the following: our opportunity to convert no programmers, the do-it -yourself-ers remains robust. Scrubs and isolation gowns are indicative of a broad uniform rental opportunity. Our approach of being flexible with customers in the short-term, reaped long-term benefits. Our Net Promoter Scores, which we use to measure customer satisfaction, have never been higher. Earning the trust of the customer enables us to penetrate -- enables further penetration and cross-selling. And our supply chain and service network are competitive advantages, enabling us to increase service to existing customers and add new customers by procuring and providing items in short supply. 
Our value proposition of getting businesses ready for the workday by providing essential, unparalleled image, safety, friendliness and compliance, has never resonated more than it does today. A new trend of greater focus on health, readiness and outsourcing of noncore activities is underway. We are well positioned for this new normal. 
I'll turn the call over to Mike now for commentary on the financial results. Mike?"

Our fiscal 2021 first quarter revenue was $1.75 billion, a decrease of 3.6% from last year's first quarter. Earnings per diluted share or EPS were $2.78, an increase of 19.8% from last year's first quarter. Free cash flow,",696,"Thanks, Scott, and good morning. Our fiscal 2021 first quarter revenue was $1.75 billion, a decrease of 3.6% from last year's first quarter. Earnings per diluted share or EPS were $2.78, an increase of 19.8% from last year's first quarter. Free cash flow, which is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, for this year's first quarter was $281.4 million, an increase of 32.6%. 
Organic revenue, adjusted for acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and differences in the number of workdays declined 5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Organic revenue for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment declined 5.4%. Organic revenue for the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment increased 17.1%. 
Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal '21 of $826.2 million decreased 2.7%. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue, 47.3% for the first quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 46.9% in the first quarter of fiscal '20. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 27.3% in the first quarter and 30% in the first quarter of fiscal '20. Fiscal '21 first quarter results benefited from lower expenses as a percentage of revenue in many areas, including discretionary spending. Operating income for the first quarter of fiscal '21 of $349.7 million increased 14.2%. Operating margin was 20% in the first quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 16.9% in the first quarter of fiscal '20. 
Our fiscal first quarter contained 1 more workday than the prior year first quarter. 1 more workday in a quarter has an impact of approximately 50 basis points on operating margin due to many large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation expense and amortization expense being determined on a monthly basis instead of on a workday basis. 
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '21 was 7.8% compared to 10.1% last year. The tax rate can move from period-to-period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. 
Net income for the first quarter of fiscal '21 was $300 million, an increase of 19.6%. Earnings per diluted share were $2.78, an increase of 19.8% from last year's first quarter. 
In addition to the solid financial performance, we continue to generate strong cash flow. First quarter free cash flow was $281.4 million, an increase of 32.6% compared to last year. Our leverage calculation for our credit facility definition was 1.6x debt to EBITDA. Our balance sheet is strong. We have an untapped credit facility of $1 billion. 
For financial modeling purposes, please note that there will be 1 more workday in our fiscal '21 than in our fiscal '20. 1 more day will benefit fiscal '21 total revenue growth by 40 basis points. 1 more workday also benefits operating margin and EPS. Fiscal '21 operating income margin will be about 12.5 basis points better in comparison to fiscal '20 due to 1 more day of revenue. 
In fiscal '20, each quarter contained 65 workdays. In fiscal '21, workdays by quarter are 66 in Q1; 65 in Q2; 64 in Q3; and 66 in Q4. Please keep these differences in mind when modeling results on a year-over-year and sequential basis. 
Before turning the call over to Todd Schneider to discuss the performance of each of our businesses, I want to comment on fiscal '21 financial guidance.  Due to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, uncertainty remains about the pace of economic recovery. Therefore, we are not providing annual guidance at this time. However, we would like to provide our second quarter financial expectations. 
We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.725 billion to $1.75 billion and EPS to be in the range of $2 to $2.20. Please note the following regarding second quarter financial expectations: our second quarter contains the same number of workdays as last year's second quarter, but 1 less than our first quarter. We expect operating margin as a percent of revenue to be in the range of 17.5% to 19%. And we expect our second quarter effective tax rate to be about 22% compared to 20.1% in last year's second quarter. 
I'll now turn it over to Todd."
260725,687843135,2102847,"Cintas Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Sep 23, 2020",2020-09-23,"Earnings Calls","Cintas Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mike. Before I review the business results, I'd like to build off with Scott's comments. While the environment remains challenging and uncertain, we did experience a continued improvement in results through the quarter. The majority of our exis",674,"Thank you, Mike. Before I review the business results, I'd like to build off with Scott's comments. While the environment remains challenging and uncertain, we did experience a continued improvement in results through the quarter. The majority of our existing customers have reopened and our employee partners work diligently in partnership with these businesses to get them right for the workday. 
Despite reopening, many existing customers are not yet operating at the same level of business before the COVID-19 pandemic started because of the virus' impact on health and the economy. In keeping with the Cintas culture, our employee partners are working with urgency to offset these headwinds. Significant opportunities for new revenues exist because of the need of businesses to instill confidence in their employees, customers, students, patients, et cetera, that they will remain healthy and safe. 
Additionally, businesses are outsourcing paths that are not their core competency, so they can successfully navigate these challenging times. The value we provide businesses has never been more evident. In fact, we've been given a seat at the table in discussions with state and local officials, hospital administrations, COVID-19 procurement task forces and hospitality cleanliness councils. There is greater demand for services and products we already provide such as healthy [indiscernible] 
In other areas, demand is so attractive that we are providing new services and products made possible by our supply chain, distribution network, sales force and cash flow. These include rental health care isolation gowns and sanitizer stand and dispenser service and sanitizing spray service. 
With that, I'll turn now to the first quarter financial performance of our businesses. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, health care scrubs, masks and towels and provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. This segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.39 billion, a decrease of 4.1%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate changes and the difference in the number of workdays, the organic revenue declined 5.4%. 
Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 48.7% for the first quarter compared to 47.2% in last year's first quarter. Higher inventory amortization expense of 80 basis points was more than offset by benefit of lower production and service expense as a percent of revenue, the additional workday and lower energy expenses. 
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products, personal protective equipment and training. This segment's revenue for the first quarter was $204.5 million. The organic growth rate for the segment was 17.1%. The First Aid segment gross margin was 40.2% from the first quarter compared to 49.0% in last year's first quarter. Lower production and service expenses as a percent of revenue compared to last year's first quarter were more than offset by higher cost of goods sold from the increased proportion of revenue from personal protective equipment, such as masks and gloves. 
Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sales businesses are reported in the All Other category. Our fire business historically grows each year at a strong pace. The Uniform Direct Sales business growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion-dollar account. Uniform Direct Sales, however, is a key business for us, and its customers are often significant opportunities to cross-sell and provide products and services from our other business units. 
All Other revenue was $147.7 million, a decrease of 20.0%. Organic revenue declined 22.2%. The fire business organic revenue declined 5.3% due to the inability to access some businesses because of closures. The Uniform Direct Sale business organic revenue declined 47.3%. Revenue from our airline, cruise line, hospitality and gaming customers largely falls within this segment. These industries continue to be among the hardest hit by the pandemic. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

On First Aid and Safety, I think the way that is probably the best way for you all to look at it is that a lot of the initial upfront large sales of PPE through the First Aid business are similar to what happens in the direct sale business when we sell a big new customer. There's a large upfront sale of these goods, and then it will -- that customer's revenue will drop to a maintenance level. And so we are seeing that in the first quarter, we did have a lot of large upfront sales to customers in the First Aid and Safety business that are now moving into that maintenance level. That doesn't mean that there aren't other customers out there that we can find and identify, but I think that there was a big rush of that in our first quarter as pandemic hit. And so I would say we're probably closer in the second quarter to move it more into the maintenance mode on those type of things. 
I would say that probably means that we may not grow in the high teens in First Aid and Safety, but we will continue to see very good growth in First Aid and Safety."

When we talk about revenue in the health care segment, keep in mind that we're talking about all of the products and services that we would provide at health care segment that is both fire service, first aid service, some direct sale business and obviously, some rental -- uniform rental and FS business. It represents about 7% of our total revenue now. We're excited about what we see in that segment. Health care represents about 17% of GDP and so we think we continue to have a big opportunity in health care, the scrub rental business and these isolation gowns. 
And from your perspective, if you just simply refer to those as the scrub business, I think you'd be safe. These isolation gowns are typically worn over the top of the scrub, dealing with particular patients to protect the nurse or doctor from bodily fluids and things like that, no need to get into a whole separate category on that. 
But we're excited on what we see there. The COVID has brought a realization to health care providers that taking -- what wearing scrubs to work and then wearing them home may not be the right approach, and they're looking for ways to outsource managing those programs for them, and we really like the position that we're in. I would say that health care has a great opportunity to be the first segment that we service to grow to over 10% of our total revenue. And so we remain very optimistic about this segment."

Happy to provide a little color there and Todd may want to chime in as we go through this. But the pre-COVID, we had decision-makers that had time to review things, try to get multiple competitive looks and things like that when we're out in the marketplace. I think that the urgency of trying to find certain products and services certainly shortened that sales cycle, decisions were made more quickly. It's not to say that they weren't trying to find competitive bids. But in many cases, it was hard for competitors that come up with the product and services that they need to fulfill a customer's order. I'm proud to say that we did a really good job of making sure that we were in front of that and had inventory. And so we've been reasonably successful in being able to help these companies out. 
As we look at sales productivity amongst our sales force, we're -- we have been through the entire COVID period. Selling at very impressive productivity rates, very high historically. We like to see that happen. It -- we think it's a good sign for the foreseeable future for the company.

They're out of supply for maybe a few days and that sort of thing. And they don't have to worry about that when we're taking care of it for them. And restrooms are something that every single business has to deal with.

And is that the case as we are -- as we sit here in this disruptive period and are we seeing any differences in the way that our competitors are coming to market and competing. 
And I'll start, as Todd mentioned earlier, our new business continues to be very, very robust. And we're selling not just the same mix of product from 6 months ago, but a little bit of a different mix as it relates to this hygiene messaging, which is resonating so well. And so that certainly can lead to new types of prospects that we may not have talked to in the past. And when we get our foot the door, good things can happen when they start to see our service. We can continue to talk about other needs that they may have. And so we've seen some nice success in that during this -- even during the fourth quarter, but more so in this first quarter."

And we're also, because of the urgency and the intensity of what we're -- what is important to these businesses, we're going to get at levels of decision-makers that we weren't in the past, quicker.

I think it says a lot about the American entrepreneurial spirit to see them able to do the things that they're doing, with the new rules in place, be they face masks and outdoor dining and such. 
But some of them, many of them are not at full capacity yet because of various restrictions that have been put on them or customers that may not be ready to come back out to frequent their businesses. So clearly, I think, for the American economy, for the global economy, a vaccine is going to be very well received. So that the rules can change and businesses could get back to operating in a sort of a new normal, but a normal that allows them to operate in a more traditional fashion."

There was 22 million jobs that were lost. It seemed like overnight almost. And then jobs returned pretty quickly in the early, very early portion of the summer. And then as you've seen that the summer we're on, things moderated a bit and jobs returning. And there's still 11 million people that are -- 11 million jobs that have not been recovered. So that has certainly impacted our business. We need more businesses to come back. 
We are still guiding towards sequential growth from Q1 to Q2. We do have 1 less workday in Q2 versus Q1. And we're encouraged by our new business efforts, the products and services that we're selling, the engagement of our customers of what we're providing and -- but it takes a while for all those new business efforts to recover over all the businesses that are still closed and all the jobs that are still on the sidelines.

And keep in mind, the last point I'll make is, last year's second quarter was a pretty good quarter for us as well. And so when you put it all together, echoing what Todd said, we remain excited about the performance and the momentum that we have, particularly in a bit of a challenging environment and one that is -- that it still contains a fair amount of, I'll say, lack of clarity, let's say.

Certainly, that was a big factor in your fourth quarter. It sounded like you had it mostly contained in the fourth quarter, but maybe there was some carryover in the first quarter. 
But Mike, I was hoping you could just talk a little bit about some of the puts and takes inside the margins and the implications about incremental margins over 100% here on a go-forward basis and what's unusual about the quarter, if anything?"

But as you think about the -- this period of time that we're in, we entered the quarter with a fair amount of disruption and lack of clarity. And we entered it with a hiring freeze, a wage rate freeze and pretty tight control on discretionary spending. And as the quarter went on, revenue obviously came a bit higher than our guidance range. And we've been pleased with that. 
And so we started to bring -- we started a higher back revenue-producing positions. And that certainly will have an impact as we move forward. But in the first quarter, this -- in this period of just extreme disruption, we entered it with a lot of uncertainty, and we exited with still some uncertainty, but better momentum than we certainly expected. 
I'll point to a couple of things, though, within the quarter. Energy was 30 basis points better than a year ago, so we certainly got a little bit of a help there. We talked a little bit about discretionary spending. If you think about travel, that was down about 100 basis points. We are itching to get out to visit customers and -- in our locations and we'll start to do that slowly. But some of that will get leverage with better revenue momentum as well. 
And then the third thing I'll say is last year, you might recall, we had a pretty high medical expense in the first quarter. We kind of settled back into our normal range, and that was a benefit of about 90 basis points. All in all, though, Andy, points to our ability to really control the costs and manage the business pretty well in a highly disruptive period of time. And it also shows that as we move out of this, we have some -- we have -- we will continue to invest in revenue-producing positions and the growth routes, et cetera."

So the people we are adding or want to add positions have to make sure that they're going through the proper channels to get approval to do that. 
Things that we need to do to invest in the business are going to come back online, that may be trucks that have been and therefore, service reps that have been idled because of this disruption, because of the growth that we've seen through the first quarter. Some of that is coming back online. As a result of that, that's driving some production labor to produce the goods. We're bringing some salespeople back online that were temporarily on the sidelines. In the second quarter, we're back to advertising, both national radio advertising and some TV advertising that you may have seen this past weekend. So these are the kind of costs that we think are necessary to continue to grow the business and to get our brand out there in front of customers and prospects, but we're very confident in our ability to manage these costs. 
Are there things that we look at to say, we maybe we don't need those or as much of that or that might have a long-term impact. We're always looking for those kind of things. And that is part of the culture that we have as a company. And when we find them, we pretty much jump on them and make sure that we can drive those costs out of the organization. I think that there are nothing major at this point that we saw in the first quarter, but there will be some things that will change the way we operate new business moving forward. We're much more efficient right now, out of necessity than we have been. And I think that that's always good for any organization to put themselves in a position where they look around and realize, what else can we do to get efficient. 
So I think we've done a really good job, and my expectation is that we'll continue to do so. That said, there are going to be some things that are coming back online in the second quarter that I think for the long term, intermediate and long-term benefit of the business and our ability to grow are necessary expenses."

It's getting us in front of decision-makers we weren't able to get to in the past. I think on our last call, we spoke about a really large bank that we had hardly done any business with before.

Those revenues are off significantly in the direct sale business. We think it's going to continue that way for the foreseeable future. I think that those are probably a longer lead time for those to see those come back as their customer base gets more and more comfortable with getting on an airplane, going to an airport or flying to a city, taking a taxi to a hotel and so forth. So I think that we're going to see those areas struggle for a while. That is all in our guidance. And it's also in our results for the first quarter. 
I would say that the second quarter, probably for those related industry segments will perform similarly to the way they did in the first quarter. There may be a few in there that do a little better than others, but I'd say it's probably, at this point through the second quarter, more of the same in those segments."

So we're very happy to be done with the integration, right? That was -- these are never funding process. 
But we're also seeing some real nice advantages there. And I'd say one of the bigger ones is the ability to get speed of product to customers, because of various items internally that allows us to get the product to that. So that's -- customers will value that, especially in an environment like this, where you can deliver when you say you will or faster, and in an environment where a lot of companies are struggling to do that, and that's a big advantage for us."

I would say that the U.S. economy, not just us, but the U.S. economy will be affected depending on which candidate wins and assuming they both implement the things that they say, the positions that they have taken at this point. A Biden administration, more business regulation, could slow down businesses' ability to continue to grow. Higher taxes will obviously hit profits and earnings per share. And then obviously, the impact to the overall stock market. And as you said, President Trump wants to continue to try to bring manufacturing jobs back and maintain or improve the current tax situation. 
Anyway, we will be impacted as much because of how our customers are impacted by whoever wins as anything else. So I think that as a general statement, because our customer and prospect base is such a broad spectrum of American industry that as American industry goes, we will go with it. I will say this, I am confident because we have managed through different versions of what different administrations have brought to -- into the U.S. economy, that we can manage through this, that we will manage through it as we have in the past. I think we've got a really good track record of proving that we can do that. And so we're optimistic either way about the long-term future of the company.

It's the actual fluid itself, the container that it comes in, the dispensing units that we need, the stands and so forth, and so there's a buildup of that inventory. But these are things that we are doing to take advantage of the opportunities that are in the marketplace right now. And we're very confident that because we've been able to do this and do it in such short order that we are winning business daily because we have inventory. 
We talked about one of the examples I gave early on was that we've got a very large account because we were able to deliver masks in a matter of days that other companies were telling that prospect, it would take months to get those. We had another example of a large customer, multi-location customer, that decided to give 1/3 of their hand sanitizer stand business to us, 1/3 to 1 of our competitors and a 1/3 to a third competitor. We implemented that program with thousands of stands in a week. One of the competitors came back and said, we can't deliver it within your time frame, so they gave us that 1/3. We did that the next week, thousands of stands. And the third competitor can only do about half of what they said they could do. So they're giving us half of that 1/3 of the business. And it's because we have the inventory available today to service those accounts. And so we look at that and what we've been able to do with our global supply chain and our ability to get those products out into the marketplace quickly as a significant competitive advantage, and we're taking advantage of it right now."

I think your question was regarding how each of our businesses is performing as we enter the second quarter and how do we feel about the performance. 
And Shlomo, I would say that, first of all, our guidance encompasses all of what I'm going to mention. But Todd talked a little bit about the momentum of the rental business, and we continue to see a nice trend line, even though it's moderated a bit from that heavy disruptive period early in this first quarter. But we still continue to add really good new business. And we're continuing to sell these hygiene products that Todd's talked a bit about. 
In our First Aid and Safety, we've had 2 quarters of high-teens growth and Scott talked a little bit about. These are -- these big sales of personal protective equipment are hard to predict. And so they happen, but then they generally will go into maintenance mode. And so our expectation is we'll see a little bit more maintenance mode in the First Aid and Safety business in Q2. But still very, very good results. We are very excited about that business. 
The fire business, which was down organically about 12% in the fourth quarter, was down organically, just over 5% in this first quarter. And that business continues to perform well and continue to move on an improving trend line. 
And then lastly, Scott talked a little bit about our Direct Sale business, which was down 47% in the [ first quarter ]. And we probably see that as another quarter of pretty difficult time given that customer base. So that's our -- that's the way we view the second quarter, keeping in mind that it is at the midpoint and higher end of that guidance, it calls for sequential improvement and nice sequential improvement of that. So again, we like the momentum of the business and the execution of it as well.

This continues to be a challenging time for our employees, who we call partners, are doing all they can do to keep our customers' places of business clean, safe and ready for the workday. Our fleet partners remain diligent in their care of our customers, providing essential products and services, and they have remained diligent in their care of each other, and we can't thank them enough for their truly impressive achievements. 
Before we get into the financial results, I'd like to provide you with some examples of our interactions with our customers in the first quarter of our fiscal year, so you have a better understanding of our business. A hospital system in Michigan provided isolation gowns to their staff and laundered them in the hospital. These garments are fluid-resistant protective clothing worn by doctors and nurses. The hospital had difficulty staffing the laundry and suffered quality issues. Hospital system, a no programmer, as we call it, decided to outsource the procurement and laundering to Cintas, so they could concentrate on patient care. 
Another no programmer, a dental alliance with 55 locations in 3 states, signed with us for scrubs in a rental program for 550 wearers. Due to their satisfaction with the service, they are in discussions with us to add facility services products and first aid supplies. 
In California, one university system with many campuses signed a multiyear agreement for hand sanitizer service. In addition, our first aid business is providing them with $0.5 million of hard-to-find gloves. To another university system in California, our first aid division is providing over 1 million face masks. 
A restaurant chain that has been a customer since 2007 had been struggling in the first few months of the pandemic. In talking with the customer, we listened and were empathetic and adjusted service frequencies and inventories in partnership with them. They were so pleased with the way that we treated them that they renewed our service agreement and added hand sanitizer stand service to every one of their restaurants. 
A casino customer in Ohio recently reopened after being dormant due to COVID-19 restrictions. In order to conduct business in the new environment, the casino added rental mask services and additional items to increase cleaning protocols, including dust mats and microfiber mops and towels. 
And a city government in Texas was a no programmer until they came to us for a hand sanitizer program for all of their government buildings. They were so happy with the execution that we gained their trust to provide some of their personal protective equipment needs as well and were impressed with our ability to deliver hundreds of thousands of masks within days. 
These examples are just a handful of the many and were offered to highlight the following: our opportunity to convert no programmers, the do-it -yourself-ers, remains robust. Scrubs and isolation gowns are indicative of a broad uniform rental opportunity. Our approach of being flexible with customers in the short term reaped long-term benefits. Our Net Promoter Scores, which we use to measure customer satisfaction, have never been higher. Earning the trust of the customer enables us to penetrate -- enables further penetration and cross-selling. And our supply chain and service network are competitive advantages, enabling us to increase service to existing customers and add new customers by procuring and providing items in short supply. Our value proposition of getting businesses ready for the workday by providing essential, unparalleled image, safety, friendliness and compliance has never resonated more than it does today. A new trend of greater focus on health, readiness and outsourcing of noncore activities is underway. We are well positioned for this new normal.

Our fiscal 2021 first quarter revenue was $1.75 billion, a decrease of 3.6% from last year's first quarter. Earnings per diluted share, or EPS, were $2.78, an increase of 19.8% from last year's first quarter. Free cash flow, which is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, for this year's first quarter was $281.4 million, an increase of 32.6%. 
Organic revenue, adjusted for acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and differences in the number of workdays, declined 5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Organic revenue for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment declined 5.4%. Organic revenue for the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment increased 17.1%. 
Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal '21 of $826.2 million decreased 2.7%. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue, 47.3% for the first quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 46.9% in the first quarter of fiscal '20. 
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 27.3% in the first quarter and 30% in the first quarter of fiscal '20. Fiscal '21 first quarter results benefited from lower expenses as a percentage of revenue in many areas, including discretionary spending. 
Operating income for the first quarter of fiscal '21 of $349.7 million increased 14.2%. Operating margin was 20% in the first quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 16.9% in the first quarter of fiscal '20. 
Our fiscal first quarter contained 1 more workday than the prior year first quarter. 1 more workday in a quarter has an impact of approximately 50 basis points on operating margin due to many large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation expense and amortization expense, being determined on a monthly basis instead of on a workday basis. 
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '21 was 7.8% compared to 10.1% last year. The tax rate can move from period-to-period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. 
Net income for the first quarter of fiscal '21 was $300 million, an increase of 19.6%. 
Earnings per diluted share were $2.78, an increase of 19.8% from last year's first quarter. 
In addition to the solid financial performance, we continue to generate strong cash flow. First quarter free cash flow was $281.4 million, an increase of 32.6% compared to last year. Our leverage calculation for our credit facility definition was 1.6x debt to EBITDA. Our balance sheet is strong. We have an untapped credit facility of $1 billion. 
For financial modeling purposes, please note that there will be 1 more workday in our fiscal '21 than in our fiscal '20. 1 more day will benefit fiscal '21 total revenue growth by 40 basis points. 1 more workday also benefits operating margin and EPS. Fiscal '21 operating income margin will be about 12.5 basis points better in comparison to fiscal '20 due to 1 more day of revenue. In fiscal '20, each quarter contained 65 workdays. In fiscal '21, workdays by quarter are 66 in Q1, 65 in Q2, 64 in Q3 and 66 in Q4. Please keep these differences in mind when modeling results on a year-over-year and sequential basis. 
Before turning the call over to Todd Schneider to discuss the performance of each of our businesses, I want to comment on fiscal '21 financial guidance. Due to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, uncertainty remains about the pace of economic recovery. Therefore, we are not providing annual guidance at this time. However, we would like to provide our second quarter financial expectations. 
We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.725 billion to $1.75 billion and EPS to be in the range of $2 to $2.20. Please note the following regarding second quarter financial expectations: Our second quarter contains the same number of workdays as last year's second quarter but 1 less than our first quarter. We expect operating margin as a percent of revenue to be in the range of 17.5% to 19%, and we expect our second quarter effective tax rate to be about 22% compared to 20.1% in last year's second quarter. 
I'll now turn it over to Todd."

Before I review the business results, I'd like to build off of Scott's comments. While the environment remains challenging and uncertain, we did experience a continued improvement in results through the quarter. The majority of our existing customers have reopened, and our employee partners work diligently in partnership with these businesses to get them ready for the workday. 
Despite reopening, many existing customers are not yet operating at the same level of business before the COVID-19 pandemic started because of the virus' impact on health and the economy. In keeping with the Cintas culture, our employee partners are working with urgency to offset these headwinds. Significant opportunities for new revenues exist because of the need of businesses to instill confidence in their employees, customers, students, patients, et cetera, that they will remain healthy and safe. Additionally, businesses are outsourcing paths that are not their core competency, so they can successfully navigate these challenging times. 
The value we provide businesses has never been more evident. In fact, we've been given a seat at the table in discussions with state and local officials, hospital administration, COVID-19 procurement task forces and hospitality cleanliness councils. There is greater demand for services and products we already provide such as healthy

In other areas, demand is so attractive that we are providing new services and products made possible by our supply chain, distribution network, sales force and cash flow. These include rent of health care isolation gowns, hand sanitizer stand and dispenser service and sanitizing spray service.

The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, health care scrubs, mats and towels and provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. This segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.39 billion, a decrease of 4.1%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate changes and the difference in the number of workdays, the organic revenue declined 5.4%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 48.7% for the first quarter compared to 47.2% in last year's first quarter. Higher inventory amortization expense of 80 basis points was more than offset by benefit of lower production and service expense as a percent of revenue, the additional workday and lower energy expenses. 
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products, personal protective equipment and training. This segment's revenue for the first quarter was $204.5 million. The organic growth rate for the segment was 17.1%. The First Aid segment gross margin was 40.2% from the first quarter compared to 49.0% in last year's first quarter. Lower production and service expenses as a percent of revenue compared to last year's first quarter were more than offset by higher cost of goods sold from the increased proportion of revenue from personal protective equipment, such as masks and gloves. 
Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. Our fire business historically grows each year at a strong pace. The Uniform Direct Sale business growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion-dollar account. Uniform Direct Sale, however, is a key business for us, and its customers are often significant opportunities to cross-sell and provide products and services from our other business units. 
All Other revenue was $147.7 million, a decrease of 20.0%. Organic revenue declined 22.2%. The fire business organic revenue declined 5.3% due to the inability to access some businesses because of closures. The Uniform Direct Sale business organic revenue declined 47.3%. Revenue from our airline, cruise line, hospitality and gaming customers largely falls within this segment. These industries continue to be among the hardest hit by the pandemic. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

I'll take the first part of that. I'll let Todd take the second part of that. On First Aid and Safety, I think the way that is probably the best way for you all to look at it is that a lot of the initial upfront large sales of PPE through the First Aid business are similar to what happens in the Direct Sale business when we sell a big, new customer. There's a large, upfront sale of these goods, and then it will -- that customer's revenue will drop to a maintenance level. And so we are seeing that, in the first quarter, we did have a lot of large, upfront sales to customers in the First Aid and Safety business that are now moving into that maintenance level. That doesn't mean that there aren't other customers out there that we can find and identify, but I think that there was a big rush of that in our first quarter as pandemic hit. And so I would say we're probably closer in the second quarter to move it more into the maintenance mode on those type of things. 
I would say that probably means that we may not grow in the high teens in First Aid and Safety, but we will continue to see very good growth in First Aid and Safety."

It represents about 7% of our total revenue now. We're excited about what we see in that segment. Health care represents about 17% of GDP, and so we think we continue to have a big opportunity in health care. 
The scrub rental business and these isolation gowns. And if -- from your perspective, if you just simply refer to those as the scrub business, I think you'd be safe. These isolation gowns are things typically worn over the top of a scrub, dealing with particular patients to protect the nurse or doctor from bodily fluids and things like that. No need to get into a whole separate category on that. But we're excited on what we see there. The COVID has brought a realization to health care providers that taking -- wearing scrubs to work and then wearing them home may not be the right approach, and they're looking for ways to outsource managing those programs for them, and we really like the position that we're in. I would say that health care has a great opportunity to be the first segment that we service to grow to over 10% of our total revenue, and so we remain very optimistic about this segment."

Happy to provide a little color there, and Todd may want to chime in as we go through this. But the -- pre-COVID, we had decision-makers that had time to review things, try to get multiple competitive looks and things like that when we're out in the marketplace. I think that the urgency of trying to find certain products and services certainly shortened that sales cycle, decisions were made more quickly. It's not to say that they weren't trying to find competitive bids. But in many cases, it was hard for competitors that come up with the product and services they needed to fulfill a customer's order. I'm proud to say that we did a really good job of making sure that we were in front of that and had inventory, and so we've been reasonably successful in being able to help these companies out. 
As we look at sales productivity amongst our sales force, we're -- we have been through the entire COVID period, selling at very impressive productivity rates, very high historically. We like to see that happen. It -- we think it's a good sign for the foreseeable future for the company.

Sometimes, that happens when they're out of inventory, then they have to go and place the order. They have to wait for the order to come to them. They're out of supply for maybe a few days and that sort of thing. And they don't have to worry about that when we're taking care of it for them.

But some of them -- many of them are not at full capacity yet because of various restrictions that have been put on them or customers that may not be ready to come back out to frequent their businesses.

Or are there other factors that are baked into the revenue guidance?"

There was 22 million jobs that were lost, seemed like, overnight almost. And then jobs returned pretty quickly in the early, very early portion of the summer. And then as you've seen that the summer wore on, things moderated a bit and jobs returning. And there's still 11 million people that are -- 11 million jobs that have not been recovered. So that has certainly impacted our business. We need more businesses to come back. 
We are still guiding towards sequential growth from Q1 to Q2. We do have 1 less workday in Q2 versus Q1. And we're encouraged by our new business efforts, the products and services that we're selling, the engagement of our customers of what we're providing and -- but it takes a while for all those new business efforts to recover over all the businesses that are still closed and all the jobs that are still on the sidelines. So -- but we're very much looking forward to Q2, Q3, Q4, and we like the trend lines that we're seeing."

One is Scott talked a little earlier about the First Aid and Safety large personal protective equipment sales that are -- that kind of turn into maintenance a little bit. So keep that in mind. 
Another point I'll make is if you think about the first quarter revenue on the same workdays as Q2, you're talking about $1.720 billion. And so we do see some -- that guidance range, especially at the top of it, does look to nice sequential improvement. 
And keep in mind, the last point I'll make is last year's second quarter was a pretty good quarter for us as well. 
And so when you put it all together, echoing what Todd said, we remain excited about the performance and the momentum that we have, particularly in a bit of a challenging environment and one that is -- that still contains a fair amount of, I'll say, lack of clarity, let's say. And so we think this guidance range really points to continued nice momentum improvement."

Anytime you've got basically EBITDA up against declining revenue, that's a very surprising and very -- obviously very good outcome for the company. We're already starting to see some questions from some of our customers asking if there was anything onetime, either positively or negatively, in other words, costs that maybe were furloughed or otherwise, things like that, that were recognized in the quarter that need to creep back in here as the year progresses or other things, if you continue to do some level of restructuring. Certainly, that was a big factor in your fourth quarter. It sounded like you had it mostly contained in the fourth quarter, but maybe there was some carryover in the first quarter. 
But Mike, I was hoping you could just talk a little bit about some of the puts and takes inside the margins and the implications about incremental margins over 100% here on a go-forward basis and what's unusual about the quarter, if anything?"

But as you think about the -- this period of time that we're in, we entered the quarter with a fair amount of disruption and lack of clarity. And we entered it with a hiring freeze, a wage rate freeze and pretty tight control on discretionary spending. And as the quarter went on, revenue obviously came a bit higher than our guidance range, and we've been pleased with that. And so we've started to bring -- we started a higher back revenue-producing positions, and that certainly will have an impact as we move forward. But in the first quarter, this -- in this period of just extreme disruption, we entered it with a lot of uncertainty, and we exited with still some uncertainty but better momentum than we certainly expected. 
I'll point to a couple of things, though, within the quarter. Energy was 30 basis points better than a year ago, so we certainly got a little bit of a help there. 
We talked a little bit about discretionary spending. If you think about travel, that was down about 100 basis points. We are itching to get out to visit customers and -- in our locations, and we'll start to do that slowly. But some of that will get leverage with better revenue momentum as well. 
And then the third thing I'll say is last year, you might recall, we had a pretty high medical expense in the first quarter. We kind of settled back into our normal range, and that was a benefit of about 90 basis points. 
All in all, though, Andy, it points to our ability to really control the costs and manage the business pretty well in a highly disruptive period of time. And it also shows that as we move out of this, we have some -- we have -- we will continue to invest in revenue-producing positions and the growth routes, et cetera."

First of all, as we look out into the second quarter and beyond, we are confident in our ability to control our costs. And we are still really managing labor at the very top of the organization, so the people we are adding or want to add positions have to make sure that they're going through the proper channels to get approval to do that. Things that we need to do to invest in the business are going to come back online. That may be trucks that have been and therefore service reps that have been idled because of this disruption because of the growth that we've seen through the first quarter. Some of that is coming back online. As a result of that, that's driving some production labor to produce the goods. We're bringing some salespeople back online that were temporarily on the sidelines. In the second quarter, we're back to advertising, both national radio advertising and some TV advertising, that you may have seen this past weekend. 
So these are the kind of costs that we think are necessary to continue to grow the business and to get our brand out there in front of customers and prospects, but we're very confident in our ability to manage these costs. Are there things that we look at to say we -- maybe we don't need those or as much of that or that might have a long-term impact? We're always looking for those kind of things, and that is part of a culture that we have as a company. And when we find them, we pretty much jump on them and make sure that we can drive those costs out of the organization. I think that there are nothing major at this point that we saw in the first quarter, but there will be some things that will change the way we operate new business moving forward. We're much more efficient right now, out of necessity, than we have been. And I think that that's always good for any organization to put themselves in a position where they look around and realize, what else can we do to get efficient. 
So I think we've done a really good job, and my expectation is that we'll continue to do so. That said, there are going to be some things that are coming back online in the second quarter that I think, for the long term, intermediate and long-term benefit of the business and our ability to grow are necessary expenses."

It gets us in the door and allows us to -- that we mentioned earlier, it's getting us in front of prospects we've never been in front before. It's getting us in front of decision-makers we weren't able to get to in the past. I think on our last call, we spoke about a really large bank that we had hardly done any business with before, and now they have sanitized service at all their branches, which is significant. But it also -- now they're talking to us about first aid, and they're talking to us about fire, and they're -- and other rental products.

And there, you got to look at that in a lot of different ways. It's the actual fluid itself, the container that it comes in, the dispensing units that we need, the stands and so forth. And so there's a buildup of that inventory, but these are things that we are doing to take advantage of the opportunities that are in the marketplace right now. And we're very confident that because we've been able to do this and do it in such short order that we are winning business daily because we have inventory. 
We talked about one of the examples I gave early on was that we've got a very large account because we were able to deliver masks in a matter of days that other companies were telling that prospect it would take months to get those. We had another example of a large customer, multilocation customer that decided to give 1/3 of their hand sanitizer stand business to us, 1/3 to one of our competitors and 1/3 to a third competitor. We implemented that program with thousands of stands in a week. One of the competitors came back and said: ""We can't deliver it within your time frame,"" so they gave us that 1/3. We did that the next week, thousands of stands. And the third competitor can only do about half of what they said they could do, so they're giving us half of that 1/3 of the business, and it's because we have the inventory available today to service those accounts. And so we look at that and what we've been able to do with our global supply chain and our ability to get those products out into the marketplace quickly as a significant competitive advantage, and we're taking advantage of it right now."

I think your question was regarding how each of our businesses is performing as we enter the second quarter and how do we feel about the performance. And Shlomo, I would say that, first of all, the guidance encompasses all of what I'm going to mention. But Todd talked a little bit about the momentum of the rental business, and we continue to see a nice trend line, even though it's moderated a bit from that heavy disruptive period early in this first quarter. But we still continue to add really good new business, and we're continuing to sell these hygiene products that Todd's talked a bit about. 
In our First Aid and Safety, we've had 2 quarters of high-teens growth and Scott talked a little bit about. These are -- these big sales of personal protective equipment are hard to predict. And so they happen, but then they generally will go into maintenance mode. And so our expectation is we'll see a little bit more maintenance mode in the First Aid and Safety business in Q2 but still very, very good results. We are very excited about that business. 
The fire business, which was down organically about 12% in the fourth quarter, was down organically, just over 5% in this first quarter. And that business continues to perform well and continue to move on an improving trend line. 
And then lastly, Scott talked a little bit about our Direct Sale business, which was down 47% in the first quarter. And we probably see that as another quarter of pretty difficult time given that customer base. 
So that's our -- that's the way we view the second quarter, keeping in mind that it is at the midpoint and higher end of that guidance, it calls for sequential improvement and nice sequential improvement of that. So again, we like the momentum of the business and the execution of it as well. 
Did that answer your question, Shlomo?"

This continues to be a challenging time for our employees, who we call partners, are doing all they can do to keep our customers' places of business clean, safe and ready for the workday. Our fleet partners remain diligent in their care of our customers, providing essential products and services, and they have remained diligent in their care of each other, and we can't thank them enough for their truly impressive achievements. 
Before we get into the financial results, I'd like to provide you with some examples of our interactions with our customers in the first quarter of our fiscal year, so you have a better understanding of our business. A hospital system in Michigan provided isolation gowns to their staff and laundered them in the hospital. These garments are fluid-resistant protective clothing worn by doctors and nurses. The hospital had difficulty staffing the laundry and suffered quality issues. Hospital system, a no programmer, as we call it, decided to outsource the procurement and laundering to Cintas, so they could concentrate on patient care. 
Another no programmer, a dental alliance with 55 locations in 3 states, signed with us for scrubs in a rental program for 550 wearers. Due to their satisfaction with the service, they are in discussions with us to add facility services products and first aid supplies. 
In California, one university system with many campuses signed a multiyear agreement for hand sanitizer service. In addition, our first aid business is providing them with $0.5 million of hard-to-find gloves. To another university system in California, our first aid division is providing over 1 million face masks. 
A restaurant chain that has been a customer since 2007 had been struggling in the first few months of the pandemic. In talking with the customer, we listened and were empathetic and adjusted service frequencies and inventories in partnership with them. They were so pleased with the way that we treated them that they renewed our service agreement and added hand sanitizer stand service to every one of their restaurants. 
A casino customer in Ohio recently reopened after being dormant due to COVID-19 restrictions. In order to conduct business in the new environment, the casino added rental mask services and additional items to increase cleaning protocols, including dust mats and microfiber mops and towels. 
And a city government in Texas was a no programmer until they came to us for a hand sanitizer program for all of their government buildings. They were so happy with the execution that we gained their trust to provide some of their personal protective equipment needs as well and were impressed with our ability to deliver hundreds of thousands of masks within days. 
These examples are just a handful of the many and were offered to highlight the following: our opportunity to convert no programmers, the do-it-yourself-ers, remains robust. Scrubs and isolation gowns are indicative of a broad uniform rental opportunity. Our approach of being flexible with customers in the short term reaped long-term benefits. Our Net Promoter Scores, which we use to measure customer satisfaction, have never been higher. Earning the trust of the customer enables us to penetrate -- enables further penetration and cross-selling. And our supply chain and service network are competitive advantages, enabling us to increase service to existing customers and add new customers by procuring and providing items in short supply. Our value proposition of getting businesses ready for the workday by providing essential, unparalleled image, safety, friendliness and compliance has never resonated more than it does today. A new trend of greater focus on health, readiness and outsourcing of noncore activities is underway. We are well positioned for this new normal. 
I'll turn the call over to Mike now for commentary on the financial results. Mike?"

Our fiscal 2021 first quarter revenue was $1.75 billion, a decrease of 3.6% from last year's first quarter.

Our fiscal 2021 first quarter revenue was $1.75 billion, a decrease of 3.6% from last year's first quarter. Earnings per diluted share, or EPS, were $2.78, an increase of 19.8% from last year's first quarter. Free cash flow, which is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, for this year's first quarter was $281.4 million, an increase of 32.6%. 
Organic revenue, adjusted for acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and differences in the number of workdays, declined 5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Organic revenue for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment declined 5.4%. Organic revenue for the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment increased 17.1%. 
Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal '21 of $826.2 million decreased 2.7%. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue, 47.3% for the first quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 46.9% in the first quarter of fiscal '20. 
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 27.3% in the first quarter and 30% in the first quarter of fiscal '20. Fiscal '21 first quarter results benefited from lower expenses as a percentage of revenue in many areas, including discretionary spending. 
Operating income for the first quarter of fiscal '21 of $349.7 million increased 14.2%. Operating margin was 20% in the first quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 16.9% in the first quarter of fiscal '20. 
Our fiscal first quarter contained 1 more workday than the prior year first quarter. 1 more workday in a quarter has an impact of approximately 50 basis points on operating margin due to many large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation expense and amortization expense, being determined on a monthly basis instead of on a workday basis. 
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '21 was 7.8% compared to 10.1% last year. The tax rate can move from period-to-period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. 
Net income for the first quarter of fiscal '21 was $300 million, an increase of 19.6%. 
Earnings per diluted share were $2.78, an increase of 19.8% from last year's first quarter. 
In addition to the solid financial performance, we continue to generate strong cash flow. First quarter free cash flow was $281.4 million, an increase of 32.6% compared to last year. Our leverage calculation for our credit facility definition was 1.6x debt to EBITDA. Our balance sheet is strong. We have an untapped credit facility of $1 billion. 
For financial modeling purposes, please note that there will be 1 more workday in our fiscal '21 than in our fiscal '20. 1 more day will benefit fiscal '21 total revenue growth by 40 basis points. 1 more workday also benefits operating margin and EPS. Fiscal '21 operating income margin will be about 12.5 basis points better in comparison to fiscal '20 due to 1 more day of revenue. In fiscal '20, each quarter contained 65 workdays. In fiscal '21, workdays by quarter are 66 in Q1, 65 in Q2, 64 in Q3 and 66 in Q4. Please keep these differences in mind when modeling results on a year-over-year and sequential basis. 
Before turning the call over to Todd Schneider to discuss the performance of each of our businesses, I want to comment on fiscal '21 financial guidance. Due to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, uncertainty remains about the pace of economic recovery. Therefore, we are not providing annual guidance at this time. However, we would like to provide our second quarter financial expectations. 
We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.725 billion to $1.75 billion and EPS to be in the range of $2 to $2.20. Please note the following regarding second quarter financial expectations: Our second quarter contains the same number of workdays as last year's second quarter but 1 less than our first quarter. We expect operating margin as a percent of revenue to be in the range of 17.5% to 19%, and we expect our second quarter effective tax rate to be about 22% compared to 20.1% in last year's second quarter. 
I'll now turn it over to Todd."

Before I review the business results, I'd like to build off of Scott's comments. While the environment remains challenging and uncertain, we did experience a continued improvement in results through the quarter. The majority of our existing customers have reopened, and our employee partners work diligently in partnership with these businesses to get them ready for the workday. 
Despite reopening, many existing customers are not yet operating at the same level of business before the COVID-19 pandemic started because of the virus' impact on health and the economy. In keeping with the Cintas culture, our employee partners are working with urgency to offset these headwinds. Significant opportunities for new revenues exist because of the need of businesses to instill confidence in their employees, customers, students, patients, et cetera, that they will remain healthy and safe. Additionally, businesses are outsourcing paths that are not their core competency, so they can successfully navigate these challenging times. 
The value we provide businesses has never been more evident. In fact, we've been given a seat at the table in discussions with state and local officials, hospital administration, COVID-19 procurement task forces and hospitality cleanliness councils. There is greater demand for services and products we already provide such as healthy
[Audio Gap] 
In other areas, demand is so attractive that we are providing new services and products made possible by our supply chain, distribution network, sales force and cash flow. These include rent of health care isolation gowns, hand sanitizer stand and dispenser service and sanitizing spray service. 
With that, I'll turn now to the first quarter financial performance of our businesses. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, health care scrubs, mats and towels and provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. This segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.39 billion, a decrease of 4.1%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate changes and the difference in the number of workdays, the organic revenue declined 5.4%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 48.7% for the first quarter compared to 47.2% in last year's first quarter. Higher inventory amortization expense of 80 basis points was more than offset by benefit of lower production and service expense as a percent of revenue, the additional workday and lower energy expenses. 
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products, personal protective equipment and training. This segment's revenue for the first quarter was $204.5 million. The organic growth rate for the segment was 17.1%. The First Aid segment gross margin was 40.2% from the first quarter compared to 49.0% in last year's first quarter. Lower production and service expenses as a percent of revenue compared to last year's first quarter were more than offset by higher cost of goods sold from the increased proportion of revenue from personal protective equipment, such as masks and gloves. 
Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. Our fire business historically grows each year at a strong pace. The Uniform Direct Sale business growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion-dollar account. Uniform Direct Sale, however, is a key business for us, and its customers are often significant opportunities to cross-sell and provide products and services from our other business units. 
All Other revenue was $147.7 million, a decrease of 20.0%. Organic revenue declined 22.2%. The fire business organic revenue declined 5.3% due to the inability to access some businesses because of closures. The Uniform Direct Sale business organic revenue declined 47.3%. Revenue from our airline, cruise line, hospitality and gaming customers largely falls within this segment. These industries continue to be among the hardest hit by the pandemic. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

On First Aid and Safety, I think the way that is probably the best way for you all to look at it is that a lot of the initial upfront large sales of PPE through the First Aid business are similar to what happens in the Direct Sale business when we sell a big, new customer. There's a large, upfront sale of these goods, and then it will -- that customer's revenue will drop to a maintenance level. And so we are seeing that, in the first quarter, we did have a lot of large, upfront sales to customers in the First Aid and Safety business that are now moving into that maintenance level. That doesn't mean that there aren't other customers out there that we can find and identify, but I think that there was a big rush of that in our first quarter as pandemic hit. And so I would say we're probably closer in the second quarter to move it more into the maintenance mode on those type of things. 
I would say that probably means that we may not grow in the high teens in First Aid and Safety, but we will continue to see very good growth in First Aid and Safety."

When we talk about revenue in the health care segment, keep in mind that we're talking about all of the products and services that we would provide at health care segment that is both fire service, first aid service, some Direct Sale business, and obviously, some rental -- Uniform Rental and FS business. It represents about 7% of our total revenue now. We're excited about what we see in that segment. Health care represents about 17% of GDP, and so we think we continue to have a big opportunity in health care. 
The scrub rental business and these isolation gowns. And if -- from your perspective, if you just simply refer to those as the scrub business, I think you'd be safe. These isolation gowns are things typically worn over the top of a scrub, dealing with particular patients to protect the nurse or doctor from bodily fluids and things like that. No need to get into a whole separate category on that. But we're excited on what we see there. The COVID has brought a realization to health care providers that taking -- wearing scrubs to work and then wearing them home may not be the right approach, and they're looking for ways to outsource managing those programs for them, and we really like the position that we're in. I would say that health care has a great opportunity to be the first segment that we service to grow to over 10% of our total revenue, and so we remain very optimistic about this segment."

But the -- pre-COVID, we had decision-makers that had time to review things, try to get multiple competitive looks and things like that when we're out in the marketplace. I think that the urgency of trying to find certain products and services certainly shortened that sales cycle, decisions were made more quickly. It's not to say that they weren't trying to find competitive bids. But in many cases, it was hard for competitors that come up with the product and services they needed to fulfill a customer's order. I'm proud to say that we did a really good job of making sure that we were in front of that and had inventory, and so we've been reasonably successful in being able to help these companies out. 
As we look at sales productivity amongst our sales force, we're -- we have been through the entire COVID period, selling at very impressive productivity rates, very high historically. We like to see that happen. It -- we think it's a good sign for the foreseeable future for the company.

Sometimes, that happens when they're out of inventory, then they have to go and place the order. They have to wait for the order to come to them. They're out of supply for maybe a few days and that sort of thing. And they don't have to worry about that when we're taking care of it for them. And restrooms are something that every single business has to deal with.

And we're selling not just the same mix of product from 6 months ago but a little bit of a different mix as it relates to this hygiene messaging, which is resonating so well. And so that certainly can lead to new types of prospects that we may not have talked to in the past. And when we get our foot in the door, good things can happen. When they start to see our service, we can continue to talk about other needs that they may have.

But some of them -- many of them are not at full capacity yet because of various restrictions that have been put on them or customers that may not be ready to come back out to frequent their businesses.

So that has certainly impacted our business. We need more businesses to come back. 
We are still guiding towards sequential growth from Q1 to Q2. We do have 1 less workday in Q2 versus Q1. And we're encouraged by our new business efforts, the products and services that we're selling, the engagement of our customers of what we're providing and -- but it takes a while for all those new business efforts to recover over all the businesses that are still closed and all the jobs that are still on the sidelines.

Another point I'll make is if you think about the first quarter revenue on the same workdays as Q2, you're talking about $1.720 billion. And so we do see some -- that guidance range, especially at the top of it, does look to nice sequential improvement. 
And keep in mind, the last point I'll make is last year's second quarter was a pretty good quarter for us as well. 
And so when you put it all together, echoing what Todd said, we remain excited about the performance and the momentum that we have, particularly in a bit of a challenging environment and one that is -- that still contains a fair amount of, I'll say, lack of clarity, let's say.

Certainly, that was a big factor in your fourth quarter. It sounded like you had it mostly contained in the fourth quarter, but maybe there was some carryover in the first quarter.

But as you think about the -- this period of time that we're in, we entered the quarter with a fair amount of disruption and lack of clarity. And we entered it with a hiring freeze, a wage rate freeze and pretty tight control on discretionary spending. And as the quarter went on, revenue obviously came a bit higher than our guidance range, and we've been pleased with that. And so we've started to bring -- we started a higher back revenue-producing positions, and that certainly will have an impact as we move forward. But in the first quarter, this -- in this period of just extreme disruption, we entered it with a lot of uncertainty, and we exited with still some uncertainty but better momentum than we certainly expected. 
I'll point to a couple of things, though, within the quarter. Energy was 30 basis points better than a year ago, so we certainly got a little bit of a help there. 
We talked a little bit about discretionary spending. If you think about travel, that was down about 100 basis points. We are itching to get out to visit customers and -- in our locations, and we'll start to do that slowly. But some of that will get leverage with better revenue momentum as well. 
And then the third thing I'll say is last year, you might recall, we had a pretty high medical expense in the first quarter. We kind of settled back into our normal range, and that was a benefit of about 90 basis points. 
All in all, though, Andy, it points to our ability to really control the costs and manage the business pretty well in a highly disruptive period of time. And it also shows that as we move out of this, we have some -- we have -- we will continue to invest in revenue-producing positions and the growth routes, et cetera."

First of all, as we look out into the second quarter and beyond, we are confident in our ability to control our costs. And we are still really managing labor at the very top of the organization, so the people we are adding or want to add positions have to make sure that they're going through the proper channels to get approval to do that. Things that we need to do to invest in the business are going to come back online. That may be trucks that have been and therefore service reps that have been idled because of this disruption because of the growth that we've seen through the first quarter. Some of that is coming back online. As a result of that, that's driving some production labor to produce the goods. We're bringing some salespeople back online that were temporarily on the sidelines. In the second quarter, we're back to advertising, both national radio advertising and some TV advertising, that you may have seen this past weekend. 
So these are the kind of costs that we think are necessary to continue to grow the business and to get our brand out there in front of customers and prospects, but we're very confident in our ability to manage these costs. Are there things that we look at to say we -- maybe we don't need those or as much of that or that might have a long-term impact? We're always looking for those kind of things, and that is part of a culture that we have as a company. And when we find them, we pretty much jump on them and make sure that we can drive those costs out of the organization. I think that there are nothing major at this point that we saw in the first quarter, but there will be some things that will change the way we operate new business moving forward. We're much more efficient right now, out of necessity, than we have been. And I think that that's always good for any organization to put themselves in a position where they look around and realize, what else can we do to get efficient. 
So I think we've done a really good job, and my expectation is that we'll continue to do so. That said, there are going to be some things that are coming back online in the second quarter that I think, for the long term, intermediate and long-term benefit of the business and our ability to grow are necessary expenses."

And when you go through these types of cataclysmic events, it is -- as Scott mentioned, it makes you look through a different lens. You evaluate your organization different. And one of the interesting items is how we engage with our customers. Do they want us there? Or should we be there in person as much?

So that is -- so you'll see it in both, but predominantly in the rental organization, just because of the scope of their organization and their customer base, et cetera. And sanitizer sale is going quite well. But you know what? It is leading to other sales as well. It gets us in the door and allows us to -- that we mentioned earlier, it's getting us in front of prospects we've never been in front before. It's getting us in front of decision-makers we weren't able to get to in the past. I think on our last call, we spoke about a really large bank that we had hardly done any business with before, and now they have sanitized service at all their branches, which is significant. But it also -- now they're talking to us about first aid, and they're talking to us about fire, and they're -- and other rental products. So it -- those types of urgent needs allow for our people to get in and help explain to people what we do, how we do it, the value we provide. And it opens some eyes, and we're able to sell more.

Anyway, we will be impacted as much because of how our customers are impacted by whoever wins as anything else, so I think that as a general statement because our customer and prospect base is such a broad spectrum of American industry that as American industry goes, we will go with it. 
I will say this. I am confident because we have managed through different versions of what different administrations have brought to -- into the U.S. economy, that we can manage through this, that we will manage through it as we have in the past.

And we're very confident that because we've been able to do this and do it in such short order that we are winning business daily because we have inventory. 
We talked about one of the examples I gave early on was that we've got a very large account because we were able to deliver masks in a matter of days that other companies were telling that prospect it would take months to get those. We had another example of a large customer, multilocation customer that decided to give 1/3 of their hand sanitizer stand business to us, 1/3 to one of our competitors and 1/3 to a third competitor. We implemented that program with thousands of stands in a week. One of the competitors came back and said: ""We can't deliver it within your time frame,"" so they gave us that 1/3. We did that the next week, thousands of stands. And the third competitor can only do about half of what they said they could do, so they're giving us half of that 1/3 of the business, and it's because we have the inventory available today to service those accounts. And so we look at that and what we've been able to do with our global supply chain and our ability to get those products out into the marketplace quickly as a significant competitive advantage, and we're taking advantage of it right now."

I think your question was regarding how each of our businesses is performing as we enter the second quarter and how do we feel about the performance. And Shlomo, I would say that, first of all, the guidance encompasses all of what I'm going to mention. But Todd talked a little bit about the momentum of the rental business, and we continue to see a nice trend line, even though it's moderated a bit from that heavy disruptive period early in this first quarter. But we still continue to add really good new business, and we're continuing to sell these hygiene products that Todd's talked a bit about. 
In our First Aid and Safety, we've had 2 quarters of high-teens growth and Scott talked a little bit about. These are -- these big sales of personal protective equipment are hard to predict. And so they happen, but then they generally will go into maintenance mode. And so our expectation is we'll see a little bit more maintenance mode in the First Aid and Safety business in Q2 but still very, very good results. We are very excited about that business. 
The fire business, which was down organically about 12% in the fourth quarter, was down organically, just over 5% in this first quarter. And that business continues to perform well and continue to move on an improving trend line. 
And then lastly, Scott talked a little bit about our Direct Sale business, which was down 47% in the first quarter. And we probably see that as another quarter of pretty difficult time given that customer base. 
So that's our -- that's the way we view the second quarter, keeping in mind that it is at the midpoint and higher end of that guidance, it calls for sequential improvement and nice sequential improvement of that. So again, we like the momentum of the business and the execution of it as well. 
Did that answer your question, Shlomo?"

This continues to be a challenging time for our employees, who we call partners, are doing all they can do to keep our customers' places of business clean, safe and ready for the workday. Our fleet partners remain diligent in their care of our customers, providing essential products and services, and they have remained diligent in their care of each other, and we can't thank them enough for their truly impressive achievements. 
Before we get into the financial results, I'd like to provide you with some examples of our interactions with our customers in the first quarter of our fiscal year, so you have a better understanding of our business. A hospital system in Michigan provided isolation gowns to their staff and laundered them in the hospital. These garments are fluid-resistant protective clothing worn by doctors and nurses. The hospital had difficulty staffing the laundry and suffered quality issues. Hospital system, a no programmer, as we call it, decided to outsource the procurement and laundering to Cintas, so they could concentrate on patient care. 
Another no programmer, a dental alliance with 55 locations in 3 states, signed with us for scrubs in a rental program for 550 wearers. Due to their satisfaction with the service, they are in discussions with us to add facility services products and first aid supplies. 
In California, one university system with many campuses signed a multiyear agreement for hand sanitizer service. In addition, our first aid business is providing them with $0.5 million of hard-to-find gloves. To another university system in California, our first aid division is providing over 1 million face masks. 
A restaurant chain that has been a customer since 2007 had been struggling in the first few months of the pandemic. In talking with the customer, we listened and were empathetic and adjusted service frequencies and inventories in partnership with them. They were so pleased with the way that we treated them that they renewed our service agreement and added hand sanitizer stand service to every one of their restaurants. 
A casino customer in Ohio recently reopened after being dormant due to COVID-19 restrictions. In order to conduct business in the new environment, the casino added rental mask services and additional items to increase cleaning protocols, including dust mats and microfiber mops and towels. 
And a city government in Texas was a no programmer until they came to us for a hand sanitizer program for all of their government buildings. They were so happy with the execution that we gained their trust to provide some of their personal protective equipment needs as well and were impressed with our ability to deliver hundreds of thousands of masks within days. 
These examples are just a handful of the many and were offered to highlight the following: our opportunity to convert no programmers, the do-it-yourself-ers, remains robust. Scrubs and isolation gowns are indicative of a broad uniform rental opportunity. Our approach of being flexible with customers in the short term reaped long-term benefits. Our Net Promoter Scores, which we use to measure customer satisfaction, have never been higher. Earning the trust of the customer enables us to penetrate -- enables further penetration and cross-selling. And our supply chain and service network are competitive advantages, enabling us to increase service to existing customers and add new customers by procuring and providing items in short supply. Our value proposition of getting businesses ready for the workday by providing essential, unparalleled image, safety, friendliness and compliance has never resonated more than it does today. A new trend of greater focus on health, readiness and outsourcing of noncore activities is underway. We are well positioned for this new normal. 
I'll turn the call over to Mike now for commentary on the financial results. Mike?"

Our fiscal 2021 first quarter revenue was $1.75 billion, a decrease of 3.6% from last year's first quarter. Earnings per diluted share, or EPS, were $2.78, an increase of 19.8% from last year's first quarter. Free cash flo",696,"Thanks, Scott, and good morning. Our fiscal 2021 first quarter revenue was $1.75 billion, a decrease of 3.6% from last year's first quarter. Earnings per diluted share, or EPS, were $2.78, an increase of 19.8% from last year's first quarter. Free cash flow, which is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, for this year's first quarter was $281.4 million, an increase of 32.6%. 
Organic revenue, adjusted for acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and differences in the number of workdays, declined 5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Organic revenue for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment declined 5.4%. Organic revenue for the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment increased 17.1%. 
Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal '21 of $826.2 million decreased 2.7%. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue, 47.3% for the first quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 46.9% in the first quarter of fiscal '20. 
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 27.3% in the first quarter and 30% in the first quarter of fiscal '20. Fiscal '21 first quarter results benefited from lower expenses as a percentage of revenue in many areas, including discretionary spending. 
Operating income for the first quarter of fiscal '21 of $349.7 million increased 14.2%. Operating margin was 20% in the first quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 16.9% in the first quarter of fiscal '20. 
Our fiscal first quarter contained 1 more workday than the prior year first quarter. 1 more workday in a quarter has an impact of approximately 50 basis points on operating margin due to many large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation expense and amortization expense, being determined on a monthly basis instead of on a workday basis. 
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '21 was 7.8% compared to 10.1% last year. The tax rate can move from period-to-period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. 
Net income for the first quarter of fiscal '21 was $300 million, an increase of 19.6%. 
Earnings per diluted share were $2.78, an increase of 19.8% from last year's first quarter. 
In addition to the solid financial performance, we continue to generate strong cash flow. First quarter free cash flow was $281.4 million, an increase of 32.6% compared to last year. Our leverage calculation for our credit facility definition was 1.6x debt to EBITDA. Our balance sheet is strong. We have an untapped credit facility of $1 billion. 
For financial modeling purposes, please note that there will be 1 more workday in our fiscal '21 than in our fiscal '20. 1 more day will benefit fiscal '21 total revenue growth by 40 basis points. 1 more workday also benefits operating margin and EPS. Fiscal '21 operating income margin will be about 12.5 basis points better in comparison to fiscal '20 due to 1 more day of revenue. In fiscal '20, each quarter contained 65 workdays. In fiscal '21, workdays by quarter are 66 in Q1, 65 in Q2, 64 in Q3 and 66 in Q4. Please keep these differences in mind when modeling results on a year-over-year and sequential basis. 
Before turning the call over to Todd Schneider to discuss the performance of each of our businesses, I want to comment on fiscal '21 financial guidance. Due to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, uncertainty remains about the pace of economic recovery. Therefore, we are not providing annual guidance at this time. However, we would like to provide our second quarter financial expectations. 
We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.725 billion to $1.75 billion and EPS to be in the range of $2 to $2.20. Please note the following regarding second quarter financial expectations: Our second quarter contains the same number of workdays as last year's second quarter but 1 less than our first quarter. We expect operating margin as a percent of revenue to be in the range of 17.5% to 19%, and we expect our second quarter effective tax rate to be about 22% compared to 20.1% in last year's second quarter. 
I'll now turn it over to Todd."

Before I review the business results, I'd like to build off of Scott's comments. While the environment remains challenging and uncertain, we did experience a continued improvement in results through the quarter. The majority of our existing customers have reopened, and our employee partners work diligently in partnership with these businesses to get them ready for the workday. 
Despite reopening, many existing customers are not yet operating at the same level of business before the COVID-19 pandemic started because of the virus' impact on health and the economy. In keeping with the Cintas culture, our employee partners are working with urgency to offset these headwinds. Significant opportunities for new revenues exist because of the need of businesses to instill confidence in their employees, customers, students, patients, et cetera, that they will remain healthy and safe. Additionally, businesses are outsourcing paths that are not their core competency, so they can successfully navigate these challenging times. 
The value we provide businesses has never been more evident. In fact, we've been given a seat at the table in discussions with state and local officials, hospital administration, COVID-19 procurement task forces and hospitality cleanliness councils. There is greater demand for services and products we already provide such as healthy
[Audio Gap] 
In other areas, demand is so attractive that we are providing new services and products made possible by our supply chain, distribution network, sales force and cash flow. These include rent of health care isolation gowns, hand sanitizer stand and dispenser service and sanitizing spray service. 
With that, I'll turn now to the first quarter financial performance of our businesses. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, health care scrubs, mats and towels and provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. This segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.39 billion, a decrease of 4.1%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate changes and the difference in the number of workdays, the organic revenue declined 5.4%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 48.7% for the first quarter compared to 47.2% in last year's first quarter. Higher inventory amortization expense of 80 basis points was more than offset by benefit of lower production and service expense as a percent of revenue, the additional workday and lower energy expenses. 
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products, personal protective equipment and training. This segment's revenue for the first quarter was $204.5 million. The organic growth rate for the segment was 17.1%. The First Aid segment gross margin was 40.2% from the first quarter compared to 49.0% in last year's first quarter. Lower production and service expenses as a percent of revenue compared to last year's first quarter were more than offset by higher cost of goods sold from the increased proportion of revenue from personal protective equipment, such as masks and gloves. 
Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. Our fire business historically grows each year at a strong pace. The Uniform Direct Sale business growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion-dollar account. Uniform Direct Sale, however, is a key business for us, and its customers are often significant opportunities to cross-sell and provide products and services from our other business units. 
All Other revenue was $147.7 million, a decrease of 20.0%. Organic revenue declined 22.2%. The fire business organic revenue declined 5.3% due to the inability to access some businesses because of closures. The Uniform Direct Sale business organic revenue declined 47.3%. Revenue from our airline, cruise line, hospitality and gaming customers largely falls within this segment. These industries continue to be among the hardest hit by the pandemic. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

On First Aid and Safety, I think the way that is probably the best way for you all to look at it is that a lot of the initial upfront large sales of PPE through the First Aid business are similar to what happens in the Direct Sale business when we sell a big, new customer. There's a large, upfront sale of these goods, and then it will -- that customer's revenue will drop to a maintenance level. And so we are seeing that, in the first quarter, we did have a lot of large, upfront sales to customers in the First Aid and Safety business that are now moving into that maintenance level. That doesn't mean that there aren't other customers out there that we can find and identify, but I think that there was a big rush of that in our first quarter as pandemic hit. And so I would say we're probably closer in the second quarter to move it more into the maintenance mode on those type of things. 
I would say that probably means that we may not grow in the high teens in First Aid and Safety, but we will continue to see very good growth in First Aid and Safety."

It represents about 7% of our total revenue now. We're excited about what we see in that segment. Health care represents about 17% of GDP, and so we think we continue to have a big opportunity in health care. 
The scrub rental business and these isolation gowns. And if -- from your perspective, if you just simply refer to those as the scrub business, I think you'd be safe. These isolation gowns are things typically worn over the top of a scrub, dealing with particular patients to protect the nurse or doctor from bodily fluids and things like that. No need to get into a whole separate category on that. But we're excited on what we see there. The COVID has brought a realization to health care providers that taking -- wearing scrubs to work and then wearing them home may not be the right approach, and they're looking for ways to outsource managing those programs for them, and we really like the position that we're in. I would say that health care has a great opportunity to be the first segment that we service to grow to over 10% of our total revenue, and so we remain very optimistic about this segment."

Happy to provide a little color there, and Todd may want to chime in as we go through this. But the -- pre-COVID, we had decision-makers that had time to review things, try to get multiple competitive looks and things like that when we're out in the marketplace. I think that the urgency of trying to find certain products and services certainly shortened that sales cycle, decisions were made more quickly. It's not to say that they weren't trying to find competitive bids. But in many cases, it was hard for competitors that come up with the product and services they needed to fulfill a customer's order. I'm proud to say that we did a really good job of making sure that we were in front of that and had inventory, and so we've been reasonably successful in being able to help these companies out. 
As we look at sales productivity amongst our sales force, we're -- we have been through the entire COVID period, selling at very impressive productivity rates, very high historically. We like to see that happen. It -- we think it's a good sign for the foreseeable future for the company. And so you combine that sales productivity with decision-makers that are in the market trying to make reasonably quick decisions, and we think we can do very well in that regard.

When you have those available, it does shorten sales cycle because there are some times where we walk in and they say, ""My goodness, you have that. Let's go."" And so again, there's so many different sales processes going on at any one time. It's tough to say, make a sweeping statement. But say, generally speaking, yes, its spend is up because of the urgency of making sure people are taken care of.

We're able to -- because the vast majority of our routes service our customers weekly that allows for us to be able to inspect what they have, where they are from an inventory standpoint and help provide some consultative services instead of just tell us when you're -- when you need some more product.

Most of the time, a customer who's buying it from a supply house or a traditional competitor has to take upon themselves to realize that they're running low on inventory. Sometimes, that happens when they're out of inventory, then they have to go and place the order. They have to wait for the order to come to them. They're out of supply for maybe a few days and that sort of thing. And they don't have to worry about that when we're taking care of it for them. And restrooms are something that every single business has to deal with. And when we take care of that for them, it's one less detail that they have to worry about in the course of their business day and allows them to focus their time and attention on taking care of their customers.

As Todd mentioned earlier, our new business continues to be very, very robust. And we're selling not just the same mix of product from 6 months ago but a little bit of a different mix as it relates to this hygiene messaging, which is resonating so well. And so that certainly can lead to new types of prospects that we may not have talked to in the past. And when we get our foot in the door, good things can happen. When they start to see our service, we can continue to talk about other needs that they may have.

I think it says a lot about the American entrepreneurial spirit to see them able to do the things that they're doing with the new rules in place, be they face masks and outdoor dining and such. But some of them -- many of them are not at full capacity yet because of various restrictions that have been put on them or customers that may not be ready to come back out to frequent their businesses.

So that has certainly impacted our business. We need more businesses to come back. 
We are still guiding towards sequential growth from Q1 to Q2. We do have 1 less workday in Q2 versus Q1. And we're encouraged by our new business efforts, the products and services that we're selling, the engagement of our customers of what we're providing and -- but it takes a while for all those new business efforts to recover over all the businesses that are still closed and all the jobs that are still on the sidelines.

Another point I'll make is if you think about the first quarter revenue on the same workdays as Q2, you're talking about $1.720 billion. And so we do see some -- that guidance range, especially at the top of it, does look to nice sequential improvement. 
And keep in mind, the last point I'll make is last year's second quarter was a pretty good quarter for us as well. 
And so when you put it all together, echoing what Todd said, we remain excited about the performance and the momentum that we have, particularly in a bit of a challenging environment and one that is -- that still contains a fair amount of, I'll say, lack of clarity, let's say.

Anytime you've got basically EBITDA up against declining revenue, that's a very surprising and very -- obviously very good outcome for the company. We're already starting to see some questions from some of our customers asking if there was anything onetime, either positively or negatively, in other words, costs that maybe were furloughed or otherwise, things like that, that were recognized in the quarter that need to creep back in here as the year progresses or other things, if you continue to do some level of restructuring. Certainly, that was a big factor in your fourth quarter. It sounded like you had it mostly contained in the fourth quarter, but maybe there was some carryover in the first quarter.

But as you think about the -- this period of time that we're in, we entered the quarter with a fair amount of disruption and lack of clarity. And we entered it with a hiring freeze, a wage rate freeze and pretty tight control on discretionary spending. And as the quarter went on, revenue obviously came a bit higher than our guidance range, and we've been pleased with that. And so we've started to bring -- we started a higher back revenue-producing positions, and that certainly will have an impact as we move forward. But in the first quarter, this -- in this period of just extreme disruption, we entered it with a lot of uncertainty, and we exited with still some uncertainty but better momentum than we certainly expected. 
I'll point to a couple of things, though, within the quarter. Energy was 30 basis points better than a year ago, so we certainly got a little bit of a help there. 
We talked a little bit about discretionary spending. If you think about travel, that was down about 100 basis points. We are itching to get out to visit customers and -- in our locations, and we'll start to do that slowly. But some of that will get leverage with better revenue momentum as well. 
And then the third thing I'll say is last year, you might recall, we had a pretty high medical expense in the first quarter. We kind of settled back into our normal range, and that was a benefit of about 90 basis points. 
All in all, though, Andy, it points to our ability to really control the costs and manage the business pretty well in a highly disruptive period of time. And it also shows that as we move out of this, we have some -- we have -- we will continue to invest in revenue-producing positions and the growth routes, et cetera."

Things that we need to do to invest in the business are going to come back online. That may be trucks that have been and therefore service reps that have been idled because of this disruption because of the growth that we've seen through the first quarter. Some of that is coming back online. As a result of that, that's driving some production labor to produce the goods. We're bringing some salespeople back online that were temporarily on the sidelines. In the second quarter, we're back to advertising, both national radio advertising and some TV advertising, that you may have seen this past weekend. 
So these are the kind of costs that we think are necessary to continue to grow the business and to get our brand out there in front of customers and prospects, but we're very confident in our ability to manage these costs. Are there things that we look at to say we -- maybe we don't need those or as much of that or that might have a long-term impact? We're always looking for those kind of things, and that is part of a culture that we have as a company. And when we find them, we pretty much jump on them and make sure that we can drive those costs out of the organization. I think that there are nothing major at this point that we saw in the first quarter, but there will be some things that will change the way we operate new business moving forward. We're much more efficient right now, out of necessity, than we have been. And I think that that's always good for any organization to put themselves in a position where they look around and realize, what else can we do to get efficient. 
So I think we've done a really good job, and my expectation is that we'll continue to do so. That said, there are going to be some things that are coming back online in the second quarter that I think, for the long term, intermediate and long-term benefit of the business and our ability to grow are necessary expenses."

Scott talked about growing is expensive, right? It's an investment. And I think we've shown the ability to manage those expenses all the way down, meaning as the economy kind of went off a cliff, and we will manage them on the way up as well. And hopefully, that V continues. And I got to tell you, it's a whole lot more fun. Demand is on the way up than it was on the way down, and our people feel that way. 
And when you go through these types of cataclysmic events, it is -- as Scott mentioned, it makes you look through a different lens. You evaluate your organization different. And one of the interesting items is how we engage with our customers. Do they want us there? Or should we be there in person as much? Whether it's a Teams call or a Zoom call or a FaceTime, whatever it is, business moves back, and we're evaluating that. Our customers are evaluating that, but it does allow things to speed up. And will that have a long-term impact? It could. We shall see I think, certainly, in the short and intermediate future, that's what we see."

So that is -- so you'll see it in both, but predominantly in the rental organization, just because of the scope of their organization and their customer base, et cetera. And sanitizer sale is going quite well. But you know what? It is leading to other sales as well. It gets us in the door and allows us to -- that we mentioned earlier, it's getting us in front of prospects we've never been in front before. It's getting us in front of decision-makers we weren't able to get to in the past. I think on our last call, we spoke about a really large bank that we had hardly done any business with before, and now they have sanitized service at all their branches, which is significant. But it also -- now they're talking to us about first aid, and they're talking to us about fire, and they're -- and other rental products. So it -- those types of urgent needs allow for our people to get in and help explain to people what we do, how we do it, the value we provide. And it opens some eyes, and we're able to sell more. So it's really encouraging."

That would be hotels and airlines and cruise ships and even gaming is in there. Those revenues are off significantly in the Direct Sale business. We think it's going to continue that way for the foreseeable future. I think that those are probably a longer lead time for those to see those come back as their customer base gets more and more comfortable with getting on an airplane, going to an airport, flying to a city, taking a taxi to a hotel and so forth. So I think that we're going to see those areas struggle for a while. That is all in our guidance, and it's also in our results for the first quarter. I would say that the second quarter, probably for those related industry segments will perform similarly to the way they did in the first quarter. There may be a few in there that do a little better than others, but I'd say it's probably, at this point through the second quarter, more of the same in those segments."

A Biden administration, more business regulation could slow down a business's ability to continue to grow. Higher taxes would obviously hit profits and earnings per share and then obviously the impact to the overall stock market. And you said it. President Trump wants to continue to try to bring manufacturing jobs back and maintain or improve the current tax situation. 
Anyway, we will be impacted as much because of how our customers are impacted by whoever wins as anything else, so I think that as a general statement because our customer and prospect base is such a broad spectrum of American industry that as American industry goes, we will go with it. 
I will say this. I am confident because we have managed through different versions of what different administrations have brought to -- into the U.S. economy, that we can manage through this, that we will manage through it as we have in the past.

And there, you got to look at that in a lot of different ways. It's the actual fluid itself, the container that it comes in, the dispensing units that we need, the stands and so forth.

And we're very confident that because we've been able to do this and do it in such short order that we are winning business daily because we have inventory. 
We talked about one of the examples I gave early on was that we've got a very large account because we were able to deliver masks in a matter of days that other companies were telling that prospect it would take months to get those. We had another example of a large customer, multilocation customer that decided to give 1/3 of their hand sanitizer stand business to us, 1/3 to one of our competitors and 1/3 to a third competitor. We implemented that program with thousands of stands in a week. One of the competitors came back and said: ""We can't deliver it within your time frame,"" so they gave us that 1/3. We did that the next week, thousands of stands. And the third competitor can only do about half of what they said they could do, so they're giving us half of that 1/3 of the business, and it's because we have the inventory available today to service those accounts. And so we look at that and what we've been able to do with our global supply chain and our ability to get those products out into the marketplace quickly as a significant competitive advantage, and we're taking advantage of it right now."

I think your question was regarding how each of our businesses is performing as we enter the second quarter and how do we feel about the performance. And Shlomo, I would say that, first of all, the guidance encompasses all of what I'm going to mention. But Todd talked a little bit about the momentum of the rental business, and we continue to see a nice trend line, even though it's moderated a bit from that heavy disruptive period early in this first quarter. But we still continue to add really good new business, and we're continuing to sell these hygiene products that Todd's talked a bit about. 
In our First Aid and Safety, we've had 2 quarters of high-teens growth and Scott talked a little bit about. These are -- these big sales of personal protective equipment are hard to predict. And so they happen, but then they generally will go into maintenance mode. And so our expectation is we'll see a little bit more maintenance mode in the First Aid and Safety business in Q2 but still very, very good results. We are very excited about that business. 
The fire business, which was down organically about 12% in the fourth quarter, was down organically, just over 5% in this first quarter. And that business continues to perform well and continue to move on an improving trend line. 
And then lastly, Scott talked a little bit about our Direct Sale business, which was down 47% in the first quarter. And we probably see that as another quarter of pretty difficult time given that customer base. 
So that's our -- that's the way we view the second quarter, keeping in mind that it is at the midpoint and higher end of that guidance, it calls for sequential improvement and nice sequential improvement of that. So again, we like the momentum of the business and the execution of it as well.

Despite the macroeconomic headwinds, I'm pleased with our second quarter financial performance, which exceeded expectations. Our employees, whom we call partners, have not wavered in their passion for getting businesses Ready for the Workday. They're providing essential products and services to help keep our customers and their places of business clean and safe. These include hand sanitizer services, professionally laundered health care scrubs and isolation gowns, first aid products, sanitizing wipes, face masks, gloves and Fire Protection Services as well as many others. 
The conversion of no programmers, the do-it-yourselfers, if you will, remains robust. Our supply chain and service network enables us to increase service to existing customers and add new customers by procuring and providing items in short supply. And our Net Promoter Score, which we use to measure customer satisfaction, has risen dramatically to an all-time high. We find ourselves today, however, at a time of increasing uncertainty. A number of states and municipalities have reinstituted temporary economic restrictions in response to rising COVID-19 cases. Others are considering them. 
On the other hand, vaccines are being distributed, and the U.S. government continues to discuss additional economic stimulus. The uncertainty of the resolutions of these impactful events makes providing near-term guidance very difficult. Therefore, we're not providing financial guidance at this time. However, if we're able to gain clarity before the end of the quarter, we'll provide an update in advance of our third quarter earnings release. 
That said, there is much that does remain certain. Our employee partners reflect the steadfast Cintas culture. We're always striving to exceed the expectations of our customers to maximize the long-term value of Cintas for its shareholders, employee partners and other stakeholders. The result is consistently strong financial performance with Cintas growing revenue and EPS 49 of the past 51 years. I remain certain of our value proposition of getting businesses Ready for the Workday by providing essential, unparalleled image, safety, cleanliness and compliance. It has never resonated more than it does today. I remain certain of our addressable market, namely the millions upon millions of businesses that are not currently Cintas customers, many of whom are not in a program with recurring service but could benefit from at least one Cintas product or service. And I'm certain that Cintas is well positioned for years to come. 
Now I'll turn it over to Mike for commentary on the financial results of the quarter. Mike?"

Our fiscal 2021 second quarter revenue was $1.76 billion compared to $1.84 billion in last year's second quarter.

Our fiscal 2021 second quarter revenue was $1.76 billion compared to $1.84 billion in last year's second quarter. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations, or EPS, were $2.62, an increase of 15.4% from last year's second quarter. Organic revenue, adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, declined 4.4% for the second quarter of fiscal '21. Organic revenue for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment declined 3.6%. Organic revenue for the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment increased 14.5%. 
Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal '21 was $819.9 million compared to $852.4 million in last year's second quarter. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased 50 basis points to 46.7% for the second quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 46.2% in the second quarter of fiscal '20. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 26.6% in the second quarter of fiscal '21 and 28.1% last year. Fiscal '21 second quarter results benefited from lower discretionary spending and increased sales rep productivity. 
Operating income for the second quarter of fiscal '21 of $352.9 million increased 5.5%. Operating margin was 20.1% in the second quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 18.1% in the second quarter of fiscal '20. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal '21 was 13.3% compared to 20.1% last year. Tax rates can move from period-to-period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. Net income from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal '21 was $284.9 million, an increase of 15.7%. EPS was $2.62, an increase of 15.4% from last year's second quarter. In the second quarter of fiscal '21, certain Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating assets were sold. The pretax gain on sale of $18 million was recorded in selling and administrative expenses and impacted operating margin by 100 basis points. The pretax gain and related tax benefit impacted EPS by $0.25. 
Our balance sheet and cash flow remains strong. Our leverage calculation for our credit facility definition was 1.6x debt to EBITDA. We have an untapped credit facility of $1 billion. For financial modeling purposes, please note that there is 1 more workday in our fiscal '21 than in our fiscal '20. 1 more day will benefit fiscal '21 total revenue growth by 40 basis points. 1 more workday also benefits operating margin and EPS. Fiscal '21 operating margin will be about 12.5 basis points better in comparison to fiscal '20 due to 1 more day of revenue. In fiscal '20, each quarter contained 65 workdays. In fiscal '21, workdays by quarter are 66 in Q1, 65 in Q2, 64 in Q3 and 66 in Q4. Please keep these differences in mind when modeling on a year-over-year and sequential basis. 
I'll now turn the call over to Todd Schneider to discuss the performance of each of our businesses."

As Scott stated, COVID-19 remains a significant disruption to the economy. Every business in U.S. and Canada has been impacted. Many of our customers that have remained open are not yet operating at the same level of business as before the pandemic started because of the virus' negative impact on health and the economy. Our employee partners continue to work with urgency to offset these headwinds. Over the past couple of quarters, we have provided some examples of their interactions with both new and existing customers to give a better understanding. Many of those examples highlighted customers in the industries of health care, education and state and local government and products and services, including scrubs, hand sanitizer service and masks. 
During the second quarter of the fiscal year, the amount of Uniform Rental and Facility Services new business sold to health care, education and government customers is double the amount in the prior year period. And the amount of first aid, fire and other new businesses sold to customers in health care, education and government is 6x the amount sold in the same period last year. And some of this new business is reoccurring and some may not repeat. Nevertheless, the results are really impressive. Also, the number of scrub dispensing machines installed in our first 2 quarters doubled last year's number. And since the virus appeared, our employee partners have provided businesses with over 350,000 hand sanitizer dispensers and over 125 million masks. I'm truly in awe of the accomplishments of our team in this challenging time, and I'm excited about the opportunities for Cintas post pandemic, which seems to be finally appearing on the horizon. 
With that, I'll turn now to the second quarter financial performance of our businesses. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, health care scrubs, masks and towels in the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. This segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.41 billion compared to $1.47 billion last year. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 47.5% for the second quarter compared to 46.6% in last year's second quarter. Higher inventory amortization expense of 80 basis points was more than offset by the benefits of lower production and service expense as a percent of revenue. 
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products, personal protective equipment and training. This segment's revenue for the second quarter was $194.4 million compared to $169.7 million last year. The first aid segment gross margin was 43.0% in the second quarter compared to 48.4% in last year's second quarter. Lower production and service expenses as a percent of revenue compared to last year's second quarter were more than offset by higher cost of goods sold from the increased proportion of revenue from personal protective equipment, such as masks and gloves. 
Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sales businesses are reported in the All Other category. Our fire business historically grows each year at a strong pace. Uniform Direct sale business growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, just as when we install a multimillion-dollar account. Uniform Direct sales, however, is a key business for us and its customers are often significant opportunities to cross-sell and provide products and services from our other business units. All Other revenue was $152.1 million compared to $204.1 million last year. The fire business organic revenue declined 3.3% due to the inability to access some businesses because of closures. Uniform Direct Sales business organic revenue declined 51.2%. Revenue from our airline, cruise line, hospitality and gaming customers largely falls within this segment. These industries continue to be among the hardest hit by the pandemic. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We're happy to answer your questions."

And it's important to note that about mid-November, we did see the impact of some of the state's restrictions on businesses. I would say it affected the trend, but it hadn't turned it worse than it had been at that point. So it's a little unpredictable on where it goes. But as you can see, through the month of November, we continued on a positive trend. I think second quarter revenue sequentially grew about 2.7% over the first quarter."

Most of the scrubs that you see in hospitals are direct sale type scrubs, some of them bought by individual health care workers, some by the hospital for departments and things like that. But converting them to a rental program, we would call a conversion of a no programmer. The other area that we're seeing in health care that's doing really well are isolation gowns. Those are traditionally direct sale disposable gowns. And we have a rentable alternative that actually saves the hospitals and health care providers money to convert from a direct sale program to a rental program.

Our no programmer as a business as a percent of our total remains quite consistent.

Scott spoke about some in the medical area have been very successful with the isolation gowns, hands sanitizer, sanitizer wipes, disinfectant wipes, scrubs, all are seeing great demand. Scott mentioned that the isolation gowns were -- that was virtually -- almost the entire market was a direct purchase market -- purchase disposable market, probably the best way to describe it. 
And what we've done with isolation gallons has been very attractive to our prospects and our customers. It's a green service, right? We're not just [ selling ] it the trash, where we're using it. It saves them significant money. The availability of them instead of folks struggling to get isolation gowns and being panicked over trying to take care of their patients. What we -- the garments that we're providing are more comfortable than what they've been wearing in the past. And then lastly, we brought some technology to that business so that we can track exactly how many times those garments have been processed so that we can meet the specifications that are detailed out for such a product. So that's been a big win. And a lot of health care customers are very, very interested in that. And we mentioned in our previous earnings release that the demand for scrubs has been up very nicely. People are uncomfortable, in many cases, wearing those home, washing those at home and whom they come in contact with on the way to home makes people a little uncomfortable. So all that has been quite good demand. In those cases, we consider those no programmers.

Sure. It boils down to certain industry segments or geographies and  the segments that you can imagine, the travel, hotels, cruise lines; even in certain areas, restaurants, movie theaters, that type of thing are being hit the hardest because of these restrictions and people's, I think, natural fear to go and congregate in a place like a movie theater. The geographies depend on what type of or if there are any restrictions in place. And what we have seen so far is, as we got through the end of November, an increase in the number of states and municipalities that have put restrictions in place. We don't know whether that trend is going to continue through the holidays. And just as an example, Governor Newsom in California put the restrictions in place, they're pretty tight, but he says that they will extend to January 4. The question that we have there is, will he extend that further, which has been his tendency? Or will it actually be January 4 when he starts to loosen those restrictions? 
So those states are the -- and municipalities are the areas where we've seen the change since about mid-November. And my perspective is that we are in a temporary lull. We don't think it's going to be anywhere near what it was in our fourth quarter last year. Quite honestly, at that point, nobody, including governors and people running businesses, had any idea how bad it was going to be, how deep it was going to go and so forth. But now that we've got 8 or 9 months' worth of experience in dealing with it and the fact that we have vaccines beginning to roll out right now, there's light at the end of the tunnel. This is a temporary period of time that we're going to go through. And so that, I hope provides a little color to you. I'm happy to get more specific in any area if you have any questions."

Yes, Mario, I would say, in the health care market, depends upon what area within the health care area, acute, nonacute; even, frankly, into what department you're speaking of. But generally speaking, iso gowns, scrubs, et cetera, those are direct purchase market. In the case of iso gown disposable, the most common way people procure those products. Lending companies certainly are in that space, those who provide services to those types of customers. But if I -- generally I'd describe it to be it's a direct purchase or disposable market with any reusables would be traditionally with a [indiscernible] companies would be the most common experience. 
As far as the scrub dispensing, it's been going extremely well for our business and our customers. The demand is there because it's a -- well, I think most people can see the experience where you go into a grocery store and you see people wearing scrubs, right? And those belong to the hospital normally. And what happens is because folks struggle to get an access to scrub, they tend to [ hoard ] them. And as they hoard them, then they have to buy more scrubs. And when they do that, and they're in that tough situation, they tend to buy the cheapest scrub they can because they end up disappearing. And we completely change the value proposition there. We provide a scrub that people want to wear, not just have to wear. It's comfortable, attractive. And we're continuing to invest in that area and come out with better technology around the fabrics, et cetera. And it makes it completely accessible, meaning there's a complete accountability. So when you want a scrub, you can get it. You have complete access and then it's laundered for you, so they don't have to take it home. So it has been really attractive for our health care customers. And as I mentioned in the opening remarks, we've installed twice the amount of scrubs that we did last year at the same time so far through Q2. So great momentum, and we're very encouraged."

And Todd mentioned that it is traditionally a direct sale item, scrubs and isolation gowns and that sort of thing. And so I think the thing that's helpful to you all to understand is that it is really difficult, and I don't know that it's even a concept that a traditional direct sale competitor would even consider would be to try and develop a laundry service to do that. So we're providing a unique opportunity for a customer to convert to a rental program where the traditional competition can't. They don't have the ability to do that. And that is a big, significant competitive advantage for us versus the traditional supplier. That -- and we believe that because of the technology we brought, the scrub machines, the dispensing units that keep inventory tracking and our ability to control how often an isolation gown is processed before we pull it out of service, these are the kind of things that for traditional competition, they can't do. 
Relative to other rental companies, that would be linen companies and uniform rental companies, we've been in this for a long time. We have trained salespeople and service providers that specialize in the health care market. And we think we have a multiyear head start on what you would probably consider to be our traditional rental competitor. And we like that position a lot, and I think that's why you're seeing the amount of success for us as we've gone through this process and through the pandemic that we are seeing. So I just thought I'd offer that as some color relative to health care as well."

Let's -- we'll talk competitive, maybe competitive behavior and pricing. We have seen some aggressive pricing in the marketplace. I think that as competition sees their business, existing customer base have issues and decline in revenue, they typically get aggressive with pricing. I don't think this is anything that we haven't seen in the past relative to lowball prices and competition trying to take big business from us. And that's a market-by-market type of an environment. And it could be in any particular market, the small players or one of the big national players in that market that decide they need to do something to try to win some accounts. Relative to overall pricing though, while we have had to adjust prices on fluctuating items like gloves and face masks and hand sanitizer and the PPE kind of things, as our cost increased trying to get those products, we have had to adjust prices upward on those items. 
For our recurring revenue, across all of our businesses really, we have not increased prices during the pandemic, and in fact, for -- as a general statement, particularly in the rental division. But we haven't increased our prices to our customers in about 1.5 years, and that's a strategic decision on our part. We don't think that during a global pandemic, it's the right time to be raising prices. And I think that's one element of why we've seen our Net Promoter Scores, how we measure customer satisfaction, be impacted to the positive. And so that's our position on pricing at this point."

I mean you guys have articulated the travel [indiscernible] discretionary, 100 basis points last quarter, 40 this quarter of benefit.

And I think there will be permanent savings on some of those things. There will be some of that comes back, but I don't think we're going to see 100 basis points of movement in something like that. And so as we look forward, Andrew, I would say this, we're -- we want to grow over the course of the long term. We will continue to staff revenue-producing positions to prepare ourselves to grow, and that may mean a little bit more bench in our service departments and in our sales departments. And that will probably create a little bit of additional spending. 
But having said that, Scott's managed the business very, very well in this period of time, and I would expect that, that is going to continue. We will continue to be very, very cognizant of our margins and our costs and recognizing that our goal is to continue to see very healthy incremental margins.

But I'd still say that even today, we're probably spending CapEx at a 60% growth, 40% maintenance level. So -- but I just think it's going to be lower until we get through this. Everybody is a little more cautious and that's sort of thing. Relative to inventory, it's important that I think we make the statement that we are doing the best job that we can to manage the supply chain and the supply of these hard-to-get items with the demand that we're seeing from our customer base. And that's the primary reason you're seeing an increase in this inventory. I don't believe that we're going to see a sudden drop off in the need for these products. I think it will be a slow, steady decline, and we'll have some view on that as the economy recovers and as COVID vaccines continue to roll out. Many of these are going to be around at a higher level than pre COVID for a long, long time. And so we're -- we haven't seen any issues with slow-moving inventory at this point or anything like that. 
But I will tell you that the fact that we have been able to bring these products into inventory the way that we have has been a huge competitive advantage for us in the marketplace, where because we might have masks or gloves or hand sanitizer, prospects who ordinarily have not been doing business with us listen to and react to our ability to provide them with these COVID-related products and then also listen to what else we can do for them. And so it might be a call where a company is interested in hand sanitizer, and we wind up after our sales rep is out talking to them where they're putting 10 people in uniform and restroom supplies in the restroom and entrance mats and mops and cleaning chemicals and so forth, in addition to the hand sanitizer. So it's been a big competitive advantage for us as we've gone through this process, and I think one of the reasons why our NPS, customer satisfaction scores are up as well as we're seeing very robust new business results. So I think the balance sheet that we have has allowed us to be able to make that investment. Our supply chain has done a great job in sourcing it.

We're also talking to them about our fire service, which, as you can imagine, they need all of that. It's just a matter of where they're getting it from and centralizing spend, in many cases, saving money. So it's just one example of what is occurring hundreds of times every single day out there with our sales and service organization. As Scott mentioned, it really positions us well because there's people in the past who really didn't -- wouldn't take our calls. And now they will because of our inventory position and our infrastructure, and that helps position us for the long term in a really healthy manner."

Their -- I mentioned earlier that their November organic growth rate was off 1% from pre-COVID levels. But -- so we have a pretty good view of what's happening in that business. And I think that will -- similar to what happens with the rest of the economy and what happens with the rental division, we'll see that recover in a similar fashion. Relative to the direct sale business, a good portion of that business goes into hospitality and travel-related areas. That's a little murkier, and I think that -- those are hotels, airlines, cruise ships, casinos and food service and that sort of segment. So those are going to be, I think, the longer tail from a recovery standpoint, but I think that there will be a day coming where they're going to get a pretty good bump. 
I think there is a -- in my personal opinion, a huge amount of pent-up demand for people to be able to go back on vacation, to stay in a hotel, to feel safe when they get on an airplane and that sort of thing. And there's a point at which when the vaccines have been rolled out to perhaps reach herd immunity. You can see airlines throw in some special rates at travelers to welcome them back, hotels and resorts doing the same kind of thing. I think you can see Las Vegas doing everything that they can to get their customers to come back. And who knows that -- maybe that's early next summer, depending on the rate of vaccinations and things like that. But if it's going to work in those businesses, it's also going to work in other businesses. People are going to be able to go back out to their restaurants and their movie theaters locally and maybe go to the concert venue and do the social things that -- bars and do the social things that they're missing right now. 
And I think that, that is coming. When it happens, we need a little bit more time to understand the rate of rollout for the vaccines. And that's why I continue to say that we're in a temporary lull in this. And that as we get a little further out and get a little more clarity, we're going to see, I think, some economic activity pick up. And we're maybe a couple of quarters away from that, maybe on an improving quarter-by-quarter basis as those vaccines roll out."

Let me try to explain it this way. We're in a -- I think that it's the timing of our quarter and therefore, this call that are causing part of the problem that there is so much uncertainty right now as we look out over the next several weeks, couple of months, few months, maybe. And it's everything from the rising counts of the virus, we have governments putting more restrictions in place. And as of today, I don't know whether more governors and mayors are going to do that, whether they're not going to do that, how long those restrictions are going to stay in place based on the ones that have put these things in place so far. We have a typical period between Christmas and New Year's where traditionally, we have a group of customers close down their facilities for the holidays anyway. We don't know this year whether that means they're going to extend that or not. And so that causes a little bit of cloudiness. 
We've got an election in Georgia coming up in a few weeks that will determine what happens in the Senate. And so there's a lot of uncertainty. When we sat down and talked about it, we said, ""Well, let's put a range together."" But when we started to put a range together, we started saying, ""Well, what if this happens and what if that happens?"" And those would be things like what if a governor or a group of governors decided, ""Well, the vaccine is 3 months away. Let's leave these restrictions in place for the next 3 months."" What does that do to our ability to predict what our low end of the range might be? What if that doesn't happen? What if Governor Newsom actually does open California's economy back up January 4? So it became such a wide range that we decided it didn't make sense for you. Our impression of -- and I don't want to -- I hope you take this the right way. But our impression is that one of the things that you like about our company is that we're pretty predictable. And when we give guidance, you can pretty much determine in your models what that means relative to what you think is going to happen. 
In this particular case, we don't think that what we would provide for you would allow you to do that, that you might wind up with some big swings with -- depending on your positive or negative approach, depending on what you think is going to happen in the economy. And therefore, we decided it didn't make sense for us in this period of time to do that. I do not believe, this is my personal opinion, that it will be anything near like what happened in the fourth quarter for us. That was brand new. And I think there were 38 states that put shelter-in-place orders in place in a short period of time. We haven't seen that. I don't think -- I don't expect that that's going to happen at this point moving forward. Might it? Maybe. My personal opinion is that won't happen. Therefore, I don't see that as the eventual downside of what's going to happen. The upside could be that the that the number of cases begin to subside, that mayors and governors begin to open their economies back up in anticipation of vaccinated progress and so forth. 
But I do know this, with the vaccines rolling out -- I can't predict the rate yet, I need a better understanding of what that is going to be. But with those vaccines rolling out, fewer and fewer governments are going to put restrictive orders in place. And eventually, those economies in those states and municipalities are going to begin to recover at a pretty good rate. Is that in our fourth quarter? I'd love to see that. Is it next summer? Highly likely that by next summer, some point next summer, we're going to be in that position. But that's my view of it. And so I'll end with that."

The COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic remains a significant disruption to the economy. In the final month of our fiscal second quarter, November, the COVID-19 virus counts surged from about 100,000 per day at the beginning of the month to about 250,000 per day now. Not surprisingly, economic indicators, such as jobs growth, unemployment and retail spending, reflect an economic recovery that slowed considerably as the fall months progressed and the virus counts increased. 
Despite the macroeconomic headwinds, I'm pleased with our second quarter financial performance, which exceeded expectations. Our employees, whom we call partners, have not wavered in their passion for getting businesses Ready for the Workday. They're providing essential products and services to help keep our customers and their places of business clean and safe. These include hand sanitizer services, professionally laundered health care scrubs and isolation gowns, first aid products, sanitizing wipes, face masks, gloves and fire protection services as well as many others. 
The conversion of no programmers, the do-it-yourselfers, if you will, remains robust. Our supply chain and service network enables us to increase service to existing customers and add new customers by procuring and providing items in short supply. And our Net Promoter Score, which we use to measure customer satisfaction, has risen dramatically to an all-time high. 
We find ourselves today, however, at a time of increasing uncertainty. A number of states and municipalities have reinstituted temporary economic restrictions in response to rising COVID-19 cases. Others are considering them. 
On the other hand, vaccines are being distributed, and the U.S. government continues to discuss additional economic stimulus. The uncertainty of the resolutions of these impactful events makes providing near-term guidance very difficult. Therefore, we're not providing financial guidance at this time. However, if we're able to gain clarity before the end of the quarter, we'll provide an update in advance of our third quarter earnings release. 
That said, there is much that does remain certain. Our employee partners reflect the steadfast Cintas culture. We're always striving to exceed the expectations of our customers to maximize the long-term value of Cintas for its shareholders, employee partners and other stakeholders. The result is consistently strong financial performance with Cintas growing revenue and EPS 49 of the past 51 years. 
I remain certain of our value proposition of getting businesses Ready for the Workday by providing essential, unparalleled image, safety, cleanliness and compliance. It has never resonated more than it does today. I remain certain of our addressable market, namely the millions upon millions of businesses that are not currently Cintas customers, many of whom are not in a program with recurring service but could benefit from at least one Cintas product or service. And I'm certain that Cintas is well positioned for years to come. 
Now, I'll turn it over to Mike for commentary on the financial results of the quarter. Mike?"

Tax rate can move from period-to-period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. 
Net income from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal '21 was $284.9 million, an increase of 15.7%. EPS was $2.62, an increase of 15.4% from last year's second quarter. In the second quarter of fiscal '21, certain Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating assets were sold. The pretax gain on sale of $18 million was recorded in selling and administrative expenses and impacted operating margin by 100 basis points. The pretax gain and related tax benefit impacted EPS by $0.25. 
Our balance sheet and cash flow remains strong. Our leverage calculation for our credit facility definition was 1.6x debt to EBITDA. We have an untapped credit facility of $1 billion. For financial modeling purposes, please note that there is 1 more workday in our fiscal '21 than in our fiscal '20. 1 more day will benefit fiscal '21 total revenue growth by 40 basis points. 1 more workday also benefits operating margin and EPS. Fiscal '21 operating margin will be about 12.5 basis points better in comparison to fiscal '20 due to 1 more day of revenue. 
In fiscal '20, each quarter contained 65 workdays. In fiscal '21, workdays by quarter are 66 in Q1, 65 in Q2, 64 in Q3 and 66 in Q4. Please keep these differences in mind when modeling on a year-over-year and sequential basis. 
I'll now turn the call over to Todd Schneider to discuss the performance of each of our businesses."

As Scott stated, COVID-19 remains a significant disruption to the economy. Every business in U.S. and Canada has been impacted. Many of our customers that have remained open are not yet operating at the same level of business as before the pandemic started because of the virus' negative impact on health and the economy. 
Our employee partners continue to work with urgency to offset these headwinds. Over the past couple of quarters, we have provided some examples of their interactions with both new and existing customers to give a better understanding. Many of those examples highlighted customers in the industries of health care, education and state and local government and products and services, including scrubs, hand sanitizer service and masks. 
During the second quarter of the fiscal year, the amount of Uniform Rental and Facility Services new business sold to health care, education and government customers is double the amount in the prior year period. And the amount of first aid, fire and other new businesses sold to customers in health care, education and government is 6x the amount sold in the same period last year. And some of this new business is reoccurring and some may not repeat. 
Nevertheless, the results are really impressive. Also, the number of scrub dispensing machines installed in our first 2 quarters doubled last year's number. And since the virus appeared, our employee partners have provided businesses with over 350,000 hand sanitizer dispensers and over 125 million masks. I'm truly in awe of the accomplishments of our team in this challenging time, and I'm excited about the opportunities for Cintas post pandemic, which seems to be finally appearing on the horizon. 
With that, I'll turn now to the second quarter financial performance of our businesses. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, health care scrubs, masks and towels in the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. This segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. 
Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.41 billion compared to $1.47 billion last year. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 47.5% for the second quarter compared to 46.6% in last year's second quarter. Higher inventory amortization expense of 80 basis points was more than offset by the benefits of lower production and service expense as a percent of revenue. 
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products, personal protective equipment and training. This segment's revenue for the second quarter was $194.4 million compared to $169.7 million last year. The First Aid segment gross margin was 43.0% in the second quarter compared to 48.4% in last year's second quarter. 
Lower production and service expenses as a percent of revenue compared to last year's second quarter were more than offset by higher cost of goods sold from the increased proportion of revenue from personal protective equipment, such as masks and gloves. 
Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sales businesses are reported in the All Other category. Our fire business historically grows each year at a strong pace. Uniform Direct Sales business growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, just as when we install a multimillion-dollar account. Uniform Direct Sales, however, is a key business for us and its customers are often significant opportunities to cross-sell and provide products and services from our other business units. 
All Other revenue was $152.1 million compared to $204.1 million last year. The fire business organic revenue declined 3.3% due to the inability to access some businesses because of closures. Uniform Direct Sales business organic revenue declined 51.2%. Revenue from our airline, cruise line, hospitality and gaming customers largely falls within this segment. These industries continue to be among the hardest hit by the pandemic. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We're happy to answer your questions."

And it's important to note that about mid-November, we did see the impact of some of the state's restrictions on businesses. I would say it affected the trend, but it  hadn't turned it worse than it had been at that point. So it's a little unpredictable on where it goes. But as you can see, through the month of November, we continued on a positive trend. I think second quarter revenue sequentially grew about 2.7% over the first quarter."

Even within the health care space, there are -- if you define a no programmer as somebody who doesn't have a rental program. Most of the scrubs that you see in hospitals are direct sale type scrubs, some of them bought by individual health care workers, some by the hospital for departments and things like that. But converting them to a rental program, we would call a conversion of a no programmer. 
The other area that we're seeing in health care that's doing really well are isolation gowns. Those are traditionally direct sale disposable gowns. And we have a rentable alternative that actually saves the hospitals and health care providers money to convert from a direct sale program to a rental program. So we're seeing a lot of success in that as well. And that would be what we would consider a no programmer conversion within health care."

Our no programmer as a business as a percent of our total remains quite consistent. What is changing is it is allowing us to get audiences, the folks, customers and prospects that we haven't had in the past in many cases because of the access we have to critical products and services that they need to provide to their business and within their business to either their customers or to their employees, both. So that they can have confidence to come to work and for people to come into their business. 
Scott spoke about some in the medical area have been very successful, the isolation gowns, hands sanitizer, sanitizer wipes, disinfectant wipes, scrubs, are all -- are seeing great demand. Scott mentioned that the isolation gowns were -- that was virtually -- almost the entire market was a direct purchase market -- purchase disposable market, probably the best way to describe it. 
And what we've done with isolation gowns has been very attractive to our prospects and our customers. It's a green service, right? We're not just throwing it in the trash, we're using it. It saves them significant money. The availability of them instead of folks struggling to get isolation gowns and being panicked over trying to take care of their patients. What we -- the garments that we're providing are more comfortable than what they've been wearing in the past. 
And then lastly, we brought some technology to that business so that we can track exactly how many times those garments have been processed so that we can meet the specifications that are detailed out for such a product. So that's been a big win. And a lot of health care customers are very, very interested in that. And we mentioned in our previous earnings release that the demand for scrubs has been up very nicely. 
People are uncomfortable, in many cases, wearing those home, washing those at home and whom they come in contact with on the way to home makes people a little uncomfortable. So all that has been quite good demand. In those cases, we consider there's no programmers. We might be doing some business with those health care organizations, but we're expanding that relationship dramatically."

The geographies depend on what type of or if there are any restrictions in place. And what we have seen so far is, as we got through the end of November, an increase in the number of states and municipalities that have put restrictions in place. We don't know whether that trend is going to continue through the holidays. And just as an example, Governor Newsom in California put the restrictions in place, they're pretty tight, but he says that they will extend to January 4. The question that we have there is, will he extend that further, which has been his tendency? Or will it actually be January 4 when he starts to loosen those restrictions? 
So those states are the -- and municipalities are the areas where we've seen the change since about mid-November. And my perspective is that we are in a temporary lull. We don't think it's going to be anywhere near what it was in our fourth quarter last year. Quite honestly, at that point, nobody, including governors and people running businesses, had any idea how bad it was going to be, how deep it was going to go and so forth. 
But now that we've got 8 or 9 months' worth of experience in dealing with it and the fact that we have vaccines beginning to roll out right now, there's light at the end of the tunnel. This is a temporary period of time that we're going to go through. And so that, I hope provides a little color to you. I'm happy to get more specific in any area if you have any questions."

Yes, Mario, I would say, in the health care market, depends upon what area within the health care area, acute, nonacute; even, frankly, into what department you're speaking of. But generally speaking, iso gowns, scrubs, et cetera, those are direct purchase market. In the case of iso gown disposable, the most common way people procure those products, linen companies certainly are in that space, those who provide services to those types of customers. 
But if I -- generally I'd describe it to be it's a direct purchase or disposable market with any reusables would be traditionally with a linen type companies would be the most common experience. 
As far as the scrub dispensing, it's been going extremely well for our business and our customers. The demand is there because it's a -- well, I think most people can see the experience where you go into a grocery store and you see people wearing scrubs, right? And those belong to the hospital normally. And what happens is because folks struggle to get an access to scrub, they tend to hoard them. And as they hoard them, then they have to buy more scrubs. And when they do that, and they're in that tough situation, they tend to buy the cheapest scrub they can because they end up disappearing. 
And we completely change the value proposition there. We provide a scrub that people want to wear, not just have to wear. It's comfortable, attractive. And we're continuing to invest in that area and come out with better technology around the fabrics, et cetera. And it makes it completely accessible, meaning there's a complete accountability. So when you want a scrub, you can get it. You have complete access and then it's laundered for you, so they don't have to take it home. So it has been really attractive for our health care customers. And as I mentioned in the opening remarks, we've installed twice the amount of scrubs that we did last year at the same time so far through Q2. So great momentum, and we're very encouraged."

And so I think the thing that's helpful to you all to understand is that it is really difficult, and I don't know that it's even a concept that a traditional direct sale competitor would even consider would be to try and develop a laundry service to do that. 
So we're providing a unique opportunity for a customer to convert to a rental program where the traditional competition can't. They don't have the ability to do that. And that is a big, significant competitive advantage for us versus the traditional supplier. That -- and we believe that because of the technology we brought, the scrub machines, the dispensing units that keep inventory tracking and our ability to control how often an isolation gown is processed before we pull it out of service, these are the kind of things that for traditional competition, they can't do. 
Relative to other rental companies, that would be linen companies and uniform rental companies, we've been in this for a long time. We have trained salespeople and service providers that specialize in the health care market. And we think we have a multiyear head start on what you would probably consider to be our traditional rental competitor.

Let's -- we'll talk competitive, maybe competitive behavior and pricing. We have seen some aggressive pricing in the marketplace. I think that as competition sees their business, existing customer base have issues and decline in revenue, they typically get aggressive with pricing. I don't think this is anything that we haven't seen in the past relative to lowball prices and competition trying to take big business from us. 
And that's a market-by-market type of an environment, and it could be in any particular market, the small players or one of the big national players in that market that decide they need to do something to try to win some accounts. Relative to overall pricing though, while we have had to adjust prices on fluctuating items like gloves and face masks and hand sanitizer and the PPE kind of things, as our cost increased trying to get those products, we have had to adjust prices upward on those items. 
For our recurring revenue, across all of our businesses really, we have not increased prices during the pandemic, and in fact, for -- as a general statement, particularly in the rental division. But we haven't increased our prices to our customers in about 1.5 years, and that's a strategic decision on our part. We don't think that during a global pandemic, it's the right time to be raising prices. And I think that's one element of why we've seen our Net Promoter Scores, how we measure customer satisfaction, be impacted to the positive. And so that's our position on pricing at this point."

So we wanted to take the appropriate approach. Scott mentioned that it's showing up in our customer satisfaction scores, which we track via Net Promoter Scores. And we look at it as what's the lifetime value of those customers, and we want to have those customers for a lifetime and not take a short-term approach. And I think, again, that's showing up in our Net Promoter Scores, and I think it's going to show up long term in how customers look at us."

From time to time, we do see an issue with a competitor, and we'll react accordingly in -- on a customer-by-customer, prospect-by-prospect basis, if you will, relative to that. I don't know that it's -- because of the -- it's still a little uncertain in where this is all going to go and how quickly it's going to end, different opinions on that. But I do think that it could provide a future opportunity for acquisitions. I think that there would probably be a desire on the part of a potential seller to try to get their revenue back to where it was pre-COVID to have something larger to sell. But with that, we'll deal with those kind of situations as they come up. But that is obviously an opportunity for us as well."

I mean the thing that most investors will look back and think about Cintas and how you managed through this and seeing your margin percentage go up despite the revenues declining. 
And so Mike, I guess the question as we look ahead from really just high levels I'm looking for here, as we're almost about to annualize the COVID comps, if you will, how should we be thinking about the margins? I mean you guys have articulated the [ driving home ] discretionary, 100 basis points last quarter, 40 this quarter of benefit. But are there other buckets out there that could [ the ] margin headwinds as you hit the year and annualize the COVID things? I don't know, things like incentive compensation, I don't know, fuel prices, other things that might have to come back in on the production side of things?

And I think there will be permanent savings on some of those things. There will be some of that comes back, but I don't think we're going to see 100 basis points of movement in something like that. 
And so as we look forward, Andrew, I would say this, we're -- we want to grow over the course of the long term. We will continue to staff revenue-producing positions to prepare ourselves to grow, and that may mean a little bit more bench in our service departments and in our sales departments. And that will probably create a little bit of additional spending. 
But having said that, Scott's managed the business very, very well in this period of time, and I would expect that, that is going to continue. We will continue to be very, very cognizant of our margins and our costs and recognizing that our goal is to continue to see very healthy incremental margins.

I think that we're going to probably see CapEx remain below historical levels until we get through the COVID crisis and the economy recovers. But I'd still say that even today, we're probably spending CapEx at a 60% growth, 40% maintenance level. So -- but I just think it's going to be lower until we get through this. Everybody is a little more cautious and that's sort of thing. 
Relative to inventory, it's important that I think we make the statement that we are doing the best job that we can to manage the supply chain and the supply of these hard-to-get items with the demand that we're seeing from our customer base. And that's the primary reason you're seeing an increase in this inventory. I don't believe that we're going to see a sudden drop off in the need for these products. I think it will be a slow, steady decline, and we'll have some view on that as the economy recovers and as COVID vaccines continue to roll out. 
Many of these are going to be around at a higher level than pre COVID for a long, long time. And so we're -- we haven't seen any issues with slow-moving inventory at this point or anything like that. But I will tell you that the fact that we have been able to bring these products into inventory the way that we have has been a huge competitive advantage for us in the marketplace, where because we might have masks or gloves or hand sanitizer, prospects who ordinarily have not been doing business with us listen to and react to our ability to provide them with these COVID-related products and then also listen to what else we can do for them. 
And so it might be a call where a company is interested in hand sanitizer, and we wind up after our sales rep is out talking to them where they're putting 10 people in uniform and restroom supplies in the restroom and entrance mats and mops and cleaning chemicals and so forth, in addition to the hand sanitizer. So it's been a big competitive advantage for us as we've gone through this process, and I think one of the reasons why our NPS, customer satisfaction scores are up as well as we're seeing very robust new business results. So I think the balance sheet that we have has allowed us to be able to make that investment. Our supply chain has done a great job in sourcing it. And I think that it's reflected in our ability to sell new accounts and satisfy our customers."

And I think that will -- similar to what happens with the rest of the economy and what happens with the rental division, we'll see that recover in a similar fashion. 
Relative to the Direct Sale business, a good portion of that business goes into hospitality and travel-related areas. That's a little murkier, and I think that -- those are hotels, airlines, cruise ships, casinos and food service and that sort of segment. So those are going to be, I think, the longer tail from a recovery standpoint, but I think that there will be a day coming where they're going to get a pretty good bump. 
I think there is a -- in my personal opinion, a huge amount of pent-up demand for people to be able to go back on vacation, to stay in a hotel, to feel safe when they get on an airplane and that sort of thing. And there's a point at which when the vaccines have been rolled out to perhaps reach herd immunity. You can see airlines throw in some special rates at travelers to welcome them back, hotels and resorts doing the same kind of thing. I think you can see Las Vegas doing everything that they can to get their customers to come back. And who knows that -- maybe that's early next summer, depending on the rate of vaccinations and things like that. But if it's going to work in those businesses, it's also going to work in other businesses. People are going to be able to go back out to their restaurants and their movie theaters locally and maybe go to the concert venue and do the social things that -- bars and do the social things that they're missing right now. 
And I think that, that is coming. When it happens, we need a little bit more time to understand the rate of rollout for the vaccines.

We'd evaluate them pretty heavily right now, just to make sure we understand how well that particular business is doing. 
But we would be acquisitive if we could find the right deal, the right business at the right price. I think that -- as I said earlier, I think there is an element of concern on the seller's part if their revenue is below where it was pre-COVID that they're going to get out of the business what they need to get out of the business should they sell it. And so there may be a little bit of a lull there. But I think as the economy continues to pick up, we'll probably see M&A activity pick up. And if that's the case, we sure would like to be a player there."

But there have been some new lockdowns and potential for more so that's your reservation for not providing the 3Q guidance. Just -- is that fair? 
And what do you see directionally, I guess, as the range of revenue growth scenarios? Is it better than 4Q on the downside, but better than this quarter on the upside?

Let me try to explain it this way. We're in a -- I think that it's the timing of our quarter and therefore, this call that are causing part of the problem that there is so much uncertainty right now as we look out over the next several weeks, couple of months, few months, maybe. And it's everything from the rising counts of the virus, we have governments putting more restrictions in place. 
And as of today, I don't know whether more governors and mayors are going to do that, whether they're not going to do that, how long those restrictions are going to stay in place based on the ones that have put these things in place so far. We have a typical period between Christmas and New Year's where traditionally, we have a group of customers close down their facilities for the holidays anyway. We don't know this year whether that means they're going to extend that or not. And so that causes a little bit of cloudiness. 
We've got an election in Georgia coming up in a few weeks that will determine what happens in the Senate. And so there's a lot of uncertainty. When we sat down and talked about it, we said, ""Well, let's put a range together."" But when we started to put a range together, we started saying, well, what if this happens and what if that happens? And those would be things like what if a governor or a group of governors decided, well, the vaccine is 3 months away, let's leave these restrictions in place for the next 3 months. What does that do to our ability to predict what our low end of the range might be? 
What if that doesn't happen? What if Governor Newsom actually does open up California's economy back up January the 4th? So it became such a wide range that we decided it didn't make sense for you. Our impression of -- and I don't want to -- I hope you take this the right way. But our impression is that one of the things that you like about our company is that we're pretty predictable. And when we give guidance, you can pretty much determine in your models what that means relative to what you think is going to happen. 
In this particular case, we don't think that what we would provide for you would allow you to do that, that you might wind up with some big swings with -- depending on your positive or negative approach, depending on what you think is going to happen in the economy. And therefore, we decided it didn't make sense for us in this period of time to do that. 
I do not believe, this is my personal opinion, that it will be anything near like what happened in the fourth quarter for us. That was brand new. And I think there were 38 states that put shelter-in-place orders in place in a short period of time. We haven't seen that. I don't think -- I don't expect that that's going to happen at this point it moving forward. Might it? Maybe. My personal opinion is that won't happen. Therefore, I don't see that as the eventual downside of what's going to happen. The upside could be that the  number of cases begin to subside, that mayors and governors begin to open their economies back up in anticipation of vaccinated progress and so forth. 
But I do know this, with the vaccines rolling out -- I can't predict the rate yet, I need a better understanding of what that is going to be. But with those vaccines rolling out, fewer and fewer governments are going to put restrictive orders in place. And eventually, those economies in those states and municipalities are going to begin to recover at a pretty good rate. Is that in our fourth quarter? I'd love to see that. Is it next summer? Highly likely that by next summer, some point next summer, we're going to be in that position. But that's my view of it. And so I'll end with that."

We mentioned in our most recent quarterly release that customers when they buy large orders of PPE, whether it's a government, a school system, it could be health care, it could be up and down the street business, they tend to make a large buy and then they go into maintenance mode from there. 
And some of those large buys were in our Q1. There were some in Q2. Some of those that bought in Q1 are now in maintenance mode, and we're in Q2. So it's a real mix.
