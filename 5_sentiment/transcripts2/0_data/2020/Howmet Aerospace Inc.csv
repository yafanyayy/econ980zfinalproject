A lot of ground to cover today, and I do recognize that we have lots of moving parts between the cost reductions, performance program, restructuring, asset sales, the share count movement, aluminum metal assumption and then finally, Boeing MAX. And I intend to provide as much visibility into these as possible. I plan to cover the quarter and full year performance and the results of these major priorities and then move on to discuss the approach that we've taken to the 2020 outlook. 
Let's start on Slide 4. Today, we are announcing that we are targeting the separation to take effect on the 1st of April. The majority of the work has been complete. We're on track with all separation steps. The planned operating date for the 2 future companies is next week, 1st of February, and the legal into the 2 listed future public companies is April 1. 
Regarding the strategic priorities, including capital structure, capital allocation and financial outlooks for the 2 future companies, we're targeting an Investor Day on February 25 in New York for both companies. 
Let's move on to Slide 5 to cover the fourth quarter results. The results were solid. We had record fourth quarter performance for operating income, excluding special items, and record operating margins and earnings per share. Operating income, excluding special items, was [ $444  ] million, and the effective tax rate was 29.7%. This was an unusually high number for tax at the prior quarters and driven essentially by the geography of earnings. 
In the quarter, engineered products and forgings year-over-year operating margin expanded 480 basis points, while GRP expanded by 370 basis points. Both EP&F and GRP demonstrated progression in year-over-year margin for every quarter this year and in EP&F sequential [indiscernible] quarter. Fourth quarter earnings per share was $0.53, up 61% year-over-year and at the maximum end of our guidance range. Earnings per share for the year was [ at ] $2.11 and up 55% year-over-year. Free cash flow was $870 million, up 87% year-over-year. And this exceeded the midpoint of guidance by $120 million and has made a very meaningful improvement in free cash flow for Arconic from prior years and achieved a free cash flow conversion of 90% of net income. Please note -- note that the free cash flow conversion guidance I provided for the 2 separated companies at the time of the last earnings call. 
The year-end cash balance was $1.7 billion after $1.15 billion of share repurchases and the repayment of $400 million in convertible notes. The $1.15 billion of share repurchases included a fourth quarter market share repurchase of 1.6 million shares. For the year, we repurchased approximately 55 million common shares at a weighted average price of $20.97. This leaves open share purchase authority of $350 million, which will carry over into the future Howmet company, if not utilized before separation. 
Net debt-to-EBITDA was 1.81x, which was a record low and an improvement from fourth quarter 2018, which was 2.05x. And lastly, cash return on net assets, improved year-over-year by 450 basis points to 13.7%, another record. 
Now let me turn it over to Ken to provide a more detailed view of Q4 and the year."
416264458,650836869,1894079,"Arconic Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2020",2020-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Howmet Aerospace Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. Now let's move to Slide 6, financial results for the quarter. In the fourth quarter, organic revenue was up $38 million year-over-year with EP&F up 2% and GRP flat. EP&F had 5% organic growth in aerospace, which represents more than 70%",1603,"Thank you, John. 
Now let's move to Slide 6, financial results for the quarter. In the fourth quarter, organic revenue was up $38 million year-over-year with EP&F up 2% and GRP flat. EP&F had 5% organic growth in aerospace, which represents more than 70% of its revenue, while commercial transportation declined 8%. GRP was flat as industrial products had 21% organic growth; packaging, 6%; and aerospace 3%. These increases were offset by a decline in automotive of 9% with the Ford F-150 is transitioning to the next-generation model, and we had lower volumes due to the GM strike. Building action was down 8% due to softness in Europe and intentional exits of less profitable products. 
Operating income, excluding special items for the fourth quarter, was $444 million, up 37% year-over-year. We delivered the fourth consecutive quarter of price increases with a $42 million favorable impact year-over-year. Price increases span across both segments, driven by aerospace, industrial and commercial transportation. And we expect favorable pricing to continue. 
Weakness in our automotive and commercial transportation markets unfavorably impacted operating income by $29 in the fourth quarter. Favorable raw material costs, including aluminum price, was a benefit to operating income of $34 million in the quarter. Similar to price, we had our fourth [ consecutive ] quarter of net cost reductions. Net cost reductions were led by cost-out program, which generated $76 million of year-over-year benefit in the quarter. This was partially offset by higher variable compensation  and equity costs, which were driven by improved performance on profit, free cash flow and equity value. As expected, the transition of our Tennessee plant to more profitable industrial products showed a year-over-year improvement in the fourth quarter. The impact was $13 million. We have included the reconciliation of operating income, excluding special items, on Slide 35 of the appendix. 
In the fourth quarter, adjusted free cash flow was a record at $728 million or $250 million more than the fourth quarter of last year. Please note, consistent with our guidance, we have excluded $2 million of unfavorable cash flow in the quarter related to planned separation. 
Days working capital improved 1 day on a year-over-year basis to 43 days with the main driver being collections. The year-over-year cash improvement was $103 million. Pension contributions and OPEB payments were $69 million in the quarter, which was $38 million more than the fourth quarter of 2018. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $167 million, which was down $104 million on a year-over-year basis. The diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.53 per share and 61% higher than the comparable period. The higher diluted earnings per share were primarily driven by operational improvements of $0.13, lower share count of $0.05 and lower raw material costs of $0.05. 
Now let's move to the year-over-year margin expansion on Slide 7. In the fourth quarter, Arconic's margin improved 380 basis points on a year-over-year basis, while EP&F improved 480 basis points, and GRP improved 370 basis points. It is noteworthy that the year-over-year margin expansion has improved each quarter in 2019. This improvement reflects the trajectory of ongoing operational improvements, improved pricing and cost reductions. 
Now let's move to the special item summary on Slide 8. In the fourth quarter, our reported results included a net favorable impact of $75 million in special items. The special items in the quarter primarily related to 3 items. First, we recorded a $94 million tax benefit related to a U.S. tax election, which caused the liquidation of a foreign subsidiaries assets into our U.S. tax parent. The second special item was a cash charge of $34 million associated with the planned separation. Third, we received $21 million in closing cash related to an earn-out associated with the Texarcana plant that was sold in the fourth quarter of 2018. I would point out loss in cried in the quarter for legal and other advisory fees related to Grenfell Tower and the fire at our fasteners plant in France were largely offset by related proceeds. More details concerning special items for the quarter can be found on Slides 28, 29 and 35 appendix. For the year, the majority of the special items have been consistent with the stated plan of divesting assets or businesses that do not fit our focus, require significant capital investment with unacceptable returns or are not material to our bottom line. As you would expect, approximately [ 1%  ] of the charges for the year were noncash. 
Now let's move to the segment results on Slide 9. In the fourth quarter, EP&S revenue was $1.7 billion. Organic revenue was up 2%. Segment operating profit was a record for the quarter at $354 million, up 32%. The increase in segment operating profit was driven by several favorable items, including volume growth in aerospace, higher pricing, lower raw material costs and net cost reductions. The resulting segment operating margin expanded by 480 basis points year-over-year to 20.4%. 
In the fourth quarter, GRP's revenue was also $1.7 billion. Organic revenue was flat year-over-year. Segment operating profit was a record for the fourth quarter at $150 million, up 61%. A favorable over year improvement in the segment operating profit was driven by favorable pricing in the industrial and commercial transportation markets, lower aluminum prices, net cost reductions and improvement in internal scrap utilization. The Tennessee transition to industrial products helped offset the declines in automotive and commercial transportation. Despite the challenges in aluminum extrusions and flat organic revenue growth, GRP segment operating margin increased 370 basis points year-over-year to 9%. 
I move to the fourth quarter key achievements on Slide 10. Our EP&F business had record fourth quarter revenue and segment operating profit on a year-over-year basis. Aerospace organic revenue was up 5%. Favorable pricing improvements in EP&F continued in the fourth quarter as we achieved $29 million in year-over-year price increases. For the year, price improvements in the segment were $78 million. Finally, in EP&F, our expansion of the aerospace [indiscernible] aerospace rings and forged wheels, capital expenditures are complete and ramping up in 2020. 
Our GRP business had record fourth quarter segment operating profit. GRP's industrial revenue was up 20% organically year-over-year. Price improvements in industrial products and commercial transportations drove $13 million of year-over-year price increases. For the year, price improvement in the segment were $75 million. GRP's internal scrap utilization improved 180 basis points versus the same quarter of last year. On a full year, free cash cash flow of $870 million resulted in a free cash flow conversion of 90%. Return on net assets for the year was 13.7%, was up 450 basis points year-over-year. CapEx for the year was $579 million, approximately 4% of revenue and was down $189 million year-over-year. Approximately 65% of the CapEx was spent on return-seeking projects. A majority of our growth CapEx projects are now complete, and we expect CapEx as a percent of revenue to be less than 4% in 2020. Our cash balance was approximately $1.7 billion after we repurchased $1.15 billion of outstanding shares and paid down approximately $400 million of debt. 
Now let's move to Slide 11 and the key financial results for the year. For the year, organic revenue was up $894 million with both EP&F and GRP up 6%. EP&F had 8% organic growth in aerospace and 4% growth in commercial transportation. GRP's organic revenue increase was driven by double-digit growth in aerospace, industrial products and packaging. Operating income, excluding special items for the year, was $1.8 billion, up 29% year-over-year. Price increases were $153 million for the year and split almost equally across the segments. Higher volumes also favorably impacted operating income by $80 million for the year, mainly driven by aerospace. Lower raw material costs, including aluminum price, was favorable to operating income, $99 million for the year. Net cost reductions were led by the cost-out program, which generated approximately $213 million of year-over-year savings. This was partially offset by 3 items: the train our Tennessee plant, operational challenges at one of our aluminum extrusion plants and higher compensation costs driven by improved performance. 
Adjusted free cash flow in 2019 was $870 million or $405 million more than 2018. Pension contributions and OPEB payments were $345 million, which was $33 million less than 2018. At year-end, a pension and OPEB net liability was approximately $3.2 billion, up approximately $200 million year-over-year as lower discount rates impacted the liability by approximately $900 million. U.S. pension asset returns were approximately 20%, and these returns partially offset the impact of the lower discount rate. Capital expenditures for the year were $579 million, which were down $189 million compared to 2018, while making significant investment in aerospace airfoils, aerospace rings, forged wheels and industrial products. 
Diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, was $2.11 per share and 55% higher than 2018. The higher diluted earnings per share were primarily driven by operational improvements of $0.47, lower raw material costs of $0.15 and lower share count of $0.12. 
Before turning it back over to John, let me briefly provide an update on our capital structure, which is on Slide '19 in the appendix. We finished the year with approximately $1.7 billion of cash after executing the $1.15 billion of share repurchases and reducing debt by $400 million. Gross debt is approximately $5.9 billion, and net debt stands at $4.2 billion. Net debt-to-EBITDA continues to improve year-over-year despite the cash outflow associated with the share repurchases. Net debt-to-EBITDA stands at 1.81x, which is an improvement of 12% compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. 
With that, I will turn it back over to John."
416264458,650836869,1894079,"Arconic Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2020",2020-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Howmet Aerospace Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ken, and let's move to Slide 12 where I'll give you the results of the key focus items.

Price increases for the year were $153 million, and we saw good progress at both EP&F and GRP. Operating cost reductions were $213 million for the year and ahead of our annual commitment of $180 million. The annual run rate operating costs are projected to be reduced by $300 million, which is a full $100 million higher than our original commitment. 
As a result of the share repurchases, which are detailed on the slide, year-end diluted common stock share count was 440 million shares, down 13% year-on-year. Capital expenditure was $579 million, excluding $7 million associated with separation. CapEx was approximately 4% of revenue. The major focus of our 2019 capital expenditures was the expansion of airfoils and rings capacity in the engine business, the European wheels expansion and the Tennessee industrial expansion in rolled products. 
Annual divestiture of proceeds of approximately $190 million are expected to exceed the operating and CapEx cash cost of separation. Divestitures signed or closed will reduce annual revenue by approximately $350 million with limited operating income impact. Two previously announced transactions will close in the first quarter of 2020 with proceeds of approximately $100 million. 
Now let me move to separation. We're targeting separation for the 1st of April. We filed an amendment to the Form 10 on the 22nd of January, where we provided greater visibility into management, capital structure and pension allocation. The next step is the financing of Arconic Corp.'s spin entity. This financing commences today and is planned for completion by February 10. The Form 10 is planned to be made effective by mid-February. The planned operating date for the 2 companies is the 1st of February, where everything will be done by the 2 entities and legal separation into the 2 listed future public companies on the 1st of April. This will have accomplished a rapid execution of separation from the time that I announced the plan upon taking the CEO role in February 2019. 
One last but very important item on separation is related to pension plans. The separation does not trigger any incremental cash contributions. 
Let's move to Slide 13. As you know, this earnings call precedes the Boeing call, which, while it's not ideal, is important in effecting the separation timing and the debt financing starting this afternoon. We have had many exchanges with Boeing during late December and every week throughout January and, hence, have a reasonable feel for their current plan in 2020. Naturally, I will not provide any details of those conversations, except to guide the Arconic numbers. 
Today, I will provide Q1 and earnings per share guidance numbers plus a view of revenue and free cash flow for Arconic. At our February Investor Day, I will provide additional insight into Howmet Aerospace and new Arconic Corp., which naturally will be of more interest going forward. The split, as stated, is set for the 1st of April, and hence, by achieving this early timing, we will be able to see 3 clean quarters in 2020. 
Now let me turn to the specific numbers, but noting, firstly, that given the uncertainty to that, which Boeing will exactly announce and future increases in production plans, this causes me to provide a wider bandwidth of guidance than would be normal. Revenue is targeted to be in the range of $13.9 billion to $14.2 billion, with organic growth in the range of 1% to 3%. Aerospace revenue is expected to increase year-over-year when we exclude the Boeing 737 MAX situation. If we were to include the impacts of the 737 MAX, aerospace revenue is expected to be flat year-over-year. We expect continued aerospace price increases in 2020 and growth year-over-year in industrial products, driven by the transition of our Tennessee plant into more profitable industrial products. Commercial transportation is expected to experience headwinds in 2020, driven by slowing manufacturing and freight growth, lower new truck orders and the increased current inventory levels. We are targeting to mitigate those margin impacts for our forged wheels business by gaining market share, supported by our differentiated lighter weight products. We continue to penetrate the steel wheel market with aluminum wheels. Moreover, our low-cost manufacturing wheels expansion in Hungary is now fully operational, and we will leverage our global footprint. The global rolled products business will mitigate commercial transportation headwinds with cost reduction actions. 
Earnings per share, excluding special items, is expected to be in the range of $2.22 to $2.42 per share. At the midpoint, year-over-year growth is approximately 10%, and including our current view of the impacts of the 737 MAX. Year-over-year growth in earnings per share will be driven by run rate cost reductions actioned in 2019 as well as incremental cost reductions in 2020, plus the continued price increases. Earnings per share for the first quarter is expected to be $0.47 to $0.53, which is an increase of approximately 16% year-over-year at the midpoint. Adjusted free cash flow forecast is to be between $800 million and $900 million, driven by earnings, capital expenditures of less than 4% of revenue and favorable year-over-year restructuring payments. Pension and OPEB cash contributions are expected to be approximately $220 million higher than in 2019, driven by the drop in the discount rate. Free cash flow conversion is expected to be 80% with greater detail to provided at Investor Day on February 25. 
Finally, regarding Grenfell, there has been no activity this quarter, and nothing has changed regarding our stance towards the matter nor our view of the expected outcomes of the litigation or liability. 
And with that, I'd like to open the line for your questions."

And, in fact, on any earnings call, I've never provided chipset values. I've read -- I'll say guesstimates in analyst reports, which I say probably aren't too far. I don't really want to give specificity of what the chipset value and what the margins are by any aircraft because the next question to follow will be on the next aircraft and the next aircraft, and I feel disinclined to do that at this point. 
What I would say to you is our assumption is we've got about a $400 million revenue hit, plus or minus, for the MAX. I've tried to take a fairly conservative view to guidance, especially in the light of -- it's only when we actually know what the Boeing published position is that I think we can be -- have that greater certainty. And then how we address our cost structures, we've made assumptions. And in particular of importance to us is what will be the profile exactly of the future Boeing build both in 2020 and really importantly, in 2021 because the -- while it's, I'm going to say, relatively easy to shed labor, getting the sort of skills back given the, I'll say, very high employment level in the U.S. -- I mean, those are all things which are really important for us to consider. And so you've got to see the whole thing and then also how the Boeing position evolves over time. I mean, what we've seen, as you know, over the last 6 or 9 months is fairly -- what has resulted in fairly optimistic assumptions, and we've seen many changes to those. And now we're in a situation where the production is currently halted with a view to restart and what's now viewed as a fairly conservative assumption regarding when the FAA will release the aircraft and according to statements made in the last week by the Chairman of the FAA. 
So I mean, all I can say is it's pretty confusing. And when we have that greater clarity -- and I tend to be in the optimistic camp, but at some point, the aircraft production may rise above what we think it is, and therefore, we need to be prepared for that. And how we manage labor is critical to it, what the carrying cost of that is and what we've built into the assumptions. And that's why guidance itself is particularly difficult at this point in time. But neither I've given you something that I don't feel confident in our ability to achieve, and I did call out the fact that provided a little bit wider guidance than normal to take account of some of this uncertainty. And clearly, we're going to be updating you as we go through the year. We're going to give you further updates, hopefully, on the Investor Day on February 25. And as the -- I'd say the clarity emerges -- and tried to give you color of how we've approached this whole situation and the fact that we're having to come out really a little bit earlier than normal just to effect the financing that we're in the market for starting this afternoon and the labeling that, I'll say, debt raise to occur to meet the separation timing. So all these things are pretty much interlinked and I guess, preferably, I'd have been 1 week or 2 later. But the most important thing for the company was to achieve, I believe, the earliest possible separation timing. So hopefully, that gives you a pretty wide view of where we've been thinking on this and how we approach it, David."

The trials and the initial production has commenced for each of those assets. And in fact, first shipments occurred in December, obviously, in small numbers. Those assets, in particular, say, the airfoil assets will see significant increased production in the first half of 2020. And they were not -- those investments were not there solely for the LEAP engine. It's going to provide and capacity relief for many of the -- for the airfoil and ring programs that we have. And so I see those assets coming on progressively during the year. Shipping increasing quantities quarter-by-quarter. By the time we get to the exit rate of the end of the year, I'll say, everything will be, I think, running, I expect to be running at a very high capacity utilization but still leaving something left for 2021 as we also increase our normal productivity programs.

And when we have greater clarity regarding the production, when indeed Boeing themselves have greater clarity regarding production, and I've commented that -- because we have seen a lot of noise and different assumptions. And then critical to that decision, the final of how much we're going to flex labor, both the direct and indirect labor and cost structure is going to be our view of to 2021. And if we feel as though -- and if we clear that the production is going to become much more healthy in '21 and potentially with upside, then that's going to affect and color our views about our willingness to hold labor or not. And if we're not thinking positively, then we're going to -- I'm going to call die for the floor and just got the cost structure as necessary because that's what we should do as good custodians of shareholders' money.

The -- in the early part of the year, I'm thinking that the opportunity that we have in discussion with GE around the ability to bring forward and build some of the spare engines is going to be important, both to cushion their production and our production to have a smoother approach to this because, while it's difficult to move production up and down on, let's call it, the structural side of the aircraft, but on the engine side, you flex up and down at your apparel. And if we were to cut that, then try to rebuild it back to a number of 42 or 52  or 57, then that will become almost impossible, not just for Arconic but for the whole of the industry. So that does not flex -- this is a matter of production, I'll say, difficulty and complexity, that doesn't flex anything like the structural side even though neither sides are difficult. And therefore, what we are thinking about is with, I'll say, some of the spares, clearance and building of spare engines, which I believe is being considered and planned, that should help smoothe the year and, in particular, provide the ability to move engine production back up again as we move into 2021. But again, it's cloudy. I wish it were -- we had greater clarity of what exactly those builds will be for the next 24 months and beyond. But we don't, so we -- living in this world that we inhabit and so at the moment, obviously, we're cushioning it, both ourselves and within GE and then seeing how we can manage the overall production, both with a view of both the material inputs for the specialty metals and also the critical skills that we have in that business."

It's not really very easy for us to suddenly flip and say, ""Oh, let's go make a few more Airbus parts."" It doesn't really work like that. 
The constraint around tooling and then, I'll say, specific specialty alloy requirements is such that you don't say, ""Well, we're making less of these, and then so we can flip it up and make more of those."" We do see Airbus trying to make more, and we see -- decide build more engines, and that will be great, and that will be also for the turbofan, but we know that some of the issues there, which we can read about recently in India. So it isn't as though that capacity is fungible. You move it to somewhere else. It really doesn't work like that. 
Clearly, if it's a roll sheet and that was there, but the aircraft itself is constrained by many other factors. So it just doesn't -- you can't say it's a $400 million, but that's now -- it's going offset by $100 million or so we can go sell elsewhere. 
So hopefully, that gives you that one. And what was the second part of your question?"

And then I'm not going to comment on which month they said that they will recommence. That's not for me to talk about on this call and then neither about the rate. 
So if you think about it in a strictly logical sense, it would be, obviously, more impact in the first half of the year just because we're not producing any. It's going to have a bigger impact when the assumption may be they're building a certain quantity in the back half -- end of the year. 
At the same time, that may be smoothed a little bit by the willingness or not of the carry inventory, particularly by Boeing themselves. And so we're in those -- in that dialogue at the moment to try to see what -- how it flows exactly from the aircraft and what part of inventory management taken into account of all this to, again, all with a view to trying to help the labor management situation that I've talked about, which is really the -- probably the most complicated part of this in trying to come up with the right judgment. And then with my comment, which I provided earlier, which was the critical thing is going to be how we see the exit rate for the year and what will be the 2021 production. So there's -- I'll say there's a lot of things to consider. It's not just the strictly the aircraft build per se and currently no build situation to inventory management and labor management in all of this, affecting both top and bottom line and this profile during the course of the year."

A lot of ground to cover today, and I do recognize that we have lots of moving parts between the cost reductions, performance program, restructuring, asset sales, the share count movement, aluminum and metal assumptions, and then finally, Boeing MAX, and I intend to provide as much visibility into these as possible. I plan to cover the quarter and full year performance and the results of these major priorities and then move on to discuss the approach that we've taken to the 2020 outlook.
Let's start on Slide 4. Today, we are announcing that we are targeting the separation to take effect on the 1st of April. The majority of the work has been complete, and we're on track with all separation steps. The planned operating date for the 2 future companies is next week, the 1st of February, and the legal [ separation ] into the 2 listed future public companies is April 1. Regarding the strategic priorities, including capital structure, capital allocation and financial outlooks for the 2 future companies, we're targeting an Investor Day on February 25 in New York for both companies.
Let's move on to Slide 5 to cover the fourth quarter results. The results were solid. We had record fourth quarter performance for operating income, excluding special items, and record operating margins and earnings per share. Operating income, excluding special items, was $444 million, and the effective tax rate was 29.7%. This was an unusually high number for tax and to prior quarters and driven essentially by the geography of earnings.
In the quarter, Engineered Products and Forgings year-over-year operating margin expanded 480 basis points, while GRP expanded by 370 basis points. Both EP&F and GRP demonstrated progression in year-over-year margin for every quarter this year and in EP&F sequential [indiscernible] quarter. Fourth quarter earnings per share was $0.53, up 61% year-over-year and at the maximum end of our guidance range. Earnings per share for the year was [indiscernible] at $2.11 and up 55% year-over-year. 
Free cash flow was $870 million, up 87% year-over-year, and this exceeded the midpoint of guidance by $120 million and has made a very [ meaningful ] improvement in free cash flow for Arconic from prior years and achieved a free cash flow conversion of 90% of net income. Please note that the free cash flow conversion guidance I provided for the 2 separated companies at the time of the last earnings call. The year-end cash balance was $1.7 billion after $1.15 billion of share repurchases and the repayment of $400 million of convertible notes. The $1.15 billion of share repurchases included a fourth quarter market share repurchase of 1.6 million shares. For the year, we repurchased approximately 55 million common shares at a weighted average price of $20.97. This leaves open share repurchase authority of $350 million, which will carry over into the future Howmet company, if not utilized before separation. Net debt to EBITDA was 1.81x, which was a record low and an improvement from fourth quarter 2018, which was 2.05x. And lastly, [ after-tax ] return on net assets improved year-over-year by 450 basis points to 13.7%, another record.
Now let me turn it over to Ken to provide a more detailed view of Q4 and the year."
416264458,650836869,1894134,"Arconic Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2020",2020-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Howmet Aerospace Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. Now let's move to Slide 6 and financial results for the quarter. In the fourth quarter, organic revenue was up $38 million year-over-year with EP&F up 2% and GRP flat. EP&F had 5% organic growth in aerospace, which represents more than 70",1609,"Thank you, John. Now let's move to Slide 6 and financial results for the quarter. In the fourth quarter, organic revenue was up $38 million year-over-year with EP&F up 2% and GRP flat. EP&F had 5% organic growth in aerospace, which represents more than 70% of its revenue, while commercial transportation declined 8%. GRP was flat as industrial products had 21% organic growth; packaging, 6%; and aerospace, 3%. These increases were offset by a decline in automotive of 9% as the Ford F-150 is transitioning to the next-generation model, and we had lower volumes due to the GM strike. Building and construction was down 8% due to softness in Europe and intentional exits of less profitable products. 
Operating income, excluding special items, for the fourth quarter,was $444 million, up 37% year-over-year. We delivered the fourth consecutive quarter of price increases with a $42 million favorable impact year-over-year. Price increases span across both segments driven by aerospace, industrial and commercial transportation, and we expect favorable pricing to continue. Weakness in our automotive and commercial transportation markets unfavorably impacted operating income by $29 million in the fourth quarter. Favorable raw material costs, including aluminum price, was a benefit to operating income of $34 million in the quarter. Similar to price, we had our fourth [ consecutive ] quarter of net cost reductions. Net cost reductions were led by cost-out program, which generated $76 million of year-over-year benefit in the quarter. This was partially offset by higher variable compensation and equity costs, which were driven by improved performance on profit, free cash flow and equity value. As expected, the transition of our Tennessee plant to more profitable industrial products showed a year-over-year improvement in the fourth quarter. The impact was $13 million. We have included the reconciliation of operating income, excluding special items, on Slide 35 of the appendix.
In the fourth quarter, adjusted free cash flow was a record at $728 million or $250 million more than the fourth quarter of last year. Please note, consistent with our guidance, we have excluded $2 million of unfavorable cash flow in the quarter related to planned separation. Days working capital improved 1 day on a year-over-year basis to 43 days with the main driver being collections. The year-over-year cash improvement was $103 million. Pension contributions and OPEB payments were $69 million in the quarter, which was $38 million more than the fourth quarter of 2018. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $167 million, which was down $104 million on a year-over-year basis. 
Diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.53 per share and 61% higher than the comparable period. The higher diluted earnings per share were primarily driven by operational improvements of $0.13, lower share count of $0.05 and lower raw material costs of $0.05.
Now let's move to the year-over-year margin expansion on Slide 7. In the fourth quarter, Arconic's margin improved 380 basis points on a year-over-year basis, while EP&F improved 480 basis points, and GRP improved 370 basis points. It is noteworthy that the year-over-year margin expansion has improved each quarter in 2019. This improvement reflects the trajectory of ongoing operational improvements, improved pricing and cost reductions.
Now let's move to the special item summary on Slide 8. In the fourth quarter, our reported results included a net favorable impact of $75 million in special items. The special items in the quarter primarily related to 3 items. First, we recorded a $94 million tax benefit related to a U.S. tax election which caused the liquidation of a foreign subsidiaries assets into our U.S. tax parent. The second special item was a cash charge of $34 million associated with the planned separation. Third, we received [ $21 million ] in closing cash related to an earn-out associated with the Texarkana plant that was sold in the fourth quarter of 2018. I would point out loss incurred in the quarter for legal and other advisory fees related to Grenfell Tower and the fire at our fasteners plant in France were largely offset by related [indiscernible] proceeds. More details concerning special items for the quarter can be found on Slides 28, 29 and 35 appendix. For the year, the majority of the special items have been consistent with the stated plan of divesting assets or businesses that do not fit our focus, require significant capital investment with unacceptable returns or are not material to our bottom line. As you would expect, approximately 1% of the charges for the year were noncash. 
Now let's move to the segment results on Slide 9. In the fourth quarter, EP&F's revenue was $1.7 billion. Organic revenue was up 2%. Segment operating profit was a record for the quarter at $354 million, up 32%. The increase in segment operating profit was driven by several favorable items, including volume growth in aerospace, higher pricing, lower raw material costs and net cost reductions. The resulting segment operating margin expanded by 480 basis points year-over-year to 20.4%.
In the fourth quarter, GRP's revenue was also $1.7 billion. Organic revenue was flat year-over-year. Segment operating profit was a record for the fourth quarter at $150 million, up 61%. The favorable year-over-year improvement in the segment operating profit was driven by favorable pricing in the industrial and commercial transportation markets, lower aluminum prices, net cost reductions and improvement in internal scrap utilization. The Tennessee transition to industrial products helped offset the declines in automotive and commercial transportation. Despite the challenges in aluminum extrusions and flat organic revenue growth, GRP segment operating margin increased 370 basis points year-over-year to 9%.
Let me move to the fourth quarter key achievements on Slide 10. Our EP&F business had record fourth quarter revenue and segment operating profit on a year-over-year basis. Aerospace organic revenue was up 5%. Favorable pricing improvements in EP&F continued in the fourth quarter as we achieved $29 million in year-over-year price increases. For the year, price improvements in the segment were $78 million. Finally, in EP&F, our expansion of the aerospace airfoils, aerospace rings and forged wheels capital expenditures are complete and ramping up in 2020.
Our GRP business had record fourth quarter segment operating profit. GRP's industrial revenue was up 20% organically year-over-year. Price improvements in industrial products and commercial transportations drove $13 million of year-over-year price increases. For the year, price improvement in the segment were $75 million. GRP's internal scrap utilization improved 180 basis points versus the same quarter of last year. 
Arconic's full year free cash flow of $870 million resulted in a free cash flow conversion of 90%. Return on net assets for the year was 13.7%, was up 450 basis points year-over-year. CapEx for the year was $579 million, approximately 4% of revenue and was down $189 million year-over-year. Approximately 65% of the CapEx was spent on return-seeking projects. A majority of our growth CapEx projects are now complete, and we expect CapEx as a percent of revenue to be less than 4% in 2020. Our cash balance was approximately $1.7 billion after we repurchased $1.15 billion of outstanding shares and paid down approximately $400 million of debt.
Now let's move to Slide 11 and the key financial results for the year. For the year, organic revenue was up $894 million with both EP&F and GRP up 6%. EP&F had 8% organic growth in aerospace and 4% growth in commercial transportation. GRP's organic revenue increase was driven by double-digit growth in aerospace, industrial products and packaging. 
Operating income, excluding special items, for the year was $1.8 billion, up 29% year-over-year. Price increases were $153 million for the year and split almost equally across the segments. Higher volumes also favorably impacted operating income by $80 million for the year, mainly driven by aerospace. Lower raw material costs, including aluminum price, was favorable to operating income, $99 million for the year. Net cost reductions were led by the cost-out program, which generated approximately $213 million of year-over-year savings. This was partially offset by 3 items: the transition of our Tennessee plant, operational challenges at one of our aluminum extrusion plants and higher compensation costs driven by improved performance. 
Adjusted free cash flow in 2019 was $870 million or $405 million more than 2018. Pension contributions and OPEB payments were $345 million, which was $33 million less than 2018. At year-end, the pension and OPEB net liability was approximately $3.2 billion, up approximately $200 million year-over-year as lower discount rates impacted the liability by approximately $900 million. U.S. pension asset returns were approximately 20%, and these returns partially offset the impact of the lower discount rate. Capital expenditures for the year were $579 million, which were down $189 million compared to 2018 while making significant investment in aerospace airfoils, aerospace rings, forged wheels and industrial products.
Diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, was $2.11 per share and 55% higher than 2018. The higher diluted earnings per share were primarily driven by operational improvements of $0.47, lower raw material costs of $0.15 and lower share count of $0.12.
Before turning it back over to John, let me briefly provide an update on our capital structure, which is on Slide '19 in the appendix. We finished the year with approximately $1.7 billion of cash after executing the $1.15 billion of share repurchases and reducing debt by $400 million. Gross debt is approximately $5.9 billion, and net debt stands at $4.2 billion. Net debt to EBITDA continues to improve year over year despite the cash outflow associated with the share repurchases. Net debt to EBITDA stands at 1.81x, which is an improvement of 12% compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. 
With that, I will turn it back over to John."

Price increases for the year were $153 million, and we saw good progress at both EP&F and GRP. Operating cost reductions were $213 million for the year and ah",954,"Thanks, Ken, and let's move to Slide 12, where I'll give you the results of the key focus items. Price increases for the year were $153 million, and we saw good progress at both EP&F and GRP. Operating cost reductions were $213 million for the year and ahead of our annual commitment of $180 million. The annual run rate operating costs are projected to be reduced by $300 million, which is a full $100 million higher than our original commitment. 
As a result of the share repurchases, which are detailed on the slide, year-end diluted common stock share count was 440 million shares, down 13% year-on-year. Capital expenditure was $579 million, excluding $7 million associated with separation. CapEx was approximately 4% of revenue. The major focus of our 2019 capital expenditures was the expansion of airfoils and rings capacity in the Engines business, the European wheels expansion and the Tennessee industrial expansion in Rolled Products.
Annual divestiture of proceeds of approximately $190 million are expected to exceed the operating and CapEx cash cost of separation. Divestitures signed or closed will reduce annual revenue by approximately $350 million with limited operating income impact. Two previously announced transactions will close in the first quarter of 2020 with proceeds of approximately $100 million. 
Now let me move to separation. We're targeting separation for the 1st of April. We filed an amendment to the Form 10 on the 22nd of January, where we provided greater visibility into management, capital structure and pension allocation. The next step is the financing of Arconic Corp.'s spin entity. This financing commences today and is planned for completion by February 10. The Form 10 is planned to be made effective by mid-February. The planned operating date for the 2 companies is the 1st of February, where everything will be done by the 2 entities; and legal separation into the 2 listed future public companies on the 1st of April. This will have accomplished a rapid execution of separation from the time that I announced the plan upon taking the CEO role in February 2019. One last but very important item on separation is related to pension plans. The separation does not trigger any incremental cash contributions. 
Let's move to Slide 13. As you know, this earnings call precedes the Boeing call, which, while is not ideal, is important in effecting the separation timing and the debt financing starting this afternoon. We have had many exchanges with Boeing during late December and every week throughout January and hence have a reasonable feel for their current plans in 2020. Naturally, I will not provide any details of those conversations, except to guide the Arconic numbers. Today, I will provide Q1 and earnings per share guidance numbers, plus a view of revenue and free cash flow for Arconic. At our February Investor Day, I will provide additional insight into Howmet Aerospace and new Arconic Corp., which, naturally, will be of more interest going forward. The split, as stated, is set for the 1st of April. And hence by achieving this early timing, we will be able to see 3 clean quarters in 2020. 
Now let me turn to the specific numbers but noting, firstly, that given the uncertainty to that which Boeing will exactly announce and their future increases in production plans, this causes me to provide a wider bandwidth of guidance than would be normal. Revenue is targeted to be in the range of $13.9 billion to $14.2 billion with organic growth in the range of 1% to 3%. Aerospace revenue is expected to increase year-over-year when we exclude the Boeing 737 MAX situation. If we were to include the impacts of the 737 MAX, aerospace revenue is expected to be flat year-over-year. We expect continued aerospace price increases in 2020 and growth year-over-year in industrial products driven by the transition of our Tennessee plant into more profitable industrial products. Commercial transportation is expected to experience headwinds in 2020 driven by slowing manufacturing and freight growth, lower new truck orders and the increased current inventory levels. We are targeting to mitigate those margin impacts for our forged wheels business by gaining market share, supported by our differentiated lighter-weight products. We continue to penetrate the steel wheel market with aluminum wheels. Moreover, our low-cost manufacturing wheels expansion in Hungary is now fully operational, and we will leverage our global footprint. The global rolled products business will mitigate commercial transportation headwinds with cost reduction actions.
Earnings per share, excluding special items, is expected to be in the range of $2.22 to $2.42 per share. At the midpoint, year-over-year growth is approximately 10%, including our current view of the impacts of the 737 MAX. Year-over-year growth in earnings per share will be driven by run rate cost reductions actioned in 2019 as well as incremental cost reductions in 2020, plus the continued price increases. Earnings per share for the first quarter is expected to be $0.47 to $0.53, which is an increase of approximately 16% year-over-year at the midpoint. 
Adjusted free cash flow forecast is to be between $800 million and $900 million driven by earnings, capital expenditures of less than 4% of revenue and favorable year-over-year restructuring payments. Pension and OPEB cash contributions are expected to be approximately $220 million higher than in 2019 driven by the drop in the discount rate. Free cash flow conversion is expected to be 80% with greater detail to be provided at Investor Day on February 25. Finally, regarding Grenfell, there has been no activity this quarter, and nothing has changed regarding our stance towards the matter nor our view of the expected outcomes of the litigation nor liability. 
And with that, I'd like to open the line for your questions."

And, in fact, on any earnings call, I've never provided shipset values. I've read, I'll say, guesstimates in analyst reports which I say probably aren't too far, but I don't really want to give specificity of what the shipset value and what the margins are by any aircraft because the next question to follow will be on the next aircraft and the next aircraft, and I feel disinclined to do that at this point. 
What I would say to you is our assumption is we've got about a $400 million revenue hit, plus or minus, for the MAX. I've tried to take a fairly conservative view to guidance, especially in the light of -- it's only when we actually know what the Boeing published position is that I think we can be -- have that greater certainty. And then how we address our cost structures, we've made assumptions. And in particular of importance to us is what will be the profile exactly of the future Boeing build, both in 2020, and really importantly, in 2021 because the -- while it's, I'm going to say, relatively easy to shed labor, getting the sort of skills back given the, I'll say, very high employment level in the U.S.,, I mean, those are all things which are really important for us to consider. And so you've got to see the whole thing and then also how the Boeing position evolves over time. I mean what we've seen, as you know, over the last 6 or 9 months is fairly -- what has resulted in fairly optimistic assumptions, and we've seen many changes to those. And now we're in a situation where the production is currently halted with a view to restart and what's now viewed as a fairly conservative assumption regarding when the FAA will release the aircraft and according to statements made in the last week by the Chairman of the FAA. 
So I mean all I can say is that it's pretty confusing. And when we have that greater clarity -- and I tend to be in the optimistic camp, but at some point, the aircraft production may rise above what we think it is. And therefore, we need to be prepared for that. And how we manage labor is critical to it, what the carrying cost of that is and what we've built into the assumptions. And that's why guidance itself is particularly difficult at this point in time. But neither I've given you something that I don't feel confident in our ability to achieve, and I did call out the fact that I provided a little bit wider guidance than normal to take account of some of this uncertainty. And clearly, we're going to be updating you as we go through the year. We're going to give you further updates, hopefully, on the Investor Day on February 25. And as the -- I'd say the clarity emerges and that tries to give you a color of how we've approached this whole situation and the fact that we're having to come out really a little bit earlier than normal just to affect the financing that we're in the market for starting this afternoon and enabling that, I'll  say, debt raise to occur to meet the separation timing. So all these things are pretty much interlinked. And I guess, preferably, I'd have been a week or 2 later. But the most important thing for the company was to achieve, I believe, the earliest possible separation timing. So hopefully, that gives you a pretty wide view of where we've been thinking on this and how we approach it, David."

And then critical to that decision, the [ finality ] now of how much we're going to flex labor, both the direct and indirect labor and our cost structure is going to be our view of 2021.

And if we were to cut that and then try to rebuild it back to a number of 42 or 52  or 57, then that will become almost impossible, not just for Arconic, but for the whole of the industry. So that does not flex -- this is a matter of production, I'll say, difficulty and complexity. That doesn't flex anything like the structural side, even though neither sides are difficult. And therefore, what we are thinking about is with, I'll say, some of the spares, clearance and building of spare engines, which I believe is being considered and planned, that should help smooth the year and, in particular, provide the ability to move engine production back up again as we move into 2021. But again, it's cloudy. I wish it were -- we had greater clarity of what exactly those builds will be for the next 24 months and beyond, but we don't. So we -- living in this world that we inhabit. And so at the moment, obviously, we're cushioning it, both ourselves and within GE, and then seeing how we can manage the overall production, both with a view of both the material input for the specialty metals and also the critical skills that we have in that business."

And we've taken our lumps now in terms of moving out of some of that low-margin business that we talked about. And therefore, that gives you a picture for BCS. So I'm going to say small growth in 2020 with the -- I would say, overall, an improved margin given the actions that we took during the course of last year. And we more than achieved the basis points improvement in margin that I talked about on previous quarters. I think it's Q2 when I called that out. 
In terms of auto, it's difficult to gain anything. If I called it out at 17 million for North America, as an example, you wouldn't gain much on that. You need to look more -- be more specific in terms of what the underlying trends are of, let's say, truck versus pass car and cleans were mainly aimed at the SUV and pickup truck market. And in fact, the really, I'll say, notable changes in 2020 is one is less of a drag from the Ford changeover, less of a drag because hopefully -- well, I can't think of any reason why there will be another strike at GM seen as the contract is all done, and it's a multiyear contract. So that's behind us. And then, as you may recall from previous commentary, we were successful in increasing our business with a major U.S. OEM coming onstream in the middle of the year. I don't think we have a call to name out, so I won't this morning, but that business comes onstream around about the sort of late May, June time, ready for the next model year of a major SUV and pickup truck introduction. 
So that gives you a picture of how we think about automotive. So a fairly -- I'm going to say, honestly, a fairly good outlook for that as it pertains to Arconic Corp. in 2020."

I mean we had a short-term impact. But then not only were other countries importing into the U.S., but it appears that some of those metals in terms of secondary parts has also been able to find its way into the U.S. So in natural effect, the total North American aluminum production was actually negatively impacted, and I think the current administration is trying to deal with some of that. And so we've seen it. What we don't yet have is the listing of what those products are. And therefore, it's really difficult today to give you clarity over what additional tonnage that may result in for the, I'll say, the rolled and extruded business in the U.S. It's something that we've obviously noted, hasn't been part of the -- our thought process for the guidance today where, hopefully, it has a positive impact, but to quantify it right now is just not possible."

We know that the Boeing announcement about cessation of production. And then I'm not going to comment on which month they said that they will recommence. That's not for me to talk about on this call and then neither about the rate. So if you think about it in a strictly logical sense, it would be, obviously, more impact in the first half of the year, just because we're not producing any. It's going to have a bigger impact when the assumption may be they're building a certain quantity in the back half -- end of the year. At the same time, that may be smooth a little bit by the willingness or not of -- to carry inventory, particularly by Boeing themselves. And so we're in those -- in that dialogue at the moment to try to see what -- how it flows exactly from the aircraft and what part of inventory management taken into account of all this to -- again, all with a view to trying to help the labor management situation that I've talked about, which is really the -- probably the most complicated part of this in trying to come up with the right judgment. And then with my comment, which I provided earlier, which was the critical thing is going to be how we see the exit rate for the year and what will be the 2021 production. So there's -- I'll say there's a lot of things to consider. It's not just the -- strictly the aircraft build per se and the currently no-build situation to inventory management and labor management in all of this, affecting both top and bottom line and this profile during the course of the year."

A lot of ground to cover today, and I do recognize that we have lots of moving parts between the cost reductions, performance program, restructuring, asset sales, the share count movement, aluminum and metal assumptions, and then finally, Boeing MAX, and I intend to provide as much visibility into these as possible. I plan to cover the quarter and the full year performance and the results of these major priorities and then move on to discuss the approach that we've taken to the 2020 outlook.
Let's start on Slide 4. Today, we are announcing that we are targeting the separation to take effect on the 1st of April. The majority of the work has been completed, and we're on track with all separation steps. The planned operating date for the 2 future companies is next week, the 1st of February and the legal separation into the 2 listed future public companies is April 1. Regarding the strategic priorities, including capital structure, capital allocation and financial outlooks for the 2 future companies, we're targeting an Investor Day on February 25 in New York for both companies.
Let's move on to Slide 5 to cover the fourth quarter results. The results were solid. We had record fourth quarter performance for operating income, excluding special items, and record operating margins and earnings per share. Operating income, excluding special items, was $444 million, and the effective tax rate was 29.7%. This was an unusually high number for tax and to prior quarters and driven essentially by the geography of earnings.
In the quarter, Engineered Products and Forgings year-over-year operating margin expanded 480 basis points, while GRP expanded by 370 basis points. Both EP&F and GRP demonstrated progression in year-over-year margin for every quarter this year and in EP&F sequential a quarter. Fourth quarter earnings per share was $0.53, up 61% year-over-year and at the maximum end of our guidance range. Earnings per share for the year was odd at $2.11 and up 55% year-over-year. 
Free cash flow was $870 million, up 87% year-over-year, and this exceeded the midpoint of guidance by $120 million and has made a very [ meaningful ] improvement in free cash flow for Arconic from prior years and achieved a free cash flow conversion of 90% of net income. Please note that the free cash flow conversion guidance I provided for the 2 separated companies at the time of the last earnings call. The year-end cash balance was $1.7 billion after $1.15 billion of share repurchases and the repayment of $400 million of convertible notes. The $1.15 billion of share repurchases included a fourth quarter market share repurchase of 1.6 million shares. For the year, we repurchased approximately 55 million common shares at a weighted average price of $20.97. This leaves open share repurchase authority of $350 million, which will carry over into the future Howmet Company, if not utilized before separation. Net debt to EBITDA was 1.81x, which was a record low and an improvement from fourth quarter 2018, which was 2.05x. And lastly, after return on net assets improved year-over-year by 450 basis points to 13.7%, another record.
Now let me turn it over to Ken to provide a more detailed view of Q4 and the year."
416264458,650836869,1894822,"Arconic Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2020",2020-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Howmet Aerospace Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. Now let's move to Slide 6 and financial results for the quarter. In the fourth quarter, organic revenue was up $38 million year-over-year with EP&F up 2% and GRP flat. EP&F had 5% organic growth in aerospace, which represents more than 70",1610,"Thank you, John. Now let's move to Slide 6 and financial results for the quarter. In the fourth quarter, organic revenue was up $38 million year-over-year with EP&F up 2% and GRP flat. EP&F had 5% organic growth in aerospace, which represents more than 70% of its revenue, while commercial transportation declined 8%. GRP was flat as industrial products had 21% organic growth; packaging, 6%; and aerospace, 3%. These increases were offset by a decline in automotive of 9% as the Ford F-150 is transitioning to the next-generation model, and we had lower volumes due to the GM strike. Building and construction was down 8% due to softness in Europe and intentional exits of less profitable products. 
Operating income, excluding special items, for the fourth quarter, was $444 million, up 37% year-over-year. We delivered the fourth consecutive quarter of price increases with a $42 million favorable impact year-over-year. Price increases span across both segments driven by aerospace, industrial and commercial transportation, and we expect favorable pricing to continue. Weakness in our automotive and commercial transportation markets unfavorably impacted operating income by $29 million in the fourth quarter. Favorable raw material costs, including aluminum price, was a benefit to operating income of $34 million in the quarter. Similar to price, we had our fourth [ consecutive ] quarter of net cost reductions. Net cost reductions were led by cost-out program, which generated $76 million of year-over-year benefit in the quarter. This was partially offset by higher variable compensation and equity costs, which were driven by improved performance on profit, free cash flow and equity value. As expected, the transition of our Tennessee plant to more profitable industrial products showed a year-over-year improvement in the fourth quarter. The impact was $13 million. We have included the reconciliation of operating income, excluding special items, on Slide 35 of the appendix.
In the fourth quarter, adjusted free cash flow was a record at $728 million or $250 million more than the fourth quarter of last year. Please note, consistent with our guidance, we have excluded $2 million of unfavorable cash flow in the quarter related to planned separation. Days working capital improved 1 day on a year-over-year basis to 43 days with the main driver being collections. The year-over-year cash improvement was $103 million. Pension contributions and OPEB payments were $69 million in the quarter, which was $38 million more than the fourth quarter of 2018. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $167 million, which was down $104 million on a year-over-year basis. 
Diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.53 per share and 61% higher than the comparable period. The higher diluted earnings per share were primarily driven by operational improvements of $0.13, lower share count of $0.05 and lower raw material costs of $0.05.
Now let's move to the year-over-year margin expansion on Slide 7. In the fourth quarter, Arconic's margin improved 380 basis points on a year-over-year basis, while EP&F improved 480 basis points, and GRP improved 370 basis points. It is noteworthy that the year-over-year margin expansion has improved each quarter in 2019. This improvement reflects the trajectory of ongoing operational improvements, improved pricing and cost reductions.
Now let's move to the special item summary on Slide 8. In the fourth quarter, our reported results included a net favorable impact of $75 million in special items. The special items in the quarter primarily related to 3 items. First, we recorded a $94 million tax benefit related to a U.S. tax election which caused the liquidation of a foreign subsidiaries assets into our U.S. tax parent. The second special item was a cash charge of $34 million associated with the planned separation. Third, we received [ $21 million ] in closing cash related to an earn-out associated with the Texarkana plant that was sold in the fourth quarter of 2018. I would point out loss incurred in the quarter for legal and other advisory fees related to Grenfell Tower and the fire at our fasteners plant in France were largely offset by related [indiscernible] proceeds. More details concerning special items for the quarter can be found on Slides 28, 29 and 35 appendix. For the year, the majority of the special items have been consistent with the stated plan of divesting assets or businesses that do not fit our focus, require significant capital investment with unacceptable returns or are not material to our bottom line. As you would expect, approximately 1% of the charges for the year were noncash. 
Now let's move to the segment results on Slide 9. In the fourth quarter, EP&F's revenue was $1.7 billion. Organic revenue was up 2%. Segment operating profit was a record for the quarter at $354 million, up 32%. The increase in segment operating profit was driven by several favorable items, including volume growth in aerospace, higher pricing, lower raw material costs and net cost reductions. The resulting segment operating margin expanded by 480 basis points year-over-year to 20.4%.
In the fourth quarter, GRP's revenue was also $1.7 billion. Organic revenue was flat year-over-year. Segment operating profit was a record for the fourth quarter at $150 million, up 61%. The favorable year-over-year improvement in the segment operating profit was driven by favorable pricing in the industrial and commercial transportation markets, lower aluminum prices, net cost reductions and improvement in internal scrap utilization. The Tennessee transition to industrial products helped offset the declines in automotive and commercial transportation. Despite the challenges in aluminum extrusions and flat organic revenue growth, GRP segment operating margin increased 370 basis points year-over-year to 9%.
Let me move to the fourth quarter key achievements on Slide 10. Our EP&F business had record fourth quarter revenue and segment operating profit on a year-over-year basis. Aerospace organic revenue was up 5%. Favorable pricing improvements in EP&F continued in the fourth quarter as we achieved $29 million in year-over-year price increases. For the year, price improvements in the segment were $78 million. Finally, in EP&F, our expansion of the aerospace airfoils, aerospace rings and forged wheels capital expenditures are complete and ramping up in 2020.
Our GRP business had record fourth quarter segment operating profit. GRP's industrial revenue was up 20% organically year-over-year. Price improvements in industrial products and commercial transportations drove $13 million of year-over-year price increases. For the year, price improvement in the segment were $75 million. GRP's internal scrap utilization improved 180 basis points versus the same quarter of last year. 
Arconic's full year free cash flow of $870 million resulted in a free cash flow conversion of 90%. Return on net assets for the year was 13.7%, was up 450 basis points year-over-year. CapEx for the year was $579 million, approximately 4% of revenue and was down $189 million year-over-year. Approximately 65% of the CapEx was spent on return-seeking projects. A majority of our growth CapEx projects are now complete, and we expect CapEx as a percent of revenue to be less than 4% in 2020. Our cash balance was approximately $1.7 billion after we repurchased $1.15 billion of outstanding shares and paid down approximately $400 million of debt.
Now let's move to Slide 11 and the key financial results for the year. For the year, organic revenue was up $894 million with both EP&F and GRP up 6%. EP&F had 8% organic growth in aerospace and 4% growth in commercial transportation. GRP's organic revenue increase was driven by double-digit growth in aerospace, industrial products and packaging. 
Operating income, excluding special items for the year was $1.8 billion, up 29% year-over-year. Price increases were $153 million for the year and split almost equally across the segments. Higher volumes also favorably impacted operating income by $80 million for the year, mainly driven by aerospace. Lower raw material costs, including aluminum price, was favorable to operating income, $99 million for the year. Net cost reductions were led by the cost-out program, which generated approximately $213 million of year-over-year savings. This was partially offset by 3 items: the transition of our Tennessee plant, operational challenges at one of our aluminum extrusion plants and higher compensation costs driven by improved performance. 
Adjusted free cash flow in 2019 was $870 million or $405 million more than 2018. Pension contributions and OPEB payments were $345 million, which was $33 million less than 2018. At year-end, the pension and OPEB net liability was approximately $3.2 billion, up approximately $200 million year-over-year as lower discount rates impacted the liability by approximately $900 million. U.S. pension asset returns were approximately 20%, and these returns partially offset the impact of the lower discount rate. Capital expenditures for the year were $579 million, which were down $189 million compared to 2018 while making significant investment in aerospace airfoils, aerospace rings, forged wheels and industrial products.
Diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, was $2.11 per share and 55% higher than 2018. The higher diluted earnings per share were primarily driven by operational improvements of $0.47, lower raw material costs of $0.15 and lower share count of $0.12.
Before turning it back over to John, let me briefly provide an update on our capital structure, which is on Slide '19 in the appendix. We finished the year with approximately $1.7 billion of cash after executing the $1.15 billion of share repurchases and reducing debt by $400 million. Gross debt is approximately $5.9 billion, and net debt stands at $4.2 billion. Net debt to EBITDA continues to improve year over year despite the cash outflow associated with the share repurchases. Net debt to EBITDA stands at 1.81x, which is an improvement of 12% compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. 
With that, I will turn it back over to John."

Price increases for the year were $153 million, and we saw good progress at both EP&F and GRP. Operating cost reductions were $213 million for the year and ahead of our annual commitment of $180 million. The annual run rate operating costs are projected to be reduced by $300 million, which is a full $100 million higher than our original commitment. 
As a result of the share repurchases, which are detailed on the slide, year-end diluted common stock share count was 440 million shares, down 13% year-on-year. Capital expenditure was $579 million, excluding $7 million associated with separation. CapEx was approximately 4% of revenue. The major focus of our 2019 capital expenditures was the expansion of airfoils and rings capacity in the Engines business, the European wheels expansion and the Tennessee industrial expansion in Rolled Products.
Annual divestiture of proceeds of approximately $190 million are expected to exceed the operating and CapEx cash cost of separation. Divestitures signed or closed will reduce annual revenue by approximately $350 million with limited operating income impact. Two previously announced transactions will close in the first quarter of 2020 with proceeds of approximately $100 million. 
Now let me move to separation. We're targeting separation for the 1st of April. We filed an amendment to the Form 10 on the 22nd of January, where we provided greater visibility into management, capital structure and pension allocation. The next step is the financing of Arconic Corp.'s spin entity. This financing commences today and is planned for completion by February 10. The Form 10 is planned to be made effective by mid-February. The planned operating date for the 2 companies is the 1st of February, where everything will be done by the 2 entities; and legal separation into the 2 listed future public companies on the 1st of April. This will have accomplished a rapid execution of separation from the time that I announced the plan upon taking the CEO role in February 2019. One last but very important item on separation is related to pension plans. The separation does not trigger any incremental cash contributions. 
Let's move to Slide 13. As you know, this earnings call precedes the Boeing call, which, while it's not ideal, is important in effecting the separation timing and the debt financing starting this afternoon. We have had many exchanges with Boeing during late December and every week throughout January and hence have a reasonable feel for their current plans in 2020. Naturally, I will not provide any details of those conversations, except to guide the Arconic numbers. Today, I will provide Q1 and earnings per share guidance numbers, plus a view of revenue and free cash flow for Arconic. At our February Investor Day, I will provide additional insight into Howmet Aerospace and new Arconic Corp., which, naturally, will be of more interest going forward. The split, as stated, is set for the 1st of April. And hence by achieving this early timing, we will be able to see 3 clean quarters in 2020. 
Now let me turn to the specific numbers but noting, firstly, that given the uncertainty to that which Boeing will exactly announce and their future increases in production plans, this causes me to provide a wider bandwidth of guidance than would be normal. Revenue is targeted to be in the range of $13.9 billion to $14.2 billion with organic growth in the range of 1% to 3%. Aerospace revenue is expected to increase year-over-year when we exclude the Boeing 737 MAX situation. If we were to include the impacts of the 737 MAX, aerospace revenue is expected to be flat year-over-year. We expect continued aerospace price increases in 2020 and growth year-over-year in industrial products driven by the transition of our Tennessee plant into more profitable industrial products. Commercial transportation is expected to experience headwinds in 2020 driven by slowing manufacturing and freight growth, lower new truck orders and the increased current inventory levels. We are targeting to mitigate those margin impacts for our forged wheels business by gaining market share, supported by our differentiated lighter-weight products. We continue to penetrate the steel wheel market with aluminum wheels. Moreover, our low-cost manufacturing wheels expansion in Hungary is now fully operational, and we will leverage our global footprint. The global rolled products business will mitigate commercial transportation headwinds with cost reduction actions.
Earnings per share, excluding special items, is expected to be in the range of $2.22 to $2.42 per share. At the midpoint, year-over-year growth is approximately 10%, including our current view of the impacts of the 737 MAX. Year-over-year growth in earnings per share will be driven by run rate cost reductions actioned in 2019 as well as incremental cost reductions in 2020, plus the continued price increases. Earnings per share for the first quarter is expected to be $0.47 to $0.53, which is an increase of approximately 16% year-over-year at the midpoint. 
Adjusted free cash flow forecast is to be between $800 million and $900 million driven by earnings, capital expenditures of less than 4% of revenue and favorable year-over-year restructuring payments. Pension and OPEB cash contributions are expected to be approximately $220 million higher than in 2019 driven by the drop in the discount rate. Free cash flow conversion is expected to be 80% with greater detail to be provided at Investor Day on February 25. Finally, regarding Grenfell, there has been no activity this quarter, and nothing has changed regarding our stance towards the matter nor our view of the expected outcomes of the litigation nor liability. 
And with that, I'd like to open the line for your questions."

What I would say to you is our assumption is we've got about a $400 million revenue hit, plus or minus, for the MAX. I've tried to take a fairly conservative view to guidance, especially in the light of -- it's only when we actually know what the Boeing published position is that I think we can be -- have that greater certainty. And then how we address our cost structures, we've made assumptions. And in particular of importance to us is what will be the profile exactly of the future Boeing build, both in 2020, and really importantly, in 2021 because the -- while it's, I'm going to say, relatively easy to shed labor, getting the sort of skills back given the, I'll say, very high employment level in the U.S., I mean, those are all things which are really important for us to consider. And so you've got to see the whole thing and then also how the Boeing position itself evolves over time. I mean what we've seen, as you know, over the last 6 or 9 months is fairly -- what has resulted in fairly optimistic assumptions, and we've seen many changes to those. And now we're in a situation where the production is currently halted with a view to restart and what's now viewed as a fairly conservative assumption regarding when the FAA will release the aircraft and according to statements made in the last week by the Chairman of the FAA. 
So I mean all I can say is that it's pretty confusing. And when we have that greater clarity -- and I tend to be in the optimistic camp, but at some point, the aircraft production may rise above what we think it is. And therefore, we need to be prepared for that. And how we manage labor is critical to it, what the carrying cost of that is and what we've built into the assumptions. And that's why guidance itself is particularly difficult at this point in time. But neither have I given you something that I don't feel confident in our ability to achieve, and I did call out the fact that I provided a little bit wider guidance than normal to take account of some of this uncertainty. And clearly, we're going to be updating you as we go through the year. We're going to give you further updates, hopefully, on the Investor Day on February 25. And as the -- I'd say the clarity emerges and that tries to give you color of how we've approached this whole situation and the fact that we're having to come out really a little bit earlier than normal just to affect the financing that we're in the market for starting this afternoon and enabling that, I'll say, debt raise to occur to meet the separation timing. So all these things are pretty much interlinked. And I guess, preferably, I'd have been a week or 2 later. But the most important thing for the company was to achieve, I believe, the earliest possible separation timing. So hopefully, that gives you a pretty wide view of where we've been thinking on this and how we approach it, David."

The -- in the early part of the year, I'm thinking that the opportunity that we have, I'll say, in discussion with GE around the ability to bring forward and build some of the spare engines is going to be important, both to push in their production a",303,"Yes. The -- in the early part of the year, I'm thinking that the opportunity that we have, I'll say, in discussion with GE around the ability to bring forward and build some of the spare engines is going to be important, both to push in their production and our production to have a smoother approach to this because while it's difficult to move production up and down on, let's call it, the structural side of the aircraft, but on the engine side, you flex up and down at your peril. And if we were to cut that and then try to rebuild it back to a number of 42 or 52  or 57, then that will become almost impossible, not just for Arconic, but for the whole of the industry. So that does not flex -- this is a matter of production, I'll say, difficulty and complexity. That doesn't flex anything like the structural side, even though neither side are difficult. And therefore, what we are thinking about is with, I'll say, some of the spares, clearance and building of spare engines, which I believe is being considered and planned, that should help smooth the year and, in particular, provide the ability to move engine production back up again as we move into 2021. But again, it's cloudy. I wish it were -- we had greater clarity of what exactly those builds will be for the next 24 months and beyond, but we don't. So we -- living in this world that we inhabit. And so at the moment, obviously, we're cushioning it, both ourselves and within GE, and then seeing how we can manage the overall production, both with a view of both the material input for the specialty metals and also the critical skills that we have in that business."

And we more than achieved the basis points improvement in margin that I talked about on previous quarters. I think it's Q2 when I called that out. 
In terms of auto, it's difficult to gain anything. If I called it out at 17 million for North America, as an example, you wouldn't gain much on that. You need to look more -- be more specific in terms of what the underlying trends are of, let's say, truck versus pass car because we're mainly aimed at the SUV and pickup truck market. And in fact, the really, I'll say, notable changes in 2020 is one is less of a drag from the Ford changeover, less of a drag because hopefully -- well, I can't think of any reason why there will be another strike at GM seen as the contract is all done, and it's a multiyear contract. So that's behind us. And then, as you may recall from previous commentary, we were successful in increasing our business with a major U.S. OEM coming onstream in the middle of the year. I don't think we ever called the name out, so I won't this morning, but that business comes onstream around about the sort of late May, June time, ready for the next model year of a major SUV and pickup truck introduction.

I mean it had a short-term impact. But then not only were other countries importing into the U.S., but it appears that some of those metals in terms of secondary parts has also been able to find its way into the U.S. So in natural fact, the total North American aluminum production was actually negatively impacted, and I think the current administration is trying to deal with some of that.

So if you think about it in a strictly logical sense, it would be, obviously, more impact in the first half of the year, just because we're not producing any. It's going to have a bigger impact when the assumption may be they're building a certain quantity in the back half -- end of the year. At the same time, that may be smoothed a little bit by the willingness or not of -- to carry inventory, particularly by Boeing themselves. And so we're in those -- in that dialogue at the moment to try to see what -- how it flows exactly from the aircraft and what part of inventory management taken into account of all this to -- again, all with a view to trying to help the labor management situation that I've talked about, which is really the -- probably the most complicated part of this in trying to come up with the right judgment. And then with my comment, which I provided earlier, which was the critical thing is going to be how we see the exit rate for the year and what will be the 2021 production. So there's -- I'll say it's a lot of things to consider.

A lot of ground to cover today, and I do recognize that we have lots of moving parts between the cost reductions, performance program, restructuring, asset sales, the share count movement, aluminum and metal assumptions, and then finally, Boeing MAX, and I intend to provide as much visibility into these as possible. I plan to cover the quarter and the full year performance and the results of these major priorities and then move on to discuss the approach that we've taken to the 2020 outlook.
Let's start on Slide 4. Today, we are announcing that we are targeting the separation to take effect on the 1st of April. The majority of the work has been completed, and we're on track with all separation steps. The planned operating date for the 2 future companies is next week, the 1st of February and the legal separation into the 2 listed future public companies is April 1. Regarding the strategic priorities, including capital structure, capital allocation and financial outlooks for the 2 future companies, we're targeting an Investor Day on February 25 in New York for both companies.
Let's move on to Slide 5 to cover the fourth quarter results. The results were solid. We had record fourth quarter performance for operating income, excluding special items, and record operating margins and earnings per share. Operating income, excluding special items, was $444 million, and the effective tax rate was 29.7%. This was an unusually high number for tax and to prior quarters and driven essentially by the geography of earnings.
In the quarter, Engineered Products and Forgings year-over-year operating margin expanded 480 basis points, while GRP expanded by 370 basis points. Both EP&F and GRP demonstrated progression in year-over-year margin for every quarter this year and in EP&F sequential a quarter. Fourth quarter earnings per share was $0.53, up 61% year-over-year and at the maximum end of our guidance range. Earnings per share for the year was odd at $2.11 and up 55% year-over-year. 
Free cash flow was $870 million, up 87% year-over-year, and this exceeded the midpoint of guidance by $120 million and has made a very [ meaningful ] improvement in free cash flow for Arconic from prior years and achieved a free cash flow conversion of 90% of net income. Please note that the free cash flow conversion guidance I provided for the 2 separated companies at the time of the last earnings call. The year-end cash balance was $1.7 billion after $1.15 billion of share repurchases and the repayment of $400 million of convertible notes. The $1.15 billion of share repurchases included a fourth quarter market share repurchase of 1.6 million shares. For the year, we repurchased approximately 55 million common shares at a weighted average price of $20.97. This leaves open share repurchase authority of $350 million, which will carry over into the future Howmet Company, if not utilized before separation. Net debt to EBITDA was 1.81x, which was a record low and an improvement from fourth quarter 2018, which was 2.05x. And lastly, after return on net assets improved year-over-year by 450 basis points to 13.7%, another record.
Now let me turn it over to Ken to provide a more detailed view of Q4 and the year."

Now let's move to Slide 6 and financial results for the quarter. In the fourth quarter, organic revenue was up $38 million year-over-year with EP&F up 2% and GRP flat. EP&F had 5% organic growth in aerospace, which represents more than 70",1610,"Thank you, John. Now let's move to Slide 6 and financial results for the quarter. In the fourth quarter, organic revenue was up $38 million year-over-year with EP&F up 2% and GRP flat. EP&F had 5% organic growth in aerospace, which represents more than 70% of its revenue, while commercial transportation declined 8%. GRP was flat as industrial products had 21% organic growth; packaging, 6%; and aerospace, 3%. These increases were offset by a decline in automotive of 9% as the Ford F-150 is transitioning to the next-generation model, and we had lower volumes due to the GM strike. Building and construction was down 8% due to softness in Europe and intentional exits of less profitable products. 
Operating income, excluding special items, for the fourth quarter, was $444 million, up 37% year-over-year. We delivered the fourth consecutive quarter of price increases with a $42 million favorable impact year-over-year. Price increases span across both segments driven by aerospace, industrial and commercial transportation, and we expect favorable pricing to continue. Weakness in our automotive and commercial transportation markets unfavorably impacted operating income by $29 million in the fourth quarter. Favorable raw material costs, including aluminum price, was a benefit to operating income of $34 million in the quarter. Similar to price, we had our fourth [ consecutive ] quarter of net cost reductions. Net cost reductions were led by cost-out program, which generated $76 million of year-over-year benefit in the quarter. This was partially offset by higher variable compensation and equity costs, which were driven by improved performance on profit, free cash flow and equity value. As expected, the transition of our Tennessee plant to more profitable industrial products showed a year-over-year improvement in the fourth quarter. The impact was $13 million. We have included the reconciliation of operating income, excluding special items, on Slide 35 of the appendix.
In the fourth quarter, adjusted free cash flow was a record at $728 million or $250 million more than the fourth quarter of last year. Please note, consistent with our guidance, we have excluded $2 million of unfavorable cash flow in the quarter related to planned separation. Days working capital improved 1 day on a year-over-year basis to 43 days with the main driver being collections. The year-over-year cash improvement was $103 million. Pension contributions and OPEB payments were $69 million in the quarter, which was $38 million more than the fourth quarter of 2018. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $167 million, which was down $104 million on a year-over-year basis. 
Diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.53 per share and 61% higher than the comparable period. The higher diluted earnings per share were primarily driven by operational improvements of $0.13, lower share count of $0.05 and lower raw material costs of $0.05.
Now let's move to the year-over-year margin expansion on Slide 7. In the fourth quarter, Arconic's margin improved 380 basis points on a year-over-year basis, while EP&F improved 480 basis points, and GRP improved 370 basis points. It is noteworthy that the year-over-year margin expansion has improved each quarter in 2019. This improvement reflects the trajectory of ongoing operational improvements, improved pricing and cost reductions.
Now let's move to the special item summary on Slide 8. In the fourth quarter, our reported results included a net favorable impact of $75 million in special items. The special items in the quarter primarily related to 3 items. First, we recorded a $94 million tax benefit related to a U.S. tax election which caused the liquidation of a foreign subsidiaries assets into our U.S. tax parent. The second special item was a cash charge of $34 million associated with the planned separation. Third, we received [ $21 million ] in closing cash related to an earn-out associated with the Texarkana plant that was sold in the fourth quarter of 2018. I would point out loss incurred in the quarter for legal and other advisory fees related to Grenfell Tower and the fire at our fasteners plant in France were largely offset by related [indiscernible] proceeds. More details concerning special items for the quarter can be found on Slides 28, 29 and 35 appendix. For the year, the majority of the special items have been consistent with the stated plan of divesting assets or businesses that do not fit our focus, require significant capital investment with unacceptable returns or are not material to our bottom line. As you would expect, approximately 1% of the charges for the year were noncash. 
Now let's move to the segment results on Slide 9. In the fourth quarter, EP&F's revenue was $1.7 billion. Organic revenue was up 2%. Segment operating profit was a record for the quarter at $354 million, up 32%. The increase in segment operating profit was driven by several favorable items, including volume growth in aerospace, higher pricing, lower raw material costs and net cost reductions. The resulting segment operating margin expanded by 480 basis points year-over-year to 20.4%.
In the fourth quarter, GRP's revenue was also $1.7 billion. Organic revenue was flat year-over-year. Segment operating profit was a record for the fourth quarter at $150 million, up 61%. The favorable year-over-year improvement in the segment operating profit was driven by favorable pricing in the industrial and commercial transportation markets, lower aluminum prices, net cost reductions and improvement in internal scrap utilization. The Tennessee transition to industrial products helped offset the declines in automotive and commercial transportation. Despite the challenges in aluminum extrusions and flat organic revenue growth, GRP segment operating margin increased 370 basis points year-over-year to 9%.
Let me move to the fourth quarter key achievements on Slide 10. Our EP&F business had record fourth quarter revenue and segment operating profit on a year-over-year basis. Aerospace organic revenue was up 5%. Favorable pricing improvements in EP&F continued in the fourth quarter as we achieved $29 million in year-over-year price increases. For the year, price improvements in the segment were $78 million. Finally, in EP&F, our expansion of the aerospace airfoils, aerospace rings and forged wheels capital expenditures are complete and ramping up in 2020.
Our GRP business had record fourth quarter segment operating profit. GRP's industrial revenue was up 20% organically year-over-year. Price improvements in industrial products and commercial transportations drove $13 million of year-over-year price increases. For the year, price improvement in the segment were $75 million. GRP's internal scrap utilization improved 180 basis points versus the same quarter of last year. 
Arconic's full year free cash flow of $870 million resulted in a free cash flow conversion of 90%. Return on net assets for the year was 13.7%, was up 450 basis points year-over-year. CapEx for the year was $579 million, approximately 4% of revenue and was down $189 million year-over-year. Approximately 65% of the CapEx was spent on return-seeking projects. A majority of our growth CapEx projects are now complete, and we expect CapEx as a percent of revenue to be less than 4% in 2020. Our cash balance was approximately $1.7 billion after we repurchased $1.15 billion of outstanding shares and paid down approximately $400 million of debt.
Now let's move to Slide 11 and the key financial results for the year. For the year, organic revenue was up $894 million with both EP&F and GRP up 6%. EP&F had 8% organic growth in aerospace and 4% growth in commercial transportation. GRP's organic revenue increase was driven by double-digit growth in aerospace, industrial products and packaging. 
Operating income, excluding special items for the year was $1.8 billion, up 29% year-over-year. Price increases were $153 million for the year and split almost equally across the segments. Higher volumes also favorably impacted operating income by $80 million for the year, mainly driven by aerospace. Lower raw material costs, including aluminum price, was favorable to operating income, $99 million for the year. Net cost reductions were led by the cost-out program, which generated approximately $213 million of year-over-year savings. This was partially offset by 3 items: the transition of our Tennessee plant, operational challenges at one of our aluminum extrusion plants and higher compensation costs driven by improved performance. 
Adjusted free cash flow in 2019 was $870 million or $405 million more than 2018. Pension contributions and OPEB payments were $345 million, which was $33 million less than 2018. At year-end, the pension and OPEB net liability was approximately $3.2 billion, up approximately $200 million year-over-year as lower discount rates impacted the liability by approximately $900 million. U.S. pension asset returns were approximately 20%, and these returns partially offset the impact of the lower discount rate. Capital expenditures for the year were $579 million, which were down $189 million compared to 2018 while making significant investment in aerospace airfoils, aerospace rings, forged wheels and industrial products.
Diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, was $2.11 per share and 55% higher than 2018. The higher diluted earnings per share were primarily driven by operational improvements of $0.47, lower raw material costs of $0.15 and lower share count of $0.12.
Before turning it back over to John, let me briefly provide an update on our capital structure, which is on Slide '19 in the appendix. We finished the year with approximately $1.7 billion of cash after executing the $1.15 billion of share repurchases and reducing debt by $400 million. Gross debt is approximately $5.9 billion, and net debt stands at $4.2 billion. Net debt to EBITDA continues to improve year over year despite the cash outflow associated with the share repurchases. Net debt to EBITDA stands at 1.81x, which is an improvement of 12% compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. 
With that, I will turn it back over to John."
416264458,650836869,1895949,"Arconic Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2020",2020-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Howmet Aerospace Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ken, and let's move to Slide 12, where I'll give you the results of the key focus items.

Price increases for the year were $153 million, and we saw good progress at both EP&F and GRP. Operating cost reductions were $213 million for the year and ahead of our annual commitment of $180 million. The annual run rate operating costs are projected to be reduced by $300 million, which is a full $100 million higher than our original commitment. 
As a result of the share repurchases, which are detailed on the slide, year-end diluted common stock share count was 440 million shares, down 13% year-on-year. Capital expenditure was $579 million, excluding $7 million associated with separation. CapEx was approximately 4% of revenue. The major focus of our 2019 capital expenditures was the expansion of airfoils and rings capacity in the Engines business, the European wheels expansion and the Tennessee industrial expansion in Rolled Products.
Annual divestiture of proceeds of approximately $190 million are expected to exceed the operating and CapEx cash cost of separation. Divestitures signed or closed will reduce annual revenue by approximately $350 million with limited operating income impact. Two previously announced transactions will close in the first quarter of 2020 with proceeds of approximately $100 million. 
Now let me move to separation. We're targeting separation for the 1st of April. We filed an amendment to the Form 10 on the 22nd of January, where we provided greater visibility into management, capital structure and pension allocation. The next step is the financing of Arconic Corp.'s spin entity. This financing commences today and is planned for completion by February 10. The Form 10 is planned to be made effective by mid-February. The planned operating date for the 2 companies is the 1st of February, where everything will be done by the 2 entities; and legal separation into the 2 listed future public companies on the 1st of April. This will have accomplished a rapid execution of separation from the time that I announced the plan upon taking the CEO role in February 2019. One last but very important item on separation is related to pension plans. The separation does not trigger any incremental cash contributions. 
Let's move to Slide 13. As you know, this earnings call precedes the Boeing call, which, while it's not ideal, is important in effecting the separation timing and the debt financing starting this afternoon. We have had many exchanges with Boeing during late December and every week throughout January and hence have a reasonable feel for their current plans in 2020. Naturally, I will not provide any details of those conversations, except to guide the Arconic numbers. Today, I will provide Q1 and earnings per share guidance numbers, plus a view of revenue and free cash flow for Arconic. At our February Investor Day, I will provide additional insight into Howmet Aerospace and new Arconic Corp., which, naturally, will be of more interest going forward. The split, as stated, is set for the 1st of April. And hence by achieving this early timing, we will be able to see 3 clean quarters in 2020. 
Now let me turn to the specific numbers but noting, firstly, that given the uncertainty to that which Boeing will exactly announce and their future increases in production plans, this causes me to provide a wider bandwidth of guidance than would be normal. Revenue is targeted to be in the range of $13.9 billion to $14.2 billion with organic growth in the range of 1% to 3%. Aerospace revenue is expected to increase year-over-year when we exclude the Boeing 737 MAX situation. If we were to include the impacts of the 737 MAX, aerospace revenue is expected to be flat year-over-year. We expect continued aerospace price increases in 2020 and growth year-over-year in industrial products driven by the transition of our Tennessee plant into more profitable industrial products. Commercial transportation is expected to experience headwinds in 2020 driven by slowing manufacturing and freight growth, lower new truck orders and the increased current inventory levels. We are targeting to mitigate those margin impacts for our forged wheels business by gaining market share, supported by our differentiated lighter-weight products. We continue to penetrate the steel wheel market with aluminum wheels. Moreover, our low-cost manufacturing wheels expansion in Hungary is now fully operational, and we will leverage our global footprint. The global rolled products business will mitigate commercial transportation headwinds with cost reduction actions.
Earnings per share, excluding special items, is expected to be in the range of $2.22 to $2.42 per share. At the midpoint, year-over-year growth is approximately 10%, including our current view of the impacts of the 737 MAX. Year-over-year growth in earnings per share will be driven by run rate cost reductions actioned in 2019 as well as incremental cost reductions in 2020, plus the continued price increases. Earnings per share for the first quarter is expected to be $0.47 to $0.53, which is an increase of approximately 16% year-over-year at the midpoint. 
Adjusted free cash flow forecast is to be between $800 million and $900 million driven by earnings, capital expenditures of less than 4% of revenue and favorable year-over-year restructuring payments. Pension and OPEB cash contributions are expected to be approximately $220 million higher than in 2019 driven by the drop in the discount rate. Free cash flow conversion is expected to be 80% with greater detail to be provided at Investor Day on February 25. Finally, regarding Grenfell, there has been no activity this quarter, and nothing has changed regarding our stance towards the matter nor our view of the expected outcomes of the litigation nor liability. 
And with that, I'd like to open the line for your questions."

I've read, I'll say, guesstimates in analyst reports which I say probably aren't too far, but I don't really want to give specificity of what the shipset value and what the margins are by any aircraft because the next question to follow will be on the next aircraft and the next aircraft, and I feel disinclined to do that at this point. 
What I would say to you is our assumption is we've got about a $400 million revenue hit, plus or minus, for the MAX. I've tried to take a fairly conservative view to guidance, especially in the light of -- it's only when we actually know what the Boeing published position is that I think we can be -- have that greater certainty. And then how we address our cost structures, we've made assumptions. And in particular of importance to us is what will be the profile exactly of the future Boeing build, both in 2020, and really importantly, in 2021 because the -- while it's, I'm going to say, relatively easy to shed labor, getting the sort of skills back given the, I'll say, very high employment level in the U.S., I mean, those are all things which are really important for us to consider. And so you've got to see the whole thing and then also how the Boeing position itself evolves over time. I mean what we've seen, as you know, over the last 6 or 9 months is fairly -- what has resulted in fairly optimistic assumptions, and we've seen many changes to those. And now we're in a situation where the production is currently halted with a view to restart and what's now viewed as a fairly conservative assumption regarding when the FAA will release the aircraft and according to statements made in the last week by the Chairman of the FAA. 
So I mean all I can say is that it's pretty confusing. And when we have that greater clarity -- and I tend to be in the optimistic camp, but at some point, the aircraft production may rise above what we think it is. And therefore, we need to be prepared for that. And how we manage labor is critical to it, what the carrying cost of that is and what we've built into the assumptions. And that's why guidance itself is particularly difficult at this point in time. But neither have I given you something that I don't feel confident in our ability to achieve, and I did call out the fact that I provided a little bit wider guidance than normal to take account of some of this uncertainty. And clearly, we're going to be updating you as we go through the year. We're going to give you further updates, hopefully, on the Investor Day on February 25. And as the -- I'd say the clarity emerges and that tries to give you color of how we've approached this whole situation and the fact that we're having to come out really a little bit earlier than normal just to affect the financing that we're in the market for starting this afternoon and enabling that, I'll say, debt raise to occur to meet the separation timing. So all these things are pretty much interlinked. And I guess, preferably, I'd have been a week or 2 later. But the most important thing for the company was to achieve, I believe, the earliest possible separation timing. So hopefully, that gives you a pretty wide view of where we've been thinking on this and how we approach it, David."

And they were not -- those investments were not there solely for the LEAP engine. It's going to provide welcome capacity relief for many of the -- for the airfoil and ring programs that we have. And so I see those assets coming on progressively during the year. Shipping increasing quantities quarter-by-quarter.

The most difficult decisions that I see coming up are going to be as we move into the middle of the year and when we have greater clarity regarding the production when indeed Boeing themselves have greater clarity regarding production. And I've commented that -- because we have seen a lot of noise and different assumptions. And then critical to that decision, the [ finality ] of how much we're going to flex labor, both the direct and indirect labor and our cost structure is going to be our view of 2021. And if we feel as though -- and if we are clear that the production is going to become much more healthy in '21 and potentially with upside, then that's going to affect and color our views upon our willingness to hold labor or not. And if we're not thinking positively, then we're going to -- I'm going to call it dive for the floor and just gut the cost structure as necessary because that's what we should do as good custodians of shareholders' money.

The -- in the early part of the year, I'm thinking that the opportunity that we have, I'll say, in discussion with GE around the ability to bring forward and build some of the spare engines is going to be important, both to push in their production and our production to have a smoother approach to this because while it's difficult to move production up and down on, let's call it, the structural side of the aircraft, but on the engine side, you flex up and down at your peril. And if we were to cut that and then try to rebuild it back to a number of 42 or 52  or 57, then that will become almost impossible, not just for Arconic, but for the whole of the industry. So that does not flex -- this is a matter of production, I'll say, difficulty and complexity. That doesn't flex anything like the structural side, even though neither side are difficult. And therefore, what we are thinking about is with, I'll say, some of the spares, clearance and building of spare engines, which I believe is being considered and planned, that should help smooth the year and, in particular, provide the ability to move engine production back up again as we move into 2021. But again, it's cloudy. I wish it were -- we had greater clarity of what exactly those builds will be for the next 24 months and beyond, but we don't. So we -- living in this world that we inhabit. And so at the moment, obviously, we're cushioning it, both ourselves and within GE, and then seeing how we can manage the overall production, both with a view of both the material input for the specialty metals and also the critical skills that we have in that business."

The constraint around tooling and then, I'll say, specific specialty alloy requirements is such that you don't say, ""Well, we're making less of these, and then so we can flip it up and make more of those."" We do see Airbus trying to make more, and we see -- decide to build more engines, and that will be great, and that will be also for the Geared Turbofan, but we know that some of the issues there, which we can read about recently in India. So it isn't as though that capacity is fungible. You move it to somewhere else. It really doesn't work like that. 
Clearly, if it's a rolled sheet and that was there, but the aircraft itself is constrained by many other factors. So it just doesn't -- you can't say it's a $400 million, but that's now, let's go and offset it by $100 million so we can go sell elsewhere. So hopefully, that gives you that one.

And then I'm not going to comment on which month they said that they will recommence. That's not for me to talk about on this call and then neither about the rate. So if you think about it in a strictly logical sense, it would be, obviously, more impact in the first half of the year, just because we're not producing any. It's going to have a bigger impact when the assumption may be they're building a certain quantity in the back half -- end of the year. At the same time, that may be smoothed a little bit by the willingness or not of -- to carry inventory, particularly by Boeing themselves. And so we're in those -- in that dialogue at the moment to try to see what -- how it flows exactly from the aircraft and what part of inventory management taken into account of all this to -- again, all with a view to trying to help the labor management situation that I've talked about, which is really the -- probably the most complicated part of this in trying to come up with the right judgment. And then with my comment, which I provided earlier, which was the critical thing is going to be how we see the exit rate for the year and what will be the 2021 production. So there's -- I'll say it's a lot of things to consider. It's not just the -- strictly the aircraft build per se or the currently no-build situation to inventory management and labor management in all of this, affecting both top and bottom line and its profile during the course of the year."

A little bit of an unusual circumstance, in that for the first time in probably 15 or 16 years of doing the earnings call, I haven't been in the same room as the CFO. However, we'll get on with it. I recognize that this earnings call is a little earlier than normal, but we felt it both opportune and appropriate given the current economic environment and the separation event that occurred for the company on the 1st of April. 
Let's move to Slide 4. As you know, on the 1st of April, we legally separated Arconic Inc., the reported entity, today into 2 companies. Howmet Aerospace, which is [indiscernible], and that's companies primarily focused on the aerospace sector and contains 4 business units within the former Engineered Products and Forging segment. Arconic Corporation, SpinCo, is primarily focused on rolled and extruded aluminum products to various end markets. Arconic Corporation contains the 3 business units within the former Global Rolled Products segment. 
Let me cover the Q1 results before talking further about the current environment that we're currently managing against. Now let's move to Slide 5. Please note, all the numbers relating to Q1 are what we currently expect. We will finalize results and discuss them in greater detail on the 5th of May. For Q1, revenues were approximately $3.2 billion, down 9% versus 2019 and down 6% organically, adjusting for the pass-through effect of the lower aluminum prices, currency and the disposal of certain businesses. We experienced declines in the commercial transportation, automotive and aerospace markets, partially offset by growth in the industrial market. Year-over-year market declines were driven by the disruptions from COVID-19 and  the Boeing 737 MAX production reduction. 
Moving to the segments. EP&F revenues were down 4% organically. And GRP revenues were down 7% organically. 
Please move to Slide #6 for the operating profit. Operating profit, excluding special items, increased approximately $78 million year-on-year. And that was 20% resulting increase, resulting in a record margin of approximately 14.7%. We expect margin expansion of about 350 basis points year-over-year for Arconic Inc., with 300 basis points for EP&F, and 310 basis points for GRP. Further profit performance progression was driven by the benefit of net cost reductions actioned last year as well as lower raw material costs and the price increases in the EP&F segment. Margin expansion is also expected to improve sequentially in both segments, having coming off the best ever fourth quarter results. When I look at each of the individual businesses in the 2 segments, every business increase its margins year-over-year despite being impacted by the disruptions I previously mentioned related to COVID and the MAX production reduction for the first quarter. I also note that the 1 troubled business in 2019, namely extrusion in the GRP segment, moves into profit, and compared favorably to every quarter that we experienced in 2019, and this is a very significant turnaround. 
Now let me move to Slide #7. Earnings per share, excluding special items, is expected to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.62, up approximately 42% from $0.43 per share in Q1 of 2019. Earnings per share increased primarily due to the operational improvements from corporate and segment productivity. Special charges totaled approximately $60 million after-tax and were primarily driven by the separation costs of some $50 million and severance costs of $16 million. The severance costs are tied to our new $100 million cost reduction initiative to align the cost base as we move into a period of demand uncertainty. 
Now let's turn to liquidity on Slide #8. Arconic's pre-separation Q1 cash balance was approximately $2.65 billion. Adjusted free cash flow, excluding separation costs, improved $50 million year-over-year and was in the range of negative $200 million to $230 million, driven by the normal seasonal working capital build and significantly higher 2019 annual variable compensation payments. Q1 cash outflow associated with separation was approximately $110 million, and there is approximately $40 million of cash outflow expected in Q2, primarily associated with the early debt repayment that has already occurred on April 6. Howmet Aerospace post-separation cash balance is approximately $850 million after the $1.3 billion early redemption -- early debt repayments, and allocation of $500 million of cash to the opening balance sheet of Arconic Corporation. The $850 million of cash is more than 2x the amount necessary to fund seasonal working capital changes. Howmet Aerospace's liquidity is strong, and also, we have an undrawn revolver of $1.5 billion. Lastly, in terms of notable impacts on the Q1 trading and operations, the impacts worth noting are: COVID-19 disruptions; the Boeing 737 MAX production suspension; and the fire at one of our North American wheels plants. 
Let's move to Slide #9. Turning now to COVID-19. We felt impacts from certain customer set down or suspensions and disruption within certain shifts. Some of Arconic Inc.'s plants were closed for a period during March due to the virus. Plant closures averaged approximately 7 days in the month. 
Now I'll turn to the outlook, which I confine my comments solely to Howmet Aerospace. Currently, Howmet Aerospace has 8 manufacturing plants which are closed. Currently, we have limited visibility of future demand because many of our customers are closed because of the coronavirus and the impacts on their employees, information flow is limited, and hence, in the face of this uncertainty, we're reducing costs and preserving cash given the lack of clarity. We find ourselves unable to provide reliable guidance to you, and therefore, withdraw the guidance provided at the February 25 Investor Day. And as you know, we treat guidance as a very serious future tracking view. To mitigate the impact of the coronavirus disruptions, we have commenced plans to reduce by a further $100 million of cost on a run rate basis. This plan is incremental to the 2019 cost reductions, which was carried over into 2020, and is primarily driven by incremental overhead and manufacturing reductions. Moreover, we're evaluating reducing capital expenditure due to the lower volumes. We have temporarily suspended the dividend to preserve cash to provide for additional flexibility. We'll continue to finalize the first quarter results and go into more detail on the May 5. Additional slides have been provided in the appendix. 
And with that, I'll now move to Q&A."

In fact, what we had done, if you go back to earlier, in the last earnings call in, I think, late January, one of the concerns I had then was trying to manage us -- our way through the 737 situation, and indeed, protecting the, I'll say, vital skills to be able to do that. At the same time, recognizing that we were going to face a potential for a further reduction in labor to stay [indiscernible] in the summer. I think it's a great credit to our team that we managed to actually plan our way through and level set what we're doing in our manufacturing against the former or the current Boeing plant. And so we're able to eliminate that labor concern at the summer. Obviously, in the current environment, we're now unsure because we don't know what will be the rate of return for the 737. But as it stands at the moment, we are in, I would say, in good shape to be able to meet customer demand. We will then, as we begin to know more about the shape of future aircraft builds, then take another view about what further cost reductions will be necessary to take after that. All the time, we are interested in protecting the bottom line as much as we are able to, with the demand reduction, which is likely to occur, and also to stay in a cash-generative situation."

We actually don't have any great detail of what inventory customers are carrying. I'm always very cognizant of the, I'll say, the multiplier effect that inventory can have in a down market for the end product. I think the missable point for Howmet would be for our engine business. I think, as you know, we were in a position of excess demand for almost continuously for the last 2-plus year. And that's the reason why we built those 2 new plants in Whitehall and Morristown, it's Whitehall, Michigan; and Morristown, Tennessee. Obviously, it's a little bit unfortunate that we now have the capacity and we have a more uncertain demand, However, as you know, I think on the previous call, I did commented that we exited 2019 with actually a higher [indiscernible] position in aggregate across our engine business than we had when we entered the year and didn't make particular headway in the first quarter against that. So my thought is, I wouldn't be surprised to see some of those areas vaporize in the case of falling demand. But at the same time, I feel there's a level of protection for some, let's say $2.5 billion, $3 billion of revenue within the company. And my thoughts, I would say it's knowledge, my thought is that the inventory multiplier effect may be fairly muted upon us, albeit it will be more significant in, let's say, in the rings part of that business and also in our structural business and potentially fastener. So it's -- there's no one single answer. And then at the same time -- and the one thing which is a bright spot for us, so I think, as you know, out of approximately $7 billion of aerospace revenue or Howmet revenue last year, fractionally under $1 billion is related to defense, and so let's call it, for sake of argument, $900 million, $950 million. And that was a source of strength for us in the first quarter. We saw approximately, I must say, it's around about 17%. I mean, not exactly precise, but over 15% increase in that demand in Q1. And at the moment, we don't expect anything but further strength in that part of the business going forward. So again, you need to bifurcate that, which goes to the commercial sector, which is by segment, and then also consider the defense aspect of the business. And also part of our industrial business in [indiscernible] too has actually had also very solid demand in the first quarter. So that's probably $400 million to $500 million of revenue, which also increased double digits. So you need to bifurcate all of that when you come up with revenue estimates."

And if we use that as a proxy for everything else at the moment, then my current feeling is that we will remain cash positive through the year as we go through it. And so when I look at the cash profile of what was Arconic Inc. and then with the cash profile of Howmet, at the moment, assuming that's a sort of revenue type of adjustment, am feeling and sensing, it's not quite the same as saying I know, because I'm not sure enough yet about all the promise of demand reduction, how the -- everything else will phase in. But I expect that 2020 will be a cash flow positive year after payment of interest, after payment of pension contributions. So that's net after everything that we currently envisaged."

So if you go back to your question, minimum cash to run the business, we've said $400 million. And to John's point, that's a pretty conservative number. We usually don't need that much. But why $400 million? It's because we normally have our biggest working capital burn or cash burn in the first quarter as you're bringing up revenue, you're bringing up inventory and all that. The first quarter is now behind us, right? So we've done the working capital build. We're comfortable. So as you move through Q2 to Q4, you're in much better shape because you've already done your working capital burn."

So my philosophical stance is that I really don't treat anything as fixed, with the exception of depreciation, because that really is a decision of the past and we cannot change that. Everything else is changeable, only question is the time line on which you change it. So that's how I will say my stance relative to those type of discussions. And because I think it's the duty of every good business to challenge everything that you do. So that's how I start off. Then I'm going to reach back into history just to try and give you a view. So in, let's say, a prior life, and going back to the business I was involved with in 2008, 2009, which I think, as you know, is in the automotive business, which -- it has margins far less than Howmet's. So let's think of margins about 1/3 of Howmet's, and in recognizing what we faced off to, there we moved quickly, and we moved often. And so first of all, you must not assume that the $100 million is done and gone, and that's it. So we moved successively at that time, and we only experienced the 2 quarters of operating loss. And of course, I'm not indicating for one second at the moment that we have operating loss, I'm just trying to say to you, that was pretty good and pretty unique for that industry. So in terms of what we will do and what we're doing is that you saw in Q1 that we actually have already taken a reserve. We're already implementing those cost reductions. And by no means that we called out that what we've done is it. And so once we are clearer what is the shape of the business going forward, and as we move through 2020, and also into '21, because we also need to also think we're managing for a package project that which is vital for the future, is that we'll have a better view over what shape will be our next action that we'll undertake to, I'll say, to preserve as best we can the performance of the company. So it's a long way of saying, I can't give you the exact number because I don't know at this point. We should assume that we will be -- have a very keen eye to the cost base of the business and move accordingly. Then we'll focus on the cash flow of the business. We would also examine capital expenditure. And then the final part of your question, which was, what are the decremental margins? I don't want to call that out at the moment. We will see whether we're able to say anything further in that regard in the more detailed call that we'll hold in early May, once we may have a better handle on the demand pattern going forward."

So substantially overdelivered, but it's not we're talking about Howmet in moving forward. If you took that $213 million and said, how much of that was Howmet last year? It's about $110 million. Roughly half. And we said that you're going to get some benefit in 2020 of another $50 million in 2020, just of that carry through of that cost out action that we took last year. So $50 million incremental this year. We'll go into more detail on the May 5 call, but if you look at the first quarter alone for Howmet of that $50 million annually, we've got a little bit more than $20 million.

And obviously, you refined that and further looked at and examined it in March. Well, first of all, in -- I'll say in January, first of all, and then again in March.

And I know that -- well, I haven't had subsequent conversations because I really don't want to interfere, except that I've said my telephone line is always open metaphorically, my door isn't at the moment because we are in different places.

It's now that is really difficult. And we're facing the same position at the moment. As a count, we did have 9 plants or 8 plants which are currently closed because of -- and they're tend to be the smaller plants, but they are closed.

A little bit of an unusual circumstance, in that for the first time in probably 15 or 16 years of doing the earnings call, I haven't been in the same room as the CFO. However, we'll get on with it. I recognize that this earnings call is a little earlier than normal, but we felt it both opportune and appropriate given the current economic environment and the separation event that occurred for the company on the 1st of April. 
Let's move to Slide 4. As you know, on the 1st of April, we legally separated Arconic Inc., the reported entity today into 2 companies: Howmet Aerospace, which is RemainCo, and that's companies primarily focused on the aerospace sector and contains 4 business units within the former Engineered Products and Forgings segment; Arconic Corporation, SpinCo, is primarily focused on rolled and extruded aluminum products to various end markets. Arconic Corporation contains the 3 business units within the former Global Rolled Products segment. 
Let me cover the Q1 results before talking further about the current environment that we're currently managing against. Now let's move to Slide 5. Please note, all the numbers relating to Q1 are what we currently expect. We will finalize results and discuss them in greater detail on the 5th of May. For Q1, revenues were approximately $3.2 billion, down 9% versus 2019 and down 6% organically, adjusting for the pass-through effect of the lower aluminum prices, currency and the disposal of certain businesses. We experienced declines in the commercial transportation, automotive and aerospace markets, partially offset by growth in the industrial market. Year-over-year market declines were driven by the disruptions from COVID-19 and the Boeing 737 MAX production reduction. Moving to the segments. EP&F revenues were down 4% organically and GRP revenues were down 7% organically. 
Please move to Slide #6 for the operating profit. Operating profit, excluding special items, increased approximately $78 million year-on-year. And that was 20% resulting increase, resulting in a record margin of approximately 14.7%. We expect margin expansion of about 350 basis points year-over-year for Arconic Inc., with 300 basis points for EP&F and 310 basis points for GRP. Further profit performance progression was driven by the benefit of net cost reductions actioned last year as well as lower raw material costs and the price increases in the EP&F segment. Margin expansion is also expected to improve sequentially in both segments, having coming off the best ever fourth quarter results. When I look at each of the individual businesses in the 2 segments, every business increased its margins year-over-year despite being impacted by the disruptions I previously mentioned related to COVID and the MAX production cessation for the first quarter. I also note that the one troubled business in 2019, namely extrusions in the GRP segment moved into profit and compared favorably to every quarter that we experienced in 2019, and this is a very significant turnaround. 
Now let me move to Slide #7. Earnings per share, excluding special items, is expected to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.62, up approximately 42% from $0.43 per share in Q1 of 2019. Earnings per share increased primarily due to the operational improvements from corporate and segment productivity. Special charges totaled approximately $60 million after-tax and were primarily driven by the separation costs of some $50 million and severance costs of $16 million. The severance costs are tied to our new $100 million cost reduction initiative to align the cost base as we move into a period of demand uncertainty. 
Now let's turn to liquidity on Slide #8. Arconic Inc.'s pre-separation Q1 cash balance was approximately $2.65 billion. Adjusted free cash flow, excluding separation costs, improved $50 million year-over-year and was in the range of negative $200 million to $230 million, driven by the normal seasonal working capital build and significantly higher 2019 annual variable compensation payments. Q1 cash outflow associated with separation was approximately $110 million, and there is approximately $40 million of cash outflow expected in Q2, primarily associated with the early debt repayment that has already occurred on April 6. Howmet Aerospace post-separation cash balance is approximately $850 million after the $1.3 billion early redemption -- early debt repayments and allocation of $500 million of cash to the opening balance sheet of Arconic Corporation. The $850 million of cash is more than 2x the amount necessary to fund seasonal working capital changes. Howmet Aerospace's liquidity is strong, and also, we have an undrawn revolver of $1.5 billion. Lastly, in terms of notable impacts on the Q1 trading and operations, the impacts worth noting are: COVID-19 disruptions; the Boeing 737 MAX production suspension; and the fire at one of our North American wheels plants. 
Let's move to Slide #9. Turning now to COVID-19. We felt impacts from certain customer shutdowns or suspensions and disruption within certain shifts. Some of Arconic Inc.'s plants were closed for a period during March due to the virus. Plant closures averaged approximately 7 days in the month. 
Now I'll turn to the outlook, which I'll confine my comments solely to Howmet Aerospace. Currently, Howmet Aerospace has 8 manufacturing plants which are closed. Currently, we have limited visibility of future demand. Many of our customers are closed because of the coronavirus and the impacts on their employees. Information flow is limited. And hence, in the face of this uncertainty, we're reducing costs and preserving cash given the lack of clarity. We find ourselves unable to provide reliable guidance to you, and therefore, withdraw the guidance provided at the February 25 Investor Day. And as you know, we treat guidance as a very serious future tracking view. To mitigate the impact of the coronavirus disruptions, we have commenced plans to reduce by a further $100 million of cost on a run rate basis. This plan is incremental to the 2019 cost reductions, which carry over into 2020, and is primarily driven by incremental overhead and manufacturing reductions. Moreover, we're evaluating reducing capital expenditure due to the lower volumes. We have temporarily suspended the dividend to preserve cash to provide for additional flexibility. We'll continue to finalize the first quarter results and go into more detail on May 5. Additional slides have been provided in the appendix. 
And with that, I'll now move to Q&A."

In fact, what we had done, if you go back to earlier, the last earnings call in, I think, late January, one of the concerns I had then was trying to manage our way through the 737 situation, and indeed, protecting the, I'll say, vital skills to be able to do that. At the same time, recognizing that we were going to face a potential for a further reduction in labor to stay soft a lot in the summer. I think it's a great credit to our team that we managed to actually plan our way through and level set what we're doing in our manufacturing against the former or the current Boeing plant. And so we're able to eliminate that labor concern at the summer. Obviously, in the current environment, we're now unsure because we don't know what will be the rate return for the 737. But as it stands at the moment, we are in, I would say, in good shape to be able to meet customer demand. We will then, as we begin to know more about the shape of future aircraft builds, then take another view about what further cost reductions will be necessary to face after that. All the time, we are interested in protecting the bottom line as much as we are able to, with the demand reduction, which is likely to occur, and also to stay in a cash-generative situation."

And so I wonder if you guys have much visibility into that. And so how we can think about, sort of once we set our rate expectations, what kind of revenue impact, how that might face given those rate expectations."
416264458,662884251,1954742,"Howmet Aerospace Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 14, 2020",2020-04-14,"Earnings Calls","Howmet Aerospace Inc.","Executives","Yes. We actually don't have any great detail of what inventory customers are carrying. I'm always very cognizant of the, I'll say, the multiplier effect that inventory can have in a down market for the end product. I think the notable point for Howmet wou",457,"Yes. We actually don't have any great detail of what inventory customers are carrying. I'm always very cognizant of the, I'll say, the multiplier effect that inventory can have in a down market for the end product. I think the notable point for Howmet would be for our engine business. I think, as you know, we were in a position of excess demand for almost continuously for the last 2-plus year. And that's the reason why we built those 2 new plants in Whitehall and Morristown; it's Whitehall, Michigan and Morristown, Tennessee. Obviously, it's a little bit unfortunate that we now have the capacity and we have a more uncertain demand. 
However, as you know, I think on the previous call, I did comment that we exited 2019 with actually a higher arrears position in aggregate across our engine business than we had when we entered the year and didn't make particular headway in the first quarter against that. So my thought is, I wouldn't be surprised to see some of those arrears vaporize in the case of falling demand. But at the same time, I feel there's a level of protection. So for some, it's a $2.5 billion, $3 billion of revenue within the company. And my thoughts, I would say it's knowledge. My thought is that the inventory multiplier effect may be fairly muted upon us, albeit it will be more significant in, let's say, in the rings part of our business and also in our structural business and potentially fasteners. So it's -- there's no one single answer. 
And then at the same time -- and the one thing which is a bright spot for us, so I think, as you know, out of approximately $7 billion of aerospace revenue or in Howmet revenue last year, fractionally under $1 billion related to defense. And so let's call it, for sake of argument, $900 million, $950 million. And that was a source of strength for us in the first quarter. We saw approximately, I must say, it's around about 17%. I mean not exactly precise, but over 15% increase in that demand in Q1. And at the moment, we don't expect anything but further strength in that part of the business going forward. So again, you need to bifurcate that, which goes to the commercial sector, which is by segment, and then also consider the defense aspect of the business. And also part of our industrial business that we face off to, it actually had also very solid demand in the first quarter. So -- and that's probably $400 million to $500 million of revenue, which also increased double digits. So you need to bifurcate all of that when you come up with revenue estimates."

But for my thought process, it's -- that's very conservative way of thinking about it. 
You're right about the undrawn revolver, and that's there for us. We are studying the current debt markets to see whether there's something we should be doing with regard that, but haven't settled on a final plan at this point in time. But we're cognizant that with the support of the Federal Reserve into the credit markets, they do seem to be falling a little bit. And we continue to watch those to see how things are progressing. 
I think that covered everything, David, is that right?"

But I have seen the announced plans of Airbus producing, for example, the narrow-body production from 60 a month down to 40 a month. And if you use that as a proxy for everything else at the moment, then my current feeling is that we will remain cash positive through the year as we go through it. And so when I look at the cash profile of what was Arconic Inc. and then when I look at the cash profile of Howmet, at the moment, assuming that's a sort of revenue type of adjustment, then I'm feeling and sensing -- it's not quite the same as saying I know, because I'm not sure enough yet about all the promise of demand reduction, how the -- everything else will phase in. But I expect that 2020 will be a cash flow positive year after payment of interest, after payment of pension contributions. So that's net after everything that we currently envisage."

But why $400 million? It's because we normally have our biggest working capital burn or cash burn in the first quarter as you're bringing up revenue, you're bringing up inventory and all that.

What I -- what I'd like to comment, first of all, my philosophical stance then bring it to practicality. So my philosophical stance is that I really don't treat anything as fixed, with the exception of depreciation, because that really is a decision of the past and we cannot change that. Everything else is changeable, only question is the time line on which you change it. And so that's how I will say my stance relative to those type of discussions. And because I think it's the duty of every good business to challenge everything that you do. So that's how I start off. Then I'm going to reach back into history just to try and give you a view. 
So in, let's say, a prior life, and going back to the business I was involved with in 2008, 2009, which I think, as you know, is in the automotive business, which has margins far less than Howmet's. So let's think of margins about 1/3 of Howmet's, and in recognizing what we faced off to, there we moved quickly and we moved often. And so first of all, you must not assume that the $100 million is done and gone, and that's it. So we moved successively at that time, and we only experienced the 2 quarters of operating loss. And of course, I'm not indicating for one second at the moment that we have operating loss. I'm just trying to say to you, that was pretty good and pretty unique for that industry. So in terms of what we will do and what we're doing is that you saw in Q1 that we actually have already taken a reserve. We're already implementing those cost reductions. And by no means that we called out that what we've done is it. And so once we are clearer on what is the shape of the business going forward, and as we move through 2020 and also into '21, because we also need to also think we're managing for a package project that -- which is vital for the future, is that we'll have a better view over what shape will be our next action that we'll undertake to, I'll say, to preserve as best we can the performance of the company. 
So it's a long way of saying, I can't give you the exact number because I don't know at this point. We should assume that we will be -- have a very keen eye to the cost base of the business and move accordingly. Then we'll focus on the cash flow of the business. We would also examine capital expenditure. And then the final part of your question, which was, what are the decremental margins? I don't want to call that out at the moment. We will see whether we're able to say anything further in that regard in the more detailed call that we'll hold in early May, once we may have a better handle on the demand pattern going forward."

But it's now we're talking about Howmet in moving forward. If you took that $213 million and said how much of that was Howmet last year, it's about $110 million, roughly half that. And we said that you're going to get some benefit in 2020 of another $50 million in 2020, just the carry-through of that cost-out action that we took last year. So $50 million incremental this year. We'll go into more detail on the May 5 call. But if you look at the first quarter alone for Howmet of that $50 million annually, we've got a little bit more than $20 million.

And so to come up with anything that's meaningful in terms of it was this utilization, it's now though -- is really difficult. And we're facing the same position at the moment. As I commented, we did have 9 plants or 8 plants which are currently closed because of -- and they tend to be the smaller plants, but they are closed. For most of our important plants, they're open, functioning and are deemed essential, as you'd expect for those -- the top products we do, plus also serving the defense industry. 
And so at the moment, we are functioning, I would say, well, but clearly, not at the level we were in the first 2 months of the year. And it's pretty difficult.

A little bit of an unusual circumstance in that for the first time in probably 15 or 16 years of doing earnings call, I haven't been in the same room as the CFO. However, we'll get on with it. I recognize that this earnings call is a little earlier than normal, but we felt it both opportune and appropriate given the current economic environment and the separation event that occurred for the company on the 1st of April. 
Let's move to Slide 4. As you know, on the 1st of April, we legally separated Arconic Inc., the reported entity today, into 2 companies: Howmet Aerospace, which is remainco, and that's companies primarily focused on the aerospace sector and contains 4 business units within the former Engineered Products and Forgings segment; Arconic Corporation, spinco, is primarily focused on rolled and extruded aluminum products to various end markets. Arconic Corporation contains the 3 business units within the former Global Rolled Products segment. 
Let me cover the Q1 results before talking further about the current environment that we're currently managing against. Now let's move to Slide 5. Please note all the numbers relating to Q1 are what we currently expect. We will finalize results and discuss them in greater detail on the 5th of May. For Q1, revenues were approximately $3.2 billion, down 9% versus 2019 and down 6% organically, adjusting for the pass-through effect of the lower aluminum prices, currency and the disposal of certain businesses. We experienced declines in the commercial transportation, automotive and aerospace markets, partially offset by growth in the industrial market. Year-over-year market declines were driven by the disruptions from COVID-19 and the Boeing 737 MAX production reduction. Moving to the segments, EP&F revenues were down 4% organically and GRP revenues were down 7% organically. 
Please move to Slide #6 for the operating profit. Operating profit, excluding special items, increased approximately $78 million year-on-year. And that was 20% resulting increase, resulting in a record margin of approximately 14.7%. We expect margin expansion of about 350 basis points year-over-year for Arconic Inc., with 300 basis points for EP&F and 310 basis points for GRP. Further profit performance progression was driven by the benefit of net cost reductions actioned last year as well as lower raw material costs and the price increases in the EP&F segment. Margin expansion is also expected to improve sequentially in both segments, having coming off the best ever fourth quarter results. When I look at each of the individual businesses in the 2 segments, every business increased its margins year-over-year despite being impacted by the disruptions I previously mentioned related to COVID and the MAX production cessation for the first quarter. I also note that the one troubled business in 2019, namely extrusions in the GRP segment, moved into profit and compared favorably to every quarter that we experienced in 2019, and this is a very significant turnaround. 
Now let me move to Slide #7. Earnings per share, excluding special items, is expected to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.62, up approximately 42% from $0.43 per share in Q1 of 2019. Earnings per share increased primarily due to the operational improvements from corporate and segment productivity. Special charges totaled approximately $60 million after tax and were primarily driven by the separation costs of some $50 million and severance costs of $16 million. The severance costs are tied to our new $100 million cost reduction initiative to align the cost base as we move into a period of demand uncertainty. 
Now let's turn to liquidity on Slide #8. Arconic Inc.'s pre-separation Q1 cash balance was approximately $2.65 billion. Adjusted free cash flow, excluding separation costs, improved $50 million year-over-year and was in the range of negative $200 million to $230 million, driven by the normal seasonal working capital build and significantly higher 2019 annual variable compensation payments. Q1 cash outflow associated with separation was approximately $110 million, and there is approximately $40 million of cash outflow expected in Q2, primarily associated with the early debt repayment that has already occurred on April 6. Howmet Aerospace post-separation cash balance is approximately $850 million after the $1.3 billion early redemption -- early debt repayment and allocation of $500 million of cash to the opening balance sheet of Arconic Corporation. The $850 million of cash is more than 2x the amount necessary to fund seasonal working capital changes. Howmet Aerospace's liquidity is strong, and also, we have an undrawn revolver of $1.5 billion. Lastly, in terms of notable impacts on Q1 trading and operations, the impacts worth noting are: COVID-19 disruptions; the Boeing 737 MAX production suspension; and the fire at one of our North American wheels plants. 
Let's move to Slide #9. Turning now to COVID-19. We felt impacts from certain customer shutdowns or suspensions and disruption within certain shifts. Some of Arconic Inc.'s plants were closed for a period during March due to the virus. Plant closures averaged approximately 7 days in the month. 
Now I'll turn to the outlook, which I'll confine my comments solely to Howmet Aerospace. Currently, Howmet Aerospace has 8 manufacturing plants which are closed. Currently, we have limited visibility of future demand. Many of our customers are closed because of the coronavirus and the impacts on their employees. Information flow is limited. And hence, in the face of this uncertainty, we're reducing costs and preserving cash given the lack of clarity. We find ourselves unable to provide reliable guidance to you, and therefore, withdraw the guidance provided at the February 25 Investor Day. And as you know, we treat guidance as a very serious future tracking view. To mitigate the impact of the coronavirus disruptions, we have commenced plans to reduce by a further $100 million of cost on a run rate basis. This plan is incremental to the 2019 cost reductions, which carry over into 2020, and is primarily driven by incremental overhead and manufacturing reductions. Moreover, we're evaluating reducing capital expenditure due to the lower volumes. We have temporarily suspended the dividend to preserve cash to provide for additional flexibility. We'll continue to finalize the first quarter results and go into more detail on May 5. Additional slides have been provided in the appendix. 
And with that, I'll now move to Q&A."

In fact, what we had done, if you go back to earlier, the last earnings call in, I think, late January, one of the concerns I had then was trying to manage our way through the 737 situation, and indeed, protecting the, I'll say, vital skills to be able to do that, at the same time recognizing that we were going to face a potential for a further reduction in labor to stay soft a lot in the summer. I think it's a great credit to our team that we managed to actually plan our way through and level set what we're doing in our manufacturing against the former -- or the current Boeing plant. And so we're able to eliminate that labor concern of the summer. Obviously, in the current environment, we're now unsure because we don't know what will be the rate return for the 737. But as it stands at the moment, we are in -- I would say, in good shape to be able to meet customer demand. We will then, as we begin to know more about the shape of future aircraft builds, then take another view about what further cost reductions will be necessary to face after that. All the time, we are interested in protecting the bottom line as much as we are able to with the demand reduction, which is likely to occur, and also to stay in a cash-generative situation."

And so how we can think about, sort of once we set our rate expectations, what kind of revenue impact Howmet might face given those rate expectations."
416264458,662884251,1954821,"Howmet Aerospace Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 14, 2020",2020-04-14,"Earnings Calls","Howmet Aerospace Inc.","Executives","Yes.

We actually don't have any great detail of what inventory our customers are carrying. I'm always very cognizant of the -- I'll say, the multiplier effect that inventory can have in a down market for the end product. I think the notable point for Howmet would be for our engine business. I think, as you know, we were in a position of excess demand for almost continuously for the last 2-plus year. And that's the reason why we built those 2 new plants in Whitehall and Morristown. That's Whitehall, Michigan and Morristown, Tennessee. Obviously, it's a little bit unfortunate that we now have the capacity and we have a more uncertain demand. 
However, as you know, I think on a previous call, I did comment that we exited 2019 with actually a higher arrears position in aggregate across our engine business than we had when we entered the year and didn't make particular headway in the first quarter against that. So my thought is, I wouldn't be surprised to see some of those arrears vaporize in the case of falling demand. But at the same time, I feel there's a level of protection. So for some, it's $2.5 billion, $3 billion of revenue within the company. And my thought -- I would say it's knowledge. My thought is that the inventory multiplier effect may be fairly muted upon us, albeit it will be more significant in -- let's say, in the rings part of our business and also in our structural business and potentially fasteners. So it's -- there's no one single answer. 
And then at the same time -- I mean the one thing which is a bright spot for us, so I think, as you know, out of approximately $7 billion of aerospace revenue -- or in Howmet revenue last year, fractionally under $1 billion related to defense. And so let's call it, for sake of argument, $900 million, $950 million. And that was a source of strength for us in the first quarter. We saw approximately -- I must say, it's around about 17%. I mean not exactly precise, but over 15% increase in that demand in Q1. And at the moment, we don't expect anything but further strength in that part of the business going forward. So again, you need to bifurcate that, which goes to the commercial sector, which is by segment, and then also consider the defense aspect of the business. And also part of our industrial business that we face off to, it actually had also very solid demand in the first quarter. So -- and that's probably $400 million to $500 million of revenue, which also increased double digits. So you need to bifurcate all of that when you come up with revenue estimates."

But for my thought process, it's -- that's very conservative way of thinking about it. 
You're right about the undrawn revolver, and that's there for us. We are studying the current debt markets to see whether there's something we should be doing with regard that but haven't settled on a final plan at this point in time. But we're cognizant that with the support of the Federal Reserve into the credit markets, they do seem to be falling a little bit. And we continue to watch those to see how things are progressing.

And so if I use at the moment the only thing that I feel as though, I say I know, and that's -- you always -- you say -- when you say you know something, maybe it's difficult these days. But I have seen the announced plans of Airbus producing, for example, the narrow-body production from 60 a month down to 40 a month. And if you use that as a proxy for everything else at the moment, then my current feeling is that we will remain cash positive through the year as we go through it. And so when I look at the cash profile of what was Arconic Inc. and then I look at cash profile of Howmet, at the moment, assuming that's a sort of revenue type of adjustment, then I'm feeling and sensing -- it's not quite the same as saying I know because I'm not sure enough yet about all the promise of demand reduction, how the -- everything else will phase in. But I expect that 2020 will be a cash flow positive year after payment of interest, after payment of pension contributions. So that's net after everything that we currently envisage."

But why $400 million? It's because we normally have our biggest working capital burn or cash burn in the first quarter. As you're bringing up revenue, you're bringing up inventory and all that.

What I'd like to comment, first of all, my philosophical stance then bring it to practicality. So my philosophical stance is that I really don't treat anything as fixed, with the exception of depreciation, because that really is a decision of the past and we cannot change that. Everything else is changeable. Main question is the time line on which you change it. And so that's how I will say my stance relative to those type of discussions. And because I think it's the duty of every good business to challenge everything that you do. So that's how I start off. Then I'm going to reach back into history just to try and give you a view. 
So in, let's say, a prior life, and going back to the business I was involved with in 2008, 2009, which I think, as you know, is in the automotive business, which has margins far less than Howmet's. So let's think of margins about 1/3 of Howmet's, and in recognizing what we faced off to, there, we moved quickly and we moved often. And so first of all, you must not assume that the $100 million is done and gone, and that's it. So we moved successively at that time, and we only experienced the 2 quarters of operating loss. And of course, I'm not indicating for one second at the moment that we have operating loss. I'm just trying to say to you, that was pretty good and pretty unique for that industry. So in terms of what we will do and what we're doing is that you saw in Q1 that we actually have already taken a reserve. We're already implementing those cost reductions. And by no means that we called out that what we've done is it. And so once we are clearer on what is the shape of the business going forward as we move through 2020 and also into '21, because we also need to also think we're managing for and [ package predict ] that -- which is vital for the future, is that we'll have a better view over what shape will be our next action that we'll undertake to -- I'll say, to preserve as best we can the performance of the company. 
So it's a long way of saying, I can't give you the exact number because I don't know at this point. We should assume that we will be -- have a very keen eye to the cost base of the business and move accordingly. Then we'll focus on the cash flow of the business. We would also examine capital expenditure. And then the final part of your question, which was what are the decremental margins, I don't want to call that out at the moment. We will see whether we're able to say anything further in that regard in the more detailed call that we'll hold in early May, once we may have a better handle on the demand pattern going forward."

And we said that you're going to get some benefit in 2020 of another $50 million in 2020, just the carry-through of that cost-out action that we took last year. So $50 million incremental this year. We'll go into more detail on the May 5 call. But if you look at the first quarter alone for Howmet of that $50 million annually, we've got a little bit more than $20 million.

I think I really do want to wait until May for that. I mean we had a reasonable, as you can imagine, a reasonable utilization rate in the first quarter that began to be impacted just because -- as we have had instances of both suspected virus contamination and people self-quarantining and us quarantining departments and shifts. So that began to cause us quite some problems as we went through for the last 3 weeks of March. And so to come up with anything that's meaningful in terms of it was this utilization, it's now though -- is really difficult. And we're facing the same position at the moment. As I commented, we did have 9 plants or 8 plants which are currently closed because of -- and they tend to be the smaller plants, but they are closed. For most of our important plants, they're open, functioning and are deemed essential, as you'd expect for those -- the top products we do, plus also serving the defense industry. 
And so at the moment, we are functioning, I would say, well but clearly not at the level we were in the first 2 months of the year. And it's pretty difficult. So if you'll give us another few weeks to talk to the subject more, then I think we'll be able to better address it in May or, if not, subsequent to that. So that's the best I can do, Curt, to answer the question. So thank you very much."

However, we'll get on wit",1055,"Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining the call today. A little bit of an unusual circumstance in that for the first time in probably 15 or 16 years of doing earnings call, I haven't been in the same room as the CFO. However, we'll get on with it. I recognize that this earnings call is a little earlier than normal, but we felt it both opportune and appropriate given the current economic environment and the separation event that occurred for the company on the 1st of April. 
Let's move to Slide 4. As you know, on the 1st of April, we legally separated Arconic Inc., the reported entity today, into 2 companies: Howmet Aerospace, which is remainco, and that's companies primarily focused on the aerospace sector and contains 4 business units within the former Engineered Products and Forgings segment; Arconic Corporation, spinco, is primarily focused on rolled and extruded aluminum products to various end markets. Arconic Corporation contains the 3 business units within the former Global Rolled Products segment. 
Let me cover the Q1 results before talking further about the current environment that we're currently managing against. Now let's move to Slide 5. Please note all the numbers relating to Q1 are what we currently expect. We will finalize results and discuss them in greater detail on the 5th of May. For Q1, revenues were approximately $3.2 billion, down 9% versus 2019 and down 6% organically, adjusting for the pass-through effect of the lower aluminum prices, currency and the disposal of certain businesses. We experienced declines in the commercial transportation, automotive and aerospace markets, partially offset by growth in the industrial market. Year-over-year market declines were driven by the disruptions from COVID-19 and the Boeing 737 MAX production reduction. Moving to the segments, EP&F revenues were down 4% organically and GRP revenues were down 7% organically. 
Please move to Slide #6 for the operating profit. Operating profit, excluding special items, increased approximately $78 million year-on-year. And that was 20% resulting increase, resulting in a record margin of approximately 14.7%. We expect margin expansion of about 350 basis points year-over-year for Arconic Inc., with 300 basis points for EP&F and 310 basis points for GRP. Further profit performance progression was driven by the benefit of net cost reductions actioned last year as well as lower raw material costs and the price increases in the EP&F segment. Margin expansion is also expected to improve sequentially in both segments, having coming off the best ever fourth quarter results. When I look at each of the individual businesses in the 2 segments, every business increased its margins year-over-year despite being impacted by the disruptions I previously mentioned related to COVID and the MAX production cessation for the first quarter. I also note that the one troubled business in 2019, namely extrusions in the GRP segment, moved into profit and compared favorably to every quarter that we experienced in 2019, and this is a very significant turnaround. 
Now let me move to Slide #7. Earnings per share, excluding special items, is expected to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.62, up approximately 42% from $0.43 per share in Q1 of 2019. Earnings per share increased primarily due to the operational improvements from corporate and segment productivity. Special charges totaled approximately $60 million after tax and were primarily driven by the separation costs of some $50 million and severance costs of $16 million. The severance costs are tied to our new $100 million cost reduction initiative to align the cost base as we move into a period of demand uncertainty. 
Now let's turn to liquidity on Slide #8. Arconic Inc.'s pre-separation Q1 cash balance was approximately $2.65 billion. Adjusted free cash flow, excluding separation costs, improved $50 million year-over-year and was in the range of negative $200 million to $230 million, driven by the normal seasonal working capital build and significantly higher 2019 annual variable compensation payments. Q1 cash outflow associated with separation was approximately $110 million, and there is approximately $40 million of cash outflow expected in Q2, primarily associated with the early debt repayment that has already occurred on April 6. Howmet Aerospace post-separation cash balance is approximately $850 million after the $1.3 billion early redemption -- early debt repayment and allocation of $500 million of cash to the opening balance sheet of Arconic Corporation. The $850 million of cash is more than 2x the amount necessary to fund seasonal working capital changes. Howmet Aerospace's liquidity is strong, and also, we have an undrawn revolver of $1.5 billion. Lastly, in terms of notable impacts on Q1 trading and operations, the impacts worth noting are: COVID-19 disruptions; the Boeing 737 MAX production suspension; and the fire at one of our North American wheels plants. 
Let's move to Slide #9. Turning now to COVID-19. We felt impacts from certain customer shutdowns or suspensions and disruption within certain shifts. Some of Arconic Inc.'s plants were closed for a period during March due to the virus. Plant closures averaged approximately 7 days in the month. 
Now I'll turn to the outlook which I'll confine my comments solely to Howmet Aerospace. Currently, Howmet Aerospace has 8 manufacturing plants which are closed. Currently, we have limited visibility of future demand. Many of our customers are closed because of the coronavirus and the impacts on their employees. Information flow is limited. And hence, in the face of this uncertainty, we're reducing costs and preserving cash given the lack of clarity. We find ourselves unable to provide reliable guidance to you, and therefore, withdraw the guidance provided at the February 25 Investor Day. And as you know, we treat guidance as a very serious future tracking view. To mitigate the impact of the coronavirus disruptions, we have commenced plans to reduce by a further $100 million of cost on a run rate basis. This plan is incremental to the 2019 cost reductions, which carry over into 2020, and is primarily driven by incremental overhead and manufacturing reductions. Moreover, we're evaluating reducing capital expenditure due to the lower volumes. We have temporarily suspended the dividend to preserve cash to provide for additional flexibility. We'll continue to finalize the first quarter results and go into more detail on May 5. Additional slides have been provided in the appendix. 
And with that, I'll now move to Q&A."

In fact, what we had done, if you go back to earlier, the last earnings call in, I think, late January, one of the concerns I had then was trying to manage our way through the 737 situation, and indeed, protecting the, I'll say, vital skills to be able to do that, at the same time recognizing that we were going to face a potential for a further reduction in labor to stay soft a lot in the summer. I think it's a great credit to our team that we managed to actually plan our way through and level set what we're doing in our manufacturing against the former -- or the current Boeing plant. And so we're able to eliminate that labor concern of the summer. Obviously, in the current environment, we're now unsure because we don't know what will be the rate return for the 737. But as it stands at the moment, we are in -- I would say, in good shape to be able to meet customer demand. We will then, as we begin to know more about the shape of future aircraft builds, then take another view about what further cost reductions will be necessary to face after that. All the time, we are interested in protecting the bottom line as much as we are able to with the demand reduction, which is likely to occur, and also to stay in a cash-generative situation."

And so how we can think about, sort of once we set our rate expectations, what kind of revenue impact Howmet might face given those rate expectations."
416264458,662884251,1955276,"Howmet Aerospace Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 14, 2020",2020-04-14,"Earnings Calls","Howmet Aerospace Inc.","Executives","Yes. We actually don't have any great detail of what inventory our customers are carrying.

We actually don't have any great detail of what inventory our customers are carrying. I'm always very cognizant of the -- I'll say, the multiplier effect that inventory can have in a down market for the end product. I think the notable point for Howmet would be for our engine business. I think, as you know, we were in a position of excess demand for almost continuously for the last 2-plus year. And that's the reason why we built those 2 new plants in Whitehall and Morristown. That's Whitehall, Michigan and Morristown, Tennessee. Obviously, it's a little bit unfortunate that we now have the capacity and we have a more uncertain demand. 
However, as you know, I think on a previous call, I did comment that we exited 2019 with actually a higher arrears position in aggregate across our engine business than we had when we entered the year and didn't make particular headway in the first quarter against that. So my thought is, I wouldn't be surprised to see some of those arrears vaporize in the case of falling demand. But at the same time, I feel there's a level of protection. So for some, it's $2.5 billion, $3 billion of revenue within the company. And my thought -- I would say it's knowledge. My thought is that the inventory multiplier effect may be fairly muted upon us, albeit it will be more significant in -- let's say, in the rings part of our business and also in our structural business and potentially fasteners. So it's -- there's no one single answer. 
And then at the same time -- I mean the one thing which is a bright spot for us, so I think, as you know, out of approximately $7 billion of aerospace revenue -- or in Howmet revenue last year, fractionally under $1 billion related to defense. And so let's call it, for sake of argument, $900 million, $950 million. And that was a source of strength for us in the first quarter. We saw approximately -- I must say, it's around about 17%. I mean not exactly precise, but over 15% increase in that demand in Q1. And at the moment, we don't expect anything but further strength in that part of the business going forward. So again, you need to bifurcate that, which goes to the commercial sector, which is by segment, and then also consider the defense aspect of the business. And also part of our industrial business that we face off to, it actually had also very solid demand in the first quarter. So -- and that's probably $400 million to $500 million of revenue, which also increased double digits. So you need to bifurcate all of that when you come up with revenue estimates."

But for my thought process, it's -- that's very conservative way of thinking about it. 
You're right about the undrawn revolver, and that's there for us. We are studying the current debt markets to see whether there's something we should be doing with regard that but haven't settled on a final plan at this point in time. But we're cognizant that with the support of the Federal Reserve into the credit markets, they do seem to be falling a little bit. And we continue to watch those to see how things are progressing.

And if you use that as a proxy for everything else at the moment, then my current feeling is that we will remain cash positive through the year as we go through it. And so when I look at the cash profile of what was Arconic Inc. and then I look at cash profile of Howmet, at the moment, assuming that's a sort of revenue type of adjustment, then I'm feeling and sensing -- it's not quite the same as saying I know because I'm not sure enough yet about all the promise of demand reduction, how the -- everything else will phase in. But I expect that 2020 will be a cash flow positive year after payment of interest, after payment of pension contributions. So that's net after everything that we currently envisage."

Everything else is changeable. Main question is the time line on which you change it. And so that's how I will say my stance relative to those type of discussions. And because I think it's the duty of every good business to challenge everything that you do. So that's how I start off. Then I'm going to reach back into history just to try and give you a view. 
So in, let's say, a prior life, and going back to the business I was involved with in 2008, 2009, which I think, as you know, is in the automotive business, which has margins far less than Howmet's. So let's think of margins about 1/3 of Howmet's, and in recognizing what we faced off to, there, we moved quickly and we moved often. And so first of all, you must not assume that the $100 million is done and gone, and that's it. So we moved successively at that time, and we only experienced the 2 quarters of operating loss. And of course, I'm not indicating for one second at the moment that we have operating loss. I'm just trying to say to you, that was pretty good and pretty unique for that industry. So in terms of what we will do and what we're doing is that you saw in Q1 that we actually have already taken a reserve. We're already implementing those cost reductions. And by no means that we called out that what we've done is it. And so once we are clearer on what is the shape of the business going forward as we move through 2020 and also into '21, because we also need to also think we're managing for and [ package predict ] that -- which is vital for the future, is that we'll have a better view over what shape will be our next action that we'll undertake to -- I'll say, to preserve as best we can the performance of the company. 
So it's a long way of saying, I can't give you the exact number because I don't know at this point. We should assume that we will be -- have a very keen eye to the cost base of the business and move accordingly. Then we'll focus on the cash flow of the business. We would also examine capital expenditure. And then the final part of your question, which was what are the decremental margins, I don't want to call that out at the moment. We will see whether we're able to say anything further in that regard in the more detailed call that we'll hold in early May, once we may have a better handle on the demand pattern going forward."

You mentioned the cost reductions that we executed and delivered in 2019 of $213 million. So this time last year, when we get our first quarter earnings, we committed to a target of $120 million in a year and we delivered the $213 million, so substantially overdelivered. But it's now we're talking about Howmet in moving forward. If you took that $213 million and said how much of that was Howmet last year, it's about $110 million, roughly half that. And we said that you're going to get some benefit in 2020 of another $50 million in 2020, just the carry-through of that cost-out action that we took last year. So $50 million incremental this year. We'll go into more detail on the May 5 call. But if you look at the first quarter alone for Howmet of that $50 million annually, we've got a little bit more than $20 million. So we're seeing the benefit of that plan, then you've got this incremental plan that we just launched as well, and that will help as we move forward."

Moreover, e",391,"Good morning, and thank you for joining the call. Given the prerelease of earnings, we'll move swiftly through the slides and then get to your questions. 
Revenue and profit for the first quarter were in line with the pre-release on April 14. Moreover, earnings per share is at the favorable end of the expected range. 
If you move to Slide 4, please. And as we discussed on the last call, on the April 1, we separated Arconic Inc., the reported entity into 2 companies. AMET Aerospace, which is Remainco, which is primarily focused on the aerospace sector and contains the 4 business units within the Engineered Products and Forging segment. Arconic Corporation, Spinco, which is primarily focused on rolled and extruded aluminum products contains the 3 business units within the Global Rolled Products segment. The targeted guidance for onetime operational and CapEx costs related to the separation were $175 million. The final costs for the separation will actually be approximately $130 million, excluding tax leakage and debt breakage. Onetime separation costs were funded by divestiture proceeds of approximately $190 million. The highlight slide for the combined company of Arconic Inc., which includes the EP&F segment, the GRP segment and corporate. Performance in the quarter was strong despite the impact of COVID-19, which surfaced during the last 3 weeks of March. Additionally, we were impacted by lower year-over-year 73 MAX production rate reduction. Q1 revenues were $3.2 billion, down 9% versus 2019 and  down 6% organically, adjusting for the pass-through of lower aluminum prices, currency changes and the divestiture of businesses. Operating income, including special -- excluding special items, was up 19% with a 350 basis points improvement. Moreover, EP&F improved 300 basis points and GRP improved 310 basis points. We have now had 5 consecutive quarters of year-over-year margin expansion. Earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.62, a record, and up 44% year-over-year. Adjusted free cash flow, excluding separation costs, improved $19 million year-over-year. And the cash balance at the end of the quarter was $2.64 billion. We've taken several actions to delever and improve our debt maturity profile, which I will discuss later in the presentation. 
Lastly, return on net assets was up 410 basis points to a record 14.8% return after tax. 
Now let me turn it over to  Ken for a more detailed view of the financials."

So for Q1, revenues were $3.2 billion, down 6% organically year-over-year market declines were driven by disruptions from COVID-19. And 737 MAX production declines, which impacted both segments. Revenues for EP&F were down 4% organically, driven by reductions in commercial aerospace of 7% and  commercial transportation of 21%. We did have favorability in defense aero, which was up 17%, driven by the continued demand for the joint Strike fighter. Also, our industrial and other markets were up 13%, driven by increased demand for industrial gas turbines as natural gas prices are at 25-year lows. GRP revenues were down 7% organically, driven by all end markets with the exception of industrial, which was up 14% year-on-year as expected. 
Please move to Slide 7. on this slide, we've provided more visibility to the Howmet Aerospace end markets. The left-hand side of the slide breaks down Q1 revenue by market. So commercial aerospace is 58% of total revenue, defense aero is 15% commercial, transportation is also 15%, and industrial, combined with our other end markets are 12%. We expect  defense aerospace to continue to grow year-over-year due to strong demand for the joint strike fighter, both new builds and engine spares. Within the industrial and other market slices of the pie, the highest growth section is IGT, our industrial gas turbines business. The IGT market was at a low level last year, and we expect to see growth in 2020, driven by increased demand for both new builds and spares. Regarding spares, we have previously communicated that airfoil spares represent approximately $800 million of annual revenue. Of the $800 million, approximately 50% of relates to commercial aerospace engine spares and the other half for defense aero and IGT spares. Going forward, we expect reductions in commercial aero spares, but an increase in defense aero and IGT spares. Hopefully, this slide gives greater transparency into Howmet Aerospace's end markets. We have created the same slide for GRP, which is listed at Slide 21 in the appendix. 
Now let's move to Slide 8. Operating profit, excluding special items, increased $75 million or 19% year-over-year, resulted in a record margin of 14.1% despite COVID-19 and 737 MAX impacts. Margin expansion was 350 basis points, up year-over-year, combined for total Arconic Inc. If we peel that back, EP&F had margin expansion of 300 basis points. And GRP had margin expansion of 310 basis points. Corporate expenses, excluding special items, improved 29% year-over-year to $36 million, which is on track with our 2020 annual target. If we estimate a Q1 split of Arconic Inc.'s corporate expenses into the new Howmet Aerospace and new Arconic Corp. companies, approximately $20 million of those corporate expenses go to Howmet and $16 million to Arconic Corp. 
Moving to EP&F. Our productivity continues to improve. For the first quarter, EP&F realized $26 million of year-over-year net cost reductions from actions that we took in 2019. The annual target for Howmet Aerospace was $50 million, and therefore, we're ahead of target for the first quarter. Additionally, we've announced another $100 million of incremental run rate net cost reductions have taken a $16 million after-tax restructuring charge in the first quarter. 
Turning to price. We had $5 million of price increases in the first quarter, which was in line with our expectations. Moving forward, we expect greater price increases in quarters 2 through 4 despite the market conditions. GRP also had good net cost reductions in the quarter. GRP extrusions returned to profitability in Q1, and the Tennessee plant improved profitability by approximately $11 million year-over-year. 
Lastly, North American scrap utilization approached 60% to a record level. GRP price was approximately flat to the prior year quarter. So let's move to Slide 9. In Q1, we've continued year-over-year segment margin expansion for both segments despite COVID-19 and the 737 impacts. To give you even greater visibility let's quickly move to Slide 10. Since Q4 of 2018, EP&F segment operating profit has increased 520 basis points and GRP's segment operating profit has increased 540 basis points. If we converted the EP&F segment operating profit to a pro forma Howmet Aerospace adjusted EBITDA, we get a percent of approximately 23.7%, which is in the top quartile of the peer group. 
Now let's move to Slide 11, where we have adjusted free cash flow and earnings per share. The charts show the consolidated company of Arconic Inc., and we've also tried to give you a view of what the estimate would be for Howmet Aerospace. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was negative $246 million. That was in line with our expectations due to our Q1 seasonal capital -- seasonal working capital build and an expected incremental $70 million of variable compensation payments tied to 2019 performance. Free cash flow for Q1 was $19 million better than the prior year and is the best performance since our first separation in 2016. Howmet Aerospace's free cash flow is approximately 40% of the total and negative $100 million. Earnings per share, excluding special items, was a record of $0.62, up 44% from Q1 of 2019. As expected, earnings per share increased primarily due to operational improvements from segment and corporate productivity. Approximately 65% of the earnings per share relate to Howmet Aerospace or $0.40 per share. Special items totaled approximately $60 million after tax, and they were primarily driven by separation costs of $50 million and severance costs of $16 million. Most of the severance costs are tied to the new incremental $100 million cost reduction initiative to realign our cost base as we move into a period of demand uncertainty. 
With that, let me turn it back over to John."

The health and safety of our employees is our top priority, and we've added the following precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19. We've restricted air travel and all travel and encouraging employees to work from home where appropriate. We have implemented social distancing standards throughout the manufacturing and office workspaces. And we are ensuring that updated protocols are followed. Lastly, we're continuing to deep clean and sanitize workspaces, which have potential exposure. We continue to be a reliable partner to our customers who are critical to national defense, commercial aviation and the global economy. 
Let's move to Slide 13. I'll now turn to the outlook for which I'll confine my comments to Howmet Aerospace. As discussed on the April 14 earnings -- preliminary earnings call, we have an incomplete picture of the future demand pattern. Since many of our customers' production has been significantly impacted. Information flow is currently limited, albeit improving. Hence, we're reducing costs, reducing capital expenditure, temporary suspending the common stock dividend and improving our debt mature profile to preserve cash given the lack of clarity. We find ourselves unable to provide reliable guidance at this time. 
Turning now to COVID-19. We felt the impact from certain customer shutdowns and suspensions and disruptions with insert shifts within our plants during the last 3 weeks of the quarter. Today, we have only 3 smaller plants, which are currently closed, and they're in Europe. To mitigate the impact of COVID-19, we have commenced plans to reduce costs by a further $100 million on a run rate basis. This plan is incremental to the $50 million of carrier reactions are making from 2019 and the actions we took then. Cost reductions are primarily driven by incremental overhead and some manufacturing reductions. Moreover, we will reduce annual capital expenditures by approximately $100 million from the initial target provided at our February 25 Investor Day. The full year capital expenditure estimate of $200 million is driven by lower volumes and us cutting those costs. 
Lastly, we have temporarily suspended the common stock dividend to preserve cash and provide additional flexibility. Despite the low volumes in 2020, we expect to be free cash flow positive for the year based upon these actions. And this free cash flow is after pension after interest, and in fact, all items of cash flow.  To give greater visibility to the free cash flow, let's move to Slide 14 and its key components. We are providing Q1 results and annual estimates. On an annual basis, consistent with our previous guidance, corporate overhead, depreciation and amortization and cash taxes are unchanged. Pension and OPEB payments have been updated to $210 million based upon final separation calculations. Interest payments have been updated for the new debt issuance and  CapEx has been reduced by the EUR 100 million previously mentioned. Common stock dividends have been temporarily suspended. Working capital will be a net source of cash for the year as AR inventory and accounts payable are reduced. 
Let's move to Slide 15 and talk about our debt maturities. We've taken 3 actions in April. The first action on April 6 that we redeemed all of our 2020 bonds for $1 billion. Additionally, we redeemed $300 million of the 2021 bonds. Secondly, on April 24, we completed a bond issuance for $1.2 billion, which is due in 2025. Thirdly, we initiated 2 tender offers. One for $760 million for a portion of the remaining 2021 bonds and the second tender offer for approximately $200 million for a portion of the 2022 bonds. These actions will result in the following 3 benefits. Firstly, we paid off all of the 2021 bonds. Secondly, we will take pressure off the balance sheet by reducing near-term maturities and terming it out further 5 years. Thirdly, we'll be able to add approximately $190 million of cash to the balance sheet, which will add to our very healthy cash balance that we have currently. Our pro forma cash balance as of April 24 would be approximately $1 billion. The pro forma cash balance would be after the Q1 seasonal working capital build. Moreover, we have reduced the operational cash requirements from $400 million to operate our business to $300 million based upon the updated additional working capital needs pertaining to Howmet. 
Finally, let's move to Slide 16. We have prepared a pro forma capital structure slide as of April 24. Pro forma cash would be approximately $103 billion and net debt would be approximately 2.4x. Additionally, we have an undrawn revolver of some $1.5 billion. And with that, let's move to Q&A."

My basic thought is that when we exited 2019, in fact, our arrears were at a higher level than we'd entered the year.

So it's hard to give a very precise answer. But as a basic theme, if your arrears were even higher despite the massive increase in production that we did achieve and the part of the results, which is last year, and we certainly didn't have a big burn down of inventory in areas in the first quarter. So I don't know it's going to be a massive impact. At the same time, we don't have visibility to exactly what our customers are carrying."

And our view is that the peak demand for aftermarket is yet to come. And so let's assume that peak demand per our estimate is around 2025. So that would be, let's say, approximately 7 years after the engine is replaced. So while we have spares demand during across the life of any engine, its peak is normally after the installed base is its highest, and therefore, I'd say approximately a 7-year lag, and therefore, we have that CFM spares. I say yet to peak so that gives you a general direction for it. But it's also influenced by the duty cycle of those airfoils on the engine. And I think you're probably aware that to achieve the fuel efficiencies that are required for the newer engines in the thrust for low emissions and a lower carbon footprint. Those engines are running at higher pressures and temperatures. And so we do our very best to work with the engine manufacturer to achieve similar life cycle of the blades. But certainly, the impact of this pressure and temperature is higher. So early on in an engine life, we probably have a slightly reduced duty cycle. But then it evens out over time. So that gives you the best answer I can give you to it. I wasn't able to answer your final point, exactly what percentage is that -- I'd have to go and get that?"

I think the -- first of all, the planned report out is -- we've been thinking it's more likely that we give segment information. Than anything else, albeit we've always given growth rates by end markets. And I understand why maybe the absolute percentages for end markets is also highly relevant. So we'll assess that and see whether we put that out there. The way I think about it at the moment is, let's say, approximately 58%, just under 60% of our business [indiscernible] aerospace. And I'd say a very close level of analysis. So I think it's just -- we're just worth -- it's a quarter analysis at this stage. If you take the changes currently anticipated by Airbus, for example, narrowbody, the A320, more like about a 35% reduction and wide-bodies at about a 40%. And I'd say Boeing wide-body probably about the same, but it's a bit more cloud because of the specific bill quantities around the 737. So it's really difficult to give a generalized picture for the 737 at the moment in [indiscernible] certified. But I'd take a broad sweep through it and say, down 35%, give or take, as a guesstimate at this point in time. Albeit we do need a little bit more time to be able to give a more accurate and be clear, a clearly thought through picture. 
On commercial transportation, I'm going to be rather more pessimistic and say about 15% of our end markets. We could see given the fact that if you take April, there was virtually no truck production. And therefore, I could see us being down close to 50% in that business ultimately. Given the current dramatic change in the order intake for Class A trucks, as an example, both in Europe and in the U.S. On defense, that 15%, you see double digits. I mean maybe it will be as big as 17%.  
[Audio Gap] 
15% growth. And then industrial, I'm going to say trucks 10% would be up, would be a guesstimate at this point of those sales or so. So when you -- and that's the way I sort of test as we try to reforecast each quarter and trying to reforecast the year as we go through this. I test that against the course modeling that I just gave to you. And it triangulates reasonably well at this point, albeit we do need another quarter to go by, I think, in terms of getting enough information to have confidence in providing guidance because I mean giving guidance, it's serious. We try to get it to be something which we believe is going to be done rather just it's not a wish."

One of the things we've tried very hard last year for Arconic Inc. was to -- rather than as we -- all of the cash flow for the company in previous years had really been achieved in the fourth quarter. We advanced that significantly last year. So we were generative in the third and fourth quarters. And we were clearly driving on that to really only have our first quarter being a quarter of cash outflow. And it's a bit too early to say whether that will be achieved given the uncertainty that we have we're dealing with at the moment. But that's basically directionally where we believe to be now. Now what I expect to happen is for working capital, I think receivables and payables. Flex, I think, for the most part, the agents code to the days that we have and the activity levels the most difficult one will be inventory management. And my expectation is there that in the earlier part of the remaining 3 quarters of the year, we will have a degradation of days of inventory. Part of it is just to do with the -- to respond and flex on input materials in real-time when you have uncertain, I'd say, customer schedules. I mean plants have been -- some are closed with receiving docs closed. And therefore, if you can't deliver product, it's not surprising, your inventory will increase a bit. But then there's also the effect of irreducible amount of inventory between machine stations and extrusion stations in the forging presses in the business. And so my expectation is that we will see both for Q2 and for the year, but to a lesser extent as we go through the year as we work this down. So days will -- I expect by the end of the year, days will be better than they are in Q2, but not as good as previously just because of the scale of, I'll say, demand contraction that is there potentially? Albeit and will be grappling with it and driving inventory down in absolute dollars as we go through the year. So it's just -- again, it's one-off time. And so one will seem to be a little bit more inefficient in the second quarter, improving efficiency there afterwards. But in terms of inventory dollars, I struggle to believe that given the scale of diminution of -- on the commercial aerospace business that will be as efficient as we were these terms as 2019."

Is essentially all we at this point in time, very little spares. That's not the say the spares aren't required because they are because the duty cycle of the given it's the military duty cycle is far less than the average commercial engine. But then as you, I think, seen from our previous decks, then that engine is operating to 1,000 degrees higher temperature. That is in particular when the aircraft had less air flow through. Does it hoppers in the air and has those capabilities for certain versions of that jet. So even with it's reduced duty cycle that to a commercial given it's still fairly new in the market, the spares part of the business has been, I'll say, fairly limited, albeit it's still there. When I think about F-35, we were -- the critical turbine blades, we're all critical, yes, but the ones which are the most exacting to manufacture, which are the ones which have, I'm going to say, the extraordinary levels of coring to achieve the multitude sort of level of chambers that they have within them to? And then how the F comes out of the training edge, then the more difficult ones were really tough for us to make. And so we were under pressure all the way through 2019 to produce more blades and I recognize that it is possible, we were -- I don't think we were the limiting factor on the engine, but we were close to it. And sought to increase that capacity with additional dies and improved yields as we went through the year. We believe that the combination of that plus the additional capacity that we brought online and pertain to our [indiscernible] engine facility has been helpful to that situation, and we've seen signs of improvement but we're also clear at the moment, we could sell everything that we could make, given the, I'll say, unfulfilled basic demand that we have. So we're trying to build to a higher rate, a rate build for 2020, which is higher than the rate build in 2019. And then we're trying to prepare for additional rate increases also in 2021 and 2022. So the -- I mean the alleviation of capacity from, let's say, the commercial side has been helpful to it. But that wasn't the singular issue in terms of us meeting the rate increases relative to tooling as well. So right now, the way I think about it is that we found the way of improving rates. We do know that there is a large spares demand that's there for us to fulfill as well on top of the increase in build. It's there and so I look at it as a very positive thing for us in going through into '21 and '22 and beyond because then we have additional rate increases to provide for, plus the spares packages that are required to be fulfilled is going to be, also, a good thing in the future for Howmet.

Revenue and profit for the first quarter were in line with the pre-release on April 14. Moreover, earnings per share is at the favorable end of the expected range. If you move to Slide 4, please. Then as we discussed on the last call, on the 1st of April, we separated Arconic Inc., the reported entity today, into 2 companies: Howmet Aerospace, which is RemainCo, which is primarily focused on the aerospace sector and contains the 4 business units within the Engineered Products and Forging segment; Arconic Corporation, SpinCo, which is primarily focused on rolled and extruded aluminum products, contains the 3 business units within the Global Rolled Products segment. The targeted guidance for onetime operational and CapEx costs related to the separation were $175 million. The final costs for the separation will actually be approximately $130 million, excluding tax leakage and debt breakage. Onetime separation costs were funded by divestiture proceeds of approximately $190 million. The highlight slide for the combined company of Arconic Inc., which includes the EP&F segment, the GRP segment and Corporate. Performance in the quarter was strong despite the impact of COVID-19, which surfaced during the last 3 weeks of March. Additionally, we were impacted by lower year-over-year 73 (sic) [ 737 ] MAX production rate reduction. Q1 revenues were $3.2 billion, down 9% versus 2019 and down 6% organically, adjusting for the pass-through of lower aluminum prices, currency changes and the divestiture of businesses. Operating income, including special -- excluding special items, was up 19%, with a 350 basis points improvement. Moreover, EP&F improved 300 basis points and GRP improved 310 basis points. We have now had 5 consecutive quarters of year-over-year margin expansion. Earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.62, a record and up 44% year-over-year. Adjusted free cash flow, excluding separation costs, improved $19 million year-over-year, and the cash balance at the end of the quarter was $2.64 billion. We've taken several actions to delever and improve our debt maturity profile, which I will discuss later in the presentation. Lastly, return on net assets was up 410 basis points to a record 14.8% return after tax. Now let me turn it over to Ken for a more detailed view of the financials."

Let's move to Slide 6. So for Q1, revenues were $3.2 billion, down 6% organically. Year-over-year market declines were driven by disruptions from COVID-19 and 737 MAX production declines, which impacted both segments. Revenues for EP&F were down 4% organically, driven by reductions in commercial aerospace of 7% and commercial transportation of 21%. We did have favorability in defense aero, which was up 17%, driven by the continued demand for the Joint Strike Fighter. Also, our industrial and other markets were up 13%, driven by increased demand for industrial gas turbines as natural gas prices are at 25-year lows. GRP revenues were down 7% organically, driven by all end markets with the exception of industrial, which was up 14% year-on-year as expected. Please move to Slide 7. On this slide, we've provided more visibility to the Howmet Aerospace end markets. The left-hand side of the slide breaks down Q1 revenue by market. So commercial aerospace is 58% of total revenue. Defense aero is 15%. Commercial transportation is also 15%. And industrial, combined with our other end markets, are 12%. We expect defense aerospace to continue to grow year-over-year due to strong demand for the Joint Strike Fighter on both new builds and engine spares. Within the industrial and other market slices of the pie, the highest growth section is IGT, our industrial gas turbines business. The IGT market was at a low level last year, and we expect to see growth in 2020, driven by increased demand for both new builds and spares. Regarding spares, we have previously communicated that airfoil spares represent approximately $800 million of annual revenue. Of the $800 million, approximately 50% relates to commercial aerospace engine spares and the other half for defense aero and IGT spares. Going forward, we expect reductions in commercial aero spares but an increase in defense aero and IGT spares. Hopefully, this slide gives greater transparency into Howmet Aerospace's end markets. We have created the same slide for GRP, which is listed at Slide 21 in the appendix. Now let's move to Slide 8. Operating profit, excluding special items, increased $75 million or 19% year-over-year, resulted in a record margin of 14.1% despite COVID-19 and 737 MAX impacts. Margin expansion was 350 basis points, up year-over-year, combined for total Arconic Inc. If we peel that back, EP&F had margin expansion of 300 basis points and GRP had margin expansion of 310 basis points. Corporate expenses, excluding special items, improved 29% year-over-year to $36 million, which is on track with our 2020 annual target. If we estimate a Q1 split of Arconic Inc.'s corporate expenses into the new Howmet Aerospace and new Arconic Corp. company is approximately $20 million of those corporate expenses go to Howmet and $16 million to Arconic Corp. Moving to EP&F. Our productivity continues to improve. For the first quarter, EP&F realized $26 million of year-over-year net cost reductions from actions that we took in 2019. 
The annual target for Howmet Aerospace was $50 million, and therefore, we're ahead of target for the first quarter. Additionally, we've announced another $100 million of incremental run rate net cost reductions and have taken a $16 million after-tax restructuring charge in the first quarter. Turning to price. We had $5 million of price increases in the first quarter, which was in line with our expectations. Moving forward, we expect greater price increases in quarters 2 through 4 despite the market conditions. GRP also had good net cost reductions in the quarter. GRP extrusions returned to profitability in Q1 and the Tennessee plant improved profitability by approximately $11 million year-over-year. Lastly, North American scrap utilization approached 60% to a record level. GRP price was approximately flat to the prior year quarter. So let's move to Slide 9. In Q1, we continued year-over-year segment margin expansion for both segments despite COVID-19 and the 737 impacts. To give you even greater visibility, let's quickly move to Slide 10. Since Q4 of 2018, EP&F segment operating profit has increased 520 basis points, and GRP's segment operating profit has increased 540 basis points. If we converted the EP&F segment operating profit to a pro forma Howmet Aerospace adjusted EBITDA, you get a percent of approximately 23.7%, which is in the top quartile of the peer group. Now let's move to Slide 11, where we have adjusted free cash flow and earnings per share. The charts show the consolidated company of Arconic Inc., and we've also tried to give you a view of what the estimate would be for Howmet Aerospace. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was negative $246 million. That was in line with our expectations due to our Q1 seasonal capital -- seasonal working capital build and an expected incremental $70 million of variable compensation payments tied to 2019 performance. Free cash flow for Q1 was $19 million better than the prior year and is the best performance since our first separation in 2016. Howmet Aerospace's free cash flow is approximately 40% of the total at negative $100 million. Earnings per share, excluding special items, was a record of $0.62, up 44% from Q1 of 2019. As expected, earnings per share increased primarily due to operational improvements from segment and corporate productivity. Approximately 65% of the earnings per share relate to Howmet Aerospace or $0.40 per share. Special items totaled approximately $60 million after tax, and they were primarily driven by separation costs of $50 million and severance costs of $16 million. Most of the severance costs are tied to the new incremental $100 million cost reduction initiative to realign our cost base as we move into a period of demand uncertainty. With that, let me turn it back over to John."

The health and safety of our employees is our top priority, and we've added the following precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19. We've restricted air travel, and in fact all travel, and are encouraging employees to work from home where appropriate. We have implemented social distancing standards throughout the manufacturing and office workspaces. And we are ensuring that updated protocols are followed. Lastly, we're continuing to deep clean and sanitize workspaces, which have potential exposure. We continue to be a reliable partner to our customers who are critical to national defense, commercial aviation and the global economy. Let's move to Slide 13. I'll now turn to the outlook for which I'll confine my comments to Howmet Aerospace. As discussed on the April 14 earnings -- preliminary earnings call, we have an incomplete picture of the future demand pattern since many of our customers' production has been significantly impacted. Information flow is currently limited, albeit improving. Hence, we're reducing costs, reducing capital expenditure, temporary suspending the common stock dividend and improving our debt maturity profile to preserve cash given the lack of clarity. We find ourselves unable to provide reliable guidance at this time. Turning now to COVID-19. We felt the impacts from certain customer shutdowns and suspensions and disruptions within certain shifts within our plants during the last 3 weeks of the quarter. Today, we have only 3 smaller plants, which are currently closed and they're in Europe. To mitigate the impact of COVID-19, we have commenced plans to reduce costs by a further $100 million on a run rate basis. This plan is incremental to the $50 million of carrier reactions we are making from 2019 and the actions we took then. Cost reductions are primarily driven by incremental overhead and some manufacturing reductions. Moreover, we will reduce annual capital expenditures by approximately $100 million from the initial target provided at our February 25 Investor Day. The full year capital expenditure estimate of $200 million is driven by lower volumes and us cutting those costs. Lastly, we have temporarily suspended the common stock dividend to preserve cash and provide additional flexibility. 
Despite the low volumes in 2020, we expect to be free cash flow positive for the year based upon these actions. And this free cash flow is after pension after interest and, in fact, all items of cash flow. To give greater visibility to the free cash flow, let's move to Slide 14 and its key components. We are providing Q1 results and annual estimates. On an annual basis, consistent with our previous guidance, corporate overhead, depreciation and amortization and cash taxes are unchanged. Pension and OPEB payments have been updated to $210 million based upon final separation calculations. Interest payments have been updated for the new debt issuance, and CapEx has been reduced by the $100 million previously mentioned. Common stock dividends have been temporarily suspended. Working capital will be a net source of cash for the year as AR inventory and accounts payable are reduced. Let's move to Slide 15 and talk about our debt maturities. We've taken 3 actions in April, the first action on April 6, that we redeemed all of our 2020 bonds for $1 billion. Additionally, we redeemed $300 million of the 2021 bonds. Secondly, on April 24, we completed a bond issuance for $1.2 billion, which is due in 2025. Thirdly, we initiated 2 tender offers, one for $760 million for a portion of the remaining 2021 bonds and the second tender offer for approximately $200 million for a portion of the 2022 bonds. These actions will result in the following 3 benefits. Firstly, we paid off all of the 2021 bonds. Secondly, we will take pressure off the balance sheet by reducing near-term maturities and turning them out a further 5 years. Thirdly, we'll be able to add approximately $190 million of cash to the balance sheet, which will add to our very healthy cash balance that we have currently. A pro forma cash balance as of April 24 would be approximately $1 billion. The pro forma cash balance would be after the Q1 seasonal working capital build. Moreover, we have reduced the operational cash requirements from $400 million to operate our business to $300 million based upon the updated seasonal working capital needs pertaining to Howmet. Finally, let's move to Slide 16. We have prepared a pro forma capital structure slide as of April 24. Pro forma cash would be approximately $1,030 billion (sic) [ $1,030 million ] and net debt would be approximately 2.4x. Additionally, we have an undrawn revolver of some $1.5 billion. And with that, let's move to Q&A."

And of course, what we think is the -- any LTA renewals really need to look at the 3- to 5-year period and not a specific 1- or 2-year time frame and the necessary capacities need to be put in place when the full run rates are reachieved. So for example, in the case of Airbus, we expect that a couple of years from now, they hopefully will be back up at 60 build rate per month or more. And the 737 MAX will be also going very well as the planes on the ground are cleared from what we've read from Boeing."

And they are, as you know, have been reassessing their own production plans and now that resetting their own inventories. My basic thought is that when we exited 2019, in fact, our arrears were at a higher level than we'd entered the year. And so given the arrears were so high, it would indicate that it wasn't an even sort of vast amount of inventory in the pipeline. But I guess it will be part specific and aircraft specific. So it's hard to give a very precise answer. But as a basic theme, if your arrears were even higher despite the massive increase in production that we did achieve and the part of the results we achieved last year, and we certainly didn't have a big burn down of inventory and arrears in the first quarter. So I don't know it's going to be a massive impact. At the same time, we don't have visibility into exactly what our customers are carrying."

And our view is that the peak demand for aftermarket is yet to come. And so let's assume that peak demand per our estimate is around 2025. And so that would be, let's say, approximately 7 years after the engine is replaced. So while we have spares demand during across the life of any engine, its peak is normally after the installed base is at its highest, and therefore, I'd say approximately a 7-year lag, and therefore, we have that CFM spares, I say, yet to peak. So that gives you a general direction for it. But it's also influenced by the duty cycle of those airfoils on the engine. And I think you're probably aware that to achieve the fuel efficiencies that are required for the newer engines in the thrust for lower emissions and a lower carbon footprint, those engines are running at higher pressures and temperatures. And so we do our very best to work with the engine manufacturer to achieve similar life cycle of the blades. But certainly, the impact of those pressure and temperatures is higher. So early on in an engine life, we probably have a slightly reduced duty cycle. But then it evens out over time. So that gives you the best answer I can give you to it. I wasn't able to answer your final point about what exactly what percentage is that -- I'd have to go and get that."

And I'd say a very coarse level of analysis, so I think it's just -- we're just worth -- it's only a quarter's analysis at this stage. If you take the changes currently anticipated by Airbus, for example, narrow-body, the A320, more like about a 35% reduction and wide-bodies at about a 40%.  And I'd say Boeing wide-body probably about the same, but it's a bit more cloudy because of the specific build quantities around the 737. So it's really difficult to give a generalized picture for the 737 at the moment. I mean, in fact, it's not recertified. But I'd take a broad sweep through it and say, down 35%, give or take, as a guesstimate at this point in time. Albeit we do need a little bit more time to be able to give a more accurate and be clear with a clearly thought through picture. 
On commercial transportation, I'm going to be rather more pessimistic and say about 15% of our end markets. We could see given the fact that if you take April, there was virtually no truck production. And therefore, I could see us being down close to 50% in that business ultimately. Given the current dramatic change in the order intake for Class A trucks, as an example, both in Europe and in the U.S. On defense, that 15%, you see double digits. I mean maybe it will be as big as the 17%, but that's on 15% growth. And then industrial, I'm going to say trucks, 10%, would be up, would be a guesstimate at this point for those sales or so. So when you -- and that's the way I sort of test as we try to reforecast each quarter and trying to reforecast the year as we go through this. I test that against the course modeling that I just gave to you. And it triangulates reasonably well at this point, albeit we do need another quarter to go by, I think, in terms of getting enough information to have confidence in providing guidance because I mean giving guidance, it's pretty serious. We try to get it to be something, which we believe is going to be done rather than just say, it's not a wish."

Of course, we consider that 80% of our cost structure is variable. Now it doesn't all flex instantaneously as I'm sure you're well aware. There are things which move instantaneously, which is, for example, if you don't make the part, you don't buy the material. So you can expect material costs, by and large, to flex according to usage. And then we go through, as I said, the more extreme would be some of the staff costs, particularly in Europe, where any adjustments would need to be made after consultation with the European Works Councils and those sort of things. And so when we think about that, that it takes a longer time to flex it in accordance with the future demand outlook that we believe we'll see. And so that's what we're trying to do. So there's a guide in terms of what's truly fixed versus variable, and the variables is in accordance with time because the basic philosophy being there's very little that should be considered to be permanent or fixed. It's all to do with the passage of time."

One of the things we've tried very hard last year for Arconic Inc. was to -- rather than as we -- all of the cash flow for the company in previous years had really been achieved in the fourth quarter. We advanced that significantly last year. So we were generative in the third and fourth quarters. And we were clearly driving on that to really only have our first quarter being a quarter of cash outflow. And it's a bit too early to say whether that will be achieved given the uncertainty that we have and we're dealing with at the moment. But that's basically directionally where we believe to be. Now what I expect to happen is for working capital, I think receivables and payables flex, I think, for the most part. The latest [ code ] of the day is that we have in the activity levels, the most difficult one will be inventory management. And my expectation is there, that in the earlier part of the remaining 3 quarters of the year, we will have a degradation of days of inventory. Part of it is just to do with the -- able to respond and flex on input materials in real-time when you would have uncertain, I'd say, customer schedules. I mean plants have been -- some are already closed with receiving docks closed. And therefore, if you can't deliver product, it's not surprising, your inventory will increase a bit. But then there's also the effect of an irreducible amount of inventory between machine stations and extrusion stations in the forging presses in the business. And so my expectation is that we will see both for Q2 and for the year, but to a lesser extent as we go through the year as we work this down. So days will -- I expect by the end of the year, days will be better than they are in Q2, but not as good as previously just because of the scale of, I'll say, demand contraction that is there potentially. And albeit we'll be grappling with it and driving inventory down in absolute dollars as we go through the year. So it's just -- again, it's one of time. And so while we'll seem to be a little bit more inefficient in the second quarter, improving efficiency there afterwards. But in terms of inventory dollars, I struggle to believe that given the scale of diminution of -- on the commercial aerospace business that we'll be as efficient as we were in these terms as 2019."

It's essentially all OE at this point in time, very little spares. That's not to say the spares aren't required because they are, because the duty cycle of that engine, given it's the military duty cycle, is far less than the average commercial engine. But then as you've, I think, seen from our previous decks, I mean that engine is operating to 1,000 degrees higher temperature. And that is in particular when the aircraft has less air flow through it as it hovers in the air and has those capabilities for certain versions of that jet. So even with it's reduced duty cycle compared to a commercial, given it's still fairly new in the market, the spares parts of the business has been, I'll say, fairly limited, albeit it's still there. When I think about F-35, we were -- the critical turbine blades in it were all critical, yes, but the ones which are the most exacting to manufacture, which are the ones which have, I'm going to say, the extraordinary levels of coring to achieve the multi sort of level of chambers that they have within them too and then how the air comes out of the trailing edge, then the more difficult ones were really tough for us to make. And so we were under pressure all the way through 2019 to produce more blades and I recognize that it is possible, we were -- I don't think we were the limiting factor on the engine, but we were close to it and sought to increase that capacity with additional dies and improved yields as we went through the year. We believe that the combination of that plus the additional capacity that we brought online and pertain to our Whitehall engine facility has been helpful to that situation, and we've seen signs of improvement. But we're also clear at the moment, we could sell everything that we could make, given the, I'll say, unfulfilled with the basic demand that we have. So we're trying to build to a higher rate, a rate build for 2020, which is higher than the rate build in 2019. And then we're trying to prepare for additional rate increases also in 2021 and 2022. So the -- I mean the alleviation of capacity from, let's say, the commercial side has been helpful to it. But that wasn't the singular issue in terms of us meeting the rate increases relative to tooling as well. So right now, the way I think about it is that we found them a way of improving rates. We do know that there is a large spares demand that's there for us to fulfill as well on top of the increase in builds that's there. And so I look at it as a very positive thing for us in going through into '21 and '22 and beyond because then, we have additional rate increases to provide for plus the fact that the spares packages that are required to be fulfilled is going to be, also, a good thing in the future for Howmet. 
Thank you very much. I think that was the last question. So if we could close the call, please."

A little bit of an unusual circumstance in that for the first time in probably 15 or 16 years of doing earnings call, I haven't been in the same room as the CFO. However, we'll get on with it. I recognize that this earnings call is a little earlier than normal, but we felt it both opportune and appropriate given the current economic environment and the separation event that occurred for the company on the 1st of April. 
Let's move to Slide 4. As you know, on the 1st of April, we legally separated Arconic Inc., the reported entity today, into 2 companies: Howmet Aerospace, which is remainco, and that's companies primarily focused on the aerospace sector and contains 4 business units within the former Engineered Products and Forgings segment; Arconic Corporation, spinco, is primarily focused on rolled and extruded aluminum products to various end markets. Arconic Corporation contains the 3 business units within the former Global Rolled Products segment. 
Let me cover the Q1 results before talking further about the current environment that we're currently managing against. Now let's move to Slide 5. Please note all the numbers relating to Q1 are what we currently expect. We will finalize results and discuss them in greater detail on the 5th of May. For Q1, revenues were approximately $3.2 billion, down 9% versus 2019 and down 6% organically, adjusting for the pass-through effect of the lower aluminum prices, currency and the disposal of certain businesses. We experienced declines in the commercial transportation, automotive and aerospace markets, partially offset by growth in the industrial market. Year-over-year market declines were driven by the disruptions from COVID-19 and the Boeing 737 MAX production reduction. Moving to the segments, EP&F revenues were down 4% organically and GRP revenues were down 7% organically. 
Please move to Slide #6 for the operating profit. Operating profit, excluding special items, increased approximately $78 million year-on-year. And that was 20% resulting increase, resulting in a record margin of approximately 14.7%. We expect margin expansion of about 350 basis points year-over-year for Arconic Inc., with 300 basis points for EP&F and 310 basis points for GRP. Further profit performance progression was driven by the benefit of net cost reductions actioned last year as well as lower raw material costs and the price increases in the EP&F segment. Margin expansion is also expected to improve sequentially in both segments, having coming off the best ever fourth quarter results. When I look at each of the individual businesses in the 2 segments, every business increased its margins year-over-year despite being impacted by the disruptions I previously mentioned related to COVID and the MAX production cessation for the first quarter. I also note that the one troubled business in 2019, namely extrusions in the GRP segment, moved into profit and compared favorably to every quarter that we experienced in 2019, and this is a very significant turnaround. 
Now let me move to Slide #7. Earnings per share, excluding special items, is expected to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.62, up approximately 42% from $0.43 per share in Q1 of 2019. Earnings per share increased primarily due to the operational improvements from corporate and segment productivity. Special charges totaled approximately $60 million after tax and were primarily driven by the separation costs of some $50 million and severance costs of $16 million. The severance costs are tied to our new $100 million cost reduction initiative to align the cost base as we move into a period of demand uncertainty. 
Now let's turn to liquidity on Slide #8. Arconic Inc.'s pre-separation Q1 cash balance was approximately $2.65 billion. Adjusted free cash flow, excluding separation costs, improved $50 million year-over-year and was in the range of negative $200 million to $230 million, driven by the normal seasonal working capital build and significantly higher 2019 annual variable compensation payments. Q1 cash outflow associated with separation was approximately $110 million, and there is approximately $40 million of cash outflow expected in Q2, primarily associated with the early debt repayment that has already occurred on April 6. Howmet Aerospace post-separation cash balance is approximately $850 million after the $1.3 billion early redemption -- early debt repayment and allocation of $500 million of cash to the opening balance sheet of Arconic Corporation. The $850 million of cash is more than 2x the amount necessary to fund seasonal working capital changes. Howmet Aerospace's liquidity is strong, and also, we have an undrawn revolver of $1.5 billion. Lastly, in terms of notable impacts on Q1 trading and operations, the impacts worth noting are: COVID-19 disruptions; the Boeing 737 MAX production suspension; and the fire at one of our North American wheels plants. 
Let's move to Slide #9. Turning now to COVID-19. We felt impacts from certain customer shutdowns or suspensions and disruption within certain shifts. Some of Arconic Inc.'s plants were closed for a period during March due to the virus. Plant closures averaged approximately 7 days in the month. 
Now I'll turn to the outlook which I'll confine my comments solely to Howmet Aerospace. Currently, Howmet Aerospace has 8 manufacturing plants which are closed. Currently, we have limited visibility of future demand. Many of our customers are closed because of the coronavirus and the impacts on their employees. Information flow is limited. And hence, in the face of this uncertainty, we're reducing costs and preserving cash given the lack of clarity. We find ourselves unable to provide reliable guidance to you, and therefore, withdraw the guidance provided at the February 25 Investor Day. And as you know, we treat guidance as a very serious future tracking view. To mitigate the impact of the coronavirus disruptions, we have commenced plans to reduce by a further $100 million of cost on a run rate basis. This plan is incremental to the 2019 cost reductions, which carry over into 2020, and is primarily driven by incremental overhead and manufacturing reductions. Moreover, we're evaluating reducing capital expenditure due to the lower volumes. We have temporarily suspended the dividend to preserve cash to provide for additional flexibility. We'll continue to finalize the first quarter results and go into more detail on May 5. Additional slides have been provided in the appendix. 
And with that, I'll now move to Q&A."

At the current time, we see no problem regarding coming up to future rates. In fact, what we had done, if you go back to earlier, the last earnings call in, I think, late January, one of the concerns I had then was trying to manage our way through the 737 situation, and indeed, protecting the, I'll say, vital skills to be able to do that, at the same time recognizing that we were going to face a potential for a further reduction in labor to stay soft a lot in the summer. I think it's a great credit to our team that we managed to actually plan our way through and level set what we're doing in our manufacturing against the former -- or the current Boeing plant. And so we're able to eliminate that labor concern of the summer. Obviously, in the current environment, we're now unsure because we don't know what will be the rate return for the 737. But as it stands at the moment, we are in -- I would say, in good shape to be able to meet customer demand. We will then, as we begin to know more about the shape of future aircraft builds, then take another view about what further cost reductions will be necessary to face after that. All the time, we are interested in protecting the bottom line as much as we are able to with the demand reduction, which is likely to occur, and also to stay in a cash-generative situation."

We actually don't have any great detail of what inventory our customers are carrying. I'm always very cognizant of the -- I'll say, the multiplier effect that inventory can have in a down market for the end product. I think the notable point for Howmet would be for our engine business. I think, as you know, we were in a position of excess demand for almost continuously for the last 2-plus year. And that's the reason why we built those 2 new plants in Whitehall and Morristown. That's Whitehall, Michigan and Morristown, Tennessee. Obviously, it's a little bit unfortunate that we now have the capacity and we have a more uncertain demand. 
However, as you know, I think on a previous call, I did comment that we exited 2019 with actually a higher arrears position in aggregate across our engine business than we had when we entered the year and didn't make particular headway in the first quarter against that. So my thought is, I wouldn't be surprised to see some of those arrears vaporize in the case of falling demand. But at the same time, I feel there's a level of protection. So for some, it's $2.5 billion, $3 billion of revenue within the company. And my thought -- I would say it's knowledge. My thought is that the inventory multiplier effect may be fairly muted upon us, albeit it will be more significant in -- let's say, in the rings part of our business and also in our structural business and potentially fasteners. So it's -- there's no one single answer. 
And then at the same time -- I mean the one thing which is a bright spot for us, so I think, as you know, out of approximately $7 billion of aerospace revenue -- or in Howmet revenue last year, fractionally under $1 billion related to defense. And so let's call it, for sake of argument, $900 million, $950 million. And that was a source of strength for us in the first quarter. We saw approximately -- I must say, it's around about 17%. I mean not exactly precise, but over 15% increase in that demand in Q1. And at the moment, we don't expect anything but further strength in that part of the business going forward. So again, you need to bifurcate that, which goes to the commercial sector, which is by segment, and then also consider the defense aspect of the business. And also part of our industrial business that we face off to, it actually had also very solid demand in the first quarter. So -- and that's probably $400 million to $500 million of revenue, which also increased double digits. So you need to bifurcate all of that when you come up with revenue estimates."

But for my thought process, it's -- that's very conservative way of thinking about it. 
You're right about the undrawn revolver, and that's there for us. We are studying the current debt markets to see whether there's something we should be doing with regard that but haven't settled on a final plan at this point in time. But we're cognizant that with the support of the Federal Reserve into the credit markets, they do seem to be falling a little bit. And we continue to watch those to see how things are progressing.

And so if I use at the moment the only thing that I feel as though, I say I know, and that's -- you always -- you say -- when you say you know something, maybe it's difficult these days. But I have seen the announced plans of Airbus producing, for example, the narrow-body production from 60 a month down to 40 a month. And if you use that as a proxy for everything else at the moment, then my current feeling is that we will remain cash positive through the year as we go through it. And so when I look at the cash profile of what was Arconic Inc. and then I look at cash profile of Howmet, at the moment, assuming that's a sort of revenue type of adjustment, then I'm feeling and sensing -- it's not quite the same as saying I know because I'm not sure enough yet about all the promise of demand reduction, how the -- everything else will phase in. But I expect that 2020 will be a cash flow positive year after payment of interest, after payment of pension contributions. So that's net after everything that we currently envisage."

But why $400 million? It's because we normally have our biggest working capital burn or cash burn in the first quarter. As you're bringing up revenue, you're bringing up inventory and all that. The first quarter is now behind us, right? So we've done the working capital build. We're comfortable.

Clearly, when revenue is under pressure, you're always fighting -- let's say, fighting the -- let's say, you're fighting, let's say, as you go through this sort of thing. What I'd like to comment, first of all, my philosophical stance then bring it to practicality. So my philosophical stance is that I really don't treat anything as fixed, with the exception of depreciation, because that really is a decision of the past and we cannot change that. Everything else is changeable. Main question is the time line on which you change it. And so that's how I will say my stance relative to those type of discussions. And because I think it's the duty of every good business to challenge everything that you do. So that's how I start off. Then I'm going to reach back into history just to try and give you a view. 
So in, let's say, a prior life, and going back to the business I was involved with in 2008, 2009, which I think, as you know, is in the automotive business, which has margins far less than Howmet's. So let's think of margins about 1/3 of Howmet's, and in recognizing what we faced off to, there, we moved quickly and we moved often. And so first of all, you must not assume that the $100 million is done and gone, and that's it. So we moved successively at that time, and we only experienced the 2 quarters of operating loss. And of course, I'm not indicating for one second at the moment that we have operating loss. I'm just trying to say to you, that was pretty good and pretty unique for that industry. So in terms of what we will do and what we're doing is that you saw in Q1 that we actually have already taken a reserve. We're already implementing those cost reductions. And by no means that we called out that what we've done is it. And so once we are clearer on what is the shape of the business going forward as we move through 2020 and also into '21, because we also need to also think we're managing for and [ package predict ] that -- which is vital for the future, is that we'll have a better view over what shape will be our next action that we'll undertake to -- I'll say, to preserve as best we can the performance of the company. 
So it's a long way of saying, I can't give you the exact number because I don't know at this point. We should assume that we will be -- have a very keen eye to the cost base of the business and move accordingly. Then we'll focus on the cash flow of the business. We would also examine capital expenditure. And then the final part of your question, which was what are the decremental margins, I don't want to call that out at the moment. We will see whether we're able to say anything further in that regard in the more detailed call that we'll hold in early May, once we may have a better handle on the demand pattern going forward."

So this time last year, when we get our first quarter earnings, we committed to a target of $120 million in a year and we delivered the $213 million, so substantially overdelivered. But it's now we're talking about Howmet in moving forward. If you took that $213 million and said how much of that was Howmet last year, it's about $110 million, roughly half that. And we said that you're going to get some benefit in 2020 of another $50 million in 2020, just the carry-through of that cost-out action that we took last year. So $50 million incremental this year. We'll go into more detail on the May 5 call. But if you look at the first quarter alone for Howmet of that $50 million annually, we've got a little bit more than $20 million.

Revenue and profit for the first quarter were in line with the pre-release on April 14. Moreover, earnings per share is at the favorable end of the expected range. If you move to Slide 4, please. Then as we discussed on the last call, on the 1st of April, we separated Arconic Inc., the reported entity today, into 2 companies: Howmet Aerospace, which is RemainCo, which is primarily focused on the aerospace sector and contains the 4 business units within the Engineered Products and Forging segment; Arconic Corporation, SpinCo, which is primarily focused on rolled and extruded aluminum products, contains the 3 business units within the Global Rolled Products segment. The targeted guidance for onetime operational and CapEx costs related to the separation were $175 million. The final costs for the separation will actually be approximately $130 million, excluding tax leakage and debt breakage. Onetime separation costs were funded by divestiture proceeds of approximately $190 million. The highlight slide for the combined company of Arconic Inc., which includes the EP&F segment, the GRP segment and Corporate. Performance in the quarter was strong despite the impact of COVID-19, which surfaced during the last 3 weeks of March. Additionally, we were impacted by lower year-over-year 73 (sic) [ 737 ] MAX production rate reduction. Q1 revenues were $3.2 billion, down 9% versus 2019 and down 6% organically, adjusting for the pass-through of lower aluminum prices, currency changes and the divestiture of businesses. Operating income, including special -- excluding special items, was up 19%, with a 350 basis points improvement. Moreover, EP&F improved 300 basis points and GRP improved 310 basis points. We have now had 5 consecutive quarters of year-over-year margin expansion. Earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.62, a record and up 44% year-over-year. Adjusted free cash flow, excluding separation costs, improved $19 million year-over-year, and the cash balance at the end of the quarter was $2.64 billion. We've taken several actions to delever and improve our debt maturity profile, which I will discuss later in the presentation. Lastly, return on net assets was up 410 basis points to a record 14.8% return after tax. Now let me turn it over to Ken for a more detailed view of the financials."

Let's move to Slide 6. So for Q1, revenues were $3.2 billion, down 6% organically. Year-over-year market declines were driven by disruptions from COVID-19 and 737 MAX production declines, which impacted both segments. Revenues for EP&F were down 4% organically, driven by reductions in commercial aerospace of 7% and commercial transportation of 21%. We did have favorability in defense aero, which was up 17%, driven by the continued demand for the Joint Strike Fighter. Also, our industrial and other markets were up 13%, driven by increased demand for industrial gas turbines as natural gas prices are at 25-year lows. GRP revenues were down 7% organically, driven by all end markets with the exception of industrial, which was up 14% year-on-year as expected. Please move to Slide 7. On this slide, we've provided more visibility to the Howmet Aerospace end markets. The left-hand side of the slide breaks down Q1 revenue by market. So commercial aerospace is 58% of total revenue. Defense aero is 15%. Commercial transportation is also 15%. And industrial, combined with our other end markets, are 12%. We expect defense aerospace to continue to grow year-over-year due to strong demand for the Joint Strike Fighter on both new builds and engine spares. Within the industrial and other market slices of the pie, the highest growth section is IGT, our industrial gas turbines business. The IGT market was at a low level last year, and we expect to see growth in 2020, driven by increased demand for both new builds and spares. Regarding spares, we have previously communicated that airfoil spares represent approximately $800 million of annual revenue. Of the $800 million, approximately 50% relates to commercial aerospace engine spares and the other half for defense aero and IGT spares. Going forward, we expect reductions in commercial aero spares but an increase in defense aero and IGT spares. Hopefully, this slide gives greater transparency into Howmet Aerospace's end markets. We have created the same slide for GRP, which is listed at Slide 21 in the appendix. Now let's move to Slide 8. Operating profit, excluding special items, increased $75 million or 19% year-over-year, resulted in a record margin of 14.1% despite COVID-19 and 737 MAX impacts. Margin expansion was 350 basis points, up year-over-year, combined for total Arconic Inc. If we peel that back, EP&F had margin expansion of 300 basis points and GRP had margin expansion of 310 basis points. Corporate expenses, excluding special items, improved 29% year-over-year to $36 million, which is on track with our 2020 annual target. If we estimate a Q1 split of Arconic Inc.'s corporate expenses into the new Howmet Aerospace and new Arconic Corp. company is approximately $20 million of those corporate expenses go to Howmet and $16 million to Arconic Corp. Moving to EP&F. Our productivity continues to improve. For the first quarter, EP&F realized $26 million of year-over-year net cost reductions from actions that we took in 2019. 
The annual target for Howmet Aerospace was $50 million, and therefore, we're ahead of target for the first quarter. Additionally, we've announced another $100 million of incremental run rate net cost reductions and have taken a $16 million after-tax restructuring charge in the first quarter. Turning to price. We had $5 million of price increases in the first quarter, which was in line with our expectations. Moving forward, we expect greater price increases in quarters 2 through 4 despite the market conditions. GRP also had good net cost reductions in the quarter. GRP extrusions returned to profitability in Q1 and the Tennessee plant improved profitability by approximately $11 million year-over-year. Lastly, North American scrap utilization approached 60% to a record level. GRP price was approximately flat to the prior year quarter. So let's move to Slide 9. In Q1, we continued year-over-year segment margin expansion for both segments despite COVID-19 and the 737 impacts. To give you even greater visibility, let's quickly move to Slide 10. Since Q4 of 2018, EP&F segment operating profit has increased 520 basis points, and GRP's segment operating profit has increased 540 basis points. If we converted the EP&F segment operating profit to a pro forma Howmet Aerospace adjusted EBITDA, you get a percent of approximately 23.7%, which is in the top quartile of the peer group. Now let's move to Slide 11, where we have adjusted free cash flow and earnings per share. The charts show the consolidated company of Arconic Inc., and we've also tried to give you a view of what the estimate would be for Howmet Aerospace. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was negative $246 million. That was in line with our expectations due to our Q1 seasonal capital -- seasonal working capital build and an expected incremental $70 million of variable compensation payments tied to 2019 performance. Free cash flow for Q1 was $19 million better than the prior year and is the best performance since our first separation in 2016. Howmet Aerospace's free cash flow is approximately 40% of the total at negative $100 million. Earnings per share, excluding special items, was a record of $0.62, up 44% from Q1 of 2019. As expected, earnings per share increased primarily due to operational improvements from segment and corporate productivity. Approximately 65% of the earnings per share relate to Howmet Aerospace or $0.40 per share. Special items totaled approximately $60 million after tax, and they were primarily driven by separation costs of $50 million and severance costs of $16 million. Most of the severance costs are tied to the new incremental $100 million cost reduction initiative to realign our cost base as we move into a period of demand uncertainty. With that, let me turn it back over to John."

The health and safety of our employees is our top priority, and we've added the following precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19. We've restricted air travel, and in fact all travel, and are encouraging employees to work from home where appropriate. We have implemented social distancing standards throughout the manufacturing and office workspaces. And we are ensuring that updated protocols are followed. Lastly, we're continuing to deep clean and sanitize workspaces, which have potential exposure. We continue to be a reliable partner to our customers who are critical to national defense, commercial aviation and the global economy. Let's move to Slide 13. I'll now turn to the outlook for which I'll confine my comments to Howmet Aerospace. As discussed on the April 14 earnings -- preliminary earnings call, we have an incomplete picture of the future demand pattern since many of our customers' production has been significantly impacted. Information flow is currently limited, albeit improving. Hence, we're reducing costs, reducing capital expenditure, temporary suspending the common stock dividend and improving our debt maturity profile to preserve cash given the lack of clarity. We find ourselves unable to provide reliable guidance at this time. Turning now to COVID-19. We felt the impacts from certain customer shutdowns and suspensions and disruptions within certain shifts within our plants during the last 3 weeks of the quarter. Today, we have only 3 smaller plants, which are currently closed and they're in Europe. To mitigate the impact of COVID-19, we have commenced plans to reduce costs by a further $100 million on a run rate basis. This plan is incremental to the $50 million of carrier reactions we are making from 2019 and the actions we took then. Cost reductions are primarily driven by incremental overhead and some manufacturing reductions. Moreover, we will reduce annual capital expenditures by approximately $100 million from the initial target provided at our February 25 Investor Day. The full year capital expenditure estimate of $200 million is driven by lower volumes and us cutting those costs. Lastly, we have temporarily suspended the common stock dividend to preserve cash and provide additional flexibility. 
Despite the low volumes in 2020, we expect to be free cash flow positive for the year based upon these actions. And this free cash flow is after pension after interest and, in fact, all items of cash flow. To give greater visibility to the free cash flow, let's move to Slide 14 and its key components. We are providing Q1 results and annual estimates. On an annual basis, consistent with our previous guidance, corporate overhead, depreciation and amortization and cash taxes are unchanged. Pension and OPEB payments have been updated to $210 million based upon final separation calculations. Interest payments have been updated for the new debt issuance, and CapEx has been reduced by the $100 million previously mentioned. Common stock dividends have been temporarily suspended. Working capital will be a net source of cash for the year as AR inventory and accounts payable are reduced. Let's move to Slide 15 and talk about our debt maturities. We've taken 3 actions in April, the first action on April 6, that we redeemed all of our 2020 bonds for $1 billion. Additionally, we redeemed $300 million of the 2021 bonds. Secondly, on April 24, we completed a bond issuance for $1.2 billion, which is due in 2025. Thirdly, we initiated 2 tender offers, one for $760 million for a portion of the remaining 2021 bonds and the second tender offer for approximately $200 million for a portion of the 2022 bonds. These actions will result in the following 3 benefits. Firstly, we paid off all of the 2021 bonds. Secondly, we will take pressure off the balance sheet by reducing near-term maturities and turning them out a further 5 years. Thirdly, we'll be able to add approximately $190 million of cash to the balance sheet, which will add to our very healthy cash balance that we have currently. A pro forma cash balance as of April 24 would be approximately $1 billion. The pro forma cash balance would be after the Q1 seasonal working capital build. Moreover, we have reduced the operational cash requirements from $400 million to operate our business to $300 million based upon the updated seasonal working capital needs pertaining to Howmet. Finally, let's move to Slide 16. We have prepared a pro forma capital structure slide as of April 24. Pro forma cash would be approximately $1,030 billion (sic) [ $1,030 million ] and net debt would be approximately 2.4x. Additionally, we have an undrawn revolver of some $1.5 billion. And with that, let's move to Q&A."

And of course, what we think is the -- any LTA renewals really need to look at the 3- to 5-year period and not a specific 1- or 2-year time frame and the necessary capacities need to be put in place when the full run rates are reachieved. So for example, in the case of Airbus, we expect that a couple of years from now, they hopefully will be back up at 60 build rate per month or more. And the 737 MAX will be also going very well as the planes on the ground are cleared from what we've read from Boeing."

And they are, as you know, have been reassessing their own production plans and now that resetting their own inventories. My basic thought is that when we exited 2019, in fact, our arrears were at a higher level than we'd entered the year. And so given the arrears were so high, it would indicate that it wasn't an even sort of vast amount of inventory in the pipeline. But I guess it will be part specific and aircraft specific. So it's hard to give a very precise answer. But as a basic theme, if your arrears were even higher despite the massive increase in production that we did achieve and the part of the results we achieved last year, and we certainly didn't have a big burn down of inventory and arrears in the first quarter. So I don't know it's going to be a massive impact. At the same time, we don't have visibility into exactly what our customers are carrying."

And our view is that the peak demand for aftermarket is yet to come. And so let's assume that peak demand per our estimate is around 2025. And so that would be, let's say, approximately 7 years after the engine is replaced. So while we have spares demand during across the life of any engine, its peak is normally after the installed base is at its highest, and therefore, I'd say approximately a 7-year lag, and therefore, we have that CFM spares, I say, yet to peak. So that gives you a general direction for it. But it's also influenced by the duty cycle of those airfoils on the engine. And I think you're probably aware that to achieve the fuel efficiencies that are required for the newer engines in the thrust for lower emissions and a lower carbon footprint, those engines are running at higher pressures and temperatures. And so we do our very best to work with the engine manufacturer to achieve similar life cycle of the blades. But certainly, the impact of those pressure and temperatures is higher. So early on in an engine life, we probably have a slightly reduced duty cycle. But then it evens out over time. So that gives you the best answer I can give you to it. I wasn't able to answer your final point about what exactly what percentage is that -- I'd have to go and get that."

I think the -- first of all, the planned report out is that we've been thinking it's more likely that we give the segment information than anything else, albeit we've always given growth rates by end markets. And I understand why maybe the absolute percentages for end markets is also highly relevant. So we'll assess that and see whether we put that out there. The way I think about it at the moment is, let's say, approximately 58%, just under 60% of our business pertains to commercial aerospace. And I'd say a very coarse level of analysis, so I think it's just -- we're just worth -- it's only a quarter's analysis at this stage. If you take the changes currently anticipated by Airbus, for example, narrow-body, the A320, more like about a 35% reduction and wide-bodies at about a 40%.  And I'd say Boeing wide-body probably about the same, but it's a bit more cloudy because of the specific build quantities around the 737. So it's really difficult to give a generalized picture for the 737 at the moment. I mean, in fact, it's not recertified. But I'd take a broad sweep through it and say, down 35%, give or take, as a guesstimate at this point in time. Albeit we do need a little bit more time to be able to give a more accurate and be clear with a clearly thought through picture. 
On commercial transportation, I'm going to be rather more pessimistic and say about 15% of our end markets. We could see given the fact that if you take April, there was virtually no truck production. And therefore, I could see us being down close to 50% in that business ultimately. Given the current dramatic change in the order intake for Class A trucks, as an example, both in Europe and in the U.S. On defense, that 15%, you see double digits. I mean maybe it will be as big as the 17%, but that's on 15% growth. And then industrial, I'm going to say trucks, 10%, would be up, would be a guesstimate at this point for those sales or so. So when you -- and that's the way I sort of test as we try to reforecast each quarter and trying to reforecast the year as we go through this. I test that against the course modeling that I just gave to you. And it triangulates reasonably well at this point, albeit we do need another quarter to go by, I think, in terms of getting enough information to have confidence in providing guidance because I mean giving guidance, it's pretty serious.

Of course, we consider that 80% of our cost structure is variable. Now it doesn't all flex instantaneously as I'm sure you're well aware. There are things which move instantaneously, which is, for example, if you don't make the part, you don't buy the material. So you can expect material costs, by and large, to flex according to usage. And then we go through, as I said, the more extreme would be some of the staff costs, particularly in Europe, where any adjustments would need to be made after consultation with the European Works Councils and those sort of things. And so when we think about that, that it takes a longer time to flex it in accordance with the future demand outlook that we believe we'll see. And so that's what we're trying to do. So there's a guide in terms of what's truly fixed versus variable, and the variables is in accordance with time because the basic philosophy being there's very little that should be considered to be permanent or fixed. It's all to do with the passage of time."

One of the things we've tried very hard last year for Arconic Inc. was to -- rather than as we -- all of the cash flow for the company in previous years had really been achieved in the fourth quarter. We advanced that significantly last year. So we were generative in the third and fourth quarters. And we were clearly driving on that to really only have our first quarter being a quarter of cash outflow. And it's a bit too early to say whether that will be achieved given the uncertainty that we have and we're dealing with at the moment. But that's basically directionally where we believe to be. Now what I expect to happen is for working capital, I think receivables and payables flex, I think, for the most part. The latest [ code ] of the day is that we have in the activity levels, the most difficult one will be inventory management. And my expectation is there, that in the earlier part of the remaining 3 quarters of the year, we will have a degradation of days of inventory. Part of it is just to do with the -- able to respond and flex on input materials in real-time when you would have uncertain, I'd say, customer schedules. I mean plants have been -- some are already closed with receiving docks closed. And therefore, if you can't deliver product, it's not surprising, your inventory will increase a bit. But then there's also the effect of an irreducible amount of inventory between machine stations and extrusion stations in the forging presses in the business. And so my expectation is that we will see both for Q2 and for the year, but to a lesser extent as we go through the year as we work this down. So days will -- I expect by the end of the year, days will be better than they are in Q2, but not as good as previously just because of the scale of, I'll say, demand contraction that is there potentially. And albeit we'll be grappling with it and driving inventory down in absolute dollars as we go through the year. So it's just -- again, it's one of time. And so while we'll seem to be a little bit more inefficient in the second quarter, improving efficiency there afterwards. But in terms of inventory dollars, I struggle to believe that given the scale of diminution of -- on the commercial aerospace business that we'll be as efficient as we were in these terms as 2019."

It's essentially all OE at this point in time, very little spares. That's not to say the spares aren't required because they are, because the duty cycle of that engine, given it's the military duty cycle, is far less than the average commercial engine. But then as you've, I think, seen from our previous decks, I mean that engine is operating to 1,000 degrees higher temperature. And that is in particular when the aircraft has less air flow through it as it hovers in the air and has those capabilities for certain versions of that jet. So even with its reduced duty cycle compared to a commercial, given it's still fairly new in the market, the spares parts of the business has been, I'll say, fairly limited, albeit it's still there. When I think about F-35, we were -- the critical turbine blades in it were all critical, yes, but the ones which are the most exacting to manufacture, which are the ones which have, I'm going to say, the extraordinary levels of coring to achieve the multi sort of level of chambers that they have within them too and then how the air comes out of the trailing edge, then the more difficult ones were really tough for us to make. And so we were under pressure all the way through 2019 to produce more blades and I recognize that it is possible, we were -- I don't think we were the limiting factor on the engine, but we were close to it and sought to increase that capacity with additional dies and improved yields as we went through the year. We believe that the combination of that plus the additional capacity that we brought online and pertain to our Whitehall engine facility has been helpful to that situation, and we've seen signs of improvement. But we're also clear at the moment, we could sell everything that we could make, given the, I'll say, unfulfilled with the basic demand that we have. So we're trying to build to a higher rate, a rate build for 2020, which is higher than the rate build in 2019. And then we're trying to prepare for additional rate increases also in 2021 and 2022. So the -- I mean the alleviation of capacity from, let's say, the commercial side has been helpful to it. But that wasn't the singular issue in terms of us meeting the rate increases relative to tooling as well. So right now, the way I think about it is that we found them a way of improving rates. We do know that there is a large spares demand that's there for us to fulfill as well on top of the increase in builds that's there. And so I look at it as a very positive thing for us in going through into '21 and '22 and beyond because then, we have additional rate increases to provide for plus the fact that the spares packages that are required to be fulfilled is going to be, also, a good thing in the future for Howmet. 
Thank you very much. I think that was the last question. So if we could close the call, please."

Revenue and profit for the first quarter were in line with the pre-release on April 14. Moreover, earnings per share is at the favorable end of the expected range. If you move to Slide 4, please. Then as we discussed on the last call, on the 1st of April, we separated Arconic Inc., the reported entity today, into 2 companies: Howmet Aerospace, which is RemainCo, which is primarily focused on the aerospace sector and contains the 4 business units within the Engineered Products and Forging segment; Arconic Corporation, SpinCo, which is primarily focused on rolled and extruded aluminum products, contains the 3 business units within the Global Rolled Products segment. The targeted guidance for onetime operational and CapEx costs related to the separation were $175 million. The final costs for the separation will actually be approximately $130 million, excluding tax leakage and debt breakage. Onetime separation costs were funded by divestiture proceeds of approximately $190 million. The highlight slide for the combined company of Arconic Inc., which includes the EP&F segment, the GRP segment and Corporate. Performance in the quarter was strong despite the impact of COVID-19, which surfaced during the last 3 weeks of March. Additionally, we were impacted by lower year-over-year 73 (sic) [ 737 ] MAX production rate reduction. Q1 revenues were $3.2 billion, down 9% versus 2019 and down 6% organically, adjusting for the pass-through of lower aluminum prices, currency changes and the divestiture of businesses. Operating income, including special -- excluding special items, was up 19%, with a 350 basis points improvement. Moreover, EP&F improved 300 basis points and GRP improved 310 basis points. We have now had 5 consecutive quarters of year-over-year margin expansion. Earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.62, a record and up 44% year-over-year. Adjusted free cash flow, excluding separation costs, improved $19 million year-over-year, and the cash balance at the end of the quarter was $2.64 billion. We've taken several actions to delever and improve our debt maturity profile, which I will discuss later in the presentation. Lastly, return on net assets was up 410 basis points to a record 14.8% return after tax. Now let me turn it over to Ken for a more detailed view of the financials."

Let's move to Slide 6. So for Q1, revenues were $3.2 billion, down 6% organically. Year-over-year market declines were driven by disruptions from COVID-19 and 737 MAX production declines, which impacted both segments. Revenues for EP&F were down 4% organically, driven by reductions in commercial aerospace of 7% and commercial transportation of 21%. We did have favorability in defense aero, which was up 17%, driven by the continued demand for the Joint Strike Fighter. Also, our industrial and other markets were up 13%, driven by increased demand for industrial gas turbines as natural gas prices are at 25-year lows. GRP revenues were down 7% organically, driven by all end markets with the exception of industrial, which was up 14% year-on-year as expected. Please move to Slide 7. On this slide, we've provided more visibility to the Howmet Aerospace end markets. The left-hand side of the slide breaks down Q1 revenue by market. So commercial aerospace is 58% of total revenue. Defense aero is 15%. Commercial transportation is also 15%. And industrial, combined with our other end markets, are 12%. We expect defense aerospace to continue to grow year-over-year due to strong demand for the Joint Strike Fighter on both new builds and engine spares. Within the industrial and other market slices of the pie, the highest growth section is IGT, our industrial gas turbines business. The IGT market was at a low level last year, and we expect to see growth in 2020, driven by increased demand for both new builds and spares. Regarding spares, we have previously communicated that airfoil spares represent approximately $800 million of annual revenue. Of the $800 million, approximately 50% relates to commercial aerospace engine spares and the other half for defense aero and IGT spares. Going forward, we expect reductions in commercial aero spares but an increase in defense aero and IGT spares. Hopefully, this slide gives greater transparency into Howmet Aerospace's end markets. We have created the same slide for GRP, which is listed at Slide 21 in the appendix. Now let's move to Slide 8. Operating profit, excluding special items, increased $75 million or 19% year-over-year, resulted in a record margin of 14.1% despite COVID-19 and 737 MAX impacts. Margin expansion was 350 basis points, up year-over-year, combined for total Arconic Inc. If we peel that back, EP&F had margin expansion of 300 basis points and GRP had margin expansion of 310 basis points. Corporate expenses, excluding special items, improved 29% year-over-year to $36 million, which is on track with our 2020 annual target. If we estimate a Q1 split of Arconic Inc.'s corporate expenses into the new Howmet Aerospace and new Arconic Corp. company is approximately $20 million of those corporate expenses go to Howmet and $16 million to Arconic Corp. Moving to EP&F. Our productivity continues to improve. For the first quarter, EP&F realized $26 million of year-over-year net cost reductions from actions that we took in 2019. 
The annual target for Howmet Aerospace was $50 million, and therefore, we're ahead of target for the first quarter. Additionally, we've announced another $100 million of incremental run rate net cost reductions and have taken a $16 million after-tax restructuring charge in the first quarter. Turning to price. We had $5 million of price increases in the first quarter, which was in line with our expectations. Moving forward, we expect greater price increases in quarters 2 through 4 despite the market conditions. GRP also had good net cost reductions in the quarter. GRP extrusions returned to profitability in Q1 and the Tennessee plant improved profitability by approximately $11 million year-over-year. Lastly, North American scrap utilization approached 60% to a record level. GRP price was approximately flat to the prior year quarter. So let's move to Slide 9. In Q1, we continued year-over-year segment margin expansion for both segments despite COVID-19 and the 737 impacts. To give you even greater visibility, let's quickly move to Slide 10. Since Q4 of 2018, EP&F segment operating profit has increased 520 basis points, and GRP's segment operating profit has increased 540 basis points. If we converted the EP&F segment operating profit to a pro forma Howmet Aerospace adjusted EBITDA, you get a percent of approximately 23.7%, which is in the top quartile of the peer group. Now let's move to Slide 11, where we have adjusted free cash flow and earnings per share. The charts show the consolidated company of Arconic Inc., and we've also tried to give you a view of what the estimate would be for Howmet Aerospace. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was negative $246 million. That was in line with our expectations due to our Q1 seasonal capital -- seasonal working capital build and an expected incremental $70 million of variable compensation payments tied to 2019 performance. Free cash flow for Q1 was $19 million better than the prior year and is the best performance since our first separation in 2016. Howmet Aerospace's free cash flow is approximately 40% of the total at negative $100 million. Earnings per share, excluding special items, was a record of $0.62, up 44% from Q1 of 2019. As expected, earnings per share increased primarily due to operational improvements from segment and corporate productivity. Approximately 65% of the earnings per share relate to Howmet Aerospace or $0.40 per share. Special items totaled approximately $60 million after tax, and they were primarily driven by separation costs of $50 million and severance costs of $16 million. Most of the severance costs are tied to the new incremental $100 million cost reduction initiative to realign our cost base as we move into a period of demand uncertainty. With that, let me turn it back over to John."

Hence, we're reducing costs, reducing capital expenditure, temporary suspending the common stock dividend and improving our debt maturity profile to preserve cash given the lack of clarity. We find ourselves unable to provide reliable guidance at this time. Turning now to COVID-19. We felt the impacts from certain customer shutdowns and suspensions and disruptions within certain shifts within our plants during the last 3 weeks of the quarter. Today, we have only 3 smaller plants, which are currently closed and they're in Europe. To mitigate the impact of COVID-19, we have commenced plans to reduce costs by a further $100 million on a run rate basis. This plan is incremental to the $50 million of carrier reactions we are making from 2019 and the actions we took then. Cost reductions are primarily driven by incremental overhead and some manufacturing reductions. Moreover, we will reduce annual capital expenditures by approximately $100 million from the initial target provided at our February 25 Investor Day. The full year capital expenditure estimate of $200 million is driven by lower volumes and us cutting those costs. Lastly, we have temporarily suspended the common stock dividend to preserve cash and provide additional flexibility. 
Despite the low volumes in 2020, we expect to be free cash flow positive for the year based upon these actions. And this free cash flow is after pension after interest and, in fact, all items of cash flow. To give greater visibility to the free cash flow, let's move to Slide 14 and its key components. We are providing Q1 results and annual estimates. On an annual basis, consistent with our previous guidance, corporate overhead, depreciation and amortization and cash taxes are unchanged. Pension and OPEB payments have been updated to $210 million based upon final separation calculations. Interest payments have been updated for the new debt issuance, and CapEx has been reduced by the $100 million previously mentioned. Common stock dividends have been temporarily suspended. Working capital will be a net source of cash for the year as AR inventory and accounts payable are reduced. Let's move to Slide 15 and talk about our debt maturities. We've taken 3 actions in April, the first action on April 6, that we redeemed all of our 2020 bonds for $1 billion. Additionally, we redeemed $300 million of the 2021 bonds. Secondly, on April 24, we completed a bond issuance for $1.2 billion, which is due in 2025. Thirdly, we initiated 2 tender offers, one for $760 million for a portion of the remaining 2021 bonds and the second tender offer for approximately $200 million for a portion of the 2022 bonds. These actions will result in the following 3 benefits. Firstly, we paid off all of the 2021 bonds. Secondly, we will take pressure off the balance sheet by reducing near-term maturities and turning them out a further 5 years. Thirdly, we'll be able to add approximately $190 million of cash to the balance sheet, which will add to our very healthy cash balance that we have currently. A pro forma cash balance as of April 24 would be approximately $1 billion. The pro forma cash balance would be after the Q1 seasonal working capital build. Moreover, we have reduced the operational cash requirements from $400 million to operate our business to $300 million based upon the updated seasonal working capital needs pertaining to Howmet. Finally, let's move to Slide 16. We have prepared a pro forma capital structure slide as of April 24. Pro forma cash would be approximately $1,030 billion (sic) [ $1,030 million ] and net debt would be approximately 2.4x. Additionally, we have an undrawn revolver of some $1.5 billion. And with that, let's move to Q&A."

And of course, what we think is the -- any LTA renewals really need to look at the 3- to 5-year period and not a specific 1- or 2-year time frame and the necessary capacities need to be put in place when the full run rates are reachieved. So for example, in the case of Airbus, we expect that a couple of years from now, they hopefully will be back up at 60 build rate per month or more. And the 737 MAX will be also going very well as the planes on the ground are cleared from what we've read from Boeing."

And they are, as you know, have been reassessing their own production plans and now that resetting their own inventories. My basic thought is that when we exited 2019, in fact, our arrears were at a higher level than we'd entered the year. And so given the arrears were so high, it would indicate that it wasn't an even sort of vast amount of inventory in the pipeline. But I guess it will be part specific and aircraft specific. So it's hard to give a very precise answer. But as a basic theme, if your arrears were even higher despite the massive increase in production that we did achieve and the part of the results we achieved last year, and we certainly didn't have a big burn down of inventory and arrears in the first quarter. So I don't know it's going to be a massive impact. At the same time, we don't have visibility into exactly what our customers are carrying."

And our view is that the peak demand for aftermarket is yet to come. And so let's assume that peak demand per our estimate is around 2025. And so that would be, let's say, approximately 7 years after the engine is replaced. So while we have spares demand during across the life of any engine, its peak is normally after the installed base is at its highest, and therefore, I'd say approximately a 7-year lag, and therefore, we have that CFM spares, I say, yet to peak. So that gives you a general direction for it. But it's also influenced by the duty cycle of those airfoils on the engine. And I think you're probably aware that to achieve the fuel efficiencies that are required for the newer engines in the thrust for lower emissions and a lower carbon footprint, those engines are running at higher pressures and temperatures. And so we do our very best to work with the engine manufacturer to achieve similar life cycle of the blades. But certainly, the impact of those pressure and temperatures is higher. So early on in an engine life, we probably have a slightly reduced duty cycle. But then it evens out over time. So that gives you the best answer I can give you to it. I wasn't able to answer your final point about what exactly what percentage is that -- I'd have to go and get that."

I think the -- first of all, the planned report out is that we've been thinking it's more likely that we give the segment information than anything else, albeit we've always given growth rates by end markets. And I understand why maybe the absolute percentages for end markets is also highly relevant. So we'll assess that and see whether we put that out there. The way I think about it at the moment is, let's say, approximately 58%, just under 60% of our business pertains to commercial aerospace. And I'd say a very coarse level of analysis, so I think it's just -- we're just worth -- it's only a quarter's analysis at this stage. If you take the changes currently anticipated by Airbus, for example, narrow-body, the A320, more like about a 35% reduction and wide-bodies at about a 40%.  And I'd say Boeing wide-body probably about the same, but it's a bit more cloudy because of the specific build quantities around the 737. So it's really difficult to give a generalized picture for the 737 at the moment. I mean, in fact, it's not recertified. But I'd take a broad sweep through it and say, down 35%, give or take, as a guesstimate at this point in time. Albeit we do need a little bit more time to be able to give a more accurate and be clear with a clearly thought through picture. 
On commercial transportation, I'm going to be rather more pessimistic and say about 15% of our end markets. We could see given the fact that if you take April, there was virtually no truck production. And therefore, I could see us being down close to 50% in that business ultimately. Given the current dramatic change in the order intake for Class A trucks, as an example, both in Europe and in the U.S. On defense, that 15%, you see double digits. I mean maybe it will be as big as the 17%, but that's on 15% growth. And then industrial, I'm going to say trucks, 10%, would be up, would be a guesstimate at this point for those sales or so. So when you -- and that's the way I sort of test as we try to reforecast each quarter and trying to reforecast the year as we go through this. I test that against the course modeling that I just gave to you. And it triangulates reasonably well at this point, albeit we do need another quarter to go by, I think, in terms of getting enough information to have confidence in providing guidance because I mean giving guidance, it's pretty serious. We try to get it to be something, which we believe is going to be done rather than just say, it's not a wish."

Of course, we consider that 80% of our cost structure is variable. Now it doesn't all flex instantaneously as I'm sure you're well aware. There are things which move instantaneously, which is, for example, if you don't make the part, you don't buy the material. So you can expect material costs, by and large, to flex according to usage. And then we go through, as I said, the more extreme would be some of the staff costs, particularly in Europe, where any adjustments would need to be made after consultation with the European Works Councils and those sort of things. And so when we think about that, that it takes a longer time to flex it in accordance with the future demand outlook that we believe we'll see. And so that's what we're trying to do.

One of the things we've tried very hard last year for Arconic Inc. was to -- rather than as we -- all of the cash flow for the company in previous years had really been achieved in the fourth quarter. We advanced that significantly last year. So we were generative in the third and fourth quarters. And we were clearly driving on that to really only have our first quarter being a quarter of cash outflow. And it's a bit too early to say whether that will be achieved given the uncertainty that we have and we're dealing with at the moment. But that's basically directionally where we believe to be. Now what I expect to happen is for working capital, I think receivables and payables flex, I think, for the most part. The latest [ code ] of the day is that we have in the activity levels, the most difficult one will be inventory management. And my expectation is there, that in the earlier part of the remaining 3 quarters of the year, we will have a degradation of days of inventory. Part of it is just to do with the -- able to respond and flex on input materials in real-time when you would have uncertain, I'd say, customer schedules. I mean plants have been -- some are already closed with receiving docks closed. And therefore, if you can't deliver product, it's not surprising, your inventory will increase a bit. But then there's also the effect of an irreducible amount of inventory between machine stations and extrusion stations in the forging presses in the business. And so my expectation is that we will see both for Q2 and for the year, but to a lesser extent as we go through the year as we work this down. So days will -- I expect by the end of the year, days will be better than they are in Q2, but not as good as previously just because of the scale of, I'll say, demand contraction that is there potentially. And albeit we'll be grappling with it and driving inventory down in absolute dollars as we go through the year. So it's just -- again, it's one of time. And so while we'll seem to be a little bit more inefficient in the second quarter, improving efficiency there afterwards. But in terms of inventory dollars, I struggle to believe that given the scale of diminution of -- on the commercial aerospace business that we'll be as efficient as we were in these terms as 2019."

It's essentially all OE at this point in time, very little spares. That's not to say the spares aren't required because they are, because the duty cycle of that engine, given it's the military duty cycle, is far less than the average commercial engine. But then as you've, I think, seen from our previous decks, I mean that engine is operating to 1,000 degrees higher temperature. And that is in particular when the aircraft has less air flow through it as it hovers in the air and has those capabilities for certain versions of that jet. So even with its reduced duty cycle compared to a commercial, given it's still fairly new in the market, the spares parts of the business has been, I'll say, fairly limited, albeit it's still there. When I think about F-35, we were -- the critical turbine blades in it were all critical, yes, but the ones which are the most exacting to manufacture, which are the ones which have, I'm going to say, the extraordinary levels of coring to achieve the multi sort of level of chambers that they have within them too and then how the air comes out of the trailing edge, then the more difficult ones were really tough for us to make. And so we were under pressure all the way through 2019 to produce more blades and I recognize that it is possible, we were -- I don't think we were the limiting factor on the engine, but we were close to it and sought to increase that capacity with additional dies and improved yields as we went through the year. We believe that the combination of that plus the additional capacity that we brought online and pertain to our Whitehall engine facility has been helpful to that situation, and we've seen signs of improvement. But we're also clear at the moment, we could sell everything that we could make, given the, I'll say, unfulfilled with the basic demand that we have. So we're trying to build to a higher rate, a rate build for 2020, which is higher than the rate build in 2019. And then we're trying to prepare for additional rate increases also in 2021 and 2022. So the -- I mean the alleviation of capacity from, let's say, the commercial side has been helpful to it. But that wasn't the singular issue in terms of us meeting the rate increases relative to tooling as well. So right now, the way I think about it is that we found them a way of improving rates. We do know that there is a large spares demand that's there for us to fulfill as well on top of the increase in builds that's there. And so I look at it as a very positive thing for us in going through into '21 and '22 and beyond because then, we have additional rate increases to provide for plus the fact that the spares packages that are required to be fulfilled is going to be, also, a good thing in the future for Howmet. 
Thank you very much. I think that was the last question. So if we could close the call, please."

Tolga has been immersed in the business since his announcement as Co-CEO back at Investor Day in February. 
Now let's move to Slide 4 to cover second quarter results. First, let me paint a picture at the quarter. As you'll recall, we saw the first significant disruptions related to COVID-19 in the last 3 weeks of March. The initial effects were quarantine-related disruptions within Howmet plants and certain customers that ceased production, for example, Boeing, Airbus, Safran, et cetera. The full impact was felt in Q2 with customer shutdowns, schedule cancellations and Howmet plant disruptions. The results reflecting this impact show sales reduced year-over-year by some 31% and operating income, excluding special items, by 42%. Nevertheless, we were pleased with the absolute numbers, our 14.4% operating income margin and a 19.7% EBITDA margin. This reflects the swift cost containment actions undertaken starting at the end of the first week of April. And you may recall that we took our initial restructuring charge in the first quarter results. 
These cost reductions continue to take effect each month in the second quarter and will continue into Q3 and Q4. Later in my remarks, I'll begin to focus more on our exit rate trajectory for 2020 as we move into 2021. 
Further to the second quarter EBITDA margin at 19.7%, Howmet also generated earnings per share of $0.12. 
Now let's move to the balance sheet and cash flow. Adjusted free cash flow in Q2 was $76 million, excluding $11 million of separation costs. I also point out that the $76 million of cash generation included the effect of 3 items. Firstly, we reduced our AR securitization for the second time in 2020 and a customer supplier financing program by some $30 million. Second, we made $12 million of cash restructuring payments. And third, we made additional voluntary cash contributions to our U.K. pension plan of approximately $45 million to make a large reduction in the gross pension liability. For the absence of that, our free cash flow is after everything. And if we had not paid down the accounts securitization, the U.K. pension and the restructuring, the cash flow of $76 million would have been higher by some $87 million, over [ after ] $163 million in the quarter. 
The cash balance for Q2 improved. After the separation of Arconic Corp. on April 1, the opening cash balance of Howmet was approximately $800 million. At the end of the second quarter, the cash balance was $1.3 billion. The increase was due to approximately $65 million of cash generation after separation costs and the net addition of $420 million as a result of refinancing bonds from 2021 and 2022 to 2025. 
Net debt-to-EBITDA was 2.73x. Revolver capacity of $1 billion is undrawn. 
Now let's move on to Slide 5. We made rapid response to COVID-19 and the market declines. 
First, with regard to our employees and customers. Employee safety is a top priority, and we are actively managing employee health risks. Programs meet or exceed local standards. All of our sites are now up and running. We are a reliable partner to our customers who are critical to the national defense, to commercial aviation and to the global economy. 
Regarding profit and liquidity, management has undertaken the following actions: following some of the early workforce and reducing overtime; permanently reducing all types of labor, both hourly unsalaried; the elimination of temporary workers, flexing materials and services; reducing capital expenditures; and reducing our working capital. 
Lastly, as I mentioned, we refinanced our 2021 and '22 bonds into 2025 and added $420 million of cash to the balance sheet. And the revolver is undrawn. 
Now let me turn it over to Ken to give more details on our second quarter performance. And then I'll begin to speak to the outlook for the second half of the year."

Before getting started, I wanted to make a few comments on our basis of presentation.

Before getting started, I wanted to make a few comments on our basis of presentation. As a result of the separation on April 1, 2020, Howmet Aerospace has reported the results of the separated entity, Arconic Corporation, as discontinued operations for 1Q 2020 and prior periods. Per GAAP, it's important to note that corporate cost for the pre-separation periods were only allocated to Arconic Corporation if the costs were specifically attributable to the entity. Therefore, for pre-separation periods, Howmet retained 100% of all shared corporate costs. For 2019, Howmet statements will show approximately $190 million of corporate costs, excluding special items, since the shared costs were not allocated to Arconic Corporation. For clarity, we've provided a schedule on Slide 20 in the appendix, which is consistent with Howmet's 2020 Investor Day and shows an estimate of historical operational corporate costs. For 2019, the comparable annual operational corporate costs were estimated to be $100 million rather than $190 million. Looking forward into 2020, operational corporate costs are expected to be approximately $75 million. 
So let's move to Slide 6. In the second quarter, commercial aerospace was 54% of total revenue. Defense aerospace was 18%. Commercial transportation was 12%. And industrial, combined with our other end markets, was 16%. COVID-19 and 737 MAX production declines most severely impacted the commercial aerospace and commercial transportation markets, which were down 36% and 54% year-over-year, respectively. 
We continue to expect defense aerospace to grow year-over-year due to the strong demand for the Joint Strike Fighter on both new airplane builds and engine spares. In the second quarter, defense aerospace was up 3% year-over-year. And within the industrial and other markets, IGT was up 25% year-over-year. 
Now let's move to Slide 7. On this slide, we provided historical information for the combined segments with an estimated operational view of corporate. Howmet Aerospace will present financial information for 4 segments: Engine Products, Fastening Systems, Engineered Products and Forged Wheels. 
Compared to the prior year, 2Q revenue declined approximately $570 million, with a corresponding segment operating profit decline of $160 million. The associated segment decremental margin for 2Q 2020 was approximately 28% year-over-year. Included in the results are price increases of $9 million, which are expected to continue in the second half. Additionally, cost reductions were $55 million in the quarter as we benefited from actions taken in early April as well as last year. Without the price increases, the cost reductions reflects a variable cost in line with the significant sudden revenue decline. Segment operating profit decrement would have been more in the 37% range rather than the 28% range reported. In the appendix, we provided historical information for each of the segments. 
Now let's move to Slide 8. For each of the segments, we provided historical revenue segment operating profit and segment operating profit margin. We have also provided the revenue by market split for the current quarter as well as commentary on performance. 
First, we'll start with the largest segment, engines. For the second quarter, year-over-year revenue was down 30%. Commercial aerospace was down 44%, driven by COVID-19 and 737 MAX production declines. Commercial aerospace was somewhat offset by a 7% year-over-year increase in defense aerospace and a 25% increase in IGT as that market rebounds from a weak level in 2019. Price increases continued in the segment. Moreover, the team was able to quickly flex variable spending to mitigate the impact in the quarter of the significant decline in commercial aerospace revenue. The decremental margin for 2Q was 23% year-over-year. 
Now let's move to fasteners on Slide 9. For the fasteners segment, second quarter year-over-year revenue was down 18%. Commercial aerospace was down 15%, driven by COVID-19 and 737 MAX production declines. Fasteners shipped overdues in the second quarter, and we expect a steeper revenue decline in 3Q as inventory levels are being adjusted at our customers, and we expect seasonal revenue declines driven by European operations. The fasteners commercial transportation business was down 43%. Cost reductions across the segment helped mitigate the decrease in revenue, but higher absenteeism and the delay in European cost reductions resulted in a 40% year-over-year decremental margin. 
Now let's move to Slide 10 to review structures. For the structures segment, second quarter year-over-year revenue was down 31%. Commercial aerospace was down 40% driven by COVID-19 and the 787 production declines. Decremental margins were 6% year-over-year. Price increases, cost reductions and exiting unprofitable businesses in 2019 allowed structures to increase operating margin by 70 basis points year-over-year despite the 31% decline in revenue. 
Lastly, let's move to Slide 11 for wheels. In the second quarter, the Wheels segment was the hardest hit with a 56% reduction in revenue year-over-year. Decremental margins were 47%. For the month of April, almost all of our OEM customers were shut down with a gradual recovery in May and June. Despite the significant and rapid revenue decline, the segment was profitable due to the rapid cost reductions as well as their ability to quickly flex variable spending. 
Now let's move to Slide 12 for special items. Special items totaled $171 million on a pretax basis, which included 3 main items: first, a $64 million charge for pension plan settlements, primarily due to a voluntary action in the U.K. to reduce our gross pension liabilities by approximately $320 million; second, a $65 million charge related to the early redemption of 2020, 2021 and 2022 notes in the second quarter; the third item was a $46 million charge related to severance programs that are tied to the 2020 cost reduction actions as we continue to navigate through a period of demand uncertainty. 
So let's now move to Slide 13. In the second quarter, we completed a good deal of work to improve our capital structure and liquidity. We completed the following actions. We redeemed all of our 2020 bonds for $1 billion. We redeemed $889 million of our 2021 bonds, leaving $361 million, which will mature in April of 2021. We redeemed $151 million of our 2022 bonds, leaving $476 million that will mature in February 2022. Lastly, we completed a new bond issue for $1.2 billion, which is due in May of 2025. Our next significant debt maturity is in October of 2024. We also amended our revolving credit facility in the second quarter. As a result of these actions, we were able to increase our cash position by approximately $420 million. We also took pressure off the balance sheet by reducing the near-term maturities and increased our available liquidity. 
Before turning it back over to John to discuss the 2020 outlook, let me cover some assumptions on Slide 14. Corporate overhead is expected to improve to $75 million for the year based on further cost reductions. Annual operational tax rate remains in the 28% to 30% range for the year, but we could have volatility in the quarters based on the current environment. Lastly, pension and OPEB cash contributions remain at $210 million for the year and include the discretionary 2Q payment of $45 million, which reduced the U.K. gross pension liability by $320 million. 
So now let me turn it back over to John."

We are providing you an outlook, and that really is to give the best possible visibility to the company. Of course, we have been monitoring air traffic around the world and the best estimates of aircraft builds. And this leads us to provide this view to you for the balance of the year given that we're well into the second half. However, we do recognize that there remains significant uncertainties regarding the external environment. For example, spikes regarding COVID-19, visibility of customer inventory corrections and aircraft build rate changes in the face of any further COVID spiking. 
Here are the salient points. Full year revenue is expected to be $5.2 billion for the year, plus or minus $100 million. Commercial aerospace is expected to be down 35%, consistent with our previous view. Commercial transportation is expected to be down 45%, which is a modest improvement from our prior view. Defense, aerospace and industrial are expected to be up with defense aerospace up 10% and industrial up 5%. The consolidated annual revenue for all of our markets is expected to be down approximately 28 -- 25% to 28% year-over-year. EBITDA is expected to be $1.03 billion for the year, plus or minus $35 million, but it is made up of very different quarters. For example, in Q1, we had, I think, a good level of revenues nevertheless offset by disruption in the latter part of March. And then, of course, the transition quarters, as I call them, are the second and third quarters and then into the fourth quarter to new operating cost levels. Naturally, the outlook remains our best estimate at this stage given the volume variability due to the complete airline and aircraft build environment, as previously mentioned. 
Q3 revenue is expected to be the low point for the year based upon the current view and is approximately $1.1 billion, plus or minus $50 million, as we expect significant commercial aerospace customer inventory corrections in the quarter and a normal seasonal slowdown in Europe. Cost reductions continued throughout the third and [ fourth ] quarters as we approach run rate. Fourth quarter revenue is expected to recover somewhat, and EBITDA margins are expected to return to similar levels of the second quarter. This trajectory is important to note, especially since the operations methodology has been cost elimination and not cost deferral. 
Q2 to Q4 adjusted free cash flow is expected to be $400 million, plus or minus $50 million. For the year, we expect free cash flow to be in the $300 million range including a modest working capital benefit of less than $50 million. And of course, these cash flows I just mentioned are after the reduction and paydown of approximately $50 million of our accounts receivable securitization program and a customer supplier financing program, plus over $60 million of cash severance payments. Moreover, the cash flow includes a voluntary U.K. pension payment made in the second quarter of approximately $45 million to affect the $320 million of reduction in gross pension liabilities that Ken already mentioned. Earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.72 per share. 
Now I'll provide some additional commentary for the year and the second half. We are increasing our [ in-year ] cost reduction program to $100 million. Moreover, we expect an additional $50 million of structural cost savings in 2020 from the 2019 actions. These cost reductions are permanent and will help accelerate margin expansion when markets eventually recover. We are continuing to flex variable costs in addition to this, with the revenue decline. We are reducing CapEx further. Annual capital expenditure is now expected to be $175 million or approximately 3% in revenue. Our previous targets mentioned on the first quarter call was $200 million. We do expect pricing to remain favorable for the year. Q3 is expected to be weaker than the second quarter due to significant customer inventory adjustments and the seasonality already mentioned. However, in the fourth quarter, we do expect some modest recovery of volumes, with adjusted EBITDA margin similar to the second quarter. 
And now let's move to Q&A."

I mean the most visibility that we have currently is, I think, for Airbus, where they've given clear indications of build rates, which are well-publicized through certainly for narrow-body through, I think, April of next year at a rate of 40 with wide-body being down, I think rejections of like the A350 down to 5 per month. 
On Boeing, as I say, we've -- as I think everybody knows, we've had several demand forecasts over the last few months. And currently, the build rate there is projected to be very low at 7. So it's difficult to discern that at the moment in terms of where we are relative to inventory takeout, et cetera, et cetera. And also, we recognize or we have to recognize that the amount of, I'll say, for us in our engine business, what then flows through by way of engine demand and then the inventory levels in, for example, in GE, et cetera, et cetera. 
So essentially, the way we think about it is we've taken that which Boeing and Airbus have published, run that out through as best we can into -- through 2021. And then just note to ourselves is that, well, we have no visibility of like when we would expect recovery to occur but the -- I guess, the flip side that we have of where we're taking, I think, inventory reductions as part of our, I'll say, top line sort of degradation at the moment. Then as builds do eventually begin to recover, and we will see some inventory build in advance of that to prepare the pipelines for that demand recovery. 
So I know we're choosing not to call out when we say demand, low return. The one thing we've done is to recognize that it's a difficult environment. The mantra has been cost elimination, not cost deferral, such that as and when we do begin to see a demand pull, then given, say, the EBITDA margins that we achieved in the quarter and where we think we'll be for the year and at the end of the year, then we're well positioned to take advantage of any demand recovery as and when it occurs. 
The only thing we're consciously doing is that if we see a particularly low point, and we have called out Q3 in that, I don't plan to chase cost reduction for a quarter because I also want to make sure that we are well positioned to be able to meet recovery as and when it occurs, trying to define what that sort of loading is. And then should the future not turn out to be as we currently believe it to be, then obviously, we'll further adjust our cost base as necessary. So I don't know whether that gives you a pretty good picture, Carter, of how we're thinking about it and what we know and compared to what we don't know at the moment."

It's one of the most difficult things that we have to try to get that in terms of visibility because clearly, we're not privy to exactly, for example, how many engines are there? How many spares are being held? And indeed, what the inventory levels exactly were? We did note that we did have significant areas as we went out of 2019. But as I think as I've said on the earlier call, I mean those areas can evaporate when the build are no longer required. So we just believe that we are seeing -- and we're in this period of inventory reduction. We can't be certain of exactly how much will be cleared in the third quarter. There may still be some lingering into the fourth quarter and even beyond, depending on what the outlook looks like. 
At the same time, what we recognize in our own cash flows is that this year, our own working capital will not be as good as it could be, particularly regarding the inventory itself. Because we will have, even at the end of the fourth quarter, some trapped inventory, whereby given what we previously understood demand to be, we had scheduled materials and some of those we'll have to take, and some of the things that we have in our plants today, we will not be able to deliver, even though we are holding our customers to account is that there will be some significant few tens of millions of trapped inventory throughout the year, which will take, again, some time to burn off in the following year. 
So again, to summarize, it's inventory is the most difficult thing to get visibility around. And all we can do is look at these current schedules, and we just see that, that third quarter will be impacted further as our customers reassess their requirements."

That will continue throughout the year, but I think it we get more intense in the third quarter. The other thing, which we are noting and I'm going to say it again because I think I surprised you a little bit on the first quarter call when I think I said something to the effect that I saw commercial transportation recovering a little bit more quickly than the commercial aerospace. And indeed, we are seeing that is that while second quarter was quite dramatic as most commercial truck plants were closed, I mean, completely closed during April and part of May, but we are seeing improved demand, both in North America and in Europe. And we think that, that will strengthen as we go into the fourth quarter. 
So the way we're sort of trying to map out our year is that we -- CT is still fairly low in Q3, but we believe to be getting better than what the visibility we have from our customers. And you see a further inventory reduction in commercial aerospace in Q3, making some allowance for that to continue into Q4 and then it's like a bandwidth that we've tried to give you in terms of guidance to where we believe we'll end the year. So I wish it was more certain. I think the one thing that I think should be recognized and we have done our best to give you guidance, and we just do recognize that it is imperfect, for sure."

So -- because I'm always concerned about cost deferral will be something that as and when you do see improvement, cost flood back into your business. And I don't think that's the way to go forward. So I think it's a pure cost elimination. And I think the very best periods of time, indeed, I think many industries you saw this to some degree, in the few sector companies in -- after the 2008, 2009 is that when you've made the very serious attempt to reduce structural costs, then some of those, most of those, maybe all of those will go back into the business. And so then you really are just taking variable costs back on to meeting future revenues. So margin rates do begin to improve at that time. I mean it's question is really when do -- when does volume and that inventory build that I talked about earlier, when does it occur? And ask a bit and none of us know, and I'm just trying to make sure that we position how as best as we can, such that as and when volume will come back, then if we cannot print those sort of EBITDA margins that I talked about for Q2 and for Q4 when things are tough, then hopefully, that leads you to the belief that we can do as and when volumes improve. And that's what it's all about. It's like preparing Howmet for the upswing, which will come. But I think none of us know when it is, but I think our job is to make sure that we've positioned it as best as we can as quickly as we can, such that we can generate cash throughout, and that's what you're seeing."

So good track record if we have $81 million already in the bank, and we're targeting $150 million in for the full year. 
On top of that, if you look at back to the first quarter, we took a severance charge at the beginning of COVID-19 of about $20 million, and then you're seeing another severance charge in the second quarter of about $46 million. So there's a good trajectory on the cost out, the prices continuing. And also, we've exited some unprofitable businesses last year as well, so that should help us."

And then assuming that the recertification goes ahead, which we have no reason to believe that it won't, and that will be good news. And then Boeing plans to resume deliveries and then increase build rates as we go into 2021.

I'm thinking that this year that the $400 million for defense aerospace and the industrial business will be a little bit higher. So given the build, the OE build and the spares packages, which you need to go with those, so think of that a 10%-plus increase in that. So let's call it [ about ] $450 million. It could be a bit more. We don't know it yet. 
And then for the balance, I see a very severe contraction in the commercial aerospace. From that $400 million, probably down to the $150 million, plus or minus, from that $400 million. That's on a year, therefore, obviously, a massive reduction in the -- like in Q2, Q3, for the aftermarket. So it all balances out, probably in that region, maybe just shy of the $600 million range for total spares for Howmet in 2020, but with very different quarters, as you can imagine, given the lack of requirements for, say, repair and overhaul at the moment."

I mean, I have a view, but we've tried to think about that very clearly for ourselves in terms of what is our run rate in terms of revenues, what are our run rates in terms of margins, how does it pan out. And so we certainly have that uppermost in our mind about the trajectory into '21 and also into '22. So we're trying to think a lot about that, but I don't really want to give guidance at this point. I think the most important thing was to try to give you a steer for exit rate trajectory, which you got, and trying to give you some view of how we are seeing some inventory issues that have to be worked through. And hopefully, those are largely done by next year, but there's no guarantee. I've tried to give you a view about maybe the sub recovery in commercial transportation and, as I say, to move towards the latter part of the year. 
And then in terms of pricing, clearly, absolute dollars is going to be a function of revenue. We know that revenue is not going to be what we had in 2019. But -- and we've also recognized that the environment and our customers were all suffering at the moment. We're all in a world of hurt, but we also believe that the trajectory in terms of the price we've talked about is largely impact, albeit it can't be exactly the same, given the current pressures of the industry. And we've tried to call that out again in Q2 and give some steer for awards for the balance of the year. 
So at the moment, as best as you can be, I think we're largely on track for doing what we said we'd do and positioning the company as best we can in terms of cost structure and trying to give you the flow, ebbs and flows regarding inventory, albeit called out the imperfect nature of the visibility that we have and at the same time, really try to give ourselves the absolutely best positioning that we can, as and when revenues do begin to talk as they always do and they will and the run for that, I guess, we should see in the decline is that Howmet is really well positioned to be able to manufacture those parts and also get the right levels of profitability, given what we've done, the way we approached our cost planning for 2020."

Now I mean in what do I mean by pretty close, but I'm not saying it's going to be above, but getting close to. So I'm feeling a little bit more confident there. And then commensurate with the fact that I think as we've told and informed the markets that each year, we do take a little bit of share from the steel wheels. We have introduced, as you know, that new 39-pound wheel and therefore, lever at the market-leading forefront. And that's also witnessed by our market shares across the world in wheels. 
I'm thinking that, actually, as we go into 2023, we're going to see above 2019 volumes. Now it's what -- just I said, just because this is what we think, doesn't mean to say that's where it will be, but this is how we're thinking about the business. And even more importantly, what we're doing at the moment, we are repositioning our capacity in that business, such that when volume does occur is that we're able to manufacture at an even more efficient rate than we've previously done. But that's going to require that volume pull to be there to be seen in terms of our results. So I think this is things that we could not have done if we'd have had the demand levels of '19 just flowing through '20 and '21 are going to take the opportunity to reprofile some of that production to enable that future, I'll say, improved cost levels to occur. So 22 for the volume and 23 for above 2019 is how we see it. 
It's a long way when you -- it's a long way out just when you're battling in the individual weeks and quarters at the moment."

Of course, as always, as time goes by, things change. I mean, today, if any proposals were made to any companies, my view is that no could possibly ever evaluate anything at this point because on what basis would any valuation be made because the visibility is so low. 
On the other hand, give it -- when you get to 2021 or sometime, could be '22, but I think that there will be increased clarity. And I think that it's going to be during that time period when -- if there is M&A activity across the, let's say, the wider industrial space and then aerospace as a subsector of that is that I'd expect those sort of moves to occur during that period of time when there will be more visibility so that any time that companies want to make an acquisitive step or when any acquisitive steps are received, it just depends upon the new Board's evaluation. 
So that's my guess. But no, we've not been approached by any of our customers to consider acquiring anybody or anything like that."

Tolga has been immersed in the business since his announcement as Co-CEO back at Howmet's Investor Day in February. 
Now let's move to Slide 4 to cover second quarter results. First, let me paint a picture of the quarter. As you'll recall, we saw the first significant disruptions related to COVID-19 in the last 3 weeks of March. The initial effects were quarantine-related disruptions within Howmet plants and certain customers that ceased production, for example, Boeing, Airbus, Safran, et cetera. The full impact was felt in Q2 with customer shutdowns, scheduled cancellations and Howmet plant disruptions. The results reflecting this impact show sales reduced year-over-year by some 31% and operating income, excluding special items, by 42%. Nevertheless, we were pleased with the absolute numbers, our 14.4% operating income margin and a 19.7% EBITDA margin. This reflects the swift cost containment actions undertaken starting at the end of the first week of April. And you may recall that we took our initial restructuring charge in the first quarter results. 
These cost reductions continue to take effect each month in the second quarter and will continue into Q3 and Q4. Later in my remarks, I'll begin to focus more on our exit rate trajectory for 2020 as we move into 2021. 
Further to the second quarter EBITDA margin at 19.7%, Howmet also generated earnings per share of $0.12. 
Now let's move to the balance sheet and cash flow. Adjusted free cash flow in Q2 was $76 million, excluding $11 million of separation costs. I also point out that the $76 million of cash generation included the effect of 3 items. Firstly, we reduced our AR securitization for the second time in 2020 and a customer supplier financing program by some $30 million. Second, we made $12 million of cash restructuring payments. And third, we made additional voluntary cash contributions to our U.K. pension plan of approximately $45 million to make a large reduction in the gross pension liability. For the absence of doubt, our free cash flow is after everything. And if we had not paid down the accounts securitization, the U.K. pension and the restructuring, the cash flow of $76 million would have been higher by some $87 million, [ over ] $163 million in the quarter. 
The cash balance for Q2 improved. After the separation of Arconic Corp. on April 1, the opening cash balance of Howmet was approximately $800 million. At the end of the second quarter, the cash balance was $1.3 billion. The increase was due to approximately $65 million of cash generation after separation costs and the net addition of $420 million as a result of refinancing bonds from 2021 and 2022 to 2025. 
Net debt-to-EBITDA was 2.73x. Revolver capacity of $1 billion is undrawn. 
Now let's move on to Slide 5. We made rapid response to COVID-19 and the market declines. 
First, with regard to our employees and customers. Employee safety is a top priority, and we are actively managing employee health risks. Programs meet or exceed local standards. All of our sites are now up and running. We are a reliable partner to our customers who are critical to the national defense, to commercial aviation and to the global economy. 
Regarding profit and liquidity, management has undertaken the following actions: furloughing some of the hourly workforce and reducing overtime; permanently reducing all types of labor, both hourly and salaried; the elimination of temporary workers; flexing materials and services; reducing capital expenditures; and reducing our working capital. 
Lastly, as I mentioned, we refinanced our 2021 and '22 bonds into 2025 and added $420 million of cash to the balance sheet. And the revolver is undrawn. 
Now let me turn it over to Ken to give more details on our second quarter performance. And then I'll begin to speak to the outlook for the second half of the year."
416264458,678227782,2063769,"Howmet Aerospace Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 06, 2020",2020-08-06,"Earnings Calls","Howmet Aerospace Inc.","Executives","Great. Thank you, John. Before getting started, I wanted to make a few comments on our basis of presentation. As a result of the separation on April 1, 2020, Howmet Aerospace has reported the results of the separated entity, Arconic Corporation, as discon",1200,"Great. Thank you, John. Before getting started, I wanted to make a few comments on our basis of presentation. As a result of the separation on April 1, 2020, Howmet Aerospace has reported the results of the separated entity, Arconic Corporation, as discontinued operations for 1Q 2020 and prior periods. Per GAAP, it's important to note that corporate cost for the pre-separation periods were only allocated to Arconic Corporation if the costs were specifically attributable to the entity. Therefore, for pre-separation periods, Howmet retained 100% of all shared corporate costs. For 2019, Howmet statements will show approximately $190 million of corporate costs, excluding special items, since the shared costs were not allocated to Arconic Corporation. For clarity, we've provided a schedule on Slide 20 in the appendix, which is consistent with Howmet's 2020 Investor Day and shows an estimate of historical operational corporate costs. For 2019, the comparable annual operational corporate costs were estimated to be $100 million rather than $190 million. Looking forward into 2020, operational corporate costs are expected to be approximately $75 million. 
So let's move to Slide 6. In the second quarter, commercial aerospace was 54% of total revenue; defense aerospace was 18%; commercial transportation was 12%; and industrial, combined with our other end markets, was 16%. COVID-19 and 737 MAX production declines most severely impacted the commercial aerospace and commercial transportation markets, which were down 36% and 54% year-over-year, respectively. 
We continue to expect defense aerospace to grow year-over-year due to the strong demand for the Joint Strike Fighter on both new airplane builds and engine spares. In the second quarter, defense aerospace was up 3% year-over-year. And within the industrial and other markets, IGT was up 25% year-over-year. 
Now let's move to Slide 7. On this slide, we provided historical information for the combined segments with an estimated operational view of corporate. Howmet Aerospace will present financial information for 4 segments: Engine Products, Fastening Systems, Engineered Products and Forged Wheels. 
Compared to the prior year, 2Q revenue declined approximately $570 million, with a corresponding segment operating profit decline of $160 million. The associated segment decremental margin for 2Q 2020 was approximately 28% year-over-year. Included in the results are price increases of $9 million, which are expected to continue in the second half. Additionally, cost reductions were $55 million in the quarter as we benefited from actions taken in early April as well as last year. Without the price increases, the cost reductions reflects a variable cost in line with the significant sudden revenue decline. Segment operating profit decrement would have been more in the 37% range rather than the 28% range reported. In the appendix, we provided historical information for each of the segments. 
Now let's move to Slide 8. For each of the segments, we provided historical revenue, segment operating profit and segment operating profit margin. We have also provided the revenue by market split for the current quarter as well as commentary on performance. 
First, we'll start with the largest segment, engines. For the second quarter, year-over-year revenue was down 30%. Commercial aerospace was down 44%, driven by COVID-19 and 737 MAX production declines. Commercial aerospace was somewhat offset by a 7% year-over-year increase in defense aerospace and a 25% increase in IGT as that market rebounds from a weak level in 2019. Price increases continued in the segment. Moreover, the team was able to quickly flex variable spending to mitigate the impact in the quarter of the significant decline in commercial aerospace revenue. The decremental margin for 2Q was 23% year-over-year. 
Now let's move to fasteners on Slide 9. For the fasteners segment, second quarter year-over-year revenue was down 18%. Commercial aerospace was down 15%, driven by COVID-19 and 737 MAX production declines. Fasteners shipped overdues in the second quarter, and we expect a steeper revenue decline in 3Q as inventory levels are being adjusted at our customers, and we expect seasonal revenue declines driven by European operations. The fasteners commercial transportation business was down 43%. Cost reductions across the segment helped mitigate the decrease in revenue, but higher absenteeism and the delay in European cost reductions resulted in a 40% year-over-year decremental margin. 
Now let's move to Slide 10 to review structures. For the structures segment, second quarter year-over-year revenue was down 31%. Commercial aerospace was down 40% driven by COVID-19 and the 787 (sic) [ 737 ] production declines. Decremental margins were 6% year-over-year. Price increases, cost reductions and exiting unprofitable businesses in 2019 allowed structures to increase operating margin by 70 basis points year-over-year despite the 31% decline in revenue. 
Lastly, let's move to Slide 11 for wheels. In the second quarter, the Wheels segment was the hardest hit with a 56% reduction in revenue year-over-year. Decremental margins were 47%. For the month of April, almost all of our OEM customers were shut down with a gradual recovery in May and June. Despite the significant and rapid revenue decline, the segment was profitable due to the rapid cost reductions as well as their ability to quickly flex variable spending. 
Now let's move to Slide 12 for special items. Special items totaled $171 million on a pretax basis, which included 3 main items: first, a $64 million charge for pension plan settlements primarily due to a voluntary action in the U.K. to reduce our gross pension liabilities by approximately $320 million; second, a $65 million charge related to the early redemption of 2020, 2021 and 2022 notes in the second quarter; and the third item was a $46 million charge related to severance programs that are tied to the 2020 cost reduction actions as we continue to navigate through a period of demand uncertainty. 
So let's now move to Slide 13. In the second quarter, we completed a good deal of work to improve our capital structure and liquidity. We completed the following actions. We redeemed all of our 2020 bonds for $1 billion. We redeemed $889 million of our 2021 bonds, leaving $361 million, which will mature in April of 2021. We redeemed $151 million of our 2022 bonds, leaving $476 million that will mature in February 2022. Lastly, we completed a new bond issue for $1.2 billion, which is due in May of 2025. Our next significant debt maturity is in October of 2024. We also amended our revolving credit facility in the second quarter. As a result of these actions, we were able to increase our cash position by approximately $420 million. We also took pressure off the balance sheet by reducing the near-term maturities and increased our available liquidity. 
Before turning it back over to John to discuss the 2020 outlook, let me cover some assumptions on Slide 14. Corporate overhead is expected to improve to $75 million for the year based on further cost reductions. Annual operational tax rate remains in the 28% to 30% range for the year, but we could have volatility in the quarters based on the current environment. Lastly, pension and OPEB cash contributions remain at $210 million for the year and include the discretionary 2Q payment of $45 million, which reduced the U.K. gross pension liability by $320 million. 
So now let me turn it back over to John."

We are providing you an outlook, and that really is to give the best possible visibility to the company. Of course, we have been monitoring air traffic around the world and the best estimates of aircraft builds. And this leads us to provide this view to you for the balance of the year given that we're well into the second half. However, we do recognize that there remains significant uncertainties regarding the external environment. For example, spikes regarding COVID-19, visibility of customer inventory corrections and aircraft build rate changes in the face of any further COVID spiking. 
Here are the salient points. Full year revenue is expected to be $5.2 billion for the year, plus or minus $100 million. Commercial aerospace is expected to be down 35%, consistent with our previous view. Commercial transportation is expected to be down 45%, which is a modest improvement from our prior view. Defense, aerospace and industrial are expected to be up with defense aerospace up 10% and industrial up 5%. The consolidated annual revenue for all of our markets is expected to be down approximately 28 -- 25% to 28% year-over-year. EBITDA is expected to be $1.03 billion for the year, plus or minus $35 million, but it is made up of very different quarters. For example, in Q1, we had, I think, a good level of revenues nevertheless offset by disruption in the latter part of March. And then, of course, the transition quarters, as I call them, are the second and third quarters and then to the fourth quarter to new operating cost levels. Naturally, the outlook remains our best estimate at this stage given the volume variability due to the complete airline and aircraft build environment, as previously mentioned. 
Q3 revenue is expected to be the low point for the year based upon the current view and is approximately $1.1 billion, plus or minus $50 million, as we expect significant commercial aerospace customer inventory corrections in the quarter and a normal seasonal slowdown in Europe. Cost reductions continued throughout the third and fourth quarters as we approach run rate. Fourth quarter revenue is expected to recover somewhat, and EBITDA margins are expected to return to similar levels of the second quarter. This trajectory is important to note, especially since the operations methodology has been cost elimination and not cost deferral. 
Q2 to Q4 adjusted free cash flow is expected to be $400 million, plus or minus $50 million. For the year, we expect free cash flow to be in the $300 million range including a modest working capital benefit of less than $50 million. And of course, these cash flows I've just mentioned are after the reduction and paydown of approximately $50 million of our accounts receivable securitization program and a customer supplier financing program, plus over $60 million of cash severance payments. Moreover, the cash flow includes a voluntary U.K. pension payment made in the second quarter of approximately $45 million to reflect the $320 million of reduction in gross pension liabilities that Ken already mentioned. Earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.72 per share. 
Now I'll provide some additional commentary for the year and the second half. We are increasing our in-year cost reduction program to $100 million. Moreover, we expect an additional $50 million of structural cost savings in 2020 from the 2019 actions. These cost reductions are permanent and will help accelerate margin expansion when markets eventually recover. We are continuing to flex variable costs in addition to this with the revenue decline. 
We are reducing CapEx further. Annual capital expenditure is now expected to be $175 million or approximately 3% in revenue. Our previous target mentioned on the first quarter call was $200 million. We do expect pricing to remain favorable for the year. Q3 is expected to be weaker than the second quarter due to significant customer inventory adjustments and the seasonality already mentioned. However, in the fourth quarter, we do expect some modest recovery of volumes, with adjusted EBITDA margin similar to the second quarter. 
And now let's move to Q&A."

On Boeing, as I say, we've -- as I think everybody knows, we've had several demand forecasts over the last few months. And currently, the build rate there is projected to be very low at 7. So it's difficult to discern that at the moment in terms of where we are relative to inventory takeout, et cetera, et cetera. And also, we recognize or we have to recognize that the amount of, I'll say, for us in our engine business, what then flows through by way of engine demand and then the inventory levels in, for example, in GE, et cetera, et cetera.

And then just note to ourselves is that, well, we have no visibility of like when we would expect recovery to occur but the -- I guess the flip side that we have of where we're taking, I think, inventory reductions as part of our, I'll say, top line sort of degradation at the moment. Then as builds do eventually begin to recover, then we will see some inventory build in advance of that to prepare the pipelines for that demand recovery. 
So I know -- we're choosing not to call out when we say demand will return. The one thing we've done is to recognize that it's a difficult environment. The mantra has been cost elimination, not cost deferral, such that as and when we do begin to see a demand pull, then given, say, the EBITDA margins that we achieved in the quarter and where we think we'll be for the year and at the end of the year, then we're well positioned to take advantage of any demand recovery as and when it occurs. 
The only thing we're consciously doing is that if we see a particularly low point, and we have called out Q3 in that, I don't plan to chase cost reduction for a quarter because I also want to make sure that we are well positioned to be able to meet recovery as and when it occurs, and trying to define what that sort of loading is. And then should the future not turn out to be as we currently believe it to be, then obviously, we'll further adjust our cost base as necessary. 
So I don't know whether that gives you a pretty good picture, Carter, of how we're thinking about it and what we know and compared to what we don't know at the moment."

It's one of the most difficult things that we have to try to get that in terms of visibility because clearly, we're not privy to exactly, for example, how many engines are there, how many spares are being held. And indeed, what the inventory levels exactly were. We did note that we did have significant areas as we went out of 2019. But as -- I think as I've said on the earlier call, I mean those areas can evaporate when the builds are no longer required. So we just believe that we are seeing -- and we're in this period of inventory reduction. We can't be certain of exactly how much will be cleared in the third quarter. There may still be some lingering into the fourth quarter and even beyond, depending on what the outlook looks like. 
At the same time, what we recognize in our own cash flows is that this year, our own working capital will not be as good as it could be, particularly regarding the inventory itself. Because we will have, even at the end of the fourth quarter, some trapped inventory, whereby given what we previously understood demand to be, we had scheduled materials. And some of those we'll have to take and some of the things that we have in our plants today, we will not be able to deliver, even though we are holding our customers to account is that there will be some significant few tens of millions of trapped inventory throughout the year, which will take, again, some time to burn off in the following year. 
So again, to summarize, inventory is the most difficult thing to get visibility around. And all we can do is look at the current schedules, and we just see that, that third quarter will be impacted further as our customers reassess their requirements."

That will continue throughout the year, but I think it will get more intense in the third quarter. The other thing, which we are noting and I'm going to say it again because I think I surprised you a little bit on the first quarter call when I think I said something to the effect that I saw commercial transportation recovering a little bit more quickly than commercial aerospace. And indeed, we are seeing that is that while second quarter was quite dramatic as most commercial truck plants were closed -- I mean completely closed during April and part of May, but we are seeing improved demand, both in North America and in Europe. And we think that, that will strengthen as we go into the fourth quarter. 
So the way we're sort of trying to map out our year is that we -- CT is still fairly low in Q3, but we believe to be getting better than what the visibility we have from our customers. And you see a further inventory reduction in commercial aerospace in Q3, making some allowance for that to continue into Q4 and then it's like a bandwidth that we've tried to give you in terms of guidance to where we believe we'll end the year. So I wish it was more certain. I think the one thing that I think should be recognized and we have done our best to give you guidance, and we just do recognize that it is imperfect, for sure."

So -- because I'm always concerned about cost deferral will be something that as and when you do see improvement, cost flood back into your business. And I don't think that's the way to go forward. So I think it's a pure cost of elimination. And I think the very best periods of time, indeed, I think many industries you saw this to some degree, in the few sector companies in -- after the 2008, 2009 is that when you've made the very serious attempt to reduce structural costs, then some of those -- most of those, maybe all of those won't go back into the business. And so then you really are just taking variable cost back on to meet future revenues. So margin rates do begin to improve at that time. I mean it's all a question really is when do -- when does volume and that inventory build that I talked about earlier, when does it occur? And that's the bit none of us know, and I'm just trying to make sure that we position Howmet as best as we can, such that as and when volume does come back, then -- if we cannot print those sort of EBITDA margins that I talked about for Q2 and for Q4 when things are tough, then hopefully, that leads you to the belief that we can do that when volumes improve. And that's what it's all about. It's like preparing Howmet for the upswing, which will come. But I think none of us know when it is, but I think our job is to make sure that we've positioned it as best as we can, as quickly as we can such that we can generate cash throughout, and that's what you're seeing."

On top of that, if you look at back to the first quarter, we took a severance charge at the beginning of COVID-19 of about $20 million, and then you're seeing another severance charge in the second quarter of about $46 million. So there's a good trajectory on the cost out, the prices continuing. And also, we've exited some unprofitable businesses last year as well so that should help us."

So given the build, the OE build and the spares packages, which you need to go with those, so think of that a 10%-plus increase in that. So let's call it at $450 million. It could be a bit more. We don't know yet. 
And then for the balance, I see a very severe contraction in the commercial aerospace. From that $400 million, probably down to the $150 million, plus or minus, from that $400 million. That's on a year, therefore, obviously, a massive reduction in the -- like in Q2, Q3, for the aftermarket.

I mean I have a view, but we've tried to think about that very clearly for ourselves in terms of what is our run rate in terms of revenues, what are our run rates in terms of margins, how does it pan out. And so we certainly have that uppermost in our mind about the trajectory into '21 and also into '22. So we're trying to think a lot about that, but I don't really want to give guidance at this point. I think the most important thing was to try to give you a steer for exit rate trajectory, which you've got, and trying to give you some view of how we are seeing some inventory issues that have to be worked through. And hopefully, those are largely done by next year, but there's no guarantee. I've tried to give you a view about maybe the sort of recovery in commercial transportation and, as I say, to move towards the latter part of the year. 
And then in terms of pricing, clearly, absolute dollars is going to be a function of revenue. We know that revenue is not going to be what we had in 2019. But -- and we've also recognized that the environment and our customers were all suffering at the moment. We're all in a world of hurt, but we also believe that the trajectory in terms of the price we've talked about is [ large ] impact, albeit it can't be exactly the same, given the current pressures of the industry. And we've tried to call that out again in Q2 and give some steer for awards for the balance of the year. 
So at the moment, as best as you can be, I think we're largely on track for doing what we said we'd do and positioning the company as best we can in terms of cost structure and trying to give you the flow -- ebbs and flows regarding inventory, albeit called out the imperfect nature of the visibility that we have and at the same time, really try to give ourselves the absolute best positioning that we can such that as and when revenues do begin to talk as they always do and they will and the [ run ] for that, I guess, we should see in the decline is that Howmet is really well positioned to be able to manufacture those parts and also get the right levels of profitability given what we've done, the way we approached our cost planning for 2020."

I'm not claiming given everything that's going on there that it's a well-informed view.

I'm not claiming given everything that's going on there that it's a well-informed view. But I am thinking that in 2022, we're going to be pretty close in terms of volume of wheels produced against 2019. Now -- I mean [ in closeness ] what do I mean by pretty close, but I'm not saying it's going to be above, but getting close to. So I'm feeling a little bit more confident there. And then commensurate with the fact that I think as we've told and informed the markets that each year, we do take a little bit of share from the steel wheels. We have introduced, as you know, that new 39-pound wheel and therefore, lever at the market-leading forefront. And that's also witnessed by our market shares across the world in wheels. 
I'm thinking that, actually, as we go into 2023, we're going to see above 2019 volumes. Now it's what -- just as I said, this is what we think. Doesn't mean to say that's where it will be, but this is how we're thinking about the business. And even more importantly, what we're doing at the moment, we are repositioning our capacity in that business such that when volume pull does occur is that we're able to manufacture at an even more efficient rate than we've previously done. But that's going to require that volume pull to be there -- to be seen in terms of our results. 
So I think this is things that we could not have done if we'd have had the demand levels of '19 just flowing through '20 and '21. We are going to take the opportunity to proactively profile some of our production to enable that future, I'll say, improved cost levels to occur. So '22 for the volume and '23 for above 2019 is how we see it. 
It's a long way out when you -- it's a long way out, Seth, when you're battling in the individual weeks and quarters at the moment."

Today, with Ken, I also have Tolga Oal, who's on the call, and Tolga is our Co-CEO. Tolga has been immersed in the business since his announcement as Co-CEO back at Howmet's Investor Day in February. 
Now let's move to Slide 4 to cover second quarter results. First, let me paint a picture of the quarter. As you'll recall, we saw the first significant disruptions related to COVID-19 in the last 3 weeks of March. The initial effects were quarantine-related disruptions within Howmet plants and certain customers that ceased production, for example, Boeing, Airbus, Safran, et cetera. The full impact was felt in Q2 with customer shutdowns, scheduled cancellations and Howmet plant disruptions. The results reflecting this impact show sales reduced year-over-year by some 31% and operating income, excluding special items, by 42%. Nevertheless, we were pleased with the absolute numbers, our 14.4% operating income margin and a 19.7% EBITDA margin. This reflects the swift cost containment actions undertaken starting at the end of the first week of April. And you may recall that we took our initial restructuring charge in the first quarter results. 
These cost reductions continue to take effect each month in the second quarter and will continue into Q3 and Q4. Later in my remarks, I'll begin to focus more on our exit rate trajectory for 2020 as we move into 2021. 
Further to the second quarter EBITDA margin at 19.7%, Howmet also generated earnings per share of $0.12. 
Now let's move to the balance sheet and cash flow. Adjusted free cash flow in Q2 was $76 million, excluding $11 million of separation costs. I also point out that the $76 million of cash generation included the effect of 3 items. Firstly, we reduced our AR securitization for the second time in 2020 and a customer supplier financing program by some $30 million. Second, we made $12 million of cash restructuring payments. And third, we made additional voluntary cash contributions to our U.K. pension plan of approximately $45 million to make a large reduction in the gross pension liability. For the absence of doubt, our free cash flow is after everything. And if we had not paid down the accounts securitization, the U.K. pension and the restructuring, the cash flow of $76 million would have been higher by some $87 million, [ over ] $163 million in the quarter. 
The cash balance for Q2 improved. After the separation of Arconic Corp. on April 1, the opening cash balance of Howmet was approximately $800 million. At the end of the second quarter, the cash balance was $1.3 billion. The increase was due to approximately $65 million of cash generation after separation costs and the net addition of $420 million as a result of refinancing bonds from 2021 and 2022 to 2025. Net debt-to-EBITDA was 2.73x. Revolver capacity of $1 billion is undrawn. 
Now let's move on to Slide 5. We made rapid response to COVID-19 and the market declines. 
First, with regard to our employees and customers. Employee safety is a top priority, and we are actively managing employee health risks. Programs meet or exceed local standards. All of our sites are now up and running. We are a reliable partner to our customers who are critical to the national defense, to commercial aviation and to the global economy. 
Regarding profit and liquidity, management has undertaken the following actions: furloughing some of the hourly workforce and reducing overtime; permanently reducing all types of labor, both hourly and salaried; the elimination of temporary workers; flexing materials and services; reducing capital expenditures; and reducing our working capital. 
Lastly, as I mentioned, we refinanced our 2021 and '22 bonds into 2025 and added $420 million of cash to the balance sheet. And the revolver is undrawn. 
Now let me turn it over to Ken to give more details on our second quarter performance. And then I'll begin to speak to the outlook for the second half of the year."
416264458,678227782,2112968,"Howmet Aerospace Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 06, 2020",2020-08-06,"Earnings Calls","Howmet Aerospace Inc.","Executives","Great. Thank you, John. Before getting started, I wanted to make a few comments on our basis of presentation. As a result of the separation on April 1, 2020, Howmet Aerospace has reported the results of the separated entity, Arconic Corporation, as discon",1200,"Great. Thank you, John. Before getting started, I wanted to make a few comments on our basis of presentation. As a result of the separation on April 1, 2020, Howmet Aerospace has reported the results of the separated entity, Arconic Corporation, as discontinued operations for 1Q 2020 and prior periods. Per GAAP, it's important to note that corporate cost for the pre-separation periods were only allocated to Arconic Corporation if the costs were specifically attributable to the entity. Therefore, for pre-separation periods, Howmet retained 100% of all shared corporate costs. For 2019, Howmet statements will show approximately $190 million of corporate costs, excluding special items, since the shared costs were not allocated to Arconic Corporation. For clarity, we've provided a schedule on Slide 20 in the appendix, which is consistent with Howmet's 2020 Investor Day and shows an estimate of historical operational corporate costs. For 2019, the comparable annual operational corporate costs were estimated to be $100 million rather than $190 million. Looking forward into 2020, operational corporate costs are expected to be approximately $75 million. 
So let's move to Slide 6. In the second quarter, commercial aerospace was 54% of total revenue; defense aerospace was 18%; commercial transportation was 12%; and industrial, combined with our other end markets, was 16%. COVID-19 and 737 MAX production declines most severely impacted the commercial aerospace and commercial transportation markets, which were down 36% and 54% year-over-year, respectively. 
We continue to expect defense aerospace to grow year-over-year due to the strong demand for the Joint Strike Fighter on both new airplane builds and engine spares. In the second quarter, defense aerospace was up 3% year-over-year. And within the industrial and other markets, IGT was up 25% year-over-year. 
Now let's move to Slide 7. On this slide, we provided historical information for the combined segments with an estimated operational view of corporate. Howmet Aerospace will present financial information for 4 segments: Engine Products, Fastening Systems, Engineered Products and Forged Wheels. 
Compared to the prior year, 2Q revenue declined approximately $570 million, with a corresponding segment operating profit decline of $160 million. The associated segment decremental margin for 2Q 2020 was approximately 28% year-over-year. Included in the results are price increases of $9 million, which are expected to continue in the second half. Additionally, cost reductions were $55 million in the quarter as we benefited from actions taken in early April as well as last year. Without the price increases, the cost reductions reflects a variable cost in line with the significant sudden revenue decline. Segment operating profit decrement would have been more in the 37% range rather than the 28% range reported. In the appendix, we provided historical information for each of the segments. 
Now let's move to Slide 8. For each of the segments, we provided historical revenue, segment operating profit and segment operating profit margin. We have also provided the revenue by market split for the current quarter as well as commentary on performance. 
First, we'll start with the largest segment, engines. For the second quarter, year-over-year revenue was down 30%. Commercial aerospace was down 44% driven by COVID-19 and 737 MAX production declines. Commercial aerospace was somewhat offset by a 7% year-over-year increase in defense aerospace and a 25% increase in IGT as that market rebounds from a weak level in 2019. Price increases continued in the segment. Moreover, the team was able to quickly flex variable spending to mitigate the impact in the quarter of the significant decline in commercial aerospace revenue. The decremental margin for 2Q was 23% year-over-year. 
Now let's move to fasteners on Slide 9. For the fasteners segment, second quarter year-over-year revenue was down 18%. Commercial aerospace was down 15% driven by COVID-19 and 737 MAX production declines. Fasteners shipped overdues in the second quarter, and we expect a steeper revenue decline in 3Q as inventory levels are being adjusted at our customers, and we expect seasonal revenue declines driven by European operations. The fasteners commercial transportation business was down 43%. Cost reductions across the segment helped mitigate the decrease in revenue, but higher absenteeism and the delay in European cost reductions resulted in a 40% year-over-year decremental margin. 
Now let's move to Slide 10 to review structures. For the structures segment, second quarter year-over-year revenue was down 31%. Commercial aerospace was down 40% driven by COVID-19 and the 787 (sic) [ 737 ] production declines. Decremental margins were 6% year-over-year. Price increases, cost reductions and exiting unprofitable businesses in 2019 allowed structures to increase operating margin by 70 basis points year-over-year despite the 31% decline in revenue. 
Lastly, let's move to Slide 11 for wheels. In the second quarter, the Wheels segment was the hardest hit with a 56% reduction in revenue year-over-year. Decremental margins were 47%. For the month of April, almost all of our OEM customers were shut down with a gradual recovery in May and June. Despite the significant and rapid revenue decline, the segment was profitable due to the rapid cost reductions as well as their ability to quickly flex variable spending. 
Now let's move to Slide 12 for special items. Special items totaled $171 million on a pretax basis, which included 3 main items: first, a $64 million charge for pension plan settlements primarily due to a voluntary action in the U.K. to reduce our gross pension liabilities by approximately $320 million; second, a $65 million charge related to the early redemption of 2020, 2021 and 2022 notes in the second quarter; and the third item was a $46 million charge related to severance programs that are tied to the 2020 cost reduction actions as we continue to navigate through a period of demand uncertainty. 
So let's now move to Slide 13. In the second quarter, we completed a good deal of work to improve our capital structure and liquidity. We completed the following actions. We redeemed all of our 2020 bonds for $1 billion. We redeemed $889 million of our 2021 bonds, leaving $361 million, which will mature in April of 2021. We redeemed $151 million of our 2022 bonds, leaving $476 million that will mature in February 2022. Lastly, we completed a new bond issue for $1.2 billion, which is due in May of 2025. Our next significant debt maturity is in October of 2024. We also amended our revolving credit facility in the second quarter. As a result of these actions, we were able to increase our cash position by approximately $420 million. We also took pressure off the balance sheet by reducing the near-term maturities and increased our available liquidity. 
Before turning it back over to John to discuss the 2020 outlook, let me cover some assumptions on Slide 14. Corporate overhead is expected to improve to $75 million for the year based on further cost reductions. Annual operational tax rate remains in the 28% to 30% range for the year, but we could have volatility in the quarters based on the current environment. Lastly, pension and OPEB cash contributions remain at $210 million for the year and include the discretionary 2Q payment of $45 million, which reduced the U.K. gross pension liability by $320 million. 
So now let me turn it back over to John."

We are providing you an outlook, and that really is to give the best possible visibility to the company. Of course, we have been monitoring air traffic around the world and the best estimates of aircraft builds. And this leads us to provide this view to you for the balance of the year given that we're well into the second half. However, we do recognize that there remains significant uncertainties regarding the external environment. For example, spikes regarding COVID-19, visibility of customer inventory corrections and aircraft build rate changes in the face of any further COVID spiking. 
Here are the salient points. Full year revenue is expected to be $5.2 billion for the year, plus or minus $100 million. Commercial aerospace is expected to be down 35%, consistent with our previous view. Commercial transportation is expected to be down 45%, which is a modest improvement from our prior view. Defense, aerospace and industrial are expected to be up with defense aerospace up 10% and industrial up 5%. The consolidated annual revenue for all of our markets is expected to be down approximately 28 -- 25% to 28% year-over-year. EBITDA is expected to be $1.03 billion for the year, plus or minus $35 million, but it is made up of very different quarters. For example, in Q1, we had, I think, a good level of revenues nevertheless offset by disruption in the latter part of March. And then, of course, the transition quarters, as I call them, are the second and third quarters and then to the fourth quarter to new operating cost levels. Naturally, the outlook remains our best estimate at this stage given the volume variability due to the complete airline and aircraft build environment, as previously mentioned. 
Q3 revenue is expected to be the low point for the year based upon the current view and is approximately $1.1 billion, plus or minus $50 million, as we expect significant commercial aerospace customer inventory corrections in the quarter and a normal seasonal slowdown in Europe. Cost reductions continued throughout the third and fourth quarters as we approach run rate. Fourth quarter revenue is expected to recover somewhat, and EBITDA margins are expected to return to similar levels of the second quarter. This trajectory is important to note, especially since the operations methodology has been cost elimination and not cost deferral. 
Q2 to Q4 adjusted free cash flow is expected to be $400 million, plus or minus $50 million. For the year, we expect free cash flow to be in the $300 million range including a modest working capital benefit of less than $50 million. And of course, these cash flows I've just mentioned are after the reduction and paydown of approximately $50 million of our accounts receivable securitization program and a customer supplier financing program, plus over $60 million of cash severance payments. Moreover, the cash flow includes a voluntary U.K. pension payment made in the second quarter of approximately $45 million to reflect the $320 million of reduction in gross pension liabilities that Ken already mentioned. Earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.72 per share. 
Now I'll provide some additional commentary for the year and the second half. We are increasing our in-year cost reduction program to $100 million. Moreover, we expect an additional $50 million of structural cost savings in 2020 from the 2019 actions. These cost reductions are permanent and will help accelerate margin expansion when markets eventually recover. We are continuing to flex variable costs in addition to this with the revenue decline. 
We are reducing CapEx further. Annual capital expenditure is now expected to be $175 million or approximately 3% in revenue. Our previous target mentioned on the first quarter call was $200 million. We do expect pricing to remain favorable for the year. Q3 is expected to be weaker than the second quarter due to significant customer inventory adjustments and the seasonality already mentioned. However, in the fourth quarter, we do expect some modest recovery of volumes, with adjusted EBITDA margin similar to the second quarter.

I mean the most visibility that we have currently is, I think, for Airbus, where they've given clear indications of build rates, which are well-publicized through certainly for narrow-body through, I think, April of next year at a rate of 40 with wid",494,"Yes. I mean the most visibility that we have currently is, I think, for Airbus, where they've given clear indications of build rates, which are well-publicized through certainly for narrow-body through, I think, April of next year at a rate of 40 with wide-body being down, I think rejections of like the A350 down to 5 per month. 
On Boeing, as I say, we've -- as I think everybody knows, we've had several demand forecasts over the last few months. And currently, the build rate there is projected to be very low at 7. So it's difficult to discern that at the moment in terms of where we are relative to inventory takeout, et cetera, et cetera. And also, we recognize or we have to recognize that the amount of, I'll say, for us in our engine business, what then flows through by way of engine demand and then the inventory levels in, for example, in GE, et cetera, et cetera. 
So essentially, the way we think about it is we've taken that which Boeing and Airbus have published, run that out through as best we can into -- through 2021. And then just note to ourselves is that, well, we have no visibility of like when we would expect recovery to occur but the -- I guess the flip side that we have of where we're taking, I think, inventory reductions as part of our, I'll say, top line sort of degradation at the moment. Then as builds do eventually begin to recover, then we will see some inventory build in advance of that to prepare the pipelines for that demand recovery. 
So I know -- we're choosing not to call out when we say demand will return. The one thing we've done is to recognize that it's a difficult environment. The mantra has been cost elimination, not cost deferral, such that as and when we do begin to see a demand pull, then given, say, the EBITDA margins that we achieved in the quarter and where we think we'll be for the year and at the end of the year, then we're well positioned to take advantage of any demand recovery as and when it occurs. 
The only thing we're consciously doing is that if we see a particularly low point, and we have called out Q3 in that, I don't plan to chase cost reduction for a quarter because I also want to make sure that we are well positioned to be able to meet recovery as and when it occurs, and trying to define what that sort of loading is. And then should the future not turn out to be as we currently believe it to be, then obviously, we'll further adjust our cost base as necessary. 
So I don't know whether that gives you a pretty good picture, Carter, of how we're thinking about it and what we know and compared to what we don't know at the moment."

It's one of the most difficult things that we have to try to get that in terms of visibility because clearly, we're not privy to exactly, for example, how many engines are there, how many spares are being held. And indeed, what the inventory levels exactly were. We did note that we did have significant areas as we went out of 2019. But as -- I think as I've said on the earlier call, I mean those areas can evaporate when the builds are no longer required. So we just believe that we are seeing -- and we're in this period of inventory reduction. We can't be certain of exactly how much will be cleared in the third quarter. There may still be some lingering into the fourth quarter and even beyond, depending on what the outlook looks like. 
At the same time, what we recognize in our own cash flows is that this year, our own working capital will not be as good as it could be, particularly regarding the inventory itself. Because we will have, even at the end of the fourth quarter, some trapped inventory, whereby given what we previously understood demand to be, we had scheduled materials. And some of those we'll have to take and some of the things that we have in our plants today, we will not be able to deliver, even though we are holding our customers to account is that there will be some significant few tens of millions of trapped inventory throughout the year, which will take, again, some time to burn off in the following year. 
So again, to summarize, inventory is the most difficult thing to get visibility around. And all we can do is look at the current schedules, and we just see that, that third quarter will be impacted further as our customers reassess their requirements."

That will continue throughout the year, but I think it will get more intense in the third quarter. The other thing, which we are noting and I'm going to say it again because I think I surprised you a little bit on the first quarter call when I think I said something to the effect that I saw commercial transportation recovering a little bit more quickly than commercial aerospace. And indeed, we are seeing that is that while second quarter was quite dramatic as most commercial truck plants were closed -- I mean completely closed during April and part of May, but we are seeing improved demand, both in North America and in Europe. And we think that, that will strengthen as we go into the fourth quarter. 
So the way we're sort of trying to map out our year is that we -- CT is still fairly low in Q3, but we believe to be getting better than what the visibility we have from our customers. And you see a further inventory reduction in commercial aerospace in Q3, making some allowance for that to continue into Q4 and then it's like a bandwidth that we've tried to give you in terms of guidance to where we believe we'll end the year. So I wish it was more certain. I think the one thing that I think should be recognized and we have done our best to give you guidance, and we just do recognize that it is imperfect, for sure."

I mean that's a sort of, I'd say, a news flow that we don't really want to put our head in, in terms of calling a margin guidance for the future. I think the way I approach it is to say we've chosen not to defer things. So -- because I'm always concerned about cost deferral will be something that as and when you do see improvement, cost flood back into your business. And I don't think that's the way to go forward. So I think it's a pure cost of elimination. And I think the very best periods of time, indeed, I think many industries you saw this to some degree, in the few sector companies in -- after the 2008, 2009 is that when you've made the very serious attempt to reduce structural costs, then some of those -- most of those, maybe all of those won't go back into the business. And so then you really are just taking variable cost back on to meet future revenues. So margin rates do begin to improve at that time. I mean it's all a question really is when do -- when does volume and that inventory build that I talked about earlier, when does it occur? And that's the bit none of us know, and I'm just trying to make sure that we position Howmet as best as we can, such that as and when volume does come back, then -- if we cannot print those sort of EBITDA margins that I talked about for Q2 and for Q4 when things are tough, then hopefully, that leads you to the belief that we can do that when volumes improve. And that's what it's all about. It's like preparing Howmet for the upswing, which will come. But I think none of us know when it is, but I think our job is to make sure that we've positioned it as best as we can, as quickly as we can such that we can generate cash throughout, and that's what you're seeing."

In the second quarter, we had $55 million. So year-to-date, that puts us at about $81 million. So good track record if we have $81 million already in the bank, and we're targeting $150 million for the full year. 
On top of that, if you look at back to the first quarter, we took a severance charge at the beginning of COVID-19 of about $20 million, and then you're seeing another severance charge in the second quarter of about $46 million. So there's a good trajectory on the cost out, the prices continuing. And also, we've exited some unprofitable businesses last year as well so that should help us."

So we're at a very low point of airfoil build for the LEAP engines and LEAP-1B in particular for the tender at Boeing. And so I think that will continue at a very low level throughout 2020. And then assuming that the recertification goes ahead, which we have no reason to believe that it won't, that will be good news. And then Boeing plans to resume deliveries and then increase build rates as we go into 2021. And that's the time that we're looking forward to because we have been essentially without a MAX build for a long period of time now.

I'm thinking that this year that the $400 million for defense aerospace and the industrial business will be a little bit higher. So given the build, the OE build and the spares packages, which you need to go with those, so think of that a 10%-plus increase in that. So let's call it at $450 million. It could be a bit more. We don't know yet. 
And then for the balance, I see a very severe contraction in the commercial aerospace. From that $400 million, probably down to the $150 million, plus or minus, from that $400 million. That's on a year, therefore, obviously, a massive reduction in the -- like in Q2, Q3, for the aftermarket. So it all balances out, probably in that region, maybe just shy of the $600 million range for total spares for Howmet in 2020, but with very different quarters, as you can imagine, given the lack of requirements for, say, repair and overhaul at the moment."

So I don't think I'm going to talk to 2021 at the moment. I mean I have a view, but we've tried to think about that very clearly for ourselves in terms of what is our run rate in terms of revenues, what are our run rates in terms of margins, how does it pan out. And so we certainly have that uppermost in our mind about the trajectory into '21 and also into '22. So we're trying to think a lot about that, but I don't really want to give guidance at this point. I think the most important thing was to try to give you a steer for exit rate trajectory, which you've got, and trying to give you some view of how we are seeing some inventory issues that have to be worked through. And hopefully, those are largely done by next year, but there's no guarantee. I've tried to give you a view about maybe the sort of recovery in commercial transportation and, as I say, to move towards the latter part of the year. 
And then in terms of pricing, clearly, absolute dollars is going to be a function of revenue. We know that revenue is not going to be what we had in 2019. But -- and we've also recognized that the environment and our customers were all suffering at the moment. We're all in a world of hurt, but we also believe that the trajectory in terms of the price we've talked about is [ large ] impact, albeit it can't be exactly the same, given the current pressures of the industry. And we've tried to call that out again in Q2 and give some steer for awards for the balance of the year. 
So at the moment, as best as you can be, I think we're largely on track for doing what we said we'd do and positioning the company as best we can in terms of cost structure and trying to give you the flow -- ebbs and flows regarding inventory, albeit called out the imperfect nature of the visibility that we have and at the same time, really try to give ourselves the absolute best positioning that we can such that as and when revenues do begin to talk as they always do and they will and the [ run ] for that, I guess, we should see in the decline is that Howmet is really well positioned to be able to manufacture those parts and also get the right levels of profitability given what we've done, the way we approached our cost planning for 2020."

So I think the thing that you should think about is the words that we've chosen that we would eliminate cost, not defer it because I think those companies which defer -- I mean you can see across the whole industrial space, there is a phenomenon to deferral. And I don't want cost to flood back in when programs are reinstated. So that's the way we've approached this."

I'm not claiming given everything that's going on there that it's a well-informed view.

I'm not claiming given everything that's going on there that it's a well-informed view.

Now -- I mean [ in closeness ] what do I mean by pretty close, but I'm not saying it's going to be above, but getting close to. So I'm feeling a little bit more confident there. And then commensurate with the fact that I think as we've told and informed the markets that each year, we do take a little bit of share from the steel wheels. We have introduced, as you know, that new 39-pound wheel and therefore, lever at the market-leading forefront. And that's also witnessed by our market shares across the world in wheels. 
I'm thinking that, actually, as we go into 2023, we're going to see above 2019 volumes. Now it's what -- just as I said, this is what we think. Doesn't mean to say that's where it will be, but this is how we're thinking about the business. And even more importantly, what we're doing at the moment, we are repositioning our capacity in that business such that when volume pull does occur is that we're able to manufacture at an even more efficient rate than we've previously done. But that's going to require that volume pull to be there -- to be seen in terms of our results. 
So I think this is things that we could not have done if we'd have had the demand levels of '19 just flowing through '20 and '21. We are going to take the opportunity to proactively profile some of our production to enable that future, I'll say, improved cost levels to occur. So '22 for the volume and '23 for above 2019 is how we see it. 
It's a long way out when you -- it's a long way out, Seth, when you're battling in the individual weeks and quarters at the moment."

Today, with Ken, I also have Tolga Oal, who's on the call, and Tolga is our Co-CEO. Tolga has been immersed in the business since his announcement as Co-CEO back at Howmet's Investor Day in February. 
Now let's move to Slide 4 to cover second quarter results. First, let me paint a picture of the quarter. As you'll recall, we saw the first significant disruptions related to COVID-19 in the last 3 weeks of March. The initial effects were quarantine-related disruptions within Howmet plants and certain customers that ceased production, for example, Boeing, Airbus, Safran, et cetera. The full impact was felt in Q2 with customer shutdowns, scheduled cancellations and Howmet plant disruptions. The results reflecting this impact show sales reduced year-over-year by some 31% and operating income, excluding special items, by 42%. Nevertheless, we were pleased with the absolute numbers, our 14.4% operating income margin and a 19.7% EBITDA margin. This reflects the swift cost containment actions undertaken starting at the end of the first week of April. And you may recall that we took our initial restructuring charge in the first quarter results. 
These cost reductions continue to take effect each month in the second quarter and will continue into Q3 and Q4. Later in my remarks, I'll begin to focus more on our exit rate trajectory for 2020 as we move into 2021. 
Further to the second quarter EBITDA margin at 19.7%, Howmet also generated earnings per share of $0.12. 
Now let's move to the balance sheet and cash flow. Adjusted free cash flow in Q2 was $76 million, excluding $11 million of separation costs. I also point out that the $76 million of cash generation included the effect of 3 items. Firstly, we reduced our AR securitization for the second time in 2020 and a customer supplier financing program by some $30 million. Second, we made $12 million of cash restructuring payments. And third, we made additional voluntary cash contributions to our U.K. pension plan of approximately $45 million to make a large reduction in the gross pension liability. For the absence of doubt, our free cash flow is after everything. And if we had not paid down the accounts securitization, the U.K. pension and the restructuring, the cash flow of $76 million would have been higher by some $87 million, [ over ] $163 million in the quarter. 
The cash balance for Q2 improved. After the separation of Arconic Corp. on April 1, the opening cash balance of Howmet was approximately $800 million. At the end of the second quarter, the cash balance was $1.3 billion. The increase was due to approximately $65 million of cash generation after separation costs and the net addition of $420 million as a result of refinancing bonds from 2021 and 2022 to 2025. Net debt-to-EBITDA was 2.73x. Revolver capacity of $1 billion is undrawn. 
Now let's move on to Slide 5. We made rapid response to COVID-19 and the market declines. 
First, with regard to our employees and customers. Employee safety is a top priority, and we are actively managing employee health risks. Programs meet or exceed local standards. All of our sites are now up and running. We are a reliable partner to our customers who are critical to the national defense, to commercial aviation and to the global economy. 
Regarding profit and liquidity, management has undertaken the following actions: furloughing some of the hourly workforce and reducing overtime; permanently reducing all types of labor, both hourly and salaried; the elimination of temporary workers; flexing materials and services; reducing capital expenditures; and reducing our working capital. 
Lastly, as I mentioned, we refinanced our 2021 and '22 bonds into 2025 and added $420 million of cash to the balance sheet. And the revolver is undrawn. 
Now let me turn it over to Ken to give more details on our second quarter performance. And then I'll begin to speak to the outlook for the second half of the year."
416264458,678227782,2112970,"Howmet Aerospace Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 06, 2020",2020-08-06,"Earnings Calls","Howmet Aerospace Inc.","Executives","Great. Thank you, John. Before getting started, I wanted to make a few comments on our basis of presentation. As a result of the separation on April 1, 2020, Howmet Aerospace has reported the results of the separated entity, Arconic Corporation, as discon",1200,"Great. Thank you, John. Before getting started, I wanted to make a few comments on our basis of presentation. As a result of the separation on April 1, 2020, Howmet Aerospace has reported the results of the separated entity, Arconic Corporation, as discontinued operations for 1Q 2020 and prior periods. Per GAAP, it's important to note that corporate cost for the pre-separation periods were only allocated to Arconic Corporation if the costs were specifically attributable to the entity. Therefore, for pre-separation periods, Howmet retained 100% of all shared corporate costs. For 2019, Howmet statements will show approximately $190 million of corporate costs, excluding special items, since the shared costs were not allocated to Arconic Corporation. For clarity, we've provided a schedule on Slide 20 in the appendix, which is consistent with Howmet's 2020 Investor Day and shows an estimate of historical operational corporate costs. For 2019, the comparable annual operational corporate costs were estimated to be $100 million rather than $190 million. Looking forward into 2020, operational corporate costs are expected to be approximately $75 million. 
So let's move to Slide 6. In the second quarter, commercial aerospace was 54% of total revenue; defense aerospace was 18%; commercial transportation was 12%; and industrial, combined with our other end markets, was 16%. COVID-19 and 737 MAX production declines most severely impacted the commercial aerospace and commercial transportation markets, which were down 36% and 54% year-over-year, respectively. 
We continue to expect defense aerospace to grow year-over-year due to the strong demand for the Joint Strike Fighter on both new airplane builds and engine spares. In the second quarter, defense aerospace was up 3% year-over-year. And within the industrial and other markets, IGT was up 25% year-over-year. 
Now let's move to Slide 7. On this slide, we provided historical information for the combined segments with an estimated operational view of corporate. Howmet Aerospace will present financial information for 4 segments: Engine Products, Fastening Systems, Engineered Products and Forged Wheels. 
Compared to the prior year, 2Q revenue declined approximately $570 million, with a corresponding segment operating profit decline of $160 million. The associated segment decremental margin for 2Q 2020 was approximately 28% year-over-year. Included in the results are price increases of $9 million, which are expected to continue in the second half. Additionally, cost reductions were $55 million in the quarter as we benefited from actions taken in early April as well as last year. Without the price increases, the cost reductions reflects a variable cost in line with the significant sudden revenue decline. Segment operating profit decrement would have been more in the 37% range rather than the 28% range reported. In the appendix, we provided historical information for each of the segments. 
Now let's move to Slide 8. For each of the segments, we provided historical revenue, segment operating profit and segment operating profit margin. We have also provided the revenue by market split for the current quarter as well as commentary on performance. 
First, we'll start with the largest segment, engines. For the second quarter, year-over-year revenue was down 30%. Commercial aerospace was down 44% driven by COVID-19 and 737 MAX production declines. Commercial aerospace was somewhat offset by a 7% year-over-year increase in defense aerospace and a 25% increase in IGT as that market rebounds from a weak level in 2019. Price increases continued in the segment. Moreover, the team was able to quickly flex variable spending to mitigate the impact in the quarter of the significant decline in commercial aerospace revenue. The decremental margin for 2Q was 23% year-over-year. 
Now let's move to fasteners on Slide 9. For the fasteners segment, second quarter year-over-year revenue was down 18%. Commercial aerospace was down 15% driven by COVID-19 and 737 MAX production declines. Fasteners shipped overdues in the second quarter, and we expect a steeper revenue decline in 3Q as inventory levels are being adjusted at our customers, and we expect seasonal revenue declines driven by European operations. The fasteners commercial transportation business was down 43%. Cost reductions across the segment helped mitigate the decrease in revenue, but higher absenteeism and the delay in European cost reductions resulted in a 40% year-over-year decremental margin. 
Now let's move to Slide 10 to review structures. For the structures segment, second quarter year-over-year revenue was down 31%. Commercial aerospace was down 40% driven by COVID-19 and the 787 (sic) [ 737 ] production declines. Decremental margins were 6% year-over-year. Price increases, cost reductions and exiting unprofitable businesses in 2019 allowed structures to increase operating margin by 70 basis points year-over-year despite the 31% decline in revenue. 
Lastly, let's move to Slide 11 for wheels. In the second quarter, the Wheels segment was the hardest hit with a 56% reduction in revenue year-over-year. Decremental margins were 47%. For the month of April, almost all of our OEM customers were shut down with a gradual recovery in May and June. Despite the significant and rapid revenue decline, the segment was profitable due to the rapid cost reductions as well as their ability to quickly flex variable spending. 
Now let's move to Slide 12 for special items. Special items totaled $171 million on a pretax basis, which included 3 main items: first, a $64 million charge for pension plan settlements primarily due to a voluntary action in the U.K. to reduce our gross pension liabilities by approximately $320 million; second, a $65 million charge related to the early redemption of 2020, 2021 and 2022 notes in the second quarter; and the third item was a $46 million charge related to severance programs that are tied to the 2020 cost reduction actions as we continue to navigate through a period of demand uncertainty. 
So let's now move to Slide 13. In the second quarter, we completed a good deal of work to improve our capital structure and liquidity. We completed the following actions. We redeemed all of our 2020 bonds for $1 billion. We redeemed $889 million of our 2021 bonds, leaving $361 million, which will mature in April of 2021. We redeemed $151 million of our 2022 bonds, leaving $476 million that will mature in February 2022. Lastly, we completed a new bond issue for $1.2 billion, which is due in May of 2025. Our next significant debt maturity is in October of 2024. We also amended our revolving credit facility in the second quarter. As a result of these actions, we were able to increase our cash position by approximately $420 million. We also took pressure off the balance sheet by reducing the near-term maturities and increased our available liquidity. 
Before turning it back over to John to discuss the 2020 outlook, let me cover some assumptions on Slide 14. Corporate overhead is expected to improve to $75 million for the year based on further cost reductions. Annual operational tax rate remains in the 28% to 30% range for the year, but we could have volatility in the quarters based on the current environment. Lastly, pension and OPEB cash contributions remain at $210 million for the year and include the discretionary 2Q payment of $45 million, which reduced the U.K. gross pension liability by $320 million. 
So now let me turn it back over to John."

We are providing you an outlook, and that really is to give the best possible visibility to the company. Of course, we have been monitoring air traffic around the world and the best estimates of aircraft builds. And this leads us to provide this view to you for the balance of the year given that we're well into the second half. However, we do recognize that there remains significant uncertainties regarding the external environment. For example, spikes regarding COVID-19, visibility of customer inventory corrections and aircraft build rate changes in the face of any further COVID spiking. 
Here are the salient points. Full year revenue is expected to be $5.2 billion for the year, plus or minus $100 million. Commercial aerospace is expected to be down 35%, consistent with our previous view. Commercial transportation is expected to be down 45%, which is a modest improvement from our prior view. Defense, aerospace and industrial are expected to be up with defense aerospace up 10% and industrial up 5%. The consolidated annual revenue for all of our markets is expected to be down approximately 28 -- 25% to 28% year-over-year. EBITDA is expected to be $1.03 billion for the year, plus or minus $35 million, but it is made up of very different quarters. For example, in Q1, we had, I think, a good level of revenues nevertheless offset by disruption in the latter part of March. And then, of course, the transition quarters, as I call them, are the second and third quarters and then to the fourth quarter to new operating cost levels. Naturally, the outlook remains our best estimate at this stage given the volume variability due to the complete airline and aircraft build environment, as previously mentioned. 
Q3 revenue is expected to be the low point for the year based upon the current view and is approximately $1.1 billion, plus or minus $50 million, as we expect significant commercial aerospace customer inventory corrections in the quarter and a normal seasonal slowdown in Europe. Cost reductions continued throughout the third and fourth quarters as we approach run rate. Fourth quarter revenue is expected to recover somewhat, and EBITDA margins are expected to return to similar levels of the second quarter. This trajectory is important to note, especially since the operations methodology has been cost elimination and not cost deferral. 
Q2 to Q4 adjusted free cash flow is expected to be $400 million, plus or minus $50 million. For the year, we expect free cash flow to be in the $300 million range including a modest working capital benefit of less than $50 million. And of course, these cash flows I've just mentioned are after the reduction and paydown of approximately $50 million of our accounts receivable securitization program and a customer supplier financing program, plus over $60 million of cash severance payments. Moreover, the cash flow includes a voluntary U.K. pension payment made in the second quarter of approximately $45 million to reflect the $320 million of reduction in gross pension liabilities that Ken already mentioned. Earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.72 per share. 
Now I'll provide some additional commentary for the year and the second half. We are increasing our in-year cost reduction program to $100 million. Moreover, we expect an additional $50 million of structural cost savings in 2020 from the 2019 actions. These cost reductions are permanent and will help accelerate margin expansion when markets eventually recover. We are continuing to flex variable costs in addition to this with the revenue decline. 
We are reducing CapEx further. Annual capital expenditure is now expected to be $175 million or approximately 3% in revenue. Our previous target mentioned on the first quarter call was $200 million. We do expect pricing to remain favorable for the year. Q3 is expected to be weaker than the second quarter due to significant customer inventory adjustments and the seasonality already mentioned. However, in the fourth quarter, we do expect some modest recovery of volumes, with adjusted EBITDA margin similar to the second quarter. 
And now let's move to Q&A."

I mean the most visibility that we have currently is, I think, for Airbus, where they've given clear indications of build rates, which are well-publicized through certainly for narrow-body through, I think, April of next year at a rate of 40 with wid",494,"Yes. I mean the most visibility that we have currently is, I think, for Airbus, where they've given clear indications of build rates, which are well-publicized through certainly for narrow-body through, I think, April of next year at a rate of 40 with wide-body being down, I think rejections of like the A350 down to 5 per month. 
On Boeing, as I say, we've -- as I think everybody knows, we've had several demand forecasts over the last few months. And currently, the build rate there is projected to be very low at 7. So it's difficult to discern that at the moment in terms of where we are relative to inventory takeout, et cetera, et cetera. And also, we recognize or we have to recognize that the amount of, I'll say, for us in our engine business, what then flows through by way of engine demand and then the inventory levels in, for example, in GE, et cetera, et cetera. 
So essentially, the way we think about it is we've taken that which Boeing and Airbus have published, run that out through as best we can into -- through 2021. And then just note to ourselves is that, well, we have no visibility of like when we would expect recovery to occur but the -- I guess the flip side that we have of where we're taking, I think, inventory reductions as part of our, I'll say, top line sort of degradation at the moment. Then as builds do eventually begin to recover, then we will see some inventory build in advance of that to prepare the pipelines for that demand recovery. 
So I know -- we're choosing not to call out when we say demand will return. The one thing we've done is to recognize that it's a difficult environment. The mantra has been cost elimination, not cost deferral, such that as and when we do begin to see a demand pull, then given, say, the EBITDA margins that we achieved in the quarter and where we think we'll be for the year and at the end of the year, then we're well positioned to take advantage of any demand recovery as and when it occurs. 
The only thing we're consciously doing is that if we see a particularly low point, and we have called out Q3 in that, I don't plan to chase cost reduction for a quarter because I also want to make sure that we are well positioned to be able to meet recovery as and when it occurs, and trying to define what that sort of loading is. And then should the future not turn out to be as we currently believe it to be, then obviously, we'll further adjust our cost base as necessary. 
So I don't know whether that gives you a pretty good picture, Carter, of how we're thinking about it and what we know and compared to what we don't know at the moment."

It's one of the most difficult things that we have to try to get that in terms of visibility because clearly, we're not privy to exactly, for example, how many engines are there, how many spares are being held. And indeed, what the inventory levels exactly were. We did note that we did have significant areas as we went out of 2019. But as -- I think as I've said on the earlier call, I mean those areas can evaporate when the builds are no longer required. So we just believe that we are seeing -- and we're in this period of inventory reduction. We can't be certain of exactly how much will be cleared in the third quarter. There may still be some lingering into the fourth quarter and even beyond, depending on what the outlook looks like. 
At the same time, what we recognize in our own cash flows is that this year, our own working capital will not be as good as it could be, particularly regarding the inventory itself. Because we will have, even at the end of the fourth quarter, some trapped inventory, whereby given what we previously understood demand to be, we had scheduled materials. And some of those we'll have to take and some of the things that we have in our plants today, we will not be able to deliver, even though we are holding our customers to account is that there will be some significant few tens of millions of trapped inventory throughout the year, which will take, again, some time to burn off in the following year. 
So again, to summarize, inventory is the most difficult thing to get visibility around. And all we can do is look at the current schedules, and we just see that, that third quarter will be impacted further as our customers reassess their requirements."

That will continue throughout the year, but I think it will get more intense in the third quarter. The other thing, which we are noting and I'm going to say it again because I think I surprised you a little bit on the first quarter call when I think I said something to the effect that I saw commercial transportation recovering a little bit more quickly than commercial aerospace. And indeed, we are seeing that is that while second quarter was quite dramatic as most commercial truck plants were closed -- I mean completely closed during April and part of May, but we are seeing improved demand, both in North America and in Europe. And we think that, that will strengthen as we go into the fourth quarter. 
So the way we're sort of trying to map out our year is that we -- CT is still fairly low in Q3, but we believe to be getting better than what the visibility we have from our customers. And you see a further inventory reduction in commercial aerospace in Q3, making some allowance for that to continue into Q4 and then it's like a bandwidth that we've tried to give you in terms of guidance to where we believe we'll end the year. So I wish it was more certain. I think the one thing that I think should be recognized and we have done our best to give you guidance, and we just do recognize that it is imperfect, for sure."

So -- because I'm always concerned about cost deferral will be something that as and when you do see improvement, cost flood back into your business. And I don't think that's the way to go forward. So I think it's a pure cost of elimination. And I think the very best periods of time, indeed, I think many industries you saw this to some degree, in the few sector companies in -- after the 2008, 2009 is that when you've made the very serious attempt to reduce structural costs, then some of those -- most of those, maybe all of those won't go back into the business. And so then you really are just taking variable cost back on to meet future revenues. So margin rates do begin to improve at that time. I mean it's all a question really is when do -- when does volume and that inventory build that I talked about earlier, when does it occur? And that's the bit none of us know, and I'm just trying to make sure that we position Howmet as best as we can, such that as and when volume does come back, then -- if we cannot print those sort of EBITDA margins that I talked about for Q2 and for Q4 when things are tough, then hopefully, that leads you to the belief that we can do that when volumes improve. And that's what it's all about. It's like preparing Howmet for the upswing, which will come. But I think none of us know when it is, but I think our job is to make sure that we've positioned it as best as we can, as quickly as we can such that we can generate cash throughout, and that's what you're seeing."

So good track record if we have $81 million already in the bank, and we're targeting $150 million for the full year. 
On top of that, if you look at back to the first quarter, we took a severance charge at the beginning of COVID-19 of about $20 million, and then you're seeing another severance charge in the second quarter of about $46 million. So there's a good trajectory on the cost out, the prices continuing. And also, we've exited some unprofitable businesses last year as well so that should help us."

So we're at a very low point of airfoil build for the LEAP engines and LEAP-1B in particular for the tender at Boeing. And so I think that will continue at a very low level throughout 2020. And then assuming that the recertification goes ahead, which we have no reason to believe that it won't, that will be good news. And then Boeing plans to resume deliveries and then increase build rates as we go into 2021. And that's the time that we're looking forward to because we have been essentially without a MAX build for a long period of time now.

So given the build, the OE build and the spares packages, which you need to go with those, so think of that a 10%-plus increase in that. So let's call it at $450 million. It could be a bit more. We don't know yet. 
And then for the balance, I see a very severe contraction in the commercial aerospace. From that $400 million, probably down to the $150 million, plus or minus, from that $400 million. That's on a year, therefore, obviously, a massive reduction in the -- like in Q2, Q3, for the aftermarket.

So I don't think I'm going to talk to 2021 at the moment. I mean I have a view, but we've tried to think about that very clearly for ourselves in terms of what is our run rate in terms of revenues, what are our run rates in terms of margins, how does it pan out. And so we certainly have that uppermost in our mind about the trajectory into '21 and also into '22. So we're trying to think a lot about that, but I don't really want to give guidance at this point. I think the most important thing was to try to give you a steer for exit rate trajectory, which you've got, and trying to give you some view of how we are seeing some inventory issues that have to be worked through. And hopefully, those are largely done by next year, but there's no guarantee. I've tried to give you a view about maybe the sort of recovery in commercial transportation and, as I say, to move towards the latter part of the year. 
And then in terms of pricing, clearly, absolute dollars is going to be a function of revenue. We know that revenue is not going to be what we had in 2019. But -- and we've also recognized that the environment and our customers were all suffering at the moment. We're all in a world of hurt, but we also believe that the trajectory in terms of the price we've talked about is [ large ] impact, albeit it can't be exactly the same, given the current pressures of the industry. And we've tried to call that out again in Q2 and give some steer for awards for the balance of the year. 
So at the moment, as best as you can be, I think we're largely on track for doing what we said we'd do and positioning the company as best we can in terms of cost structure and trying to give you the flow -- ebbs and flows regarding inventory, albeit called out the imperfect nature of the visibility that we have and at the same time, really try to give ourselves the absolute best positioning that we can such that as and when revenues do begin to talk as they always do and they will and the [ run ] for that, I guess, we should see in the decline is that Howmet is really well positioned to be able to manufacture those parts and also get the right levels of profitability given what we've done, the way we approached our cost planning for 2020."

And I don't want cost to flood back in when programs are reinstated. So that's the way we've approached this."

Now -- I mean [ in closeness ] what do I mean by pretty close, but I'm not saying it's going to be above, but getting close to. So I'm feeling a little bit more confident there. And then commensurate with the fact that I think as we've told and informed the markets that each year, we do take a little bit of share from the steel wheels. We have introduced, as you know, that new 39-pound wheel and therefore, lever at the market-leading forefront. And that's also witnessed by our market shares across the world in wheels. 
I'm thinking that, actually, as we go into 2023, we're going to see above 2019 volumes. Now it's what -- just as I said, this is what we think. Doesn't mean to say that's where it will be, but this is how we're thinking about the business. And even more importantly, what we're doing at the moment, we are repositioning our capacity in that business such that when volume pull does occur is that we're able to manufacture at an even more efficient rate than we've previously done. But that's going to require that volume pull to be there -- to be seen in terms of our results. 
So I think this is things that we could not have done if we'd have had the demand levels of '19 just flowing through '20 and '21. We are going to take the opportunity to proactively profile some of our production to enable that future, I'll say, improved cost levels to occur. So '22 for the volume and '23 for above 2019 is how we see it.

I plan to give an overview of Howmet's third quarter performance, ask Tolga to speak to segment information, and then Ken will provide further financial detail. Lastly, I will return to talk the outlook for the fourth quarter and 2020 financial year. 
Please move to Slide #4. The third quarter performance was good and in line with expectations, including strong cash generation. Revenue in the quarter was $1.1 billion, down 37% year-over-year and was impacted by commercial aerospace being down 56%, driven by customer inventory corrections. We continue to expect that this is the low point for Howmet revenues while anticipating that there could be some lingering inventory corrections that could carry over into the fourth quarter and possibly the first half 2021. 
Commercial transportation was down year-over-year but we had healthy sequential growth of 42%, which favorably impacts the Forged Wheels and commercial transportation fastening segment. Moreover, we had growth in defense aerospace and in the industrial gas turbine business year-over-year. The mix of our portfolio has changed with approximately 40% of Q3 revenue being tied to commercial aerospace. 
Operating income, excluding special items, was $100 million and this includes the buyout of an unfavorable long-term contract, which cost $8 million. This hopefully should be the last of the cleanup items over the last year. Segment decremental margins, including the contract termination, were 37% year-over-year. I had indicated on the Q2 call that the third quarter was likely to be more decremented than the second quarter and reflects that we chose not to take out costs for 1 quarter and risk not having the people assets in place what we expect to be an uptick in future demand. 
For example, early in the third quarter, we completed all of the people reductions in our wheel segment and have since pulled people back from furlough and have begun recruitment in certain countries as we bring production assets back online, both for our forgings and machining lines. Structural cost reductions will continue within each of the aerospace segments to the end of 2020 and in the first quarter in Europe. 
Third quarter reflects further structural cost takeout of $56 million, making year-to-date cost takeout of $137 million, which is ahead of target. This structural cost takeout is in addition to the flexing of variable costs, which we expect by the end of first quarter 2021 should be at a perfect flex. Further to this, price increases of $14 million were achieved in the third quarter compared to $9 million in the second quarter. Year-to-date price increases are $28 million. 
I am pleased that all of the 2020 long-term contract negotiations are now completed, and price negotiations are well underway for the 2021 long-term agreements. 
Now let's move to the balance sheet and cash flow. Adjusted free cash flow in the third quarter was very good at $188 million, before further reductions in the accounts receivable securitization program and cash flow was $143 million after the reduction in the AR program. The $45 million of the accounts receivable -- sorry, the accounts resecuritization reduction was effectively repayment of debt. Cash severance payments in the quarter were $14 million. The third quarter cash balance increased to $1.4 billion after the $51 million of common stock share repurchases, which were at an average price of $17.36. Our peak operational cash requirements are approximately $300 million, which results in excess cash in hand of well over $1 billion. Net debt-to-EBITDA is approximately 3.2x and our revolver of $1 billion continues to be undrawn. 
All plants are running -- so, now let's move to Slide 5. All plants are running with employee and partner safety being a top priority. We're actively monitoring employee health risk and all programs meet or exceed local standards. To best serve our customers, we're effectively managing daily adjustments for customer inventory corrections and shutdowns. 
Regarding cost out, most of the North American permanent personnel reductions have been completed and are ahead of target. Therefore, we will be raising our 2020 permanent cost outlook. We're also continuing to flex variable spend and labor effectively with revenue. Our strict and disciplined capital expenditure process has been effective and we will once again be reducing our annual capital expenditure outlook. 
Lastly, we're focused on working capital but expect it to be use of cash in 2020 as we have reduced our AR securitization program by approximately $95 million year-to-date. Moreover, we have stranded inventory which we expect to be a source of cash in 2021. 
Now let me turn it over to Tolga."

Aerospace segments continue with revenue adjustments that follow slightly different trends. Let me start with engine products. Although strong defense aerospace and industrial gas turbine growth continued in third quarter, commercial aerospace had expected customer inventory corrections and seasonal shutdowns. We continue to expect that third quarter will be the lowest revenue quarter of 2020, and we are ahead of our permanent cost reduction plans. Additionally, we are flexing variable labor and indirect costs with revenue. 
Regarding our long-term agreements, 2020 negotiations are now complete, and we are actively working on 2021 contracts. Our philosophy on price has not changed. The Engine products segment's biggest challenge continues to be managing the strength inventory, which had a modest reduction quarter-over-quarter. 
Moving to Fastening Systems. The Fastening Systems segment follows a lagging, reducing revenue trends, mainly due to the timing of commercial aerospace distribution business. The decline in commercial aerospace is partially offset by growth in fasteners industrial business. Regarding permanent cost reduction, fasteners [ says ] the largest number of European locations within our business, which impacts the timing of cost reduction actions, but follows directionally the revenue reduction impact. We are bridging this timing with heavy furloughs and effective variable cost flexing. Maintaining our critical talent and skill sets is our priority during this period. 
The Engineered Structures segment has long lead time orders, requiring close discussions with our customers to level out their demands for an efficient operating model for the next 6 to 9 months. Permanent cost reduction actions are ahead of plan. Long-term agreement pricing negotiations are complete for 2020, including weeding out unprofitable products. 
In the Forged Wheels segment, third quarter 2020 revenue started recovering from second quarter 2020. As John mentioned, third quarter sequential revenue was up 42%, as tough U.S. shipping ports are near or above record levels of volume, which drives trucking demand. We expect continued growth in the fourth quarter and have called employees back from furloughs and restarted operations. We have complex permanent costs and have been effective in flexing production to meet customer demand. Lastly, we renewed 1 of our largest customers' long-term agreements, while increasing share with our innovative, lightweight, 39 pounds wheel. 
I will now hand it over to Ken to give more details on the financials."

Now let's move to Slide 7. So before moving into the revenue and segment profitability, I wanted to note that the third quarter revenue and profit was in line with expectations and better than the implied outlook that we provided on the second quarter earnings call. The improved performance will be reflected in the updated outlook for the remainder of the year. 
Now to the third quarter. Total revenue was down 37% year-over-year, driven by commercial aerospace, which now represents approximately 40% of total revenue in the quarter. Moving to the right-hand side of the slide, commercial aerospace was down 56% year-over-year. Consistent with our previous outlook, we expect the third quarter to be the lowest revenue quarter of the year as covers adjust inventory levels. Regarding the remaining 60% of the portfolio, I would point out that our second largest market, defense aerospace, continues to show year-over-year growth and was up 15% in the quarter driven by strong demand for the Joint Strike Fighter on both new engine builds and engine spares. Our next largest market, commercial transportation, which impacts both the Forged Wheels and the Fastening Systems segment, was down 31% year-over-year. However, as Tolga has mentioned, we are seeing favorable trends for increased demand, and this market improved 42% sequentially. 
Lastly, the industrial and other markets, which is comprised of industrial gas turbines, oil and gas and general industrial was down 4%. I would point out that IGT, which makes up approximately 40% of this market, continues to be strong and was up 23%. 
Now let's move to Slide 8. On this slide, we are providing historical information for the combined segments with an estimated operational view of corporate. Compared to the prior year, third quarter revenue declined approximately $660 million with a corresponding segment operating profit decline of $246 million. Despite the 37% year-over-year revenue decline, we remained profitable and generated strong adjusted free cash flow in the quarter. Included in the third quarter results are continued price increases of $14 million and continued permanent cost reductions of $56 million for a combined benefit of $70 million in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, price increases were $28 million and cost reductions were $137 million for our combined benefit of $165 million. 
One last comment on cost reductions of the $137 million realized year-to-date, this includes carryover benefits from our 2019 cost reduction program. This program generated $54 million of benefit year-to-date for 2020 and finished ahead of target. The program is now substantially complete. In the appendix, we have provided additional information, including historical financials for each of the segments. 
Now let's move to Slide 9 to go into more detail on the segments. Engine Products year-over-year revenue was down 43% in the quarter. In this segment, commercial aerospace was down 65% driven by COVID-19, 737 MAX production declines and customer inventory corrections. Commercial aerospace was somewhat offset by an 18% year-over-year increase in defense aerospace and a 23% increase in IGT. Third quarter results were impacted by an $8 million charge to exit an unprofitable long-term contract. Cost reductions and price increases continued in the segment, and the team continued to flex variable spending to mitigate the impact in the quarter of the significant decline in commercial aerospace revenue. 
Now let's move to the Fastening Systems segment on Slide 10. Also, as expected, we experienced the steeper revenue decline in fasteners as the third quarter year-over-year revenue was down 31%, driven by commercial aerospace and commercial transportation, both being down over 35%. Continued cost reductions, combined with third quarter price increases, helped to mitigate the decrease in revenue. However, a weaker product mix with less commercial aerospace and the expected delay in European cost reductions unfavorably impacted results. In the near term, we're furloughing employees to offset the delay in European cost reductions. 
Now let's move to Slide 11 to review Engineered Structures. For the Engineered Structures segment, third quarter revenue was down 35%. Commercial aerospace was down 54%, driven by COVID-19, production declines on both the 787 and 737 MAX as well as customer inventory corrections. Commercial aerospace was somewhat offset by a 26% year-over-year increase in defense aerospace. Cost reductions and price increases helped mitigate the decrease in revenue, but structures experienced a weaker product mix with less commercial aerospace. 
Lastly, let's move to Slide 12 for Forged Wheels. In the third quarter, revenue for the Forged Wheels segment was down 29% year-over-year, but increased 52% sequentially as expected. Employees are returning from furloughs and we continue to quickly flex staffing at variable cost to meet changing market demand. Despite revenue being down 29%, the impact of cost reductions resulted in healthy EBITDA margin for the quarter of 26%. 
Now let's move to Slide 13 for special items. Special items for the quarter was a net benefit of approximately $23 million after-tax and included 2 items. First, a $36 million after-tax benefit related to a U.S. tax law change; second, a $12 million after-tax charge related to severance programs. The severance programs are tied to the permanent cost reduction actions. 
Now let's move to Slide 14. We continue to focus on improving our capital structure and liquidity. All of that is unsecured, and our next significant maturity is in 2024. Our cash position remains strong and increased to $1.4 billion in the quarter and is expected to increase again in the fourth quarter. As we look into next year, we will use cash on hand to pay down the 2021 outstanding notes in the first quarter of 2021. 
A couple of additional items of note. First, our $1 billion 5-year revolving credit facility remains undrawn. Second, we have reduced our AR securitization program. Prior to the separation earlier this year, we historically sold $350 million worth of AR each quarter. Beginning in the first quarter of this year, the amount of AR sold through the securitization program was decreased each quarter, approximately $20 million decrease in the first quarter, a $30 million decrease in the second quarter and a $45 million increase in the third quarter. The total decrease has been approximately $95 million year-to-date from $350 million of AR sold at the end of 2019 to approximately $255 million of AR sold at the end of the third quarter. The $95 million reduction in AR sold is effectively a repayment of debt and unfavorably impact year-to-date adjusted free cash flow. 
Before turning it back to John to cover the 2020 outlook, let me review some assumptions on Slide 15. Depreciation and amortization is expected to improve to approximately $270 million for the year. The annual operational tax rate is also expected to improve and be in the range of 27% to 29% for the full year. Regarding CapEx, we are once again reducing our annual CapEx spend outlook to approximately $160 million for the year, which is a historical low at 3% of revenue. Lastly, as a result of the common stock share repurchases in the third quarter, we are lowering the expected fourth quarter diluted share count to approximately 437 million shares and the full year average diluted share count to approximately 439 million shares. 
Now let me turn it back over to John."

Now let me discuss the outlook for the remainder of 2020. We are improving the outlook and narrowing the ranges. The improvement strength in the sales, increases EBITDA, increases EBITDA margins, and lifts the earnings per share compared to the prior outlook. Revenues in the fourth quarter are expected to be $1.23 billion, plus or minus $30 million, and price increases are expected to continue. EBITDA in the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately $255 million, plus or minus $15 million, and we are once again increasing our annual permanent cost out target to $185 million from $150 million. These are savings realized in the year. 
Our fourth quarter EBITDA margin is now increased to 20% to 21% from the prior midpoint of 20%. I think this may be the most significant item of our call this morning beyond the good cash generation. Annual earnings per share improves to a range of $0.68 to $0.76. Cash generation in the quarters from separation, Q2 to Q4, is strong and unchanged at $450 million, plus or minus $50 million, despite the third quarter incremental reduction in AR securitization of $45 million. Year-end cash is expected to increase once again to approximately $1.5 billion. The year-end cash balance includes $95 million of annual reduction in AR securitization and $51 million of common stock repurchases at the average price of $17.36. Approximately $300 million of share purchase authority remains under prior announced Board authorization. Fourth quarter net debt of approximately $3.6 billion, which is an improvement post separation, which was started out at $3.8 billion. As we move into 2021, we plan to use cash on hand to repay the outstanding 2021 bond maturities. 
During these uncertain times, we focused on the areas which we control, including price, variable cost flexing, structural cost reductions, CapEx reductions and free cash flow while being prudent with our cash to opportunistically repay down debt and repurchase shares. Moreover, our diverse portfolio with less than 50% of revenue tied to commercial aerospace is delivering strong results while we wait for commercial aerospace to recover. 
Now let's move to Slide 17. To summarize, our third quarter was delivered in line or better than the implied outlook. Cost and price leverage has been deployed. We have healthy and improving liquidity with positive cash flows in this COVID environment. The fourth quarter outlook improved regarding revenues, margins and profitability with earnings per share guidance raised. Now let me turn it over to take your questions."

First of all, we've not discussed this with Pratt but when you reflect on the situation in the industry, we work with companies already that have their own casting capabilities. So for example, GE, Rolls-Royce, Safran, all hardcasting foundries. And so that in itself is nothing new to us. And when we look at Pratt & Whitney, in fact, they had their own casting capability until they exited in 2016. So we have a pattern and a history of working with our customers in this environment. So it's -- I would say it's nothing new for us. We do feel confident in our position as innovation and technology leader, especially in the hot section of the engine. And indeed, we produce some very specialized blades which are quite extraordinary in their capabilities for the JSF, which is the [indiscernible] the engine. 
If I comment a little bit further, so that you can understand some of the, I'll say, depths of our abilities. We do go to the extent of building our own furnaces. We have proprietary core preparation, waxing and casting processes and measuring controlling the temperature gradient starting off with an average of 300 degrees Fahrenheit higher than the casting temperatures, in-house. So really not really speaking about how and why we do it in any technical detail enables us to keep, I think, the technology edge and that in particular scale that we have with it and the know-how capability. And I think, as you know, we've been in this business now between 50 or 60 years. 
So I think you know we have all 3 levels of casting capability and all of the subprocesses. To replicate that which Howmet has would probably take in the region of towards $10 billion of capital, plus or minus. So I always absolutely respect everything that our customers do and probably more importantly, we have a competitive environment already with other competitors. And currently, we are a market leader by probably 1.5x but I think it comes down to those very unique capabilities that we have and the experience of working very collaboratively with our customers to do the most extraordinary applications, where they already have in-house capabilities. And so this would mark Pratt & Whitney returning to being having in-house capability alongside GE Aviation, Rolls-Royce and Safran too. Hopefully, I covered it out for you so."

We do have a long-term agreement covering many years in place. So I think that's the good in all of this. So [indiscernible] anything else, I'll move on to how we see the balance of year and into 2021 for us. We did call out the third quarter in our previous earnings call in early August that we felt that it would be below. We felt that it would be the most severely impacted by inventory reduction at our customers. And as you know, we operate both the first year place directly with Boeing and Airbus and also a second-tier place in terms of some of the engine parts that we supply to the engine manufacturers. And so you get an increased inventory effect as you go through another tier in the supply chain. And that's what we felt back in August and tried to indicate before also calling out back then that we felt as though the majority of the severity of the inventory reduction, we would try to accommodate and work with our customers to accommodate it sooner rather than later nor have it dragged out in a long tail. Now we are clear that we're not completely through this. It's to continue and have an impact into the fourth quarter and in some areas into the early part of 2021. And that's taking their accounts of the planned increase in Airbus narrow-body sales. We're not taking that into account at this point.  But we do feel that our revenues will improve in the fourth quarter. And that gives us the platform that we always sought to really get 2021 framed as best as we could. 
Maybe if I could amplify that point. We set out back in the depths of the -- let's call it the fog of war, back in the second quarter, where we didn't know very much that our target was to move quickly and to address the problems that we saw coming from the commercial aerospace market and target that we would ambitiously try to achieve the exit rate EBITDA margin in that 30% area. We indicated that clearly feel confident enough now that we increased the midpoint of that fourth quarter guidance a little bit and feel solid around it. And that was really to try to give the best view we could as the exit rate, which obviously helps when we view 2021 profitability. Albeit today, we're not guiding at all either for revenues or margins for 2021, that really is a fourth quarter call at the end of January or early February. 
So we are confident that the third quarter is -- was our low. We do see revenues in the fourth quarter increasing and increasing, not just in commercial transportation, which is [indiscernible], but also in commercial aerospace for us as part of it is the -- just the natural rebound from the inventory takeout in Q4. 
I mean where we go from here, and there are so many things that we need to think about for 2021 and you look out a year from now, and clearly, we'll know a lot more 3 months from now, whether it's this morning's vaccine news or whether it's our narrow-bodies are strong as we see and as MAX been completely recertified around the world, and what's the build rate and build rate going into 2022 and what's the inventory build to accommodate all of that, so there are so many factors, but I'd say maybe I've spoken too long now, but it really is confidence that the third quarter is the low and we are going to see that defense spend continue and IGD strength into the fourth quarter rebound in commercial aerospace sales, and commercial transportation currently with the wind behind its back in terms of volumes of our customers for commercial trucking and trade manufacturer."

So let's do in that sequence. And I cover the 2 points, which is why I use this year and then the pension side, pass across to Tolga.
So the use essentially is that AR securitization paid out. It goes through -- it affects working capital, and it goes through that line on the cash flow statement. If you exempted the AR $95 million, then there would be a working capital inflow for the year. So it's a function of the accounting around the securitization. 
One thing, David, that I've always felt a little bit comfortable about is we were -- we had this off-balance sheet financing, which was a carryover from Alcoa, the 2016 separation, a carryover from the Arconic separation, carried that securitization into [indiscernible] as RemainCo and wanted to gradually work that down, which is effectively just working down on our net debt of the company. And we feel that's a good thing to do it also improves the interest carrying cost of the company. So that's the principal reason around it. And if you were to do that, you'll see our AR improving, our AP under good control and our inventories being reduced. So the normal definition of working capital would be in good shape. And it's just a function of this AR securitization paydown, which goes to the working capital line. 
I'll comment on pension and pass across to Tolga. So pension at the moment, we do see that the -- the thought basically is that 2021 will be lower than 2020 in terms of pension contributions. And we'll give you a more exact number on that at the time we announce our fourth quarter results, say, early Feb. Tolga, if I could ask you to comment on truck inventory, both through our Engine and Fastener segment? And also the move into 2021?"

It's important to highlight that we are reducing our inventory and support the cash generation. However, if you look at the scale of the reductions in the stranded inventory in hand, the days on hand translation is naturally under pressure. So the 2 segments that have the highest pressure on the stranded inventory are engines and structures businesses. 
So I mentioned that we are working very closely with our customers to level load the demand and the production levels, especially on the structure side, especially on the long lead time orders. And therefore, we projected this stranded inventory will continue into 2021, and we should be balancing our days on hand within 2021. We are managing also the stranded inventory on the engine side and we have some more adjustments that we are working with our customers, but we expect that impact to be much smaller. And we got minimal impacts for the segments like fasteners on the stranded inventory side that we are actively managing today."

And you've seen that improve and be better. And then probably even more important to pit a bigger number than the structural cost takes is our variable cost takeout, which we've never called out the absolute dollars because I think the relevance of that is the percentage and are you getting close to what we call the perfect flex.  And we see ourselves flexing that cost base a little bit better well, across all the areas, but in particular, where the volume problem has been is in the commercial aerospace business that flexing the cost base has been at a higher order then we'd, again, plan for, again, partly because we tend to plan conservatively and then see if we can exceed it. 
So that's where it's at. I'm not saying that there's any increase in aircraft build or anything like that. That's not the case. But it could be in the fourth quarter more of the assumptions that we've made.

And now we're talking about the opposite trend over an extended period in a downturn. So just if you could help square why that is still true."

I mean, I'm not able to comment on predecessor management's stance towards it.

I mean, I'm not able to comment on predecessor management's stance towards it. I originate from an industry, which is called the -- in automotive, which is probably more used to price [indiscernible] the attempted commoditization of the input products for vehicle assembly. And -- but even there, where I always looked at it very closely, getting immersed in the technical capabilities and performance differentiation of the products. So even there, for example, I don't believe a steering wheel on a vehicle is -- that all steering wheels are equal. They're very different in terms of capabilities, cosmetics and quality delivered. So it really is trying to really understand the performance differentiation of the product. 
I'd like to believe that Homet provides that not only in product quality, technology but also in delivery performance and consistency with our customers. And I always try to work collaboratively with our customers to maximize the value for both of us. And so inherently, I've not thought of the aerospace parts market in quite the same way as the vehicle part of the market. I don't believe inherently that it is consistently price deflationary or anything like that. I think there is product capabilities of most of the parts that are produced in aerospace are technological wonders in our own rights and achieve a level of safety and performance for the traveling public, which is quite extraordinary. And so my hats off to everybody in the industry, the second-tier level, the first tier level and obviously, the plain manufacturer themselves. 
But within that, I do think -- I don't believe this is just any correction of past. If there's a correction. It's just -- we have cleaned out 1 or 2 contracts, which were, let's say, inappropriately taken. That's -- I'd like to indicate that on the earlier comment on the call. It's -- I think we're now beyond that in dealing with such things. And that's why I called out the $8 million in the quarter in the normal operating, you put in the normal operating result in that as a special item. And then I just think it's the consistent application of those technical characteristics. So we're never resting. If you look at the -- some of the developments that we're making within our portfolio in terms of parts for radar or parts for engines, we're trying to advance them all the time. I did try to call out the descriptors of those things, which we truly try to protect and even to the extent of not buying a lot of the machine tools outside. So that knowledge can't lead out into the wider marketplace. And so when you go to that level of effort of making your own equipment because it gives you that, I'll say, capabilities, which we think is extraordinary. I think that does give you the ability to look at price and also the -- I'll say, the value produced at the scale with which we do it at.  And I often think people underestimate scale within such things about the economics of production and also the methodology which you can create the scale. 
So it's a long way of saying, I think the attitude and stance is different. At the same time, I do recognize that there are parts that we are able to improve the economics are. And there are parts that who can see the [indiscernible] customer. So it's always a range and a good negotiation. It's always important that we end in a place of equanimity. Everybody is feeling good. And the shares are settled, and the prices are settled and then we move on for several years. In the round that we've just been implementing, we're out a further 5 years on the majority of our path going forward. So that's, again, a good condition to be in. I've not commented about the adjustment for any percentage increase. So I think that's not appropriate. Neither I commented on share [indiscernible] less appropriate, but apart from we're in the right zone that we thought we'd be in and I think and everybody from ourselves and our customers were as a place of -- in a good zone."

I plan to give an overview of Howmet's third quarter performance, ask Tolga to speak to segment information, and then Ken will provide further financial detail. Lastly, I will return to talk to the outlook for the fourth quarter and 2020 financial year. 
Please move to Slide #4. The third quarter performance was good and in line with expectations, including strong cash generation. Revenue in the quarter was $1.1 billion, down 37% year-over-year and was impacted by commercial aerospace being down 56%, driven by customer inventory corrections. We continue to expect that this is the low point for Howmet revenues while anticipating that there could be some lingering inventory corrections that could carry over into the fourth quarter and possibly the first half 2021. 
Commercial transportation was down year-over-year, but we had healthy sequential growth of 42%, which favorably impacts the Forged Wheels and commercial transportation fastening segment. Moreover, we had growth in defense aerospace and in the industrial gas turbine business year-over-year. The mix of our portfolio has changed with approximately 40% of Q3 revenue being tied to commercial aerospace. 
Operating income excluding special items was $100 million and this includes the buyout of an unfavorable long-term contract, which cost $8 million. This hopefully should be the last of the cleanup items over the last year. Segment decremental margins, including the contract termination, were 37% year-over-year. I had indicated it on the Q2 call that the third quarter was likely to be more decremented than the second quarter and reflects that we chose not to take out costs for one quarter and risk not having the people assets in place with what we expect to be an uptick in future demand. 
For example, early in the third quarter, we completed all of the people reductions in our wheels segment and have since pulled people back from furlough and have begun recruitment in certain countries as we bring production assets back online, both for our forgings and machining lines. Structural cost reductions will continue within each of the aerospace segments to the end of 2020 and in the first quarter in Europe. 
Third quarter reflects further structural cost takeout of $56 million, making year-to-date cost takeout of $137 million, which is ahead of target. This structural cost takeout is in addition to the flexing of variable costs, which we expect by the end of first quarter 2021 should be at a perfect flex. Further to this, price increases of $14 million were achieved in the third quarter compared to $9 million in the second quarter. Year-to-date price increases are $28 million. 
I am pleased that all of the 2020 long-term contract negotiations are now completed, and price negotiations are well underway for the 2021 long-term agreements. 
Now let's move to the balance sheet and cash flow. Adjusted free cash flow in the third quarter was very good at $188 million, before further reductions in the accounts receivable securitization program. And cash flow was $143 million after the reduction in the AR program. The $45 million of the accounts receivable -- sorry, the accounts resecuritization reduction was effectively repayment of debt. Cash severance payments in the quarter were $14 million. 
The third quarter cash balance increased to $1.4 billion after the $51 million of common stock share repurchases, which were at an average price of $17.36. Our peak operational cash requirements are approximately $300 million, which results in excess cash in hand of well over $1 billion. 
Net debt-to-EBITDA is approximately 3.2x and our revolver of $1 billion continues to be undrawn. 
All plants are running -- so, now let's move to Slide 5. All plants are running with employee and partner safety being a top priority. We're actively monitoring employee health risk, and all programs meet or exceed local standards. To best serve our customers, we're effectively managing daily adjustments for customer inventory corrections and shutdowns. 
Regarding cost-outs, most of the North American permanent personnel reductions have been completed and are ahead of target. Therefore, we will be raising our 2020 permanent cost outlook. We're also continuing to flex variable spend and labor effectively with revenue. Our strict and disciplined capital expenditure process has been effective and we will once again be reducing our annual capital expenditure outlook. 
Lastly, we're focused on working capital but expect it to be use of cash in 2020 as we have reduced our AR securitization program by approximately $95 million year-to-date. Moreover, we have stranded inventory which we expect to be a source of cash in 2021. 
Now let me turn it over to Tolga."

Although strong defense aerospace",396,"Thank you, John. Please move to Slide 6. We summarized on Slide 6 the status of our segments. Aerospace segments continue with revenue adjustments that follow slightly different trends. Let me start with engine products. Although strong defense aerospace and industrial gas turbine growth continued in third quarter, commercial aerospace had expected customer inventory corrections and seasonal shutdowns. We continue to expect that third quarter will be the lowest revenue quarter of 2020, and we are ahead of our permanent cost reduction plans. Additionally, we are flexing variable labor and indirect costs with revenue. 
Regarding our long-term agreements, 2020 negotiations are now complete, and we are actively working on 2021 contracts. Our philosophy on price has not changed. The Engine products segment's biggest challenge continues to be managing the strength in inventory, which had a modest reduction quarter-over-quarter. 
Moving to Fastening Systems. The Fastening Systems segment follows a lagging, reducing revenue trends, mainly due to the timing of commercial aerospace distribution business. The decline in commercial aerospace is partially offset by growth in fasteners industrial business. Regarding permanent cost reduction, fasteners has the largest number of European locations within our business, which impacts the timing of cost reduction actions, but follows directionally the revenue reduction threat. We are bridging this timing with heavy furloughs and effective variable cost flexing. Maintaining our critical talent and skill sets is our priority during this period. 
The Engineered Structures segment has long lead time orders, requiring close discussions with our customers to level out their demands for an efficient operating model for the next 6 to 9 months. Permanent cost reduction actions are ahead of plan. Long-term agreement pricing negotiations are complete for 2020, including weeding out unprofitable products. 
In the Forged Wheels segment, third quarter 2020 revenue started recovering from second quarter 2020. As John mentioned, third quarter sequential revenue was up 42%, as tough U.S. shipping ports are near or above record levels of volume, which drives trucking demand. We expect continued growth in the fourth quarter and have called employees back from furloughs and restarted operations. We have compressed permanent costs and have been effective in flexing production to meet customer demand. 
Lastly, we renewed one of our largest customers' long-term agreements, while increasing share with our innovative, lightweight, 39 pounds wheel. 
I will now hand it over to Ken to give more details on the financials."

Now let's move to Slide 7. So before moving into the revenue and segment profitability, I wanted to note that the third quarter revenue and profit was in line with expectations and better than the implied outlook that we provided on the second quarter earnings call. The improved performance will be reflected in the updated outlook for the remainder of the year. 
Now to the third quarter. Total revenue was down 37% year-over-year, driven by commercial aerospace, which now represents approximately 40% of total revenue in the quarter. Moving to the right-hand side of the slide, commercial aerospace was down 56% year-over-year. Consistent with our previous outlook, we expect the third quarter to be the lowest revenue quarter of the year as customers adjust inventory levels. Regarding the remaining 60% of the portfolio, I would point out that our second largest market, defense aerospace, continues to show year-over-year growth and was up 15% in the quarter driven by strong demand for the Joint Strike Fighter on both new engine builds and engine spares. Our next largest market, commercial transportation, which impacts both the Forged Wheels and the Fastening Systems segment, was down 31% year-over-year. However, as Tolga has mentioned, we are seeing favorable trends for increased demand, and this market improved 42% sequentially. 
Lastly, the industrial and other markets, which is comprised of industrial gas turbines, oil and gas and general industrial, was down 4%. I would point out that IGT, which makes up approximately 40% of this market, continues to be strong and was up 23%. 
Now let's move to Slide 8. On this slide, we are providing historical information for the combined segments with an estimated operational view of corporate. Compared to the prior year, third quarter revenue declined approximately $660 million, with a corresponding segment operating profit decline of $246 million. Despite the 37% year-over-year revenue decline, we've remained profitable and generated strong adjusted free cash flow in the quarter. Included in the third quarter results are continued price increases of $14 million and continued permanent cost reductions of $56 million for a combined benefit of $70 million in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, price increases were $28 million and cost reductions were $137 million for our combined benefit of $165 million. 
One last comment on cost reductions. Of the $137 million realized year-to-date, this includes carryover benefits from our 2019 cost reduction program. This program generated $54 million of benefit year-to-date for 2020 and finished ahead of target. The program is now substantially complete. In the appendix, we have provided additional information, including historical financials for each of the segments. 
Now let's move to Slide 9 to go into more detail on the segments. Engine Products year-over-year revenue was down 43% in the quarter. In this segment, commercial aerospace was down 65%, driven by COVID-19, 737 MAX production declines and customer inventory corrections. Commercial aerospace was somewhat offset by an 18% year-over-year increase in defense aerospace and a 23% increase in IGT. Third quarter results were impacted by an $8 million charge to exit an unprofitable long-term contract. Cost reductions and price increases continued in the segment, and the team continued to flex variable spending to mitigate the impact in the quarter of the significant decline in commercial aerospace revenue. 
Now let's move to the Fastening Systems segment on Slide 10. Also, as expected, we experienced the steeper revenue decline in fasteners as the third quarter year-over-year revenue was down 31%, driven by commercial aerospace and commercial transportation, both being down over 35%. Continued cost reductions, combined with third quarter price increases, helped to mitigate the decrease in revenue. However, a weaker product mix with less commercial aerospace and the expected delay in European cost reductions unfavorably impacted results. In the near term, we're furloughing employees to offset the delay in European cost reductions. 
Now let's move to Slide 11 to review Engineered Structures. For the Engineered Structures segment, third quarter revenue was down 35%. Commercial aerospace was down 54%, driven by COVID-19, production declines on both the 787 and 737 MAX as well as customer inventory corrections. Commercial aerospace was somewhat offset by a 26% year-over-year increase in defense aerospace. Cost reductions and price increases helped mitigate the decrease in revenue, but structures experienced a weaker product mix with less commercial aerospace. 
Lastly, let's move to Slide 12 for Forged Wheels. In the third quarter, revenue for the Forged Wheels segment was down 29% year-over-year, but increased 52% sequentially as expected. Employees are returning from furloughs and we continue to quickly flex staffing at variable cost to meet changing market demand. Despite revenue being down 29%, the impact of cost reductions resulted in a healthy EBITDA margin for the quarter of 26%. 
Now let's move to Slide 13 for special items. Special items for the quarter was a net benefit of approximately $23 million after-tax and included 2 items: first, a $36 million after-tax benefit related to a U.S. tax law change; second, a $12 million after-tax charge related to severance programs. The severance programs are tied to the permanent cost reduction actions.
Now let's move to Slide 14. We continue to focus on improving our capital structure and liquidity. All debt is unsecured, and our next significant maturity is in 2024. Our cash position remained strong and increased to $1.4 billion in the quarter and is expected to increase again in the fourth quarter. As we look into next year, we will use cash on hand to pay down the 2021 outstanding notes in the first quarter of 2021. 
A couple of additional items of note. First, our $1 billion 5-year revolving credit facility remains undrawn. Second, we have reduced our AR securitization program. Prior to the separation earlier this year, we historically sold $350 million worth of AR each quarter. Beginning in the first quarter of this year, the amount of AR sold through the securitization program was decreased each quarter, approximately $20 million decrease in the first quarter, a $30 million decrease in the second quarter and a $45 million increase in the third quarter. The total decrease has been approximately $95 million year-to-date from $350 million of AR sold at the end of 2019 to approximately $255 million of AR sold at the end of the third quarter. The $95 million reduction in AR sold is effectively a repayment of debt and unfavorably impacts year-to-date adjusted free cash flow. 
Before turning it back to John to cover the 2020 outlook, let me review some assumptions on Slide 15. Depreciation and amortization is expected to improve to approximately $270 million for the year. The annual operational tax rate is also expected to improve and be in the range of 27% to 29% for the full year. Regarding CapEx, we are once again reducing our annual CapEx spend outlook to approximately $160 million for the year, which is a historical low at 3% of revenue. 
Lastly, as a result of the common stock share repurchases in the third quarter, we are lowering the expected fourth quarter diluted share count to approximately 437 million shares and the full year average diluted share count to approximately 439 million shares. 
Now let me turn it back over to John."

Now let me discuss the outlook for the remainder of 2020. We are improving the outlook and narrowing the ranges. The improvement strengthens the sales, increases EBITDA, increases EBITDA margins, and lifts the earnings per share compared to the prior outlook. Revenues in the fourth quarter are expected to be $1.23 billion, plus or minus $30 million, and price increases are expected to continue. EBITDA in the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately $255 million, plus or minus $15 million, and we are once again increasing our annual permanent cost out target to $185 million from $150 million. These are savings realized in the year. 
Our fourth quarter EBITDA margin is now increased to 20% to 21% from the prior midpoint of 20%. I think this may be the most significant item of our call this morning beyond the good cash generation. Annual earnings per share improves to a range of $0.68 to $0.76. Cash generation in the quarters from separation, Q2 to Q4, is strong and unchanged at $450 million, plus or minus $50 million, despite the third quarter incremental reduction in AR securitization of $45 million. Year-end cash is expected to increase once again to approximately $1.5 billion. The year-end cash balance includes $95 million of annual reduction in AR securitization and $51 million of common stock repurchases at the average price of $17.36. Approximately $300 million of share purchase authority remains under prior announced Board authorization. 
Fourth quarter net debt of approximately $3.6 billion, which is an improvement post separation, which was started out at $3.8 billion. As we move into 2021, we plan to use cash on hand to repay the outstanding 2021 bond maturities. During these uncertain times, we focused on the areas which we control, including price, variable cost flexing, structural cost reductions, CapEx reductions and free cash flow, while being prudent with our cash to opportunistically repay down debt and repurchase shares. Moreover, our diverse portfolio with less than 50% of revenue tied to commercial aerospace, is delivering strong results while we wait for commercial aerospace to recover. 
Now let's move to Slide 17. To summarize, our third quarter was delivered in line or better than the implied outlook. Cost and price leverage has been deployed. We have healthy and improving liquidity with positive cash flows in this COVID environment. The fourth quarter outlook improved regarding revenues, margins and profitability with earnings per share guidance raised. Now let me turn it over to take your questions."

So for example, GE, Rolls-Royce, Safran, all have casting foundries, and so that in itself is nothing new to us. And when we look at Pratt & Whitney, in fact, they had their own casting capability until they exited in 2016. So we have a pattern and a history of working with our customers in this environment. So it's -- I would say it's nothing new for us. We do feel confident in our position as innovation and technology leader, especially in the hot section of the engine. And indeed, we produce some very specialized blades which are quite extraordinary in their capabilities for the JSF, which is a Pratt & Whitney engine. 
If I comment a little bit further so that you can understand some of the, I'll say, depths of our capabilities. We do go to the extent of building our own furnaces. We have proprietary core preparation, waxing and casting processes and measuring and controlling the temperature gradient starting off with an average of 300 degrees Fahrenheit higher than the casting temperatures, or maximum casting temperatures of our competitors. So one of the things we do is by keeping all of that production equipment in-house and really not really speaking about how and why we do it in any technical detail enables us to keep, I think, the technology edge and that in particular, that scale that we have with it and the know-how capability. And I think, as you know, we've been in this business now between 50 or 60 years. 
So I think you know we have all 3 levels of casting capabilities and all of the subprocesses. To replicate that which Howmet has would probably take in the region of towards $10 billion of capital, plus or minus. So I always absolutely respect everything that our customers do. And probably more importantly, we have a competitive environment already with other competitors. And currently, we are a market leader by probably 1.5x, but I think it comes down to those very unique capabilities that we have and the experience of working very collaboratively with our customers to do the most extraordinary applications, where they already have in-house capabilities. And so this would mark the Pratt & Whitney returning to being having in-house capability alongside GE Aviation, Rolls-Royce and Safran too. Hopefully, I covered it out for you, Seth."

I don't think there's much to add to the Pratt & Whitney conversation. We do have a long-term agreement covering many years in place. So I think that's the good in all of this.

We do have a long-term agreement covering many years in place. So I think that's the good in all of this. So unless there's anything else, I'll move on to how we see the balance of year and into 2021 for us. 
We did call out the third quarter in our previous earnings call in early August, that we felt that it would be below. We felt that it would be the most severely impacted by inventory reductions of our customers. And as you know, we operate both the first-tier place directly with Boeing and Airbus and also a second-tier place in terms of some of the engine parts that we supply to the engine manufacturers. And so you get an increased inventory effect as you go through another tier in the supply chain. And that's what we felt back in August and tried to indicate before also calling out back then that we felt as though the majority of the severity of the inventory reduction, we would try to accommodate and work with our customers to accommodate it sooner rather than later nor have it dragged out in a long tail. 
Now we are clear that we're not completely through this. It's going to continue and have an impact into the fourth quarter and in some areas into the early part of 2021. And that's taking their accounts of the planned increase in Airbus narrow-body sales. We're not taking that into account at this point. But we do feel that our revenues will improve in the fourth quarter. And that gives us the platform that we always sought to really get 2021 framed as best as we could. 
Maybe if I could amplify that point. We set out back in the depths of the, let's call it the fog of war back in the second quarter, where we didn't know very much that our target was to move quickly and to address the problems that we saw coming from the commercial aerospace market and target that we would ambitiously try to achieve the exit rate EBITDA margin in that 30% area. We indicated that and clearly feel confident enough now that we increased the midpoint of that fourth quarter guidance a little bit and feel solid around it. And that was really to try to give the best view we could as the exit rate, which obviously helps when we view 2021 profitability. Albeit today, we're not guiding at all either for revenues or margins for 2021, that really is a fourth quarter call at the end of January or early February. 
So we are confident that the third quarter is -- was our low. We do see revenues in the fourth quarter increasing, and increasing not just in commercial transportation, which is self-evident, but also in commercial aerospace for us as part of it is the -- just the natural rebound from the inventory takeout in Q4. 
I mean where we go from here and the so many things that we need to think about for 2021 and you look out a year from now, and clearly, we'll know a lot more 3 months from now, whether it's this morning's vaccine news or whether it's our narrow-bodies are strong as we see and as MAX been completely recertified around the world, and what's the build rate and build rate going into 2022, and what's the inventory build to accommodate all of that. So there are so many factors, but I'd say maybe I've spoken too long now, but it really is confidence that the third quarter is the low, and we are going to see that defense spend continue and IGT strength into the fourth quarter just rebound in commercial aerospace sales and commercial transportation currently with the wind behind its back in terms of volumes from our customers for commercial trucking and trade manufacturer."

So maybe if I start at the top level to say why we see working capital recorded out differently to be a use this year, and now I'm going to hand across to Tolga to talk a little bit about trapped inventory, what we have this year and into next year.",359,"Okay. So maybe if I start at the top level to say why we see working capital recorded out differently to be a use this year, and now I'm going to hand across to Tolga to talk a little bit about trapped inventory, what we have this year and into next year. So let's do in that sequence. And I cover the 2 points, which is why the use this year and then the pension side, pass across to Tolga.
So the use essentially is that AR securitization paid out. It goes through -- it affects working capital, and it goes through that line on the cash flow statement. If you exempted the AR $95 million, then there would be a working capital inflow for the year. So it's a function of the accounting around the securitization. 
One thing, David, that I've always felt a little bit comfortable about is we were -- we had this off-balance sheet financing, which was a carryover from Alcoa, the 2016 separation, a carryover from the Arconic separation, carried that securitization into [indiscernible] as RemainCo and wanted to gradually work that down, which is effectively just working down on our net debt of the company. And we feel that's a good thing to do. It also improves the interest-carrying cost of the company. So that's the principal reason around it. And if you were to do that, you'll see our AR improving, our AP under good control and our inventories being reduced. So the normal definition of working capital would be in good shape. And it's just a function of this AR securitization paydown, which goes to the working capital line. 
I'll comment on pension and pass across to Tolga. So pension, at the moment, we do see that the -- the thought, basically, is that 2021 will be lower than 2020 in terms of pension contributions, and we'll give you a more exact number on that at the time we announce our fourth quarter results, say, early Feb. Tolga, if I could ask you to comment on trapped inventory, both through our Engine and Fastener segment, and also the move into 2021?"

It's important to highlight that we are reducing our inventory and supporting the cash generation. However, if you look at the scale of the reductions in the stranded inventory in hand, the days on-hand translation is naturally under pressure. So the 2 segments that have the highest pressure on the stranded inventory are engines and structures businesses. 
So I mentioned that we are working very closely with our customers to level load the demand into production levels, especially on the structure side, especially on the long lead time orders. And therefore, we projected this stranded inventory will continue into 2021, and we should be balancing our days on hand within 2021. We are managing also the stranded inventory on the engine side, and we have some more adjustments that we are working with our customers, but we expect that impact to be much smaller. And we got minimal impacts for the segments like fasteners on the stranded inventory side that we are actively managing today."

There are a couple of major ones within 2021.

My comment about the bidding out was on the structure side, a few contracts, as we are renegotiating our pricing. And in general, it has been very positive for structures and certain part numbers that were historically not good. So we continued -- we chose the option not to renew those funds. It's in the big picture, not significant for us and beneficial for the business. And specifically talking about the fasteners, our contract negotiations are going very positive and the renewable saving very good. And we do not really have any specific action to specifically look into big numbers of contracts that are giving us margin issues. But again, overall, it has been a very positive contract renewable for all of our segments, including structures, fasteners and engines."

So it's a little bit better there, but that could also be down to conservative assumptions that we tend to roll with. I think the cost takeout, you've seen both on the structural side of our cost take out, and you've seen that improve and be better. And then probably even more important to pit a bigger number than the structural cost takes is our variable cost takeouts, which we've never called out the absolute dollars because I think the relevance of that is the percentage and are you getting close to what we call the perfect flex. And we see ourselves flexing that cost base a little bit better, well, across all the areas, but in particular where the volume problem has been is in the commercial aerospace business, that flexing the cost base has been at a higher order than we'd, again, plan for, again, partly because we tend to plan conservatively and then see if we can exceed it. 
So that's where it's at. I'm not saying that there's any increase in aircraft build or anything like that. That's not the case. But it could be in the fourth quarter, more of the assumptions that we've made. But at this point, we feel confident about the revenue lift that we've talked about, the cost takeout, and the therefore, the improvement in the EBITDA margins that we've called out because, for us, that's all about the platform we enter 2021 with."

And is it a -- is it sort of a rolling onetime mark-to-market on some of the contracts that Howmet inherited from the legacy companies, maybe that were off commercial terms relative to your competitors, and therefore, you're just going to reset the market, maybe FX energy pass-throughs on metal, things like that weren't -- you were taking too much risk on the legacy contracts relative to your competitors? Or is it in fact, the customers wanting recognizing the value you guys provide and just you're seeing price inflation in the end market? Because, again, I'm just trying to square with what you guys said before your time as CEO, Arconic used to talk about price deflation as a reality in aerospace and used to have loading bar charts and showed it on your slides. And now we're talking about the opposite trend over an extended period in a downturn. So just if you could help square why that is still true."

I mean, I'm not able to comment on predecessor management's stance towards it.

I mean, I'm not able to comment on predecessor management's stance towards it. I originate from an industry, which is called the -- in automotive, which is probably more used to price deflation and the attempted commoditization of the input products for vehicle assembly. And -- but even there, when I always looked at it very closely, getting immersed in the technical capabilities and performance differentiation of the products. So even there, for example, I don't believe a steering wheel on a vehicle is -- that all steering wheels are equal. They're very different in terms of capabilities, cosmetics and quality delivered. So it really is trying to really understand the performance differentiation of the product. 
I'd like to believe that Howmet provides that not only in product quality, technology but also in delivery performance and consistency with our customers. And I always try to work collaboratively with our customers to maximize the value for both of us and so inherently, I've not thought of the aerospace parts market in quite the same way as the vehicle part market. I don't believe inherently that it is consistently price deflationary or anything like that. I think there is product capabilities of most of the parts that are produced in aerospace are technological wonders in our own rights and achieve a level of safety and performance for the traveling public, which is quite extraordinary. And so my hat's off to everybody in the industry at the second-tier level, the first tier level and obviously, the plain manufacturer themselves. 
But within that, I do think -- I don't believe this is just any correction of the past. If there's a correction, it's this -- we have cleaned out 1 or 2 contracts, which were, let's say, inappropriately taken. That's -- and I tried to just indicate that on the earlier comments on the call, but I think we're now beyond that in dealing with such things. And that's why I called out the $8 million in the quarter in the normal operating, we put in the normal operating result in that as a special item. And then I just think it's the consistent application of those technical characteristics. So we're never resting. If you look at the -- some of the developments that we're making within our portfolio in terms of parts for radar or parts for engines, we're trying to advance them all the time. And I did try to call out the descriptors of those things, which we truly try to protect and even to the extent of not buying a lot of the machine tools outside, so that knowledge can't lead out into the wider marketplace. And so when you go to that level of effort of making your own equipment because it gives you that, I'll say, capabilities, which we think is extraordinary, I think that does give you the ability to look at price and also the, I'll say, the value produced at the scale with which we do it at. And I often think people underestimate scale within such things about the economics of production and also the methodology which you can create the scale. 
So it's a long way of saying, I think the attitude and the stance is different. At the same time, I do recognize that there are parts that we are able to improve the economics on. And there are parts that who can see the concede the price to our customer. So it's always a range and a good negotiation. It's always important that we end in a place of equanimity, and everybody is feeling good. And the shares are settled, and the prices are settled and then we move on for several years. In the round that we've just been implementing, we're out a further 5 years on the majority of our parts going forward. So that's, again, a good condition to be in. I've not commented about the adjustment for any percentage increase because I think that's not appropriate, neither I commented on share because that's not appropriate, but apart from we're in the right zone that we thought we'd be in and I think and everybody from ourselves and our customers were at a place of -- in a good zone."
