We're pleased that you've joined us for our 2019 year-end earnings call. With me today are Vince Sorgi, PPL, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Joe Bergstein, Chief Financial Officer. Moving to Slide",1015,"Thank you, Andy, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased that you've joined us for our 2019 year-end earnings call. With me today are Vince Sorgi, PPL, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Joe Bergstein, Chief Financial Officer. 
Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda this morning begins with an overview of 2019 results and PPL's business outlook for 2020. Vince will then review some of PPL's recent operational highlights and outlook for 2020 as well as discuss PPL's clean energy transition strategy, including our decision to set a more aggressive goal to reduce PPL's carbon emissions. Following Vince's remarks, Joe will provide a more detailed financial review of 2019 and 2020, along with our updated earnings forecast for 2021. 
I'll conclude by taking a few moments to highlight what has truly been a decade of transformation and growth for PPL. And PPL is marking its 100th anniversary, thanks to our employees' hard work and dedication and the unparalleled support of our communities. As always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions. 
Turning to Slide 4. In 2019, PPL continues to deliver on its commitments to shareowners, to customers and the communities we serve. We remain steadfast in our strategy to deliver best in sector operational performance, invest in a sustainable energy future, provide superior customer service, maintain a strong financial foundation and engage and develop our people. 
Our results in 2019 reflect this strategy. We exceeded the midpoint of our earnings guidance for the tenth straight year. Delivering ongoing earnings of $2.45 per share. We remain committed to dividend growth, increasing our dividend for the 17th time in 18 years and returning more than $1 billion in dividends to shareowners. As we delivered on these financial commitments, we continue to extend our track record of operational excellence. 
We maintained strong transmission and distribution reliability across all of our utilities. In addition, we achieved top decile generation reliability in Kentucky. At the same time, we remain as focused as ever on providing superior customer service. In fact, our utilities remain among the very best for customer satisfaction in the regions we serve. Our U.S. utilities earned 4 J.D. Power awards for customer satisfaction, raising their combined total to 51, since J.D. Power began assessing utility customer satisfaction in 1999. Meanwhile, our U.K. utilities all achieved a 9 out of 10 rating in Ofgem's broad measure of customer satisfaction review. In addition, Western Power distribution earned the U.K.'s customer service Excellence award for the 27th consecutive year. The company was also ranked by the industry regulator as best and stakeholder engagement and support for vulnerable customers for the eighth straight year. These achievements and more reflect our shared values and common purpose across PPL to deliver without fail for our customers to exceed their expectations and to continuously improve. 
Aware of the tremendous opportunity we have to make a positive impact on society, not only today, but for years to come, PPL also invested more than $3 billion in infrastructure improvements. Our continued investments are aimed at strengthening grid resiliency in the face of worsening storms, incorporating automation, replacing and rebuilding power lines and substations and reshaping electricity networks to support the growth of renewables and other distributed energy resources. 
In regulatory matters, we remain focused in 2019 on achieving balanced regulatory outcomes that will benefit our customers and our share owners. In Kentucky, we received a public service commission approval of a combined $187 million revenue increase, which supports additional improvements to the grid, our natural gas lines and our generation fleet. New rates took effect May 1. 
And in the U.K., we continued to actively engage with Ofgem to advance a balanced regulatory framework that will provide real value to customers, support the U.K.'s electrification and decarbonization initiatives and provide fair and reasonable returns to investors when the next price control review period begins in 2023. Our engagement over the past year included meeting with Ofgem leadership and submitting responses to Ofgem's open letter consultation on behalf of both PPL and WPD, including our shareholders. 
I'll note that the RIIO-ED2 framework released by Ofgem in December was largely in line with our expectations. In summary, we're proud of our many achievements over the past year on behalf of PPL shareowners and customers. Our performance is reflected in the numerous awards received throughout the year.  Looking ahead, we're committed to building on this momentum and adding to our long-term track record of financial and operational excellence. 
Now turning to Slide 5 and our 2020 outlook. Today, we initiated formal 2020 earnings guidance of $2.40 per share to $2.60 per share. This reflects our updated foreign currency hedge position, which we increased following the U.K. election that finally led to Brexit last month. Given the election result, we expect the U.K. business climate to remain strong as it has historically been. 
Turning to our dividend. Today, we announced we are raising the annualized dividend to $1.66 per share. The increase announced today represents our 18th dividend increase in the last 19 years, and we remained committed to dividend growth. In terms of network investment in 2020, we plan to invest an additional $3.3 billion in all of our utilities. These investments will continue to support our efforts to improve customer experience and great resiliency and advance a cleaner energy future. 
Finally, as I touched upon earlier, we will remain engaged on the regulatory front to achieve balance outcomes that benefit customers and shareowners. Last week, the new CEO of Ofgem, Jonathan Brierley, announced his decarbonization program action plan. Ofgem's plan over the next 18 months to make low-cost decarbonization reality shows that the DNOs will play a critical role in the significant investment required to deliver clean energy and the U.K.'s net 0 carbon emissions target by the year 2050. This supports what we've been saying that we see real long-term growth opportunities with our WPD business as the DNOs lead many of the decarbonization initiatives that will enable a net 0 carbon economy. 
I'll now turn the call over to Vince for an operational update. Vince?"
185508,653004866,1910727,"PPL Corporation, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 14, 2020",2020-02-14,"Earnings Calls","PPL Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bill. As we turn to a new year and a new decade, I just want to express how proud I am with the operational excellence that our 7 utilities continue to deliver for our customers.

As we turn to a new year and a new decade, I just want to express how proud I am with the operational excellence that our 7 utilities continue to deliver for our customers. Our sector continues to rapidly evolve, and our teams are meeting the challenges and finding opportunities to leverage technological advancements and decarbonization initiatives that are driving real value for our customers. 
We believe that PPL is well positioned to further enhance its networks and continue to build these utilities of the future as we look ahead. I'd like to highlight some of the operational developments from this past year and briefly discuss our strategic priorities for each segment for 2020 and beyond. I'll also provide an update on our 5-year capital expenditure plan. 
Turning to Slide 7. Starting with the U.K., during 2019, WPD continued to demonstrate its leadership in support of the U.K.'s decarbonization goals. WPD was the first U.K. network operator to publish an electric vehicle strategy, building on knowledge gaining through the company's electric Nation EV smart charging initiative. The company has begun to proactively ready its network for increasing numbers of electric vehicles, anticipating the potential for up to 3 million EVs in our service territory by 2030. WPD also continues to deliver an industry-leading innovation program, including finding ways to connect more distributed generation to local networks. 
Through 2019, WPD connected nearly 10 gigawatts of distributed generation to its network, about 6 gigawatts of which was renewable energy. In addition, WPD is leading the way in developing markets for flexibility services and demand response solutions to help maintain great resiliency and control costs to U.K. customers. These flexibility solution should enable the deferral of some network spend, which Ofgem is keen to see the DNOs deliver. As we look to the upcoming year, it's important to review how we are performing against our RIIO-ED1 business plan, and I'm proud to say that WPD continues to perform extremely well in RIIO-ED1. In the most recent Ofgem annual report for electric distribution, WPD ranked first in customer satisfaction and customer minutes lost and ranked second in time to connect customers. Our returns are middle of the pack with an RORE expectation of 8.4% on a real basis over the ED-1 period. I'll note that this equates to a nominal RORE of about 11% when including RPI inflation. As we've indicated in the past, as the only fast track company in RIIO-ED1. We think the fact that we are the top-performing D&O group in the sector and only earning average returns will serve us well going into RIIO-ED2. 
Our strategic priorities moving forward are to continue this high level of performance and continue our engagement with Ofgem to help develop the sector-specific methodology. Our objective is to ensure RIIO-ED2 provides the appropriate incentives for DNOs to deliver on the initiatives required to achieve net 0 carbon emissions by 2050. 
Turning to Slide 8. In Pennsylvania, PPL electric utilities continue to demonstrate its leadership in the deployment of smart grid solutions. We currently have 4,500 smart switches installed on our grid. Since 2015, this technology has helped us eliminate over 900,000 outages for our customers. 
As we've discussed during the year, [indiscernible] has received numerous awards this year for its operational excellence and commitment to innovation including the deployment of a new distributed energy resource management system or terms and the development of groundbreaking technology that safely and automatically cuts power to down power lines, protecting the public first responders and our employees. 
In addition, PPL electric utilities was awarded the most improved utility at the decade by IPA consulting. The company is also substantially complete with the multiyear nearly $500 million project to install 1.4 million advanced meters for our customers. 
Looking ahead, for 2020, we remain focused on executing on our substantial electric transmission and distribution investment plan. The majority of the spend this year remains in our transmission business, which has been the fastest-growing business in our portfolio for a number of years now due to the ongoing needs to upgrade and modernize our transmission system. This includes upgrading transmission lines and substations, replacing wood poles with steel poles and building new substations. 
We've also invested considerably in our distribution network, also adding smart grid devices to the network, hardening the system, targeting our tree trimming efforts and investing in new systems to automate how the network is controlled. This investment has also resulted in significant reductions in the number of end-duration of outages for our customers. Going forward, we'll continue to deploy digital and cloud-based technology solutions to further automate the system to improve service even further for our customers. From a rates perspective, our retail rates continue to remain competitive in the Mid-Atlantic region, thanks to our ongoing emphasis on integrating technology and efficiently managing costs, especially since we haven't had a base rate case since 2016. 
Over the past decade, we've held our operating costs of less than a 1% increase on average each year. We'll look to continue our efforts in this area as we don't expect another rate case to be effective within the earnings guidance period. 
Moving to Kentucky on Slide 9. We [indiscernible] Lasan electric and Kentucky utilities continue to make progress on a multiyear $800 million project at Cateno ash ponds at our coal-fired power plant. Overall, we are about 80% complete with the cap and closure program. We also retired 272 megawatts of coal-fired generation at our E.W. Brown facility, raising the amount of retired coal generation to nearly 1,200 megawatts since 2010. 
In addition, we secured public Service Commission approval of a green energy tariff for businesses and continued to enhance our solar offerings for all of our customers. We completed construction of the first phase of our subscription-based solar share program, and we have fully subscribed the second phase with construction expected to be completed in Q2 of this year. 
Following up on a renewable energy RFP conducted in 2019. In January, we requested approval of contracts to supply an additional 100 megawatts of ads available solar power to Kentucky customers. As we move into 2020, we see a balanced mix of investment across our Kentucky utilities. Over the past decade, we've had a significant portion of our capital devoted to improving the environmental profile of our generating units, which has supported reductions of So2 and NOX emissions by approximately 90% and 80%, respectively. We'll be completing the majority of these environmental projects to comply with current regulations within the next couple of years. 
As the environmental capital requirements have begun to decline, we've been able to deploy capital to improving our electric and gas PV networks with a focus on system reliability and automation that are already delivering real value for our customers as evidenced by 120,000 interruptions that have been presented to date from our smart grid solutions. All of these investments have supported rate base growth of over 7% per year, on average, over the past 20 years in Kentucky. 
As we look forward, we are focused on a number of initiatives, including customer-focused programs, such as our green energy tariff as well as planning for the future investment cycle as it relates to generation resource planning. We'll also be working on updating our integrated resource plan with a new IRP to be filed with the commission in late 2021. We expect the new IRP will provide a better sense of timing for the next wave of capital deployment in Kentucky, related to the replacement of our coal-fired generating fleet.  I'll touch on this further in a few minutes. 
Turning to Slide 10. As the world focuses on climate change, PPL remains committed to advancing a cleaner energy future while maintaining safety, reliability and affordability for those who serve. Today, we are updating our goals to reduce PPL CO2 emission. Specifically, we raised our goal of reducing PPL's carbon emissions to at least 80% from 2010 levels by 2050 from our previous target of 70%. Company also accelerated its previous 2050 target by a decade, and we are now targeting reducing carbon emissions likely 70% by 2040. 
PPL has already reduced its carbon emissions by over 50% since 2010, exiting the competitive generation business in 2015, including nearly 4,000 megawatts of coal-fired generation and retiring 1,200 megawatts of coal in Kentucky. We expect to achieve these further reductions through a variety of actions including replacement of Kentucky coal-fired generation over time with a mix of renewables and natural gas, while meeting our obligations to provide lease cost and reliable service to our Kentucky customers. Our updated targets are based on our ongoing resource planning activities and updated market data and trends in Kentucky. Assuming we received KPSC approval for the previously mentioned renewable PPA and if technology continues to improve and drive down the cost of renewables, it is certainly possible that we can achieve even greater carbon reductions in these targets, while at the same time, ensuring the best value and reliability for our customers. We are confident, however, that these targets are achievable under current legislation and regulation as well as current technology and current economics. 
Turning to Slide 11. We also wanted to provide an overview of the near-term and longer-term opportunities to economically shift our business mix away from coal-fired generation. As you can see from the chart on the left side of the slide, PPL's rate base already consists of more than 80% transmission, distribution and noncoal fired generation. Given that our significant planned investments over the next 5 years are heavily weighted towards additional T&D infrastructure, the percentage of rate base from coal-fired assets is expected to decrease even further in the near term. In fact, only about 5% of our $14 billion capital plan is for investments related to coal-fired generating assets. Our current filed IRP supports the transition to cleaner energy, driven by technology and economics consistent with current policy and regulation. 
As you can see, based on the chart on the right of the slide, based on certain scenarios from our latest IRP filed back in 2018, we could see some additional coal retirements in the back half of the 2020s with significantly more coal retirements in the 2030. These scenarios continue to evolve, and we are starting to see more momentum for renewables in the state, as evidenced by the results of the recent renewable RFP, where we are proposing to economically add a lower cost as available renewable generation resource, while reducing the amount of output from some of our higher cost fossil units. We are not at a point where renewables can compete on a replacement capacity basis, as renewable plus storage options are not even competitive with our peaking gas plant. 
With that said, it is clear that these factors are rapidly changing as we move through time, which requires us to continuously assess the most prudent strategy that's in the best interest of our customers, something we've always demonstrated. 
Moving to Slide 12. We've updated our capital expenditure plan and continue to see significant investment opportunities in our networks over the next 5 years, totaling about $14 billion. We've increased our 2020 and 2021 projections by approximately $200 million each year from our prior estimates, primarily due to additional fluid limitation guidelines spend in Kentucky and a mix of timing-related investments in the U.K. 
Our U.K. capital plan projects that we will be within 1% of our Ofgem approved business plan for ED-1. This will strengthen our credibility with Ofgem when we file our RIIO-ED2 business point. Note that changing the assumed FX rate from $1.40 per pound to $1.30 per pound. And our U.K. spend, reduced the 5-year CapEx projections by about $300 million. We have not included the $300 million Kentucky AMI project in our forecast at this time, but that remains a potential upside opportunity for us as well as the other areas of opportunity noted on the slide, including decarbonization-related spending in the U.K. We believe these additional opportunities could be as much as another $500 million above within the 5-year capital plan. 
Long term, we expect more than an incremental $1 billion of investment to be required over the 5 year RIIO-ED2 period to achieve electrification initiatives based on our initial estimates. As I previously noted, we also believe the transition of our coal-fired generation fleet will be the next significant investment opportunity in Kentucky. While this opportunity is outside of our 5-year capital plan under current scenarios, it's important to remember that this plan reflects assumptions based on today's views of future prices and market conditions, which could rapidly change. What will not change is our commitment to our customers to continue to optimize our fleet and exceed expectations as we lead the evolution of our Kentucky operation, including the transition to less carbon-intensive generation resources. 
So as we look at the diverse portfolio of businesses that we have, it's important to point out that each business is in a different stage of its investment cycle. While U.K. RAV growth has been a strong 5% to 6% in ED-1, we see that growth accelerating into ED-2, beginning in 2023 as we fund the U.K. electrification initiatives. In Kentucky, we see the initial stages of the Kentucky coal generation replacement strategy, likely starting in the mid-2020s, which will begin another period of significant capital investment.  And in Pennsylvania, we are expecting growth to likely slow in the next couple of years, following an extensive period of transmission spending over the last 5 years at almost $700 million per year. 
It's the diversity of our portfolio of businesses combined with our culture of operational excellence and continuous improvement, and we'll continue to deliver long-term value for our shareowners. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe now to cover the financial review. Jeff?"
185508,653004866,1910727,"PPL Corporation, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 14, 2020",2020-02-14,"Earnings Calls","PPL Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a brief financial overview on Slide 14. And while PPL delivered an outstanding quarter of financial performance, earning $0.57 of ongoing earnings per share.

And while PPL delivered an outstanding quarter of financial performance, earning $0.57 of ongoing earnings per share. I'll focus my review this morning on our full year results. We have included a walk in the appendix of today's presentation and our news release for additional details on fourth quarter results. Looking at the full year, we achieved 2019 reported earnings of $2.37 per share compared with $2.58 per share a year ago. Adjusting for special items, primarily reflecting mark-to-market changes related to unrealized foreign currency economic hedges, 2019 earnings from ongoing operations were $2.45 per share, exceeding the midpoint of our forecast by $0.05 per share. This compares to the $2.40 per share that we earned last year, which included significant weather benefits of about $0.08 per share. 
Looking forward to 2020, we announced the formal guidance range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share, which reflects updates for current market conditions and our foreign currency hedge position. We also are updating our 2021 estimates, primarily reflecting changes to foreign currency forecast, which are lower than our prior forecast. 
Let's turn to Slide 15 for an update on our earnings results for the full year. Walking from our 2018 results on the left, we first made weather adjustments for comparability purposes of the underlying businesses. As I mentioned, weather was $0.08 favorable compared to normalized weather results in 2018. 
For 2019, we experienced slightly favorable weather. The net result was a $0.07 per share decline year-over-year across all of our utilities. We also adjust for the effect of dilution. We settled the remaining 43 million shares on our forward equity transaction in November of 2019, which is the primary driver of the $0.10 per share of dilution year-over-year. Segment allocation of pollution is included on the slide for your reference. 
Turning to the individual segment drivers, which exclude the impact of these items, starting with the U.K. Our U.K. regulated segment earned $1.40 per share, a $0.12 year-over-year increase. The increase in the U.K. earnings was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins, primarily driven by higher prices due to the April 1, 2018 and 2019 price increases, partially offset by lower sales volumes and higher pension income. 
In Pennsylvania, we earned $0.62 per share, which was $0.05 higher than our results in 2018. Our Pennsylvania results were primarily driven by higher adjusted gross margins, primarily resulting from returns on additional capital investments in transmission, partially offset by year-over-year differences and reduced income tax rates due to U.S. tax reform. The higher adjusted gross margins were partially offset by higher depreciation expense. 
Turning to our Kentucky regulated segment. We're at $0.59 per share in 2019 and a $0.05 increase over our results 1 year ago. The increase was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins, primarily resulting from higher retail rates effective May 1, 2019 and lower income taxes, primarily due to the Kentucky recycling credit recorded in the second quarter. Partially offsetting these items were higher depreciation expense and higher interest expense due to higher interest rates and increased borrowings. Results in corporate and other were consistent compared to the prior year. The results were primarily driven by higher other income offset by a higher operations and maintenance expense. 
Turning to Slide 16 and our financial outlook for 2020. PPL's growth is underpinned by continued operational excellence and organic investment at our regulated utilities. Walking from our strong 2019 results on the left of the slide, I'll note that weather this past year was not significant compared to our forecast of normal conditions and resulted in only a $0.01 per share adjustment for comparability purposes. We also project dilution of about $0.11 due to the November 2019 settlement of our May 2018 equity forward offering, which increases our 2020 average shares outstanding compared to 2019. The allocations by segment are provided on the slide for your reference. Excluding these 2 factors, we project growth in each of PPL's business segments. The U.K. segment is expected to experience growth, primarily driven by higher base demand revenues due to the annual April 1 increases and expected higher foreign currency exchange rates, reflecting our solid hedge position for 2020. 
These positive drivers in the U.K. are expected to be partially offset by lower revenues from true-up mechanisms related to cost of debt recovery, property taxes and sales volumes totaling about $0.10. Lower pension income, primarily due to the significant decline in discount rates in the U.K. and a combination of other miscellaneous drivers such as higher depreciation, financing cost and taxes. In Pennsylvania, we project an increase driven primarily by higher returns on transmission investments. 
And turning to Kentucky, we project an increase from 2019, driven by higher retail rates, partially offset by higher depreciation expense. In corporate and other, we project improved earnings driven by a number of items, including lower interest expense due to lower short-term debt post the settlement of our equity forward. These drivers result in the midpoint of our guidance range of $2.50 per share. 
Turning to Slide 17. We have also updated our 2021 projections to account for current foreign currency forecasts. Our prior earnings forecast of $2.50 to $2.80 per share reflected a foreign currency range of $1.35 per pound to $1.60 per pound, which was consistent with bank FX forecast at the time we initiated the earnings range. Our updating earnings forecast of $2.40 to $2.60 per share includes an updated foreign currency range of $1.25 to $1.40 per pound, which is below the current forwards and market forecasts. We are using these lower rates for the FX range given the expected near-term volatility as the U.K. works through the Brexit transition period during 2020, and we will be hedging 2021 during this time period. 
The other drivers for 2021 highlighted in our previously announced forecast remained largely unchanged, with rate base still expected to grow at 5% to 6% and our expectation to continue to earn near our allowed returns. Our 2020 and 2021 forecast continue to assume an immaterial amount of equity issuances, as previously indicated. 
Let me provide an update on our foreign currency hedging status, which is on Slide 18. For 2020, we were actively hedging during the fourth quarter and increased our hedge percentage by another 20%, bringing our hedge position to 90% of 2020 forecasted ongoing earnings. The average rate for 2020, reflecting these new hedges is $1.48 per pound. We were able to slightly improve on the average 2020 hedge rates by optimizing our hedge portfolio given the brief uplift in currency rates, following the positive U.K. election outcome and the strength in our 2019 results. We continue to utilize options in our hedging strategy that preserve upside to the current market rates with about 1/3 of the 2020 hedge portfolio being option-based. And for 2021, our hedge position is at 5% of forecasted earnings at an average rate of $1.33 per pound. Again, we expect to continue layering in 2020, 2021 hedges going forward. 
Turning to Slide 19. As we continue our efforts to invest in our networks and earn our authorized returns, we've remained committed to paying dividends to shareholders as we've done over the past century. The January 1 dividend represents the 2906th consecutive quarterly dividend paid to shareowners. As Bill mentioned, we remain committed to dividend growth and today, announced we are raising the annualized dividend to $1.66 per share. We will continue to assess the rate at which we grow the dividend going forward in the context of our yield and payout relative to our peers. 
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back to Bill for some closing comments. Bill?"

Before we open up the call for Q&A, I'd like to take a moment to reflect on what has truly been a remarkable decade for PPL. Over the past 10 years, we've doubled our market cap. We've unfailingly exceeded the midpoint of our earnings forecast. We've grown our dividend 18%. We won 21 J.D. Power awards for customer satisfaction in the U.S. We've consistently ranked highest for customer satisfaction among the network operators in the U.K. We've invested $27 billion to make our network smarter to improve reliability and to advance a cleaner energy future. We've cut average customer interruptions by over 1/3 in the U.K. and by more than 20% in the U.S. since 2010. 
All the while, we've kept electricity costs reasonable for our customers and remained deeply engaged with the communities we serve. And last but not least, we have dramatically transformed PPL. A decade ago, we were primarily a Pennsylvania hybrid utility facing stiff headwinds in competitive markets. Today, we are one of the nation's largest investor-owned utility companies with 100% of its earnings, driven by stable, high-performing regulated businesses. 
In short, we are stronger today than we were a decade ago. We're better positioned to invest in the future. And as we celebrate our centennial, we are poised to power progress for another 100 years. When our directors first met a century ago, they did so at a pivotal time. The country was beginning to move from a patchwork quilt of isolated lighting companies to a coordinated network of regional utilities, power plants and transmission lines. Or in that moment, PPL would help drive that change, extending electricity service throughout the regions we serve, expanding to meet the needs and demands of rapid industrial growth and is helping to improve quality of life for generations of customers. 
Today, we again find ourselves at a pivotal moment for our industry, which is investing in new technologies to reshape not only how we deliver power, but how we produce it as well. 
In this moment, we remain as committed as ever to powering progress to fostering innovation to creating long-term shareowner value and to making a positive impact on society. 
In closing, I'm proud of our past achievements, I'm equally excited about our future, and I'm convinced that PPL's best days are ahead. 
With that, operator, let's open the call for questions, please."

Operationally, when you look at the assumptions behind the 2020, we're largely consistent with the prior forecast. The primary change was really a significant decline in corporate bond rates in the U.K., resulting in some lower discount rates, which had a negative impact on our U.K. pension obligations. Those factors really resulted in about a $0.06 impact compared to our prior plan. But as I mentioned, despite this, we're still in the part of range for 2020.

As you indicated, we have historically been pretty conservative. With our forecast, and we continue to be -- really driven by what we know about current projects, but also what we see as the current kind of FX rate, which, as you know, has been pretty volatile over time.

That's based on our initial estimates going into the electrification initiatives that would be required to be funded by the DNOs. When you look at the process going forward for RIIO 2, right? The sector methodology consultation will be coming out Q2, Q3 of this year -- this is on Slide 28, by the way, in the deck. The methodology decision would be coming out until Q4, then the companies will be submitting our submissions in Q2 of 2021. So to be honest with you, we're going through the process right now on planning for those submissions -- the business plan submissions, while we're consulting with Ofgem on the methodology. And so I think we just need to get through that process a little more Shahriar before we would, I think, update the view of ED or electrification spending going into ED-2. But to your point, I think there certainly could be an opportunity there for incremental capital, especially coming out of what Jonathan really published -- really on his first day on the job with his decarbonization plan.

And I believe that, particularly in the U.K., it's one of the reasons why we continue to have a positive outlook on the U.K. We've weathered probably the strongest of the storm so far, particularly with renationalization threats, which are now, obviously not a threat at all, given the strong election outcome in the U.K. So that risk is now behind us, and we still have the risk of Brexit that's keeping the markets a little bit genre. But beyond that, I think things will stabilize, we'll have a much better view of not only RIIO-ED2, but also where the FX starts to land. 
And I think for the -- going forward setup for the business because I think we're in very good shape."

And I guess one of the points that I took away from all the answers was, clearly, you would look to or at least benefit from reducing the proportion of the U.K. business. So I just wanted to understand, I know that there was a constraint around selling the U.K. business because of tax and the leakage there? If you were to partner up and use that increased size of the company, effectively reducing the proportion of the U.K. business, what kind of constraint should we think about on the tax side or other side that could limit any kind of strategic decisions around that decision?"

So I think with where we are today that strategic decision continues to be a big challenge for us. In terms of where the renationalization risk being removed, clearly, you've seen the values of the U.K. utilities move up significantly after the election. And we still have what we believe is one of the strongest, if not the strongest distributor network and operator in the U.K. So we believe, on its own, its values increased.

The team is working through our business plan submission and that will be filed mid-2021 as part of the RIIO 2 process.

We think we have enough leeway within the existing plan that we would be able to divert some spending towards that. Therefore, it wouldn't be a drag on the returns because, as you know, the revenues are kind of set for the ED-1 period. So we would have to basically shift capital away from other things to EDs. We have innovation capital, other things that I would say are placeholders that we could redeploy there.

We're pleased that you've joined us for our 2019 year-end earnings call. With me today are Vince Sorgi, PPL, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Joe Bergstein, Chief Financial Officer.Moving to Slide 3",1010,"Thank you, Andy, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased that you've joined us for our 2019 year-end earnings call. With me today are Vince Sorgi, PPL, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Joe Bergstein, Chief Financial Officer.
Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda this morning begins with an overview of 2019 results and PPL's business outlook for 2020. Vince will then review some of PPL's recent operational highlights and outlook for 2020 as well as discuss PPL's clean energy transition strategy, including our decision to set a more aggressive goal to reduce PPL's carbon emissions. Following Vince's remarks, Joe will provide a more detailed financial review of 2019 and 2020, along with our updated earnings forecast for 2021.
I'll conclude by taking a few moments to highlight what has truly been a decade of transformation and growth for PPL. And PPL is marking its 100th anniversary, thanks to our employees' hard work and dedication and the unparalleled support of our communities. As always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions.
Turning to Slide 4. In 2019, PPL continues to deliver on its commitments to shareowners, customers and the communities we serve. We remain steadfast in our strategy to deliver best-in-sector operational performance, invest in a sustainable energy future, provide superior customer service, maintain a strong financial foundation and engage and develop our people.
Our results in 2019 reflect this strategy. We exceeded the midpoint of our earnings guidance for the 10th straight year. Delivering ongoing earnings of $2.45 per share. We remain committed to dividend growth, increasing our dividend for the 17th time in 18 years and returning more than $1 billion in dividends to shareowners. As we delivered on these financial commitments, we continued to extend our track record of operational excellence.
We maintained strong transmission and distribution reliability across all of our utilities. In addition, we achieved top-decile generation reliability in Kentucky. At the same time, we remain as focused as ever on providing superior customer service. In fact, our utilities remain among the very best for customer satisfaction in the regions we serve. Our U.S. utilities earned 4 J.D. Power awards for customer satisfaction, raising their combined total to 51, since J.D. Power began assessing utility customer satisfaction in 1999. Meanwhile, our U.K. utilities all achieved a 9 out of 10 rating in Ofgem's broad measure of customer satisfaction review. In addition, Western Power Distribution earned the U.K.'s customer service excellence award for the 27th consecutive year. The company was also ranked by the industry regulator as best in stakeholder engagement and support for vulnerable customers for the eighth straight year. These achievements and more reflect our shared values and common purpose across PPL to deliver without fail for our customers to exceed their expectations and to continuously improve.
Aware of the tremendous opportunity we have to make a positive impact on society, not only today, but for years to come, PPL also invested more than $3 billion in infrastructure improvements. Our continued investments are aimed at strengthening grid resiliency in the face of worsening storms, incorporating automation, replacing and rebuilding power lines and substations and reshaping electricity networks to support the growth of renewables and other distributed energy resources.
In regulatory matters, we remain focused in 2019 on achieving balanced regulatory outcomes that will benefit our customers and our shareowners. In Kentucky, we received public service commission approval of a combined $187 million revenue increase, which supports additional improvements to the grid, our natural gas lines and our generation fleet. New rates took effect May 1.
And in the U.K., we continued to actively engage with Ofgem to advance a balanced regulatory framework that will provide real value to customers, support the U.K.'s electrification and decarbonization initiatives and provide fair and reasonable returns to investors when the next price control review period begins in 2023. Our engagement over the past year included meeting with Ofgem leadership and submitting responses to Ofgem's open letter consultation on behalf of both PPL and WPD, including our shareowners.
I'll note that the RIIO-ED2 framework released by Ofgem in December was largely in line with our expectations. In summary, we're proud of our many achievements over the past year on behalf of PPL shareowners and customers. Our performance is reflected in the numerous awards received throughout the year. Looking ahead, we're committed to building on this momentum and adding to our long-term track record of financial and operational excellence.
Now turning to Slide 5 and our 2020 outlook. Today, we initiated formal 2020 earnings guidance of $2.40 per share to $2.60 per share. This reflects our updated foreign currency hedge position, which we increased following the U.K. election that finally led to Brexit last month. Given the election result, we expect the U.K. business climate to remain strong as it has historically been.
Turning to our dividend. Today, we announced we are raising the annualized dividend to $1.66 per share. The increase announced today represents our 18th dividend increase in the last 19 years, and we remained committed to dividend growth. In terms of network investment in 2020, we plan to invest an additional $3.3 billion in all of our utilities. These investments will continue to support our efforts to improve customer experience and grid resiliency and advance a cleaner energy future.
Finally, as I touched upon earlier, we will remain engaged on the regulatory front to achieve balanced outcomes that benefit customers and shareowners. Last week, the new CEO of Ofgem, Jonathan Brearley, announced his decarbonization program action plan. Ofgem's plan over the next 18 months to make low-cost decarbonization a reality shows that the DNOs will play a critical role in the significant investment required to deliver clean energy and the U.K.'s net 0 carbon emissions target by the year 2050. This supports what we've been saying that we see real long-term growth opportunities with our WPD business as the DNOs lead many of the decarbonization initiatives that will enable a net 0 carbon economy.
I'll now turn the call over to Vince for an operational update. Vince?"

As we turn to a new year and a new decade, I just want to express how proud I am and the operational excellence that our 7 utilities continue to deliver for our customers. Our sector continues to rapidly evolve, and our teams are meeting the challenges and finding opportunities to leverage technological advancements and decarbonization initiatives that are driving real value for our customers.
We believe that PPL is well positioned to further enhance its networks and continue to build these utilities of the future as we look ahead. I'd like to highlight some of the operational developments from this past year and briefly discuss our strategic priorities for each segment for 2020 and beyond. I'll also provide an update on our 5-year capital expenditure plan.
Turning to Slide 7. Starting with the U.K., during 2019, WPD continued to demonstrate its leadership in support of the U.K.'s decarbonization goals. WPD was the first U.K. network operator to publish an electric vehicle strategy, building on knowledge gaining through the company's Electric Nation EV Smart Charging initiative. The company has begun to proactively ready its network for increasing numbers of electric vehicles, anticipating the potential for up to 3 million EVs in our service territory by 2030. WPD also continues to deliver an industry-leading innovation program, including finding ways to connect more distributed generation to local networks.
Through 2019, WPD connected nearly 10 gigawatts of distributed generation to its network, about 6 gigawatts of which was renewable energy. In addition, WPD is leading the way in developing markets for flexibility services and demand response solutions to help maintain grid resiliency and control costs to U.K. customers. These flexibility solution should enable the deferral of some network spend, which Ofgem is keen to see the DNOs deliver. As we look to the upcoming year, it's important to review how we are performing against our RIIO-ED1 business plan, and I'm proud to say that WPD continues to perform extremely well in RIIO-ED1. In the most recent Ofgem annual report for electric distribution, WPD ranked first in customer satisfaction and customer minutes lost and ranked second in time to connect customers. Our returns are middle of the pack with an RORE expectation of 8.4% on a real basis over the ED1 period. I'll note that this equates to a nominal RORE of about 11% when including RPI inflation. As we've indicated in the past, as the only fast track company in RIIO-ED1, we think the fact that we are the top-performing DNO group in the sector and only earning average returns will serve us well going into RIIO-ED2.
Our strategic priorities moving forward are to continue this high level of performance and continue our engagement with Ofgem to help develop the sector-specific methodology. Our objective is to ensure RIIO-ED2 provides the appropriate incentives for DNOs to deliver on the initiatives required to achieve net 0 carbon emissions by 2050.
Turning to Slide 8. In Pennsylvania, PPL Electric Utilities continued to demonstrate its leadership in the deployment of smart grid solutions. We currently have 4,500 smart switches installed on our grid. Since 2015, this technology has helped us eliminate over 900,000 outages for our customers.
As we've discussed during the year, PPL Electric has received numerous awards this year for its operational excellence and commitment to innovation including the deployment of a new distributed energy resource management system or DERMS and the development of groundbreaking technology that safely and automatically cuts power to down power lines, protecting the public, first responders and our employees.
In addition, PPL Electric Utilities was awarded the most improved utility of the decade by PA Consulting. The company is also substantially complete with the multiyear nearly $500 million project to install 1.4 million advanced meters for our customers.
Looking ahead, for 2020, we remain focused on executing on our substantial electric transmission and distribution investment plan. 
The majority of the spend this year remains in our transmission business, which has been the fastest-growing business in our portfolio for a number of years now due to the ongoing needs to upgrade and modernize our transmission system. This includes upgrading transmission lines at substations, replacing wood poles with steel poles and building new substations.
We've also invested considerably in our distribution network, also adding smart grid devices to the network, hardening the system, targeting our tree-trimming efforts and investing in new systems to automate how the network is controlled. This investment has also resulted in significant reductions in the number of end-duration of outages for our customers. Going forward, we'll continue to deploy digital and cloud-based technology solutions to further automate the system to improve service even further for our customers.
From a rates perspective, our retail rates continue to remain competitive in the Mid-Atlantic region, thanks to our ongoing emphasis on integrating technology and efficiently managing costs, especially since we haven't had a base rate case since 2016.
Over the past decade, we've held our operating costs of less than a 1% increase on average each year. We'll look to continue our efforts in this area as we don't expect another rate case to be effective within the earnings guidance period.
Moving to Kentucky on Slide 9, Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities continued to make progress on a multiyear $800 million project at cap and close ash ponds at our coal-fired power plant. Overall, we are about 80% complete with the cap and closure program. We also retired 272 megawatts of coal-fired generation at our E.W. Brown facility, raising the amount of retired coal generation to nearly 1,200 megawatts since 2010.
In addition, we secured Public Service Commission approval of a green energy tariff for businesses and continued to enhance our solar offerings for all of our customers. We completed construction of the first phase of our subscription-based solar share program, and we have fully subscribed the second phase with construction expected to be completed in Q2 of this year.
Following up on a renewable energy RFP conducted in 2019. In January, we requested approval of contracts to supply an additional 100 megawatts of as-available solar power to Kentucky customers. As we move into 2020, we see a balanced mix of investment across our Kentucky Utilities. Over the past decade, we've had a significant portion of our capital devoted to improving the environmental profile of our generating units, which has supported reductions of SO2 and NOx emissions by approximately 90% and 80%, respectively. We'll be completing the majority of these environmental projects to comply with current regulations within the next couple of years.
As the environmental capital requirements have begun to decline, we've been able to deploy capital to improving our electric and gas P&B networks with a focus on system reliability and automation that are already delivering real value for our customers as evidenced by 120,000 interruptions that have been prevented to date from our Smart Grid solutions. All of these investments have supported rate base growth of over 7% per year, on average, over the past 20 years in Kentucky.
As we look forward, we are focused on a number of initiatives, including customer-focused programs, such as our green energy tariff as well as planning for the future investment cycle as it relates to generation resource planning. We'll also be working on updating our integrated resource plan with a new IRP to be filed with the commission in late 2021. We expect the new IRP will provide a better sense of timing for the next wave of capital deployment in Kentucky, related to the replacement of our coal-fired generating fleet. I'll touch on this further in a few minutes.
Turning to Slide 10. As the world focuses on climate change, PPL remains committed to advancing a cleaner energy future while maintaining safety, reliability and affordability for those who serve. Today, we are updating our goals to reduce PPL CO2 emission. Specifically, we raised our goal of reducing PPL's carbon emissions to at least 80% from 2010 levels by 2050 from our previous target of 70%. Company also accelerated its previous 2050 target by a decade, and we are now targeting reducing carbon emissions likely 70% by 2040. 
PPL has already reduced its carbon emissions by over 50% since 2010, exiting the competitive generation business in 2015, including nearly 4,000 megawatts of coal-fired generation and retiring 1,200 megawatts of coal in Kentucky. We expect to achieve these further reductions through a variety of actions including replacement of Kentucky coal-fired generation over time with a mix of renewables and natural gas, while meeting our obligations to provide lease cost and reliable service to our Kentucky customers. Our updated targets are based on our ongoing resource planning activities and updated market data and trends in Kentucky. Assuming we receive KPSC approval for the previously mentioned renewable PPA and if technology continues to improve and drive down the cost of renewables, it is certainly possible that we can achieve even greater carbon reductions in these targets, while at the same time, ensuring the best value and reliability for our customers. We are confident, however, that these targets are achievable under current legislation and regulation as well as current technology and current economics. 
Turning to Slide 11. We also wanted to provide an overview of the near-term and longer-term opportunities to economically shift our business mix away from coal-fired generation. As you can see from the chart on the left side of the slide, PPL's rate base already consists of more than 80% transmission, distribution and noncoal-fired generation. Given that our significant planned investments over the next 5 years are heavily weighted towards additional T&D infrastructure, the percentage of rate base from coal-fired assets is expected to decrease even further in the near term. In fact, only about 5% of our 17 -- of our $14 billion capital plan is for investments related to coal-fired generating assets. Our current filed IRP supports the transition to cleaner energy, driven by technology and economics consistent with current policy and regulation.
As you can see, based on the chart on the right of the slide, based on certain scenarios from our latest IRP filed back in 2018, we could see some additional coal retirements in the back half of the 2020s with significantly more coal retirements in the 2030. These scenarios continue to evolve, and we are starting to see more momentum for renewables in the state, as evidenced by the results of the recent renewable RFP, where we are proposing to economically add a lower cost as available renewable generation resource, while reducing the amount of output from some of our higher cost fossil units. We are not at a point where renewables can compete on a replacement capacity basis, as renewable plus storage options are not even competitive with our peaking gas plant.
With that said, it is clear that these factors are rapidly changing as we move through time, which requires us to continuously assess the most prudent strategy that's in the best interest of our customers, something we've always demonstrated.
Moving to Slide 12. We've updated our capital expenditure plan and continue to see significant investment opportunities in our networks over the next 5 years, totaling about $14 billion. We've increased our 2020 and 2021 projections by approximately $200 million each year from our prior estimates, primarily due to additional fluid limitation guidelines spend in Kentucky and a mix of timing-related investments in the U.K.
Our U.K. capital plan projects that we will be within 1% of our Ofgem-approved business plan for ED1. This will strengthen our credibility with Ofgem when we file our RIIO-ED2 business point. Note that changing the assumed FX rate from $1.40 per pound to $1.30 per pound on our U.K. spend, reduced the 5-year CapEx projections by about $300 million. We have not included the $300 million Kentucky AMI project in our forecast at this time, but that remains a potential upside opportunity for us as well as the other areas of opportunity noted on the slide, including decarbonization-related spending in the U.K. We believe these additional opportunities could be as much as another $500 million above within the 5-year capital plan.
Long term, we expect more than an incremental $1 billion of investment to be required over the 5 year RIIO-ED2 period to achieve electrification initiatives based on our initial estimates. As I previously noted, we also believe the transition of our coal-fired generation fleet will be the next significant investment opportunity in Kentucky. While this opportunity is outside of our 5-year capital plan under current scenarios, it's important to remember that this plan reflects assumptions based on today's views of future prices and market conditions, which could rapidly change. What will not change is our commitment to our customers to continue to optimize our fleet and exceed expectations as we lead the evolution of our Kentucky operation, including the transition to less carbon-intensive generation resources. 
So as we look at the diverse portfolio of businesses that we have, it's important to point out that each business is in a different stage of its investment cycle. While U.K. RAV growth has been a strong 5% to 6% in ED1, we see that growth accelerating into ED2, beginning in 2023 as we fund the U.K. electrification initiatives. In Kentucky, we see the initial stages of the Kentucky coal generation replacement strategy, likely starting in the mid-2020s, which will begin another period of significant capital investment. And in Pennsylvania, we are expecting growth to likely slow in the next couple of years, following an extensive period of transmission spending over the last 5 years at almost $700 million per year.
It's the diversity of our portfolio of businesses combined with our culture of operational excellence and continuous improvement, and we'll continue to deliver long-term value for our shareowners.
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe now to cover the financial review. Joe?"
185508,653004866,1911006,"PPL Corporation, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 14, 2020",2020-02-14,"Earnings Calls","PPL Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a brief financial overview on Slide 14. And while PPL delivered an outstanding quarter of financial performance, earning $0.57 of ongoing earnings per share, I'll focus my review this morning on o",1294,"Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a brief financial overview on Slide 14. And while PPL delivered an outstanding quarter of financial performance, earning $0.57 of ongoing earnings per share, I'll focus my review this morning on our full year results.
We have included a walk in the appendix of today's presentation and our news release for additional details on fourth quarter results. Looking at the full year, we achieved 2019 reported earnings of $2.37 per share compared with $2.58 per share a year ago. Adjusting for special items, primarily reflecting mark-to-market changes related to unrealized foreign currency economic hedges, 2019 earnings from ongoing operations were $2.45 per share, exceeding the midpoint of our forecast by $0.05 per share. This compares to the $2.40 per share that we earned last year, which included significant weather benefits of about $0.08 per share. 
Looking forward to 2020, we announced the formal guidance range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share, which reflects updates for current market conditions and our foreign currency hedge position. We also are updating our 2021 estimates, primarily reflecting changes to foreign currency forecast, which are lower than our prior forecast.
Let's turn to Slide 15 for an update on our earnings results for the full year. Walking from our 2018 results on the left, we first made weather adjustments for comparability purposes of the underlying businesses. As I mentioned, weather was $0.08 favorable compared to normalized weather results in 2018.
For 2019, we experienced slightly favorable weather. The net result was a $0.07 per share decline year-over-year across all of our utilities. We also adjust for the effect of dilution. We settled the remaining 43 million shares on our forward equity transaction in November of 2019, which is the primary driver of the $0.10 per share of dilution year-over-year. Segment allocation of pollution is included on the slide for your reference.
Turning to the individual segment drivers, which exclude the impact of these items, starting with the U.K. Our U.K. regulated segment earned $1.40 per share, a $0.12 year-over-year increase. The increase in the U.K. earnings was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins, primarily driven by higher prices due to the April 1, 2018 and 2019 price increases, partially offset by lower sales volumes and higher pension income. 
In Pennsylvania, we earned $0.62 per share, which was $0.05 higher than our results in 2018. Our Pennsylvania results were primarily driven by higher adjusted gross margins, primarily resulting from returns on additional capital investments in transmission, partially offset by year-over-year differences and reduced income tax rates due to U.S. tax reform. The higher adjusted gross margins were partially offset by higher depreciation expense. 
Turning to our Kentucky-regulated segment. We're at $0.59 per share in 2019, a $0.05 increase over our results 1 year ago. The increase was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins, primarily resulting from higher retail rates effective May 1, 2019, and lower income taxes, primarily due to the Kentucky recycling credit recorded in the second quarter. Partially offsetting these items were higher depreciation expense and higher interest expense due to higher interest rates and increased borrowings. Results in corporate and other were consistent compared to the prior year. The results were primarily driven by higher other income offset by higher operations and maintenance expense.
Turning to Slide 16 and our financial outlook for 2020. PPL's growth is underpinned by continued operational excellence and organic investment at our regulated utilities. Walking from our strong 2019 results on the left of the slide, I'll note that weather this past year was not significant compared to our forecast of normal conditions and resulted in only a $0.01 per share adjustment for comparability purposes. We also project dilution of about $0.11 due to the November 2019 settlement of our May 2018 equity forward offering, which increases our 2020 average shares outstanding compared to 2019. The allocations by segment are provided on the slide for your reference. Excluding these 2 factors, we project growth in each of PPL's business segments. The U.K. segment is expected to experience growth, primarily driven by higher base demand revenues due to the annual April 1 increases and expected higher foreign currency exchange rates, reflecting our solid hedge position for 2020.
These positive drivers in the U.K. are expected to be partially offset by lower revenues from true-up mechanisms related to cost of debt recovery, property taxes and sales volumes totaling about $0.10. Lower pension income, primarily due to the significant decline in discount rates in the U.K. and a combination of other miscellaneous drivers such as higher depreciation, financing cost and taxes. In Pennsylvania, we project an increase driven primarily by higher returns on transmission investments. 
And turning to Kentucky, we project an increase from 2019, driven by higher retail rates, partially offset by higher depreciation expense. In corporate and other, we project improved earnings driven by a number of items, including lower interest expense due to lower short-term debt post the settlement of our equity forward. These drivers result in the midpoint of our guidance range of $2.50 per share.
Turning to Slide 17. We have also updated our 2021 projections to account for current foreign currency forecasts. Our prior earnings forecast of $2.50 to $2.80 per share reflected a foreign currency range of $1.35 per pound to $1.60 per pound, which was consistent with bank FX forecast at the time we initiated the earnings range. Our updating earnings forecast of $2.40 to $2.60 per share includes an updated foreign currency range of $1.25 to $1.40 per pound, which is below the current forwards and market forecasts. We are using these lower rates for the FX range given the expected near-term volatility as the U.K. works through the Brexit transition period during 2020, and we will be hedging 2021 during this time period.
The other drivers for 2021 highlighted in our previously announced forecast remained largely unchanged, with rate base still expected to grow at 5% to 6% and our expectation to continue to earn near our allowed returns. Our 2020 and 2021 forecast continue to assume an immaterial amount of equity issuances, as previously indicated.
Let me provide an update on our foreign currency hedging status, which is on Slide 18. For 2020, we were actively hedging during the fourth quarter and increased our hedge percentage by another 20%, bringing our hedge position to 90% of 2020 forecasted ongoing earnings. The average rate for 2020, reflecting these new hedges is $1.48 per pound. We were able to slightly improve on the average 2020 hedge rates by optimizing our hedge portfolio given the brief uplift in currency rates, following the positive U.K. election outcome and the strength in our 2019 results. We continue to utilize options in our hedging strategy that preserve upside to the current market rates with about 1/3 of the 2020 hedge portfolio being option-based. And for 2021, our hedge position is at 5% of forecasted earnings at an average rate of $1.33 per pound. Again, we expect to continue layering in 2020, 2021 hedges going forward.
Turning to Slide 19. As we continue our efforts to invest in our networks and earn our authorized returns, we remain committed to paying dividends to shareholders as we've done over the past century. The January 1 dividend represents the 296th consecutive quarterly dividend paid to shareowners. As Bill mentioned, we remain committed to dividend growth and today, announced we are raising the annualized dividend to $1.66 per share. We will continue to assess the rate at which we grow the dividend going forward in the context of our yield and payout relative to our peers.
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back to Bill for some closing comments. Bill?"

Before we open up the call for Q&A, I'd like to take a moment to reflect on what has truly been a remarkable decade for PPL. Over the past 10 years, we've doubled our market cap. We've unfailingly exceeded the midpoint of our earnings forecast. We've grown our dividend 18%. We won 21 J.D. Power awards for customer satisfaction in the U.S. We've consistently ranked highest for customer satisfaction among the network operators in the U.K. We've invested $27 billion to make our network smarter to improve reliability and to advance a cleaner energy future. We've cut average customer interruptions by over 1/3 in the U.K. and by more than 20% in the U.S. since 2010.
All the while, we've kept electricity costs reasonable for our customers and remained deeply engaged with the communities we serve. And last but not least, we have dramatically transformed PPL. A decade ago, we were primarily a Pennsylvania hybrid utility facing stiff headwinds in competitive markets. Today, we are one of the nation's largest investor-owned utility companies with 100% of its earnings, driven by stable, high-performing regulated businesses.
In short, we are stronger today than we were a decade ago. We're better positioned to invest in the future. And as we celebrate our centennial, we are poised to power progress for another 100 years. When our directors first met a century ago, they did so at a pivotal time. The country was beginning to move from a patchwork quilt of isolated lighting companies to a coordinated network of regional utilities, power plants and transmission lines. Born in that moment, PPL would help drive that change, extending electricity service throughout the regions we serve, expanding to meet the needs and demands of a rapid industrial growth and is helping to improve quality of life for generations of customers.
Today, we again find ourselves at a pivotal moment for our industry, which is investing in new technologies to reshape not only how we deliver power, but how we produce it as well.
In this moment, we remain as committed as ever to powering progress to fostering innovation to creating long-term shareowner value and to making a positive impact on society.
In closing, I'm proud of our past achievements, I'm equally excited about our future, and I'm convinced that PPL's best days are ahead.

Operationally, when you look at the assumptions behind the 2020 were largely consistent with the prior forecast. The primary change was really a significant decline in corporate bond rates in the U.K., resulting in some lower discount rates, which had a negative impact on our U.K. pension obligations.

As you indicated, we have historically been pretty conservative with our forecast, and we continue to be -- really driven by what we know about current projects, but also what we see as the current kind of FX rate, which, as you know, has been pretty volatile over time.

The sector methodology consultation will be coming out Q2, Q3 of this year -- this is on Slide 28, by the way, in the deck. The methodology decision would be coming out until Q4, then the companies will be submitting our submissions in Q2 of 2021. So to be honest with you, we're going through the process right now on planning for those submissions -- the business plan submissions, while we're consulting with Ofgem on the methodology. And so I think we just need to get through that process a little more Shar before we would, I think, update the view of EV or electrification spending going into ED2. But to your point, I think there certainly could be an opportunity there for incremental capital, especially coming out of what Jonathan Brearley published really on his first day on the job with his decarbonization plan.

Is there anything else we should be thinking about around the rate-based growth profile as you think about the different segments?"

I think the biggest decrease is really in the Kentucky operation, we're only projecting a 1.5% growth much about or much because of the reasons that Vince articulated in his opening remarks. And in PI transmission, that's really been probably the larger decrease when you look at the overall mix, because for a period of time, we're growing double-digit there. And then on the distribution side, I think it's been fairly consistent in the 4% to 6%. So I think the 2 big changes are lower in Kentucky and lower on the Pennsylvania transmission side."

We think we have enough leeway within the existing plan that we would be able to divert some spending towards that. Therefore, it wouldn't be a drag on the returns because, as you know, the revenues are kind of set for the ED1 period. So we would have to basically shift capital away from other things to EDs. We have innovation capital, other things that I would say are placeholders that we could redeploy there.

We're pleased that you've joined us for our 2019 year-end earnings call. With me today are Vince Sorgi, PPL, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Joe Bergstein, Chief Financial Officer.
Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda this morning begins with an overview of 2019 results and PPL's business outlook for 2020. Vince will then review some of PPL's recent operational highlights and outlook for 2020 as well as discuss PPL's clean energy transition strategy, including our decision to set a more aggressive goal to reduce PPL's carbon emissions. Following Vince's remarks, Joe will provide a more detailed financial review of 2019 and 2020, along with our updated earnings forecast for 2021.
I'll conclude by taking a few moments to highlight what has truly been a decade of transformation and growth for PPL. And PPL is marking its 100th anniversary, thanks to our employees' hard work and dedication and the unparalleled support of our communities. As always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions.
Turning to Slide 4. In 2019, PPL continued to deliver on its commitments to shareowners, customers and the communities we serve. We remain steadfast in our strategy to deliver best-in-sector operational performance, invest in a sustainable energy future, provide superior customer service, maintain a strong financial foundation, and engage and develop our people.
Our results in 2019 reflect this strategy. We exceeded the midpoint of our earnings guidance for the 10th straight year. Delivering ongoing earnings of $2.45 per share. We remain committed to dividend growth, increasing our dividend for the 17th time in 18 years and returning more than $1 billion in dividends to shareowners. As we delivered on these financial commitments, we continued to extend our track record of operational excellence.
We maintained strong transmission and distribution reliability across all of our utilities. In addition, we achieved top-decile generation reliability in Kentucky. At the same time, we remain as focused as ever on providing superior customer service. In fact, our utilities remain among the very best for customer satisfaction in the regions we serve. Our U.S. utilities earned 4 J.D. Power awards for customer satisfaction, raising our combined total to 51, since J.D. Power began assessing utility customer satisfaction in 1999. Meanwhile, our U.K. utilities all achieved a 9 out of 10 rating in Ofgem's Broad Measure of Customer Satisfaction review. In addition, Western Power Distribution earned the U.K.'s customer service excellence award for the 27th consecutive year. The company was also ranked by the industry regulator as best in stakeholder engagement and support for vulnerable customers for the eighth straight year. These achievements and more reflect our shared values and common purpose across PPL to deliver without fail for our customers, to exceed their expectations and to continuously improve.
Aware of the tremendous opportunity we have to make a positive impact on society, not only today, but for years to come, PPL also invested more than $3 billion in infrastructure improvements. Our continued investments are aimed at strengthening grid resiliency in the face of worsening storms, incorporating automation, replacing and rebuilding power lines and substations and reshaping electricity networks to support the growth of renewables and other distributed energy resources.
In regulatory matters, we remain focused in 2019 on achieving balanced regulatory outcomes that will benefit our customers and our shareowners. In Kentucky, we received Public Service Commission approval of a combined $187 million revenue increase, which supports additional improvements to the grid, our natural gas lines and our generation fleet. New rates took effect May 1.
And in the U.K., we continued to actively engage with Ofgem to advance a balanced regulatory framework that will provide real value to customers, support the U.K.'s electrification and decarbonization initiatives and provide fair and reasonable returns to investors when the next price control review period begins in 2023. Our engagement over the past year included meeting with Ofgem leadership and submitting responses to Ofgem's open letter consultation on behalf of both PPL and WPD, including our shareowners.
I'll note that the RIIO-ED2 framework released by Ofgem in December was largely in line with our expectations. In summary, we're proud of our many achievements over the past year on behalf of PPL shareowners and customers. Our performance is reflected in the numerous awards received throughout the year. Looking ahead, we're committed to building on this momentum and adding to our long-term track record of financial and operational excellence.
Now turning to Slide 5 and our 2020 outlook. Today, we initiated formal 2020 earnings guidance of $2.40 per share to $2.60 per share. This reflects our updated foreign currency hedge position, which we increased following the U.K. election that finally led to Brexit last month. Given the election result, we expect the U.K. business climate to remain strong as it has historically been.
Turning to our dividend. Today, we announced we are raising the annualized dividend to $1.66 per share. The increase announced today represents our 18th dividend increase in the last 19 years, and we remained committed to dividend growth. In terms of network investment in 2020, we plan to invest an additional $3.3 billion in all of our utilities. These investments will continue to support our efforts to improve customer experience and grid resiliency and advance a cleaner energy future.
Finally, as I touched upon earlier, we will remain engaged on the regulatory front to achieve balanced outcomes that benefit customers and shareowners. Last week, the new CEO of Ofgem, Jonathan Brearley, announced his decarbonization program action plan. Ofgem's plan over the next 18 months to make low-cost decarbonization a reality shows that the DNOs will play a critical role in the significant investment required to deliver clean energy and the U.K.'s net 0 carbon emissions target by the year 2050. This supports what we've been saying that we see real long-term growth opportunities with our WPD business as the DNOs lead many of the decarbonization initiatives that will enable a net 0 carbon economy.
I'll now turn the call over to Vince for an operational update. Vince?"

As we turn to a new year and a new decade, I just want to express how proud I am of the operational excellence that our 7 utilities continue to deliver for our customers. Our sector continues to rapidly evolve, and our teams are meeting the challenges and finding opportunities to leverage technological advancements and decarbonization initiatives that are driving real value for our customers.
We believe that PPL is well positioned to further enhance its networks and continue to build these utilities of the future as we look ahead. I'd like to highlight some of the operational developments from this past year and briefly discuss our strategic priorities for each segment for 2020 and beyond. I'll also provide an update on our 5-year capital expenditure plan.
Turning to Slide 7. Starting with the U.K., during 2019, WPD continued to demonstrate its leadership in support of the U.K.'s decarbonization goals. WPD was the first U.K. network operator to publish an electric vehicle strategy, building on knowledge gained through the company's Electric Nation EV Smart Charging initiative. The company has begun to proactively ready its network for increasing numbers of electric vehicles, anticipating the potential for up to 3 million EVs in our service territory by 2030. WPD also continues to deliver an industry-leading innovation program, including finding ways to connect more distributed generation to local networks.
Through 2019, WPD connected nearly 10 gigawatts of distributed generation to its network, about 6 gigawatts of which was renewable energy. In addition, WPD is leading the way in developing markets for flexibility services and demand response solutions to help maintain grid resiliency and control costs to the U.K. customers. These flexibility solution should enable the deferral of some network spend, which Ofgem is keen to see the DNOs deliver. As we look to the upcoming year, it's important to review how we are performing against our RIIO-ED1 business plan, and I'm proud to say that WPD continues to perform extremely well in RIIO-ED1. In the most recent Ofgem annual report for electric distribution, WPD ranked first in customer satisfaction and customer minutes lost and ranked second in time to connect customers. Our returns are middle of the pack with an RORE expectation of 8.4% on a real basis over the ED1 period. I'll note that this equates to a nominal RORE of about 11% when including RPI inflation. As we've indicated in the past, as the only fast track company in RIIO-ED1, we think the fact that we are the top-performing DNO group in the sector and only earning average returns will serve us well going into RIIO-ED2.
Our strategic priorities moving forward are to continue this high level of performance and continue our engagement with Ofgem to help develop the sector-specific methodology. Our objective is to ensure RIIO-ED2 provides the appropriate incentives for DNOs to deliver on the initiatives required to achieve net 0 carbon emissions by 2050.
Turning to Slide 8. In Pennsylvania, PPL Electric Utilities continued to demonstrate its leadership in the deployment of smart grid solutions. We currently have 4,500 smart switches installed on our grid. Since 2015, this technology has helped us eliminate over 900,000 outages for our customers.
As we've discussed during the year, PPL electric has received numerous awards this year for its operational excellence and commitment to innovation including the deployment of a new distributed energy resource management system or DERMS and the development of groundbreaking technology that safely and automatically cuts power to downed power lines, protecting the public, first responders and our employees.
In addition, PPL Electric Utilities was awarded the most improved utility of the decade by PA Consulting. The company is also substantially complete with the multiyear nearly $500 million project to install 1.4 million advanced meters for our customers.
Looking ahead, for 2020, we remain focused on executing on our substantial electric transmission and distribution investment plan. 
The majority of the spend this year remains in our transmission business, which has been the fastest-growing business in our portfolio for a number of years now due to the ongoing needs to upgrade and modernize our transmission system. This includes upgrading transmission lines and substations, replacing wood poles with steel poles and building new substations.
We've also invested considerably in our distribution network, also adding smart grid devices to the network, hardening the system, targeting our tree-trimming efforts and investing in new systems to automate how the network is controlled. This investment has also resulted in significant reductions in the number of and duration of outages for our customers. Going forward, we'll continue to deploy digital and cloud-based technology solutions to further automate the system to improve service even further for our customers.
From a rates perspective, our retail rates continue to remain competitive in the Mid-Atlantic region, thanks to our ongoing emphasis on integrating technology and efficiently managing costs, especially since we haven't had a base rate case since 2016.
Over the past decade, we've held our operating costs to less than a 1% increase on average each year. We'll look to continue our efforts in this area as we don't expect another rate case to be effective within the earnings guidance period.
Moving to Kentucky on Slide 9, Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities continued to make progress on a multiyear $800 million project at cap and close ash ponds at our coal-fired power plant. Overall, we are about 80% complete with the cap and closure program. We also retired 272 megawatts of coal-fired generation at our E.W. Brown facility, raising the amount of retired coal generation to nearly 1,200 megawatts since 2010.
In addition, we secured Public Service Commission approval of a green energy tariff for businesses and continued to enhance our solar offerings for all of our customers. We completed construction of the first phase of our subscription-based Solar Share program, and we have fully subscribed the second phase with construction expected to be completed in Q2 of this year.
Following up on a renewable energy RFP conducted in 2019. In January, we requested approval of contracts to supply an additional 100 megawatts of as-available solar power to Kentucky customers. As we move into 2020, we see a balanced mix of investment across our Kentucky utilities. Over the past decade, we've had a significant portion of our capital devoted to improving the environmental profile of our generating units, which has supported reductions of SO2 and NOx emissions by approximately 90% and 80%, respectively. We'll be completing the majority of these environmental projects to comply with current regulations within the next couple of years.
As the environmental capital requirements have begun to decline, we've been able to deploy capital to improving our electric and gas T&D networks with a focus on system reliability and automation that are already delivering real value for our customers as evidenced by 120,000 interruptions that have been prevented to date from our smart grid solutions. All of these investments have supported rate base growth of over 7% per year, on average, over the past 20 years in Kentucky.
As we look forward, we are focused on a number of initiatives, including customer-focused programs, such as our green energy tariff as well as planning for the future investment cycle as it relates to generation resource planning. We'll also be working on updating our integrated resource plan with a new IRP to be filed with the commission in late 2021. We expect the new IRP will provide a better sense of timing for the next wave of capital deployment in Kentucky, related to the replacements of our coal-fired generating fleet. I'll touch on this further in a few minutes.
Turning to Slide 10. As the world focuses on climate change, PPL remains committed to advancing a cleaner energy future while maintaining safety, reliability and affordability for those we serve. Today, we are updating our goals to reduce PPL's CO2 emissions. Specifically, we raised our goal of reducing PPL's carbon emissions to at least 80% from 2010 levels by 2050 from our previous target of 70%. The company also accelerated its previous 2050 target by a decade, and we are now targeting reducing carbon emissions likely 70% by 2040. 
PPL has already reduced its carbon emissions by over 50% since 2010, exiting the competitive generation business in 2015, including nearly 4,000 megawatts of coal-fired generation and retiring 1,200 megawatts of coal in Kentucky. We expect to achieve these further reductions through a variety of actions including replacement of Kentucky coal-fired generation over time with a mix of renewables and natural gas, while meeting our obligations to provide least cost and reliable service to our Kentucky customers. Our updated targets are based on our ongoing resource planning activities and updated market data and trends in Kentucky. Assuming we receive KPSC approval for the previously mentioned renewable PPA and if technology continues to improve and drive down the cost of renewables, it is certainly possible that we can achieve even greater carbon reductions than these targets, while at the same time, ensuring the best value and reliability for our customers. We are confident, however, that these targets are achievable under current legislation and regulation as well as current technology and current economics. 
Turning to Slide 11. We also wanted to provide an overview of the near-term and longer-term opportunities to economically shift our business mix away from coal-fired generation. As you can see from the chart on the left side of the slide, PPL's rate base already consists of more than 80% transmission and distribution in noncoal-fired generation. Given that our significant planned investments over the next 5 years are heavily weighted towards additional T&D infrastructure, the percentage of rate base from coal-fired assets is expected to decrease even further in the near term. In fact, only about 5% of our 17 -- of our $14 billion capital plan is for investments related to coal-fired generating assets. Our current filed IRP supports the transition to cleaner energy, driven by technology and economics consistent with current policy and regulation.
As you can see, based on the chart on the right of the slide, based on certain scenarios from our latest IRP filed back in 2018, we could see some additional coal retirements in the back half of the 2020s with significantly more coal retirements in the 2030s. These scenarios continue to evolve, and we are starting to see more momentum for renewables in the state, as evidenced by the results of the recent renewable RFP, where we are proposing to economically add a lower cost as available renewable generation resource, while reducing the amount of output from some of our higher cost fossil units. We are not at a point where renewables can compete on a replacement capacity basis, as renewable plus storage options are not even competitive with our peaking gas plant.
With that said, it is clear that these factors are rapidly changing as we move through time, which requires us to continuously assess the most prudent strategy that's in the best interest of our customers, something we've always demonstrated.
Moving to Slide 12. We've updated our capital expenditure plan and continue to see significant investment opportunities in our networks over the next 5 years, totaling about $14 billion. We've increased our 2020 and 2021 projections by approximately $200 million each year from our prior estimates, primarily due to additional effluent limitation guidelines spend in Kentucky and a mix of timing-related investments in the U.K.
Our U.K. capital plan projects that we will be within 1% of our Ofgem-approved business plan for ED1. This will strengthen our credibility with Ofgem when we file our RIIO-ED2 business plan. Note that changing the assumed FX rate from $1.40 per pound to $1.30 per pound on our U.K. spend, reduced the 5-year CapEx projections by about $300 million. We have not included the $300 million Kentucky AMI project in our forecast at this time, but that remains a potential upside opportunity for us as well as the other areas of opportunity noted on the slide, including decarbonization-related spending in the U.K. We believe these additional opportunities could be as much as another $500 million above within the 5-year capital plan.
Long term, we expect more than an incremental $1 billion of investment to be required over the 5 year RIIO-ED2 period to achieve electrification initiatives based on our initial estimates. As I previously noted, we also believe the transition of our coal-fired generation fleet will be the next significant investment opportunity in Kentucky. While this opportunity is outside of our 5-year capital plan under current scenarios, it's important to remember that this plan reflects assumptions based on today's views of future prices and market conditions, which could rapidly change. What will not change is our commitment to our customers to continue to optimize our fleet and exceed expectations as we lead the evolution of our Kentucky operation, including the transition to less carbon-intensive generation resources. 
So as we look at the diverse portfolio of businesses that we have, it's important to point out that each business is in a different stage of its investment cycle. While U.K. RAV growth has been a strong 5% to 6% in ED1, we see that growth accelerating into ED2, beginning in 2023 as we fund the U.K. electrification initiatives. In Kentucky, we see the initial stages of the Kentucky coal generation replacement strategy, likely starting in the mid-2020s, which will begin another period of significant capital investment. And in Pennsylvania, we are expecting growth to likely slow in the next couple of years, following an extensive period of transmission spending over the last 5 years at almost $700 million per year.
It's -- the diversity of our portfolio of businesses combined with our culture of operational excellence and continuous improvement that will continue to deliver long-term value for our shareowners.
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe now to cover the financial review. Joe?"

I'll begin with a brief financial overview on Slide 14. And while PPL delivered an outstanding quarter of financial performance, earning $0.57 of ongoing earnings per share, I'll focus my review this morning on o",1295,"Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a brief financial overview on Slide 14. And while PPL delivered an outstanding quarter of financial performance, earning $0.57 of ongoing earnings per share, I'll focus my review this morning on our full year results.
We have included a walk in the appendix of today's presentation and our news release for additional details on fourth quarter results. Looking at the full year, we achieved 2019 reported earnings of $2.37 per share compared with $2.58 per share a year ago. Adjusting for special items, primarily reflecting mark-to-market changes related to unrealized foreign currency economic hedges, 2019 earnings from ongoing operations were $2.45 per share, exceeding the midpoint of our forecast by $0.05 per share. This compares to the $2.40 per share that we earned last year, which included significant weather benefits of about $0.08 per share. 
Looking forward to 2020, we announced the formal guidance range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share, which reflects updates for current market conditions and our foreign currency hedge position. We also are updating our 2021 estimates, primarily reflecting changes to foreign currency forecast, which are lower than our prior forecast.
Let's turn to Slide 15 for an update on our earnings results for the full year. Walking from our 2018 results on the left, we first made weather adjustments for comparability purposes of the underlying businesses. As I mentioned, weather was $0.08 favorable compared to normalized weather results in 2018.
For 2019, we experienced slightly favorable weather. The net result was a $0.07 per share decline year-over-year across all of our utilities. We also adjust for the effect of dilution. We settled the remaining 43 million shares on our forward equity transaction in November of 2019, which is the primary driver of the $0.10 per share of dilution year-over-year. Segment allocation of dilution is included on the slide for your reference.
Turning to the individual segment drivers, which exclude the impact of these items, starting with the U.K. Our U.K. regulated segment earned $1.40 per share, a $0.12 year-over-year increase. The increase in the U.K. earnings was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins, primarily driven by higher prices due to the April 1, 2018 and 2019 price increases, partially offset by lower sales volumes and higher pension income. 
In Pennsylvania, we earned $0.62 per share, which was $0.05 higher than our results in 2018. Our Pennsylvania results were primarily driven by higher adjusted gross margins, primarily resulting from returns on additional capital investments in transmission, partially offset by year-over-year differences and reduced income tax rates due to U.S. tax reform. The higher adjusted gross margins were partially offset by higher depreciation expense. 
Turning to our Kentucky-regulated segment. We're at $0.59 per share in 2019, a $0.05 increase over our results 1 year ago. The increase was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins, primarily resulting from higher retail rates effective May 1, 2019, and lower income taxes, primarily due to the Kentucky recycling credit recorded in the second quarter. Partially offsetting these items were higher depreciation expense and higher interest expense due to higher interest rates and increased borrowings. Results in corporate and other were consistent compared to the prior year. The results were primarily driven by higher other income offset by higher operations and maintenance expense.
Turning to Slide 16 and our financial outlook for 2020. PPL's growth is underpinned by continued operational excellence and organic investment at our regulated utilities. Walking from our strong 2019 results on the left of the slide, I'll note that weather this past year was not significant compared to our forecast of normal conditions and results in only a $0.01 per share adjustment for comparability purposes. We also project dilution of about $0.11 due to the November 2019 settlement of our May 2018 equity forward offering, which increases our 2020 average shares outstanding compared to 2019. The allocations by segment are provided on the slide for your reference. Excluding these 2 factors, we project growth at each of PPL's business segments. The U.K. segment is expected to experience growth, primarily driven by higher base demand revenues due to the annual April 1 increases and expected higher foreign currency exchange rates, reflecting our solid hedge position for 2020.
These positive drivers in the U.K. are expected to be partially offset by lower revenues from true-up mechanisms related to cost of debt recovery, property taxes and sales volumes totaling about $0.10. Lower pension income, primarily due to the significant decline in discount rates in the U.K. and a combination of other miscellaneous drivers such as higher depreciation, financing cost and taxes. In Pennsylvania, we project an increase driven primarily by higher returns on transmission investments. 
And turning to Kentucky, we project an increase from 2019, driven by higher retail rates, partially offset by higher depreciation expense. In corporate and other, we project improved earnings driven by a number of items, including lower interest expense due to lower short-term debt post the settlement of our equity forward. These drivers result in the midpoint of our guidance range of $2.50 per share.
Turning to Slide 17. We have also updated our 2021 projections to account for current foreign currency forecasts. Our prior earnings forecast of $2.50 to $2.80 per share reflected a foreign currency range of $1.35 per pound to $1.60 per pound, which was consistent with bank FX forecast at the time we initiated the earnings range. Our updating earnings forecast of $2.40 to $2.60 per share includes an updated foreign currency range of $1.25 to $1.40 per pound, which is below the current forwards and market forecasts. We are using these lower rates for the FX range given the expected near-term volatility as the U.K. works through the Brexit transition period during 2020, and we will be hedging 2021 during this time period.
The other drivers for 2021 highlighted in our previously announced forecast remained largely unchanged, with rate base still expected to grow at 5% to 6% and our expectation to continue to earn near our allowed returns. Our 2020 and 2021 forecast continue to assume an immaterial amount of equity issuances, as previously indicated.
Let me provide an update on our foreign currency hedging status, which is on Slide 18. For 2020, we were actively hedging during the fourth quarter and increased our hedge percentage by another 20%, bringing our hedge position to 90% of 2020 forecasted ongoing earnings. The average rate for 2020, reflecting these new hedges is $1.48 per pound. We were able to slightly improve on the average 2020 hedge rates by optimizing our hedge portfolio given the brief uplift in currency rates, following the positive U.K. election outcome and the strength in our 2019 results. We continue to utilize options in our hedging strategy that preserve upside to the current market rates with about 1/3 of the 2020 hedge portfolio being option-based. And for 2021, our hedge position is at 5% of forecasted earnings at an average rate of $1.33 per pound. Again, we expect to continue layering in 2020 -- 2021 hedges going forward.
Turning to Slide 19. As we continue our efforts to invest in our networks and earn our authorized returns, we remain committed to paying dividends to shareowners as we've done over the past century. The January 1 dividend represents the 296th consecutive quarterly dividend paid to shareowners. As Bill mentioned, we remain committed to dividend growth and today, announced we are raising the annualized dividend to $1.66 per share. We will continue to assess the rate at which we grow the dividend going forward in the context of our yield and payout relative to our peers.
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back to Bill for some closing comments. Bill?"

Before we open up the call for Q&A, I'd like to take a moment to reflect on what has truly been a remarkable decade for PPL. Over the past 10 years, we've doubled our market cap. We've unfailingly exceeded the midpoint of our earnings forecast. We've grown our dividend 18%. We won 21 J.D. Power awards for customer satisfaction in the U.S. We've consistently ranked highest for customer satisfaction among the network operators in the U.K. We've invested $27 billion to make our network smarter, to improve reliability and to advance a cleaner energy future. We've cut average customer interruptions by over 1/3 in the U.K. and by more than 20% in the U.S. since 2010.
All the while, we've kept electricity costs reasonable for our customers and remained deeply engaged with the communities we serve. And last but not least, we have dramatically transformed PPL. A decade ago, we were primarily a Pennsylvania hybrid utility facing stiff headwinds in competitive markets. Today, we are one of the nation's largest investor-owned utility companies with 100% of its earnings, driven by stable, high-performing regulated businesses.
In short, we are stronger today than we were a decade ago. We're better positioned to invest in the future. And as we celebrate our centennial, we are poised to power progress for another 100 years. When our directors first met a century ago, they did so at a pivotal time. The country was beginning to move from a patchwork quilt of isolated lighting companies to a coordinated network of regional utilities, power plants and transmission lines. Born in that moment, PPL would help drive that change, extending electricity service throughout the regions we serve, expanding to meet the needs and demands of a rapid industrial growth and just helping to improve quality of life for generations of customers.
Today, we again find ourselves at a pivotal moment for our industry, which is investing in new technologies to reshape not only how we deliver power, but how we produce it as well.
In this moment, we remain as committed as ever to powering progress, to fostering innovation to creating long-term shareowner value and to making a positive impact on society.
In closing, I'm proud of our past achievements, I'm equally excited about our future, and I'm convinced that PPL's best days are ahead.

Operationally, when you look at the assumptions behind the 2020, we're largely consistent with the prior forecast. The primary change was really a significant decline in corporate bond rates in the U.K., resulting in some lower discount rates, which had a negative impact on our U.K. pension obligations. Those factors really resulted in about a $0.06 impact compared to our prior plan. But as I mentioned, despite this, we're still in the prior range for 2020.

So the $200 million a year that we've included, so basically an incremental $1 billion that we're expecting over RIIO-ED2. That's based on our initial estimates going into the electrification initiatives that would be required to be funded by the DNOs. When you look at the process going forward for RIIO-2, right? The sector methodology consultation will be coming out Q2, Q3 of this year -- this is on Slide 28, by the way, in the deck. The methodology decision wouldn't be coming out until Q4, then the companies will be submitting our submissions in Q2 of 2021. So to be honest with you, we're going through the process right now on planning for those submissions -- the business plan submissions, while we're consulting with Ofgem on the methodology. And so I think we just need to get through that process a little more Shar, before we would, I think, update the view of EV or electrification spending going into ED2. But to your point, I think there certainly could be an opportunity there for incremental capital, especially coming out of what Jonathan Brearley published really on his first day on the job with his decarbonization plan. So we think that all fits very nicely into what we've been talking about. But I think we need to get through the process a little more before we would go beyond our initial estimate."

Bank forecasts are in a range of $1.35 to $1.45 for 2021. So there's certainly some potential upside to our forecast. And as we look to 2022, those bank forecasts are actually in the mid 1.40s range.

So we have about $1 billion over 5 years, call it, $200 million a year in that 5-year period. And again, that's based on our initial assumptions. The team is working through our business plan submission and that will be filed mid-2021 as part of the RIIO-2 process. I would say depending how aggressive the government initiatives and Ofgem's policies become on the tail end of ED1, we could see deploying some capital in our current rate -- our current business plan time frame on electrification initiatives. We think we have enough leeway within the existing plan that we would be able to divert some spending towards that. Therefore, it wouldn't be a drag on the returns because, as you know, the revenues are kind of set for the ED1 period. So we would have to basically shift capital away from other things to EVs. We have innovation capital, other things that I would say are placeholders that we could redeploy there. 
So I think we have enough flexibility in the back end of ED1, and you'll see a significant uptick in the ED2, which could -- once we get the business plan done, could be higher than what we're currently projecting at that $1 billion over the 5 years."

We're pleased that you've joined us for our 2019 year-end earnings call.

We're pleased that you've joined us for our 2019 year-end earnings call. With me today are Vince Sorgi, PPL, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Joe Bergstein, Chief Financial Officer.
Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda this morning begins with an overview of 2019 results and PPL's business outlook for 2020. Vince will then review some of PPL's recent operational highlights and outlook for 2020 as well as discuss PPL's clean energy transition strategy, including our decision to set a more aggressive goal to reduce PPL's carbon emissions. Following Vince's remarks, Joe will provide a more detailed financial review of 2019 and 2020, along with our updated earnings forecast for 2021.
I'll conclude by taking a few moments to highlight what has truly been a decade of transformation and growth for PPL. And PPL is marking its 100th anniversary, thanks to our employees' hard work and dedication and the unparalleled support of our communities. As always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions.
Turning to Slide 4. In 2019, PPL continued to deliver on its commitments to shareowners, customers and the communities we serve. We remain steadfast in our strategy to deliver best-in-sector operational performance, invest in a sustainable energy future, provide superior customer service, maintain a strong financial foundation, and engage and develop our people.
Our results in 2019 reflect this strategy. We exceeded the midpoint of our earnings guidance for the 10th straight year. Delivering ongoing earnings of $2.45 per share. We remain committed to dividend growth, increasing our dividend for the 17th time in 18 years and returning more than $1 billion in dividends to shareowners. As we delivered on these financial commitments, we continued to extend our track record of operational excellence.
We maintained strong transmission and distribution reliability across all of our utilities. In addition, we achieved top-decile generation reliability in Kentucky. At the same time, we remain as focused as ever on providing superior customer service. In fact, our utilities remain among the very best for customer satisfaction in the regions we serve. Our U.S. utilities earned 4 J.D. Power awards for customer satisfaction, raising our combined total to 51, since J.D. Power began assessing utility customer satisfaction in 1999. Meanwhile, our U.K. utilities all achieved a 9 out of 10 rating in Ofgem's Broad Measure of Customer Satisfaction review. In addition, Western Power Distribution earned the U.K.'s customer service excellence award for the 27th consecutive year. The company was also ranked by the industry regulator as best in stakeholder engagement and support for vulnerable customers for the eighth straight year. These achievements and more reflect our shared values and common purpose across PPL to deliver without fail for our customers, to exceed their expectations and to continuously improve.
Aware of the tremendous opportunity we have to make a positive impact on society, not only today, but for years to come, PPL also invested more than $3 billion in infrastructure improvements. Our continued investments are aimed at strengthening grid resiliency in the face of worsening storms, incorporating automation, replacing and rebuilding power lines and substations and reshaping electricity networks to support the growth of renewables and other distributed energy resources.
In regulatory matters, we remain focused in 2019 on achieving balanced regulatory outcomes that will benefit our customers and our shareowners. In Kentucky, we received Public Service Commission approval of a combined $187 million revenue increase, which supports additional improvements to the grid, our natural gas lines and our generation fleet. New rates took effect May 1.
And in the U.K., we continued to actively engage with Ofgem to advance a balanced regulatory framework that will provide real value to customers, support the U.K.'s electrification and decarbonization initiatives and provide fair and reasonable returns to investors when the next price control review period begins in 2023. Our engagement over the past year included meeting with Ofgem leadership and submitting responses to Ofgem's open letter consultation on behalf of both PPL and WPD, including our shareowners.
I'll note that the RIIO-ED2 framework released by Ofgem in December was largely in line with our expectations. In summary, we're proud of our many achievements over the past year on behalf of PPL shareowners and customers. Our performance is reflected in the numerous awards received throughout the year. Looking ahead, we're committed to building on this momentum and adding to our long-term track record of financial and operational excellence.
Now turning to Slide 5 and our 2020 outlook. Today, we initiated formal 2020 earnings guidance of $2.40 per share to $2.60 per share. This reflects our updated foreign currency hedge position, which we increased following the U.K. election that finally led to Brexit last month. Given the election result, we expect the U.K. business climate to remain strong as it has historically been.
Turning to our dividend. Today, we announced we are raising the annualized dividend to $1.66 per share. The increase announced today represents our 18th dividend increase in the last 19 years, and we remained committed to dividend growth. In terms of network investment in 2020, we plan to invest an additional $3.3 billion in all of our utilities. These investments will continue to support our efforts to improve customer experience and grid resiliency and advance a cleaner energy future.
Finally, as I touched upon earlier, we will remain engaged on the regulatory front to achieve balanced outcomes that benefit customers and shareowners. Last week, the new CEO of Ofgem, Jonathan Brearley, announced his decarbonization program action plan. Ofgem's plan over the next 18 months to make low-cost decarbonization a reality shows that the DNOs will play a critical role in the significant investment required to deliver clean energy and the U.K.'s net 0 carbon emissions target by the year 2050. This supports what we've been saying that we see real long-term growth opportunities with our WPD business as the DNOs lead many of the decarbonization initiatives that will enable a net 0 carbon economy.
I'll now turn the call over to Vince for an operational update. Vince?"

As we turn to a new year and a new decade, I just want to express how proud I am of the operational excellence that our 7 utilities continue to deliver for our customers. Our sector continues to rapidly evolve, and our teams are meeting the challenges and finding opportunities to leverage technological advancements and decarbonization initiatives that are driving real value for our customers.
We believe that PPL is well positioned to further enhance its networks and continue to build these utilities of the future as we look ahead. I'd like to highlight some of the operational developments from this past year and briefly discuss our strategic priorities for each segment for 2020 and beyond. I'll also provide an update on our 5-year capital expenditure plan.
Turning to Slide 7. Starting with the U.K., during 2019, WPD continued to demonstrate its leadership in support of the U.K.'s decarbonization goals. WPD was the first U.K. network operator to publish an electric vehicle strategy, building on knowledge gained through the company's Electric Nation EV Smart Charging initiative. The company has begun to proactively ready its network for increasing numbers of electric vehicles, anticipating the potential for up to 3 million EVs in our service territory by 2030. WPD also continues to deliver an industry-leading innovation program, including finding ways to connect more distributed generation to local networks.
Through 2019, WPD connected nearly 10 gigawatts of distributed generation to its network, about 6 gigawatts of which was renewable energy. In addition, WPD is leading the way in developing markets for flexibility services and demand response solutions to help maintain grid resiliency and control costs to the U.K. customers. These flexibility solution should enable the deferral of some network spend, which Ofgem is keen to see the DNOs deliver. As we look to the upcoming year, it's important to review how we are performing against our RIIO-ED1 business plan, and I'm proud to say that WPD continues to perform extremely well in RIIO-ED1. In the most recent Ofgem annual report for electric distribution, WPD ranked first in customer satisfaction and customer minutes lost and ranked second in time to connect customers. Our returns are middle of the pack with an RORE expectation of 8.4% on a real basis over the ED1 period. I'll note that this equates to a nominal RORE of about 11% when including RPI inflation. As we've indicated in the past, as the only fast track company in RIIO-ED1, we think the fact that we are the top-performing DNO group in the sector and only earning average returns will serve us well going into RIIO-ED2.
Our strategic priorities moving forward are to continue this high level of performance and continue our engagement with Ofgem to help develop the sector-specific methodology. Our objective is to ensure RIIO-ED2 provides the appropriate incentives for DNOs to deliver on the initiatives required to achieve net 0 carbon emissions by 2050.
Turning to Slide 8. In Pennsylvania, PPL Electric Utilities continued to demonstrate its leadership in the deployment of smart grid solutions. We currently have 4,500 smart switches installed on our grid. Since 2015, this technology has helped us eliminate over 900,000 outages for our customers.
As we've discussed during the year, PPL electric has received numerous awards this year for its operational excellence and commitment to innovation including the deployment of a new distributed energy resource management system or DERMS and the development of groundbreaking technology that safely and automatically cuts power to downed power lines, protecting the public, first responders and our employees. In addition, PPL Electric Utilities was awarded the most improved utility of the decade by PA Consulting. The company is also substantially complete with the multiyear nearly $500 million project to install 1.4 million advanced meters for our customers. 
Looking ahead, for 2020, we remain focused on executing on our substantial electric transmission and distribution investment plan. The majority of the spend this year remains in our transmission business, which has been the fastest-growing business in our portfolio for a number of years now due to the ongoing needs to upgrade and modernize our transmission system. This includes upgrading transmission lines and substations, replacing wood poles with steel poles and building new substations.
We've also invested considerably in our distribution network, also adding smart grid devices to the network, hardening the system, targeting our tree-trimming efforts and investing in new systems to automate how the network is controlled. This investment has also resulted in significant reductions in the number of and duration of outages for our customers. Going forward, we'll continue to deploy digital and cloud-based technology solutions to further automate the system to improve service even further for our customers.
From a rates perspective, our retail rates continue to remain competitive in the Mid-Atlantic region, thanks to our ongoing emphasis on integrating technology and efficiently managing costs, especially since we haven't had a base rate case since 2016. Over the past decade, we've held our operating costs to less than a 1% increase on average each year. We'll look to continue our efforts in this area as we don't expect another rate case to be effective within the earnings guidance period.
Moving to Kentucky on Slide 9. Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities continued to make progress on a multiyear $800 million project at cap and close ash ponds at our coal-fired power plant. Overall, we are about 80% complete with the cap and closure program. We also retired 272 megawatts of coal-fired generation at our E.W. Brown facility, raising the amount of retired coal generation to nearly 1,200 megawatts since 2010.
In addition, we secured Public Service Commission approval of a green energy tariff for businesses and continued to enhance our solar offerings for all of our customers. We completed construction of the first phase of our subscription-based Solar Share program, and we have fully subscribed the second phase with construction expected to be completed in Q2 of this year.
Following up on a renewable energy RFP conducted in 2019. In January, we requested approval of contracts to supply an additional 100 megawatts of as-available solar power to Kentucky customers. As we move into 2020, we see a balanced mix of investment across our Kentucky utilities. Over the past decade, we've had a significant portion of our capital devoted to improving the environmental profile of our generating units, which has supported reductions of SO2 and NOx emissions by approximately 90% and 80%, respectively. We'll be completing the majority of these environmental projects to comply with current regulations within the next couple of years.
As the environmental capital requirements have begun to decline, we've been able to deploy capital to improving our electric and gas T&D networks with a focus on system reliability and automation that are already delivering real value for our customers as evidenced by 120,000 interruptions that have been prevented to date from our smart grid solutions. All of these investments have supported rate base growth of over 7% per year, on average, over the past 20 years in Kentucky.
As we look forward, we are focused on a number of initiatives, including customer-focused programs, such as our green energy tariff as well as planning for the future investment cycle as it relates to generation resource planning. We'll also be working on updating our integrated resource plan with a new IRP to be filed with the commission in late 2021. We expect the new IRP will provide a better sense of timing for the next wave of capital deployment in Kentucky, related to the replacements of our coal-fired generating fleet. I'll touch on this further in a few minutes.
Turning to Slide 10. As the world focuses on climate change, PPL remains committed to advancing a cleaner energy future while maintaining safety, reliability and affordability for those we serve. Today, we are updating our goals to reduce PPL's CO2 emissions. Specifically, we raised our goal of reducing PPL's carbon emissions to at least 80% from 2010 levels by 2050 from our previous target of 70%. The company also accelerated its previous 2050 target by a decade, and we are now targeting reducing carbon emissions likely 70% by 2040. 
PPL has already reduced its carbon emissions by over 50% since 2010, exiting the competitive generation business in 2015, including nearly 4,000 megawatts of coal-fired generation and retiring 1,200 megawatts of coal in Kentucky. We expect to achieve these further reductions through a variety of actions including replacement of Kentucky coal-fired generation over time with a mix of renewables and natural gas, while meeting our obligations to provide least cost and reliable service to our Kentucky customers. Our updated targets are based on our ongoing resource planning activities and updated market data and trends in Kentucky. Assuming we receive KPSC approval for the previously mentioned renewable PPA and if technology continues to improve and drive down the cost of renewables, it is certainly possible that we can achieve even greater carbon reductions than these targets, while at the same time, ensuring the best value and reliability for our customers. We are confident, however, that these targets are achievable under current legislation and regulation as well as current technology and current economics. 
Turning to Slide 11. We also wanted to provide an overview of the near-term and longer-term opportunities to economically shift our business mix away from coal-fired generation. As you can see from the chart on the left side of the slide, PPL's rate base already consists of more than 80% transmission and distribution in noncoal-fired generation. Given that our significant planned investments over the next 5 years are heavily weighted towards additional T&D infrastructure, the percentage of rate base from coal-fired assets is expected to decrease even further in the near term. In fact, only about 5% of our 17 -- of our $14 billion capital plan is for investments related to coal-fired generating assets. Our current filed IRP supports the transition to cleaner energy, driven by technology and economics consistent with current policy and regulation.
As you can see, based on the chart on the right of the slide, based on certain scenarios from our latest IRP filed back in 2018, we could see some additional coal retirements in the back half of the 2020s with significantly more coal retirements in the 2030s. These scenarios continue to evolve, and we are starting to see more momentum for renewables in the state, as evidenced by the results of the recent renewable RFP, where we are proposing to economically add a lower cost as available renewable generation resource, while reducing the amount of output from some of our higher cost fossil units. We are not at a point where renewables can compete on a replacement capacity basis, as renewable plus storage options are not even competitive with our peaking gas plant. With that said, it is clear that these factors are rapidly changing as we move through time, which requires us to continuously assess the most prudent strategy that's in the best interest of our customers, something we've always demonstrated.
Moving to Slide 12. We've updated our capital expenditure plan and continue to see significant investment opportunities in our networks over the next 5 years, totaling about $14 billion. We've increased our 2020 and 2021 projections by approximately $200 million each year from our prior estimates, primarily due to additional effluent limitation guidelines spend in Kentucky and a mix of timing-related investments in the U.K.
Our U.K. capital plan projects that we will be within 1% of our Ofgem-approved business plan for ED1. This will strengthen our credibility with Ofgem when we file our RIIO-ED2 business plan. Note that changing the assumed FX rate from $1.40 per pound to $1.30 per pound on our U.K. spend, reduced the 5-year CapEx projections by about $300 million. We have not included the $300 million Kentucky AMI project in our forecast at this time, but that remains a potential upside opportunity for us as well as the other areas of opportunity noted on the slide, including decarbonization-related spending in the U.K. We believe these additional opportunities could be as much as another $500 million above within the 5-year capital plan.
Long term, we expect more than an incremental $1 billion of investment to be required over the 5 year RIIO-ED2 period to achieve electrification initiatives based on our initial estimates. As I previously noted, we also believe the transition of our coal-fired generation fleet will be the next significant investment opportunity in Kentucky. While this opportunity is outside of our 5-year capital plan under current scenarios, it's important to remember that this plan reflects assumptions based on today's views of future prices and market conditions, which could rapidly change. What will not change is our commitment to our customers to continue to optimize our fleet and exceed expectations as we lead the evolution of our Kentucky operation, including the transition to less carbon-intensive generation resources. 
So as we look at the diverse portfolio of businesses that we have, it's important to point out that each business is in a different stage of its investment cycle. While U.K. RAV growth has been a strong 5% to 6% in ED1, we see that growth accelerating into ED2, beginning in 2023 as we fund the U.K. electrification initiatives. In Kentucky, we see the initial stages of the Kentucky coal generation replacement strategy, likely starting in the mid-2020s, which will begin another period of significant capital investment. And in Pennsylvania, we are expecting growth to likely slow in the next couple of years, following an extensive period of transmission spending over the last 5 years at almost $700 million per year.
It's -- the diversity of our portfolio of businesses combined with our culture of operational excellence and continuous improvement that will continue to deliver long-term value for our shareowners.
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe now to cover the financial review. Joe?"

I'll begin with a brief financial overview on Slide 14. And while PPL delivered an outstanding quarter of financial performance, earning $0.57 of ongoing earnings per share, I'll focus my review this morning on our full year results.
We have included a walk in the appendix of today's presentation and our news release for additional details on fourth quarter results. Looking at the full year, we achieved 2019 reported earnings of $2.37 per share compared with $2.58 per share a year ago. Adjusting for special items, primarily reflecting mark-to-market changes related to unrealized foreign currency economic hedges, 2019 earnings from ongoing operations were $2.45 per share, exceeding the midpoint of our forecast by $0.05 per share. This compares to the $2.40 per share that we earned last year, which included significant weather benefits of about $0.08 per share. 
Looking forward to 2020. We announced the formal guidance range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share, which reflects updates for current market conditions and our foreign currency hedge position. We also are updating our 2021 estimates, primarily reflecting changes to foreign currency forecast, which are lower than our prior forecast.
Let's turn to Slide 15 for an update on our earnings results for the full year. Walking from our 2018 results on the left, we first made weather adjustments for comparability purposes of the underlying businesses. As I mentioned, weather was $0.08 favorable compared to normalized weather results in 2018.
For 2019, we experienced slightly favorable weather. The net result was a $0.07 per share decline year-over-year across all of our utilities. We also adjust for the effect of dilution. We settled the remaining 43 million shares on our forward equity transaction in November of 2019, which is the primary driver of the $0.10 per share of dilution year-over-year. Segment allocation of dilution is included on the slide for your reference.
Turning to the individual segment drivers, which exclude the impact of these items, starting with the U.K. Our U.K. regulated segment earned $1.40 per share, a $0.12 year-over-year increase. The increase in the U.K. earnings was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins, primarily driven by higher prices due to the April 1, 2018 and 2019 price increases, partially offset by lower sales volumes and higher pension income. 
In Pennsylvania, we earned $0.62 per share, which was $0.05 higher than our results in 2018. Our Pennsylvania results were primarily driven by higher adjusted gross margins, primarily resulting from returns on additional capital investments in transmission, partially offset by year-over-year differences and reduced income tax rates due to U.S. tax reform. The higher adjusted gross margins were partially offset by higher depreciation expense. 
Turning to our Kentucky-regulated segment. We're at $0.59 per share in 2019, a $0.05 increase over our results 1 year ago. The increase was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins, primarily resulting from higher retail rates effective May 1, 2019, and lower income taxes, primarily due to the Kentucky recycling credit recorded in the second quarter. Partially offsetting these items were higher depreciation expense and higher interest expense due to higher interest rates and increased borrowings. Results in corporate and other were consistent compared to the prior year. The results were primarily driven by higher other income offset by higher operations and maintenance expense.
Turning to Slide 16 and our financial outlook for 2020. PPL's growth is underpinned by continued operational excellence and organic investment at our regulated utilities. Walking from our strong 2019 results on the left of the slide, I'll note that weather this past year was not significant compared to our forecast of normal conditions and results in only a $0.01 per share adjustment for comparability purposes. We also project dilution of about $0.11 due to the November 2019 settlement of our May 2018 equity forward offering, which increases our 2020 average shares outstanding compared to 2019. The allocations by segment are provided on the slide for your reference. Excluding these 2 factors, we project growth at each of PPL's business segments. The U.K. segment is expected to experience growth, primarily driven by higher base demand revenues due to the annual April 1 increases and expected higher foreign currency exchange rates, reflecting our solid hedge position for 2020.
These positive drivers in the U.K. are expected to be partially offset by lower revenues from true-up mechanisms related to cost of debt recovery, property taxes and sales volumes totaling about $0.10. Lower pension income, primarily due to the significant decline in discount rates in the U.K. and a combination of other miscellaneous drivers such as higher depreciation, financing cost and taxes. In Pennsylvania, we project an increase driven primarily by higher returns on transmission investments. 
And turning to Kentucky, we project an increase from 2019, driven by higher retail rates, partially offset by higher depreciation expense. In corporate and other, we project improved earnings driven by a number of items, including lower interest expense due to lower short-term debt post the settlement of our equity forward. These drivers result in the midpoint of our guidance range of $2.50 per share.
Turning to Slide 17. We have also updated our 2021 projections to account for current foreign currency forecasts. Our prior earnings forecast of $2.50 to $2.80 per share reflected a foreign currency range of $1.35 per pound to $1.60 per pound, which was consistent with bank FX forecast at the time we initiated the earnings range. Our updating earnings forecast of $2.40 to $2.60 per share includes an updated foreign currency range of $1.25 to $1.40 per pound, which is below the current forwards and market forecasts. We are using these lower rates for the FX range given the expected near-term volatility as the U.K. works through the Brexit transition period during 2020, and we will be hedging 2021 during this time period.
The other drivers for 2021 highlighted in our previously announced forecast remained largely unchanged, with rate base still expected to grow at 5% to 6% and our expectation to continue to earn near our allowed returns. Our 2020 and 2021 forecast continue to assume an immaterial amount of equity issuances, as previously indicated.
Let me provide an update on our foreign currency hedging status, which is on Slide 18. For 2020, we were actively hedging during the fourth quarter and increased our hedge percentage by another 20%, bringing our hedge position to 90% of 2020 forecasted ongoing earnings. The average rate for 2020, reflecting these new hedges is $1.48 per pound. We were able to slightly improve on the average 2020 hedge rates by optimizing our hedge portfolio given the brief uplift in currency rates, following the positive U.K. election outcome and the strength in our 2019 results. We continue to utilize options in our hedging strategy that preserve upside to the current market rates with about 1/3 of the 2020 hedge portfolio being option-based. And for 2021, our hedge position is at 5% of forecasted earnings at an average rate of $1.33 per pound. Again, we expect to continue layering in 2020 -- 2021 hedges going forward.
Turning to Slide 19. As we continue our efforts to invest in our networks and earn our authorized returns, we remain committed to paying dividends to shareowners as we've done over the past century. The January 1 dividend represents the 296th consecutive quarterly dividend paid to shareowners. As Bill mentioned, we remain committed to dividend growth and today, announced we are raising the annualized dividend to $1.66 per share. We will continue to assess the rate at which we grow the dividend going forward in the context of our yield and payout relative to our peers. That concludes my prepared remarks. 
And I'll turn the call back to Bill for some closing comments. Bill?"

Before we open up the call for Q&A, I'd like to take a moment to reflect on what has truly been a remarkable decade for PPL. Over the past 10 years, we've doubled our market cap. We've unfailingly exceeded the midpoint of our earnings forecast. We've grown our dividend 18%. We won 21 J.D. Power awards for customer satisfaction in the U.S. We've consistently ranked highest for customer satisfaction among the network operators in the U.K. We've invested $27 billion to make our network smarter, to improve reliability and to advance a cleaner energy future. We've cut average customer interruptions by over 1/3 in the U.K. and by more than 20% in the U.S. since 2010.
All the while, we've kept electricity costs reasonable for our customers and remained deeply engaged with the communities we serve. And last but not least, we have dramatically transformed PPL. A decade ago, we were primarily a Pennsylvania hybrid utility facing stiff headwinds in competitive markets. Today, we are one of the nation's largest investor-owned utility companies with 100% of its earnings, driven by stable, high-performing regulated businesses.
In short, we are stronger today than we were a decade ago. We're better positioned to invest in the future. And as we celebrate our centennial, we are poised to power progress for another 100 years. When our directors first met a century ago, they did so at a pivotal time. The country was beginning to move from a patchwork quilt of isolated lighting companies to a coordinated network of regional utilities, power plants and transmission lines. Born in that moment, PPL would help drive that change, extending electricity service throughout the regions we serve, expanding to meet the needs and demands of a rapid industrial growth and just helping to improve quality of life for generations of customers.
Today, we again find ourselves at a pivotal moment for our industry, which is investing in new technologies to reshape not only how we deliver power, but how we produce it as well. In this moment, we remain as committed as ever to powering progress, to fostering innovation to creating long-term shareowner value and to making a positive impact on society. In closing, I'm proud of our past achievements, I'm equally excited about our future, and I'm convinced that PPL's best days are ahead.
With that, operator, let's open the call for questions, please."

As -- and one of the things you just pointed out was the very tight range that we had established for 2020. Having said that, we still are kind of within that range, but towards the lower end. Operationally, when you look at the assumptions behind the 2020, we're largely consistent with the prior forecast. The primary change was really a significant decline in corporate bond rates in the U.K., resulting in some lower discount rates, which had a negative impact on our U.K. pension obligations. Those factors really resulted in about a $0.06 impact compared to our prior plan. But as I mentioned, despite this, we're still in the prior range for 2020.
Joe, did you want to say anything more?"

And I'm kind of curious on when you can present the timing of an update understanding that you guys are very, very conservative when it comes to the outer years, i.e., like with the capital opportunities associated with EV deployment in the U.K. Why not have included some of this stuff in your capital outlook today?

As you indicated, we have historically been pretty conservative with our forecast, and we continue to be really driven by what we know about current projects, but also what we see as the current kind of FX rate, which, as you know, has been pretty volatile over time.

So the $200 million a year that we've included, so basically an incremental $1 billion that we're expecting over RIIO-ED2. That's based on our initial estimates going into the electrification initiatives that would be required to be funded by the DNOs. When you look at the process going forward for RIIO-2, right? The sector methodology consultation will be coming out Q2, Q3 of this year -- this is on Slide 28, by the way, in the deck. The methodology decision wouldn't be coming out until Q4, then the companies will be submitting our submissions in Q2 of 2021. So to be honest with you, we're going through the process right now on planning for those submissions -- the business plan submissions, while we're consulting with Ofgem on the methodology. 
And so I think we just need to get through that process a little more Shar, before we would, I think, update the view of EV or electrification spending going into ED2. But to your point, I think there certainly could be an opportunity there for incremental capital, especially coming out of what Jonathan Brearley published really on his first day on the job with his decarbonization plan. So we think that all fits very nicely into what we've been talking about. But I think we need to get through the process a little more before we would go beyond our initial estimate."

We're pleased that you've joined us for our first quarter earnings call. With me today are Vince Sorgi, PPL President and Chief Operating Officer; and Joe Bergstein, Chief Financial Officer. Moving to Slide 3",1037,"Thank you, Andy, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased that you've joined us for our first quarter earnings call. With me today are Vince Sorgi, PPL President and Chief Operating Officer; and Joe Bergstein, Chief Financial Officer. 
Moving to Slide 3. I'll begin this morning's call with an executive overview, including our response to the COVID-19 endemic and PPL's strong position in the face of this challenge. Phil will then provide a more detailed review of first quarter earnings and discuss our approach to managing certain financial risks relating to COVID. Then Vince will take a few moments on how we are maintaining our safe and reliable operations and focus on PPL's long-term strategy. As always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions. 
Turning to Slide 4. I'm extremely proud of our team's response to the pandemic, which was early and aggressive. This proactive approach helped us adapt quickly to ensure that we continue to provide safe and reliable services during these challenging times. Importantly, we have been able to keep electricity and guests flowing to our over 10 million customers despite the extensive measures necessary to protect our employees and our communities. First and foremost, we've taken steps to practice social distancing in all of our operations. This has included shifting almost 40% of our workforce to work from home. That represents more than 4,500 employees and it has included creating additional separation for those who must still report to a PPL facility due to the nature of their job. These measures have proven effective as we've had just a handful of positive COVID-19 cases across our company. These encouraging results are in part due to the substantial investments we've made, which enable our staff to complete a lot of the work remotely and without direct interaction with customers. And in those cases where our employees need to enter our customer premises, we've ensured our employees have the proper equipment to keep them safe. We've experienced shutdowns of nonessential businesses across the regions we serve, which has supported our social distancing effort. In all of our jurisdictions, the support by our local trade union has been fantastic. As we worked in true partnership to protect our workers and the public. And it's a testament to our employees whose patience, persistence and professionalism continues to shine through in these unprecedented times. Importantly, we continue to deliver an essential service for our customers when they need us most, especially the health care facilities that are literally on the front line fighting this pandemic. 
As we focus on meeting our customers' needs, we also remain well positioned to manage an extended economic downturn brought on by COVID-19. This is a reflection of the low risk, adaptable, great regulated business model that we have strategically built over the past decade. We have a strong liquidity position and took further steps to strengthen our financial position demonstrating our abilities to access the capital markets, which Joe will discuss more in a few moments. We also have substantial flexibility in our capital plan without major project risk which enables us to be agile and focused on the immediate needs of our customers, shifting noncritical work without significant implications to our overall capital plan. In short, we are confident in our ability to weather the storm as we confront the challenge of COVID-19. 
Lastly, I would note that we are committed to supporting customers who may be struggling financially through these difficult times. Our foundations in Pennsylvania and Kentucky, along with our U.K. business, have pledged $1.6 million combined in donations to coronavirus relief funds and programs that help customers with financial hardship. Our companies have also suspended disconnect and late fees and work to connect -- reconnect customers who had previously been disconnected. In addition, we continue to offer payment assisted programs and other services to help customers manage their energy bills. We know the road won't be easy for many, and we will continue to look for opportunities to support our local communities going forward. 
Now turning to Slide 5. Today, we announced first quarter reported earnings of $0.72 per share compared with $0.64 per share during the same period a year ago. Adjusting for special items, first quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.6 -- $0.67 per share compared to $0.70 per share a year ago. The decrease was driven largely by $0.04 of dilution and lower sales volumes, primarily due to the mild weather in the first quarter. These factors were partially offset by returns on our additional capital investment. 
Turning to the full year. We have not changed our 2020 forecast of $2.40 a share to $2.60 per share. And while we're on track through the first quarter with minimal impact from COVID, we have largely been under a lock down for the past 6 weeks. This has resulted in lower C&I load and higher residential loads in all of our jurisdictions. At this point, it is too early to predict clearly what the pandemic impact will be on full year results. This will depend on how long the pandemic lasts, the pace and extent of the economic recovery and the degree companies continuing to employ work from home protocols, which is what's driving the higher residential loads. Given these uncertainties and how early we are in the process, we are providing sensitivities in today's material, which Joe will cover in more detail in his remarks. We felt it was more helpful and transparent to provide sensitivity that allow shareowners and analysts to access the potential impact as time goes on. 
As you'll see in our sensitivity analysis, the monthly impact may be manageable, especially if the economies in our jurisdictions recover quickly, and we see more favorable weather, coupled with other levers that we can pull. So while we're bringing stability to our communities and customers in the face of unprecedented challenges, we also remain confident in our long-term prospects for our shareowners, including our 2021 forecast. We see minimal, if any, impact to our capital and rate base growth plans, and we maintain an attractive dividend and a strong investment-grade rate credit rating. 
I'll now turn the call over to Joe for a financial update."
185508,665375501,1978068,"PPL Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 08, 2020",2020-05-08,"Earnings Calls","PPL Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a brief overview of first quarter segment results on Slide 7. As Bill mentioned, PPL delivered first quarter 2020 earnings from ongoing operations of $0.67 per share versus $0.70 per share in",1514,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a brief overview of first quarter segment results on Slide 7. 
As Bill mentioned, PPL delivered first quarter 2020 earnings from ongoing operations of $0.67 per share versus $0.70 per share in the first quarter of 2019. Walking from our Q1 2019 results on the left, we first make weather adjustments for comparability purposes of the underlying businesses. As felt across much of the U.S. during the first quarter, we experienced a very mild winter, which drove a $0.03 negative variance compared to Q1 2019 and and about $0.05 variance to our forecast. Heating degree days were down by about 30% in Pennsylvania and 15% in Kentucky compared to normal weather conditions. We also adjust for the effects of dilution, primarily driven by the November 2019 draw on our equity forward contracts. 
Turning to the individual segment drivers, which exclude the impacts of these items, we'll begin first with the U.K. Our U.K. regulated segment earned $0.39 per share, a $0.02 decrease compared to the same period a year ago. The decrease in U.K. earnings was primarily due to lower other income due to lower pension income and higher operation and maintenance expense. These decreases were partially offset by higher adjusted gross margins, primarily driven by higher prices due to the April 1, 2019, price increases. I'll note, foreign currency was not a significant driver for Q1 based on the shape of our hedge portfolio. We remain substantially hedged for the balance of 2020 at an average hedge rate of $1.55 per pound. We'll see the benefit of higher hedge rates compared to 2019 in the balance of the year. 
Moving to Pennsylvania. We earned $0.16 per share, which was $0.02 higher than our comparable results for 2019. The increase was primarily driven by higher adjusted gross margins, primarily resulting from returns on additional capital investment and transmission. 
Turning to our Kentucky regulated segment, we earned $0.16 per share, a $0.03 increase over our results 1 year ago. The increase was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins, primarily resulting from higher retail rates effective May 1, 2019. Results at corporate and other were $0.01 higher compared to a year ago, driven by several factors, none of which were individually significant. 
Turning to Slide 8. As Bill noted, the company is well positioned to manage the challenges of COVID, we did not see material impacts to our financial results through the first quarter. With that said, there are a number of key areas of potential risk that we have been managing and continue to monitor. Our preliminary estimates reflect the monthly impact of approximately $0.03 to $0.04 per share based on April lockdowns. Importantly, we believe a substantial portion of these risks will be mitigated through constructive regulatory mechanisms, primarily U.K. decoupling. Breaking down the overall potential risk, starting with customer sales, we are seeing lower C&I volumes across the board, given that each one of our jurisdictions have been operating under some form of mandatory lockdown. However, that has also driven strong increases in residential volumes that partially offset these declines. I'll touch on load specific sensitivities in each of our jurisdictions on the next slide, but it's important to highlight that any impacts due to U.K. volume variances are fully recoverable in 2 years and are NPV neutral. Domestically, we have various fixed and demand charges in our tariffs that helped to reduce the impact to changes in load and about 40% of our Pennsylvania margins come from transmission under a FERC formula rate. 
Regarding bad debt, our U.K. operations are very well insulated as we do not directly bill the end-use customer in the U.K. WPD builds about 150 suppliers with the largest 7 suppliers comprising approximately 2/3 of those receivables. And as part of each U.K. supplier license agreement, these counterparties are required to post collateral in the form of letters of credit, escrow account deposits and cash deposits, supporting the DNOs in the event of a supplier default. 
Turning to the U.S., while we have experienced some delayed payments, we haven't seen a material drop-off in cash received to date. We believe that is in part due to the unemployment and small business provisions in the stimulus packages approved by Congress. I'll also note that our commissions are encouraging customers to continue to pay their utility bills, including contacting us directly for payment options. In the event we see the trend of delinquent payments rising to a significant level we will explore regulatory mechanisms with our commissions to recover late or miss payments related to COVID 19. In regard to our capital plan, in the U.S., we do not expect major changes to our plans and expect to complete as much of our planned capital work as possible with minimal notable delays experienced to date. In the U.K., the national shutdown ordered by Prime Minister Johnson has caused us to dial back capital spending to just the essential work, focused on ensuring reliability and safety of our network. Ofgem has provided guidance branding the network's flexibility in this area to prioritize our work accordingly. While we could see some modifications in our plan for 2020, we do not expect this to have a significant impact on our overall CapEx plan for RAV growth. We have the flexibility to shift some of the projects to the back half of 2020 or into future periods, depending on the duration of the lockdown. As a reminder, under the favorable U.K. regulatory construct for rate making purposes, 80% of our projected Totex or total expenditures grows towards increasing the RAV and 20% is recovered as current period revenue. So shifting or deferring capital investment, at least the amount we are talking about does not materially impact our RAB or our annual revenues. I'll cover our detailed liquidity update in a few moments, but I'll just reaffirm Bill's comment on our strong position and confidence to manage a prolonged downturn. The recent actions we have taken plus the flexibility we have with our low-risk capital plan gives us further levers to pull to effectively manage the company's cash flow and liquidity through these challenges. 
Turning to Slide 9. We are providing an update and more detailed view of our load trends by customer class and related sensitivities to better reflect potential risks associated with any prolonged shutdown in our service territories. Of the $0.03 to $0.04 per share of monthly exposure that I mentioned on the prior slide, $0.02 to $0.03 is driven by load. And of that, about $0.02 is recoverable in future periods due to decoupling in the U.K. Based on our observations in April, we estimate the potential impact on C&I load is a decline of approximately 15% to 25% depending on the jurisdiction. The decline in C&I load is partially offset by stronger residential demand, where we observed 1% to 3% increases in the U.K. and 5% to 8% increases domestically. Given this load profile, we are projecting about 2/3 of the impact to come from the U.K. In April, this resulted in Kentucky margins being off about $0.01 per share relative to our original business plan. In Pennsylvania, margins were flat to plan, and we do not have WPD's results yet, given the normal lag in receiving that data from suppliers. If our projections are accurate, it would result in about a $0.02 impact for the U.K. for the month. On the right side of the slide, we provide an example of the U.K. decoupling mechanism. This is an essential part of the regulation that provides stability to our cash flows, supporting the low business risk profile from the credit rating agencies. One of the key points is that in addition to recovering the lost revenue from any declines in volume, we also receive inflation on top of those revenues to make us whole. So economically, we're very well protected in the U.K. from the potential impacts of COVID, weather or any volume-related variances. Despite any current year impact to earnings. 
Turning to Slide 10. I'd now like to take a moment and describe a number of steps we've taken to improve our liquidity position in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic and the uncertainty in the capital markets. As Bill mentioned, we are very well situated with about $5 billion of total available liquidity as we sit here today. During March and April, we secured term loan facilities of $400 million to 12 and 24-month durations. We also issued $1 billion of senior notes at PPL capital funding, providing incremental liquidity and prefunding the LKE maturity we have in November of this year. We believe this positions the company very well from a liquidity perspective for the remainder of 2020. While we have $700 million of additional debt maturities at the operating companies in November, we believe we'll have the ability to access the capital markets to refinance that debt. 
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call to Vince for a brief operational update. Vince?"

I'd first like to echo Bill's commentary on how proud we are of our collective team's response to the challenges of COVID-19. And there's no doubt that COVID-19 has had a significant impact on the way we're operating the business. But as a company, we acted early and aggressively to foster social distancing and minimize the spread of the coronavirus. 
As a result, I'm pleased to report that we have not had any significant operational issues related to COVID-19. There's no denying how vital our service is to our customers, particularly in times of adversity and uncertainty. We are committed to be a source of stability at this time and to continue to power their lives, regardless of the challenges that are thrown our way. 
Turning to Slide 12. I want to take a moment to highlight some of the actions that we've taken to maintain that stability and reliability of service. We've taken extensive measures across PPL to protect our employees in the public in order to deliver gas and electricity safely and reliably for our customers as they cope with the challenges of COVID-19. But simply, safety is our top priority. We are following comprehensive emergency management and pandemic plans as well as the guidance of the CDC and state and local health departments. The work at home and social distancing measures that Bill discussed earlier are core to our strategy. In addition, we've taken a number of other measures, including temperature testing, reusing masks and gloves and enhancing our industrial cleaning. With our critical employees, which are primarily the control room operators, we've split the crews into multiple teams where possible, having them work in different locations and with the work from home numbers that we're able to enforce social distancing much better at our PPL facility. From a customer perspective, we are very focused on maintaining safety and reliability during these challenging times, and that starts with not cutting service to customers and deferring the charging of late fees, which we and most utilities in the U.S. have agreed to do. 
In the U.K., while WPD does not bill the end customer, we continue to work with a wider energy industry to consider liquidity issues, all focused on helping the end consumer. Despite these changes to how we operate, it has been critically important to ensure our top-tier reliability remains unchanged. We had our first round of spring storms in all 3 of our jurisdictions and we were able to restore power in all cases without any issues and without mutual assistant. These restoration efforts highlight the importance of preserving a strong supply chain, and we've increased our inventories for storm-related supply. Despite the lockdowns in our jurisdictions, we've been successful in getting our critical suppliers on the list of companies that are permitted to operate. As a result, we're well positioned with sufficient spares and supplies to operate effectively even in the COVID environment. We're also scenario planning in the event this will continue for an extended period of time to ensure we have adequate supplies and to assess the employee working arrangements that we've put in place. Both on PPL premises and off. 
As Joe indicated, we've already dialed back our U.K. capital spend to essential only work, but we are continuing to execute the original capital plans in the U.S. and expect to continue to do so. Having said that, based on the nature of our capital projects, we have the flexibility in the U.S. as well to defer capital spending into future periods, if necessary. In addition, our planned rate case calendar is relatively light with no outstanding base rate cases in the U.S., and our current U.K. price control continues through March of 2023. 
Turning to Slide 13. I covered the key points of our capital plan on the prior slide, but it's important to point out that a lot of our work in the U.K. is done on our customers' premises. So it's critically important. For the safety of our employees to take a more conservative approach to work, and we're extremely pleased that Ofgem has been a great supporter of these efforts. At this point, we expect any delayed asset replacement work and/or deferred asset reinforcement work to be completed in future periods. Of course, we'll continue to assess these needs in the context of our overall capital plan and as we look at the deliverables we committed to both our customers and to Ofgem. Looking forward, we do not expect the current environment to materially impact our overall capital plan, and we continue to see future investment opportunity across the PPL portfolio with about $14 billion of CapEx projected in the next 5 years focused on advancing a cleaner energy future. As discussed on our year-end call, we expect incremental CapEx opportunities of up to $500 million beyond the identified projects in our current plan. And longer term, we continue to see significant opportunities with the electrification initiatives in the U.K. as well as the transition of our coal generation fleet in Kentucky. 
And finally, moving to Slide 14. While we are certainly managing the current crisis at hand and ensuring that our customers and employees are protected during these difficult times, I want to further emphasize that we remain focused on the long-term strategy of the company. For PPL, in many utilities, that includes the transition to cleaner energy, and we continue to position our utilities to fight climate change in a manner that balances the needs of our customers and the environment. PPL remains committed to our updated CO2 emission reduction target announced earlier this year, increasing our reduction target to at least 80% from 2010 levels by 2050. We are also showing a glide path that has already resulted in a 56% reduction in Co2 through the end of last year and at least a 70% reduction by 2040.  I want to remind investors that these targets are based on current economics and technologies as well as current legislation and regulation. We believe these targets are credible, and we are confident in our ability to achieve them. Of course, if there are further advancements in technology or the cost of renewables continues to come down, we could certainly see even greater CO2 reduction than what we are currently targeting. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Bill for some closing remarks. Bill?"

I'd like to take a moment now to reiterate that PPL remains well positioned for the future.

We remain steadfast in our goals to advance the cleaner energy future and delivering on commitments to share owners. 
In closing, I would note that this will be the last earnings call led by me as PPL's Chief Executive Officer. As we announced in February, I will be retiring as CEO on June 1, and will become nonexecutive Chairman of the Board of Directors. Vince will become President and CEO of PPL at that time. It has truly been an honor to lead a tremendous team of employees we have here at PPL. They are among the very best our industry has to offer. They are talented, creative, caring and hardworking. And above all, they are dedicated to making life better for our customers and our community.

Lastly, we talked at length today about the challenge of COVID-19 and PPL's response. And I think it's worth noting that PPL has delivered power safely and reliably for the communities we serve for 100 years, overcoming many difficult challenges in that time. Through world War II, the great depression, hurricanes, snowstorms and more, generations of PPL employees have answered the call with grid determination and creativity. I have no doubt we will continue to do the same once again in the face of this new and unprecedented challenge.

To your point, given just the current backdrop with COVID, we are uncertain as to the timing of when we would file that next rate case. Our normal cadence that we've been on in Kentucky was basically every other year, that would have suggested filing something at the end of this year with rates going into effect mid next year. But we are currently assessing that timing given COVID and just the backdrop there. For Pennsylvania, we don't have a rate case in the business plan through our guide period through at least 2021. And I don't think COVID in and of itself would drive us to alter the timing of any rate case decisions in Pennsylvania. As Joe talked about in his remarks, when we looked at April's results, Pennsylvania was actually flat. So the residential load offset the C&I, the negative impacts on C&I. So again, I think given the tariff structure in PA, I wouldn't say co of it is going to drive us to alter our current plan there NPA."

I think at least we have that level of opportunity as we move through the balance of the year. Ultimately, we'll have to assess the full impact.

So from a cash flow or credit or dividend perspective, over the next 2 years, we really don't see an impact. So we'll have to just continue to assess the situation and the impact as we move through the balance of the year and decide which levers and how we want to flex them.

Fortunately, we've been able to provide those to both small, large customers as well, and they are receiving those very well. The economics at least in their view, have gotten close enough that they believe based on their own corporate environmental objectives and the economics that it makes sense for them to begin placing solar on their facilities at this time.

Fortunately, as we mentioned, any hit in the U.K., which is expected to be our biggest hit, if we have one, at least relative to 2020 earnings, will be recoverable plus inflation in 2022 and 2023. So even if we ultimately have to alter our 2020 forecast due to lower sales in the U.K., economically, we're not going to be any worse off."

We're pleased that you've joined us for our first quarter earnings call. With me today are Vince Sorgi, PPL President and Chief Operating Officer; and Joe Bergstein, Chief Financial Officer. Moving to Slide 3",1033,"Thank you, Andy, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased that you've joined us for our first quarter earnings call. With me today are Vince Sorgi, PPL President and Chief Operating Officer; and Joe Bergstein, Chief Financial Officer. 
Moving to Slide 3. I'll begin this morning's call with an executive overview, including our response to the COVID-19 pandemic and PPL's strong position in the face of this challenge. Joe will then provide a more detailed review of first quarter earnings and discuss our approach to managing certain financial risks relating to COVID. Then Vince will take a few moments on how we are maintaining our safe and reliable operations and focus on PPL's long-term strategy. As always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions. 
Turning to Slide 4. I'm extremely proud of our team's response to the pandemic, which was early and aggressive. This proactive approach helped us adapt quickly to ensure that we continue to provide safe and reliable services during these challenging times. Importantly, we have been able to keep electricity and gas flowing to our over 10 million customers despite the extensive measures necessary to protect our employees and our communities. 
First and foremost, we've taken steps to practice social distancing in all of our operations. This has included shifting almost 40% of our workforce to work from home. That represents more than 4,500 employees and it has included creating additional separation for those who must still report to a PPL facility due to the nature of their job. These measures have proven effective as we've had just a handful of positive COVID-19 cases across our company. These encouraging results are in part due to the substantial investments we've made, which enable our staff to complete a lot of the work remotely and without direct interaction with customers. And in those cases where our employees need to enter our customer premises, we've ensured our employees have the proper equipment to keep them safe. We've experienced shutdowns of nonessential businesses across the regions we serve, which has supported our social distancing effort. In all of our jurisdictions, the support by our local trade union has been fantastic. As we've worked in true partnership to protect our workers and the public. And it's a testament to our employee whose patience, persistence and professionalism continues to shine through in these unprecedented times. Importantly, we continue to deliver an essential service for our customers when they need us most, especially the health care facilities that are literally on the frontline fighting this pandemic. 
As we focus on meeting our customers' needs, we also remain well positioned to manage an extended economic downturn brought on by COVID-19. This is a reflection of the low risk, adaptable, great regulated business model that we have strategically built over the past decade. We have a strong liquidity position and took further steps to strengthen our financial position demonstrating our abilities to access the capital markets, which Joe will discuss more in a few moments. 
We also have substantial flexibility in our capital plan without major project risk which enables us to be agile and focused on the immediate needs of our customers, shifting noncritical work without significant implications to our overall capital plan. In short, we are confident in our ability to weather the storm as we confront the challenge of COVID-19. 
Lastly, I would note that we are committed to supporting customers who may be struggling financially through these difficult times. Our foundations in Pennsylvania and Kentucky, along with our U.K. business, have pledged $1.6 million combined in donations to coronavirus relief funds and programs that help customers with financial hardship. Our companies have also suspended disconnect and late fees and worked to connect -- reconnect customers who had previously been disconnected. In addition, we continue to offer payment assisted programs and other services to help customers manage their energy bills. We know the road won't be easy for many, and we will continue to look for opportunities to support our local communities going forward. 
Now turning to Slide 5. Today, we announced first quarter reported earnings of $0.72 per share compared with $0.64 per share during the same period a year ago. Adjusting for special items, first quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.60 per -- $0.67 per share compared to $0.70 per share a year ago. The decrease was driven largely by $0.04 of dilution and lower sales volumes, primarily due to the mild weather in the first quarter. These factors were partially offset by returns on our additional capital investment. 
Turning to the full year. We have not changed our 2020 forecast of $2.40 a share to $2.60 per share. And while we're on track through the first quarter with minimal impact from COVID, we have largely been under a lockdown for the past 6 weeks. This has resulted in lower C&I load and higher residential loads in all of our jurisdiction. At this point, it is too early to predict clearly what the pandemic impact will be on full year results. This will depend on how long the pandemic lasts, the pace and extent of the economic recovery and the degree companies continue in employ work-from-home protocols, which is what's driving the higher residential loads. Given these uncertainties and how early we are in the process, we are providing sensitivities in today's material, which Joe will cover in more detail in his remarks. We felt it was more helpful and transparent to provide sensitivities that allow shareowners and analysts to assess the potential impact as time goes on. 
As you'll see in our sensitivity analysis, the monthly impact may be manageable, especially if the economies in our jurisdictions recover quickly, and we see more favorable weather, coupled with other levers that we can pull. So while we're bringing stability to our communities and customers in the face of unprecedented challenges, we also remain confident in our long-term prospects for our shareowners, including our 2021 forecast. We see minimal, if any, impact to our capital and rate-based growth plans, and we maintain an attractive dividend and a strong investment-grade rate credit rating. 
I'll now turn the call over to Joe for a financial update."
185508,665375501,1978400,"PPL Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 08, 2020",2020-05-08,"Earnings Calls","PPL Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a brief overview of first quarter segment results on Slide 7. As Bill mentioned, PPL delivered first quarter 2020 earnings from ongoing operations of $0.67 per share versus $0.70 per share in",1515,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a brief overview of first quarter segment results on Slide 7. 
As Bill mentioned, PPL delivered first quarter 2020 earnings from ongoing operations of $0.67 per share versus $0.70 per share in the first quarter of 2019. Walking from our Q1 2019 results on the left, we first make weather adjustments for comparability purposes of the underlying businesses. As felt across much of the U.S. during the first quarter, we experienced a very mild winter, which drove a $0.03 negative variance compared to Q1 2019 and about $0.05 variance to our forecast. Heating degree days were down by about 30% in Pennsylvania and 15% in Kentucky compared to normal weather conditions. We also adjust for the effects of dilution, primarily driven by the November 2019 draw on our equity forward contracts. 
Turning to the individual segment drivers, which exclude the impacts of these items, we'll begin first with the U.K. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.39 per share, a $0.02 decrease compared to the same period a year ago. The decrease in U.K. earnings was primarily due to lower other income due to lower pension income and higher operation and maintenance expense. These decreases were partially offset by higher adjusted gross margins, primarily driven by higher prices through the April 1, 2019, price increases. I'll note, foreign currency was not a significant driver for Q1 based on the shape of our hedge portfolio. We remain substantially hedged for the balance of 2020 at an average hedge rate of $1.55 per pound. We'll see the benefit of higher hedge rates compared to 2019 in the balance of the year. 
Moving to Pennsylvania. We earned $0.16 per share, which was $0.02 higher than our comparable results for 2019. The increase was primarily driven to -- by higher adjusted gross margins, primarily resulting from returns on additional capital investment and transmission. 
Turning to our Kentucky regulated segment, we earned $0.16 per share, a $0.03 increase over our results 1 year ago. The increase was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins, primarily resulting from higher retail rates effective May 1, 2019. Results at Corporate and Other were $0.01 higher compared to a year ago, driven by several factors, none of which were individually significant. 
Turning to Slide 8. As Bill noted, the company is well positioned to manage the challenges of COVID, and we did not see material impacts to our financial results through the first quarter. With that said, there are a number of key areas of potential risk that we have been managing and continue to monitor. Our preliminary estimates reflect the monthly impact of approximately $0.03 to $0.04 per share based on April lockdowns. Importantly, we believe a substantial portion of these risks will be mitigated through constructive regulatory mechanisms, primarily U.K. decoupling. 
Breaking down the overall potential risk, starting with customer sales, we are seeing lower C&I volumes across the board, given that each one of our jurisdictions have been operating under some form of mandatory lockdown. However, that has also driven strong increases in residential volumes that partially offset these declines. I'll touch on load specific sensitivities in each of our jurisdictions on the next slide, but it's important to highlight that any impacts due to U.K. volume variances are fully recoverable in 2 years and are NPV neutral. Domestically, we have various fixed and demand charges in our tariffs that helped to reduce the impact to changes in load and about 40% of our Pennsylvania margins come from transmission under a FERC formula rate. 
Regarding bad debts, our U.K. operations are very well insulated as we do not directly bill the end-use customer in the U.K. WPD bills about 150 suppliers with the largest 7 suppliers comprising approximately 2/3 of those receivables. And as part of each U.K. supplier license agreement, these counterparties are required to post collateral in the form of letters of credit, escrow account deposits and cash deposits, supporting the DNOs in the event of a supplier default. 
Turning to the U.S., while we have experienced some delayed payments, we haven't seen a material drop-off in cash received to date. We believe that is in part due to the unemployment and small business provisions in the stimulus packages approved by Congress. I'll also note that our commissions are encouraging customers to continue to pay their utility bills, including contacting us directly for payment options. In the event we see the trend of delinquent payments rising to a significant level, we will explore regulatory mechanisms with our commissions to recover late or miss payments related to COVID-19. 
In regard to our capital plan, in the U.S., we do not expect major changes to our plans and expect to complete as much of our planned capital work as possible with minimal notable delays experienced to date. In the U.K., the national shutdown ordered by Prime Minister Johnson has caused us to dial back capital spending to just the essential work, focused on ensuring reliability and safety of our network. Ofgem has provided guidance branding the network's flexibility in this area to prioritize our work accordingly. 
While we could see some modifications in our plan for 2020, we do not expect this to have a significant impact on our overall CapEx planned for RAV growth. We have the flexibility to shift some of the project to the back half of 2020 or into future periods, depending on the duration of the lockdown. As a reminder, under the favorable U.K. regulatory construct for rate making purposes, 80% of our projected totex or total expenditures grows towards increasing the RAV and 20% is recovered as current period revenue. So shifting or deferring capital investment at, at least the amount we are talking about does not materially impact our RAV or our annual revenues. I'll cover our detailed liquidity update in a few moments, but I'll just reaffirm Bill's comment on our strong position and confidence to manage a prolonged downturn. The recent actions we have taken plus the flexibility we have with our low-risk capital plan gives us further levers to pull to effectively manage the company's cash flow and liquidity through these challenges. 
Turning to Slide 9. We are providing an update and more detailed view of our load trends by customer class and related sensitivities to better reflect potential risks associated with any prolonged shutdown in our service territory. Of the $0.03 to $0.04 per share of monthly exposure that I mentioned on the prior slide, $0.02 to $0.03 is driven by load. And of that, about $0.02 is recoverable in future periods due to decoupling in the U.K. Based on our observations in April, we estimate the potential impact on C&I load is a decline of approximately 15% to 25% depending on the jurisdiction. The decline in C&I load is partially offset by stronger residential demand, where we observed 1% to 3% increases in the U.K. and 5% to 8% increases domestically. Given this load profile, we are projecting about 2/3 of the impact to come from the U.K. In April, this resulted in Kentucky margins being off about $0.01 per share relative to our original business plan. In Pennsylvania, margins were flat to plan, and we do not have WPD's results yet, given the normal lag in receiving that data from suppliers. If our projections are accurate, it would result in about a $0.02 impact for the U.K. for the month. 
On the right side of the slide, we provide an example of the U.K. decoupling mechanism. This is an essential part of the regulation that provides stability to our cash flows, supporting the low business risk profile from the credit rating agencies. One of the key points is that in addition to recovering the lost revenue from any declines in volume, we also receive inflation on top of those revenues to make us whole. So economically, we're very well protected in the U.K. from the potential impacts of COVID, weather or any volume-related variances, despite any current year impact to earnings. 
Turning to Slide 10. I'd now like to take a moment and describe a number of steps we've taken to improve our liquidity position in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic and the uncertainty in the capital markets. As Bill mentioned, we are very well situated with about $5 billion of total available liquidity as we sit here today. During March and April, we secured term loan facilities of $400 million to 12- and 24-month durations. We also issued $1 billion of senior notes at PPL Capital Funding, providing incremental liquidity and prefunding the LKE maturity we have in November of this year. We believe this positions the company very well from a liquidity perspective for the remainder of 2020. While we have $700 million of additional debt maturities at the operating companies in November, we believe we'll have the ability to access the capital markets to refinance that debt. 
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call to Vince for a brief operational update. Vince?"

I'd first like to echo Bill's commentary on how proud we are of our collective team's response to the challenges of COVID-19.

I'd first like to echo Bill's commentary on how proud we are of our collective team's response to the challenges of COVID-19. There's no doubt that COVID-19 has had a significant impact on the way we're operating the business. But as a company, we acted early and aggressively to foster social distancing and minimize the spread of the coronavirus. 
As a result, I'm pleased to report that we have not had any significant operational issues related to COVID-19. There's no denying how vital our service is to our customers, particularly in times of adversity and uncertainty. We are committed to be a source of stability at this time and to continue to power their lives, regardless of the challenges that are thrown our way. 
Turning to Slide 12. I want to take a moment to highlight some of the actions that we've taken to maintain that stability and reliability of service. We've taken extensive measures across PPL to protect our employees in the public in order to deliver gas and electricity safely and reliably for our customers as they cope with the challenges of COVID-19. But simply, safety is our top priority. We are following comprehensive emergency management and pandemic plans as well as the guidance of the CDC and state and local health departments. The work at home and social distancing measures that Bill discussed earlier are core to our strategy. In addition, we've taken a number of other measures, including temperature testing, we're using masks and gloves and enhancing our industrial cleaning. With our critical employees, which are primarily the control room operators, we've split the crews into multiple teams where possible, having them work in different locations and with the work-from-home numbers that we're able to enforce social distancing much better at our PPL facility. From a customer perspective, we are very focused on maintaining safety and reliability during these challenging times, and that starts with not cutting service to customers and deferring the charging of late fees, which we and most utilities in the U.S. have agreed to do. 
In the U.K., while WPD does not bill the end customer, we continue to work with a wider energy industry to consider liquidity issues, all focused on helping the end consumer. Despite these changes to how we operate, it has been critically important to ensure our top-tier reliability remains unchanged. We had our first round of spring storms in all 3 of our jurisdictions, and we were able to restore power in all cases without any issues and without mutual assistant. These restoration efforts highlight the importance of preserving a strong supply chain, and we've increased our inventories for storm-related supply. Despite the lockdowns in our jurisdictions, we've been successful in getting our critical suppliers on the list of companies that are permitted to operate. As a result, we're well positioned with sufficient spares and supplies to operate effectively even in the COVID environment. We're also scenario planning in the event this will continue for an extended period of time to ensure we have adequate supplies and to assess the employee working arrangements that we've put in place. Both on PPL premises and off. 
As Joe indicated, we've already dialed back our U.K. capital spend to essential only work, but we are continuing to execute the original capital plans in the U.S. and expect to continue to do so. Having said that, based on the nature of our capital projects, we have the flexibility in the U.S. as well to defer capital spending into future periods, if necessary. In addition, our planned rate case calendar is relatively light with no outstanding base rate cases in the U.S., and our current U.K. price control continues through March of 2023. 
Turning to Slide 13. I covered the key points of our capital plan on the prior slide, but it's important to point out that a lot of our work in the U.K. is done on our customers' premises. So it's critically important, for the safety of our employees, to take a more conservative approach to work, and we're extremely pleased that Ofgem has been a great supporter of these efforts. At this point, we expect any delayed asset replacement work and/or deferred asset reinforcement work to be completed in future periods. Of course, we'll continue to assess these needs in the context of our overall capital plan and as we look at the deliverables we committed to both our customers and to Ofgem. Looking forward, we do not expect the current environment to materially impact our overall capital plan, and we continue to see future investment opportunity across the PPL portfolio with about $14 billion of CapEx projected in the next 5 years focused on advancing a cleaner energy future. As discussed on our year-end call, we expect incremental CapEx opportunities of up to $500 million beyond the identified projects in our current plan. And longer term, we continue to see significant opportunities with the electrification initiatives in the U.K. as well as the transition of our coal generation fleet in Kentucky. 
And finally, moving to Slide 14. While we are certainly managing the current crisis at hand and ensuring that our customers and employees are protected during these difficult times, I want to further emphasize that we remain focused on the long-term strategy of the company. For PPL, in many utilities, that includes the transition to cleaner energy, and we continue to position our utilities to fight climate change in a manner that balances the needs of our customers and the environment. PPL remains committed to our updated CO2 emission reduction targets announced earlier this year, increasing our reduction target to at least 80% from 2010 levels by 2050. We are also showing a glide path that has already resulted in a 56% reduction in CO2 through the end of last year and at least a 70% reduction by 2040. I want to remind investors that these targets are based on current economics and technologies as well as current legislation and regulation. We believe these targets are credible, and we are confident in our ability to achieve them. Of course, if there are further advancements in technology or the cost of renewables continues to come down, we could certainly see even greater CO2 reduction than what we are currently targeting. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Bill for some closing remarks. Bill?"

I'd like to take a moment now to reiterate that PPL remains well positioned for the future. Our strong financial profile consisting of a significant liquidity position and low-risk capital plan will enable us to manage through an extended economic downturn. Our commitment to exceptional operational performance and customer satisfaction shines bright as we continue to deliver electricity and natural gas during this period of uncertainty. We remain steadfast in our goals to advance the cleaner energy future and delivering on commitments to share owner.
In closing, I would note that this will be the last earnings call led by me as PPL's Chief Executive Officer. As we announced in February, I will be retiring as CEO on June 1, and will become nonexecutive Chairman of the Board of Directors. Vince will become President and CEO of PPL at that time. It has truly been an honor to lead a tremendous team of employees we have here at PPL. They are among the very best our industry has to offer. They are talented, creative, caring and hardworking. And above all, they are dedicated to making life better for our customers and our community. As we look to the future, I'm confident that the company will be in good hands, led by Vince, guided by an outstanding management team, supported by more than 12,000 strong in the U.S. and U.K. and poised to deliver for our share owners moving forward. 
Lastly, we talked at length today about the challenge of COVID-19 and PPL's response. And I think it's worth noting that PPL has delivered power safely and reliably for the communities we serve for 100 years, overcoming many difficult challenges in that time.

And thanks, Michael. I appreciate the congrats. So when we think about the U.S., right, so Kentucky given the continued high level of investment that we're deploying, not only in '20, but also '21, we would expect a need to file a rate case in Kentucky within the next year or so. To your point, given just the current backdrop with COVID, we are uncertain as to the timing of when we would file that next rate case. Our normal cadence that we've been on in Kentucky was basically every other year, that would have suggested filing something at the end of this year with rates going into effect mid next year. But we are currently assessing that timing given COVID and just the backdrop there. For Pennsylvania, we don't have a rate case in the business plan through our guide period through at least 2021. I don't think COVID in and of itself would drive us to alter the timing of any rate case decisions in Pennsylvania. As Joe talked about in his remarks, when we looked at April's results, Pennsylvania was actually flat. So the residential load offset the C&I, the negative impacts on C&I. So again, I think given the tariff structure in PA, I wouldn't say COVID is going to drive us to alter our current plan there in PA."

So we certainly have levers that we can pull, Julien, as we do in typical years to face the challenges that we may see from weather or other headwinds. And obviously, we had a weather impact, a negative impact for the first quarter, yet we still were confident in our forecast through the first quarter results. So I think if you think of it in terms of our ability to manage in a weather year, I think that's kind of what we were about $0.05 short of our business plan for the first quarter. I think at least we have that level of opportunity as we move through the balance of the year. Ultimately, we'll have to assess the full impact. And again, given the recoverability nature of the U.K. with their decoupling mechanism, it's really just a timing difference as we see it. So from a cash flow or credit or dividend perspective, over the next 2 years, we really don't see an impact. So we'll have to just continue to assess the situation and the impact as we move through the balance of the year and decide which levers and how we want to flex them. But of course, I think we'll have the normal levers that we typically have. And then in addition to that, just given the current situation, we'll have things like travel, training, open positions across the company and things like that, that we'll take a look at as well."

Fortunately, we've been able to provide those to both small, large customers as well, and they are receiving those very well. The economics, at least in their view, have gotten close enough that they believe based on their own corporate environmental objectives and the economics that it makes sense for them to begin placing solar on their facilities at this time. Relative to the coal fleet, as I mentioned, we're still not at the inflection point. However, we do see that on the -- what I would say, the medium-term horizon might be in the next, say, couple of years to 5 years.

We're pleased that you've joined us for our first quarter earnings call. With me today are Vince Sorgi, PPL President and Chief Operating Officer; and Joe Bergstein, Chief Financial Officer. Moving to Slide 3",1031,"Thank you, Andy, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased that you've joined us for our first quarter earnings call. With me today are Vince Sorgi, PPL President and Chief Operating Officer; and Joe Bergstein, Chief Financial Officer. 
Moving to Slide 3. I'll begin this morning's call with an executive overview, including our response to the COVID-19 pandemic and PPL's strong position in the face of this challenge. Joe will then provide a more detailed review of first quarter earnings and discuss our approach to managing certain financial risks relating to COVID. Then Vince will take a few moments on how we are maintaining our safe and reliable operations and focus on PPL's long-term strategy. As always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions. 
Turning to Slide 4. I'm extremely proud of our team's response to the pandemic, which was early and aggressive. This proactive approach helped us adapt quickly to ensure that we continue to provide safe and reliable services during these challenging times. Importantly, we have been able to keep electricity and gas flowing to our over 10 million customers despite the extensive measures necessary to protect our employees and our communities. 
First and foremost, we've taken steps to practice social distancing in all of our operations. This has included shifting almost 40% of our workforce to work from home. That represents more than 4,500 employees, and it has included creating additional separation for those who must still report to a PPL facility due to the nature of their job. These measures have proven effective as we've had just a handful of positive COVID-19 cases across our company. These encouraging results are in part due to the substantial investments we've made, which enable our staff to complete a lot of the work remotely and without direct interaction with customers. And in those cases where our employees need to enter our customer premises, we've ensured our employees have the proper equipment to keep them safe. We've experienced shutdowns of nonessential businesses across the regions we serve, which has supported our social distancing effort. In all of our jurisdictions, the support by our local trade union has been fantastic. As we've worked in true partnership to protect our workers and the public. And it's a testament to our employee whose patience, persistence and professionalism continues to shine through in these unprecedented times. Importantly, we continue to deliver an essential service for our customers when they need us most, especially the health care facilities that are literally on the frontline fighting this pandemic. 
As we focus on meeting our customers' needs, we also remain well positioned to manage an extended economic downturn brought on by COVID-19. This is a reflection of the low risk, adaptable, great regulated business model that we have strategically built over the past decade. We have a strong liquidity position and took further steps to strengthen our financial position demonstrating our abilities to access the capital markets, which Joe will discuss more in a few moments. 
We also have substantial flexibility in our capital plan without major project risk, which enables us to be agile and focused on the immediate needs of our customers, shifting noncritical work without significant implications to our overall capital plan. In short, we are confident in our ability to weather the storm as we confront the challenge of COVID-19. 
Lastly, I would note that we are committed to supporting customers who may be struggling financially through these difficult times. Our foundations in Pennsylvania and Kentucky, along with our U.K. business, have pledged $1.6 million combined in donations to coronavirus relief funds and programs that help customers with financial hardship. Our companies have also suspended disconnect and late fees and worked to connect -- reconnect customers who had previously been disconnected. In addition, we continue to offer payment assistant programs and other services to help customers manage their energy bills. We know the road won't be easy for many, and we will continue to look for opportunities to support our local communities going forward. 
Now turning to Slide 5. Today, we announced first quarter reported earnings of $0.72 per share compared with $0.64 per share during the same period a year ago. Adjusting for special items, first quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.60 per -- $0.67 per share compared to $0.70 per share a year ago. The decrease was driven largely by $0.04 of dilution and lower sales volumes, primarily due to the mild weather in the first quarter. These factors were partially offset by returns on our additional capital investment.
Turning to the full year. We have not changed our 2020 forecast of $2.40 a share to $2.60 per share. And while we're on track through the first quarter with minimal impact from COVID, we have largely been under a lockdown for the past 6 weeks. This has resulted in lower C&I load and higher residential loads in all of our jurisdiction. At this point, it is too early to predict clearly what the pandemic impact will be on full year results. This will depend on how long the pandemic lasts, the pace and extent of the economic recovery and the degree companies continue into employ work-from-home protocols, which is what's driving the higher residential loads. Given these uncertainties and how early we are in the process, we are providing sensitivities in today's material, which Joe will cover in more detail in his remarks. We felt it was more helpful and transparent to provide sensitivities that allow shareowners and analysts to assess the potential impact as time goes on. 
As you'll see in our sensitivity analysis, the monthly impact may be manageable, especially if the economies in our jurisdictions recover quickly, and we see more favorable weather, coupled with other levers that we can pull. So while we're bringing stability to our communities and customers in the face of unprecedented challenges, we also remain confident in our long-term prospects for our shareowners, including our 2021 forecast. We see minimal, if any, impact to our capital and rate-based growth plans, and we maintain an attractive dividend and strong investment-grade credit rating. 
I'll now turn the call over to Joe for a financial update."
185508,665375501,2015594,"PPL Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 08, 2020",2020-05-08,"Earnings Calls","PPL Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a brief overview of first quarter segment results on Slide 7. As Bill mentioned, PPL delivered first quarter 2020 earnings from ongoing operations of $0.67 per share versus $0.70 per share in",1513,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a brief overview of first quarter segment results on Slide 7. 
As Bill mentioned, PPL delivered first quarter 2020 earnings from ongoing operations of $0.67 per share versus $0.70 per share in the first quarter of 2019. Walking from our Q1 2019 results on the left, we first make weather adjustments for comparability purposes of the underlying businesses. As felt across much of the U.S. during the first quarter, we experienced a very mild winter, which drove a $0.03 negative variance compared to Q1 2019 and about $0.05 variance to our forecast. Heating degree days were down by about 30% in Pennsylvania and 15% in Kentucky compared to normal weather conditions. We also adjust for the effects of dilution, primarily driven by the November 2019 draw on our equity forward contracts. 
Turning to the individual segment drivers, which exclude the impacts of these items, we'll begin first with the U.K. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.39 per share, a $0.02 decrease compared to the same period a year ago. The decrease in U.K. earnings was primarily due to lower other income due to lower pension income and higher operation and maintenance expense. These decreases were partially offset by higher adjusted gross margins, primarily driven by higher prices through the April 1, 2019, price increases. I'll note, foreign currency was not a significant driver for Q1 based on the shape of our hedge portfolio. We remain substantially hedged for the balance of 2020 at an average hedge rate of $1.55 per pound. We'll see the benefit of higher hedge rates compared to 2019 in the balance of the year. 
Moving to Pennsylvania. We earned $0.16 per share, which was $0.02 higher than our comparable results for 2019. The increase was primarily driven to -- by higher adjusted gross margins, primarily resulting from returns on additional capital investment and transmission. 
Turning to our Kentucky regulated segment, we earned $0.16 per share, a $0.03 increase over our results 1 year ago. The increase was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins, primarily resulting from higher retail rates effective May 1, 2019. Results at Corporate and Other were $0.01 higher compared to a year ago, driven by several factors, none of which were individually significant. 
Turning to Slide 8. As Bill noted, the company is well positioned to manage the challenges of COVID, and we did not see material impacts to our financial results through the first quarter. With that said, there are a number of key areas of potential risk that we have been managing and continue to monitor. Our preliminary estimates reflect the monthly impact of approximately $0.03 to $0.04 per share based on April lockdowns. Importantly, we believe a substantial portion of these risks will be mitigated through constructive regulatory mechanisms, primarily U.K. decoupling. 
Breaking down the overall potential risk, starting with customer sales, we are seeing lower C&I volumes across the board, given that each one of our jurisdictions have been operating under some form of mandatory lockdown. However, that has also driven strong increases in residential volumes that partially offset these declines. I'll touch on load-specific sensitivities in each of our jurisdictions on the next slide, but it's important to highlight that any impacts due to U.K. volume variances are fully recoverable in 2 years and are NPV neutral. Domestically, we have various fixed and demand charges in our tariffs that help to reduce the impact to changes in load and about 40% of our Pennsylvania margins come from transmission under a FERC formula rate. 
Regarding bad debts, our U.K. operations are very well insulated as we do not directly bill the end-use customer in the U.K. WPD bills about 150 suppliers with the largest 7 suppliers comprising approximately 2/3 of those receivables. And as part of each U.K. supplier license agreement, these counterparties are required to post collateral in the form of letters of credit, escrow account deposits and cash deposits, supporting the DNOs in the event of a supplier default. 
Turning to the U.S., while we have experienced some delayed payments, we haven't seen a material drop-off in cash received to date. We believe that is in part due to the unemployment and small business provisions in the stimulus packages approved by Congress. I'll also note that our commissions are encouraging customers to continue to pay their utility bills, including contacting us directly for payment options. In the event we see the trend of delinquent payments rising to a significant level, we will explore regulatory mechanisms with our commissions to recover late or miss payments related to COVID-19. 
In regard to our capital plan, in the U.S., we do not expect major changes to our plans and expect to complete as much of our planned capital work as possible with minimal notable delays experienced to date. In the U.K., the national shutdown ordered by Prime Minister Johnson has caused us to dial back capital spending to just the essential work, focused on ensuring reliability and safety of our network. Ofgem has provided guidance branding the network's flexibility in this area to prioritize our work accordingly. 
While we could see some modifications in our plan for 2020, we do not expect this to have a significant impact on our overall CapEx planned for RAV growth. We have the flexibility to shift some of the project to the back half of 2020 or into future periods, depending on the duration of the lockdown. As a reminder, under the favorable U.K. regulatory construct for rate making purposes, 80% of our projected totex or total expenditures goes towards increasing the RAV and 20% is recovered as current period revenue. So shifting or deferring capital investment at, at least the amount we are talking about does not materially impact our RAV or our annual revenues. I'll cover our detailed liquidity update in a few moments, but I'll just reaffirm Bill's comment on our strong position and confidence to manage a prolonged downturn. The recent actions we have taken plus the flexibility we have with our low-risk capital plan gives us further levers to pull to effectively manage the company's cash flow and liquidity through these challenges. 
Turning to Slide 9. We are providing an update and more detailed view of our load trends by customer class and related sensitivities to better reflect potential risks associated with any prolonged shutdown in our service territory. Of the $0.03 to $0.04 per share of monthly exposure that I mentioned on the prior slide, $0.02 to $0.03 is driven by load. And of that, about $0.02 is recoverable in future periods due to decoupling in the U.K. Based on our observations in April, we estimate the potential impact on C&I load is a decline of approximately 15% to 25% depending on the jurisdiction. The decline in C&I load is partially offset by stronger residential demand, where we observed 1% to 3% increases in the U.K. and 5% to 8% increases domestically. Given this load profile, we are projecting about 2/3 of the impact to come from the U.K. In April, this resulted in Kentucky margins being off about $0.01 per share relative to our original business plan. In Pennsylvania, margins were flat to plan, and we do not have WPD's results yet, given the normal lag in receiving that data from suppliers. If our projections are accurate, it would result in about a $0.02 impact for the U.K. for the month. 
On the right side of the slide, we provide an example of the U.K. decoupling mechanism. This is an essential part of the regulation that provides stability to our cash flows, supporting the low business risk profile from the credit rating agencies. One of the key points is that in addition to recovering the lost revenue from any declines in volume, we also receive inflation on top of those revenues to make us whole. So economically, we're very well protected in the U.K. from the potential impacts of COVID, weather or any volume-related variances, despite any current-year impact to earnings. 
Turning to Slide 10. I'd now like to take a moment and describe a number of steps we've taken to improve our liquidity position in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic and the uncertainty in the capital markets. As Bill mentioned, we are very well situated with about $5 billion of total available liquidity as we sit here today. During March and April, we secured term loan facilities of $400 million to 12- and 24-month durations. We also issued $1 billion of senior notes at PPL Capital Funding, providing incremental liquidity and prefunding the LKE maturity we have in November of this year. We believe this positions the company very well from a liquidity perspective for the remainder of 2020. While we have $700 million of additional debt maturities at the operating companies in November, we believe we'll have the ability to access the capital markets to refinance that debt. 
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call to Vince for a brief operational update. Vince?"

I'd first like to echo Bill's commentary on how proud we are of our collective team's response to the challenges of COVID-19.

I'd first like to echo Bill's commentary on how proud we are of our collective team's response to the challenges of COVID-19. There's no doubt that COVID-19 has had a significant impact on the way we're operating the business. But as a company, we acted early and aggressively to foster social distancing and minimize the spread of the coronavirus. 
As a result, I'm pleased to report that we have not had any significant operational issues related to COVID-19. There's no denying how vital our service is to our customers, particularly in times of adversity and uncertainty. We are committed to be a source of stability at this time and to continue to power their lives, regardless of the challenges that are thrown our way. 
Turning to Slide 12. I want to take a moment to highlight some of the actions that we've taken to maintain that stability and reliability of service. We've taken extensive measures across PPL to protect our employees in the public in order to deliver gas and electricity safely and reliably for our customers as they cope with the challenges of COVID-19. But simply, safety is our top priority. We are following comprehensive emergency management and pandemic plans as well as the guidance of the CDC and state and local health departments. The work-at-home and social distancing measures that Bill discussed earlier are core to our strategy. In addition, we've taken a number of other measures, including temperature testing, we're using masks and gloves, and enhancing our industrial cleaning. With our critical employees, which are primarily the control room operators, we've split the crews into multiple teams where possible, having them work in different locations, and with the work-from-home numbers that we have, we're able to enforce social distancing much better at our PPL facility. From a customer perspective, we are very focused on maintaining safety and reliability during these challenging times and that starts with not cutting service to customers and deferring the charging of late fees, which we and most utilities in the U.S. have agreed to do. 
In the U.K., while WPD does not bill the end customer, we continue to work with a wider energy industry to consider liquidity issues, all focused on helping the end consumer. Despite these changes to how we operate, it has been critically important to ensure our top-tier reliability remains unchanged. We had our first round of spring storms in all 3 of our jurisdictions, and we were able to restore power in all cases without any issues and without mutual assistant. These restoration efforts highlight the importance of preserving a strong supply chain, and we've increased our inventories for storm-related supply. Despite the lockdowns in our jurisdictions, we've been successful in getting our critical suppliers on the list of companies that are permitted to operate. As a result, we're well positioned with sufficient spares and supplies to operate effectively even in the COVID environment. We're also scenario planning in the event this will continue for an extended period of time to ensure we have adequate supplies and to assess the employee working arrangements that we've put in place, both on PPL premises and off. 
As Joe indicated, we've already dialed back our U.K. capital spend to essential only work, but we are continuing to execute the original capital plans in the U.S. and expect to continue to do so. Having said that, based on the nature of our capital projects, we have the flexibility in the U.S. as well to defer capital spending into future periods, if necessary. In addition, our planned rate case calendar is relatively light, with no outstanding base rate cases in the U.S., and our current U.K. price control continues through March of 2023. 
Turning to Slide 13. I covered the key points of our capital plan on the prior slide, but it's important to point out that a lot of our work in the U.K. is done on our customers' premises. So it's critically important, for the safety of our employees, to take a more conservative approach to work, and we're extremely pleased that Ofgem has been a great supporter of these efforts. At this point, we expect any delayed asset replacement work and/or deferred asset reinforcement work to be completed in future periods. Of course, we'll continue to assess these needs in the context of our overall capital plan and as we look at the deliverables we committed to both our customers and to Ofgem. 
Looking forward, we do not expect the current environment to materially impact our overall capital plan, and we continue to see future investment opportunity across the PPL portfolio with about $14 billion of CapEx projected in the next 5 years focused on advancing a cleaner energy future. As discussed on our year-end call, we expect incremental CapEx opportunities of up to $500 million beyond the identified projects in our current plan. And longer term, we continue to see significant opportunities with the electrification initiatives in the U.K. as well as the transition of our coal generation fleet in Kentucky. 
And finally, moving to Slide 14. While we are certainly managing the current crisis at hand and ensuring that our customers and employees are protected during these difficult times, I want to further emphasize that we remain focused on the long-term strategy of the company. For PPL, in many utilities, that includes the transition to cleaner energy, and we continue to position our utilities to fight climate change in a manner that balances the needs of our customers and the environment. PPL remains committed to our updated CO2 emission reduction targets announced earlier this year, increasing our reduction target to at least 80% from 2010 levels by 2050. We are also showing a glide path that has already resulted in a 56% reduction in CO2 through the end of last year and at least a 70% reduction by 2040. I want to remind investors that these targets are based on current economics and technologies as well as current legislation and regulation. We believe these targets are credible, and we are confident in our ability to achieve them. Of course, if there are further advancements in technology or the cost of renewables continues to come down, we could certainly see even greater CO2 reduction than what we are currently targeting. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Bill for some closing remarks. Bill?"

I'd like to take a moment now to reiterate that PPL remains well positioned for the future. Our strong financial profile consisting of a significant liquidity position and low-risk capital plan will enable us to manage through an extended economic downturn. Our commitment to exceptional operational performance and customer satisfaction shines bright as we continue to deliver electricity and natural gas during this period of uncertainty. We remain steadfast in our goals to advance the cleaner energy future and delivering on commitments to shareowner.
In closing, I would note that this will be the last earnings call led by me as PPL's Chief Executive Officer. As we announced in February, I will be retiring as CEO on June 1, and will become nonexecutive Chairman of the Board of Directors. Vince will become President and CEO of PPL at that time. It has truly been an honor to lead a tremendous team of employees we have here at PPL. They are among the very best our industry has to offer. They are talented, creative, caring and hardworking. And above all, they are dedicated to making life better for our customers and our community. As we look to the future, I'm confident that the company will be in good hands, led by Vince, guided by an outstanding management team, supported by more than 12,000 strong in the U.S. and U.K. and poised to deliver for our share owners moving forward. 
Lastly, we talked at length today about the challenge of COVID-19 and PPL's response. And I think it's worth noting that PPL has delivered power safely and reliably for the communities we serve for 100 years, overcoming many difficult challenges in that time. Through World War II, the Great Depression, hurricanes, snowstorms and more generations of PPL employees have answered the call with great determination and creativity. I have no doubt we will continue to do the same once again in the face of this new and unprecedented challenge. 
With that, operator, let's open the call for questions, please."

So when we think about the U.S., right, so Kentucky given the continued high level of investment that we're deploying, not only in '20, but also '21, we would expect a need to file a rate case in Kentucky within the next year or so. To your point, given just the current backdrop with COVID, we are uncertain as to the timing of when we would file that next rate case. Our normal cadence that we've been on in Kentucky was basically every other year, that would have suggested filing something at the end of this year with rates going into effect mid-next year, but we are currently assessing that timing given COVID, just backdrop there. For Pennsylvania, we don't have a rate case in the business plan through our guidance period through, at least, 2021. I don't think COVID, in and of itself, would drive us to alter the timing of any rate case decisions in Pennsylvania. As Joe talked about in his remarks, when we looked at April's results, Pennsylvania was actually flat. So the residential load offset the C&I, the negative impacts on C&I. So again, I think given the tariff structure in PA, I wouldn't say COVID is going to drive us to alter our current plan there in PA."

I think at least we have that level of opportunity as we move through the balance of the year. Ultimately, we'll have to assess the full impact. And again, given the recoverability nature of the U.K. with their decoupling mechanism, it's really just a timing difference as we see it. So from a cash flow or credit or dividend perspective, over the next 2 years, we really don't see an impact. So we'll have to just continue to assess the situation and the impact as we move through the balance of the year and decide which levers and how we want to flex them.

So our thinking around pension funding hasn't really changed as -- with respect to the Triennial Review process and future funding requirements from customers in the U.K. We were -- we had already embarked on that process. We work with the pension trustee first. We're largely through that process with them and then we move to the U.K. pension regulator, and we're in that phase now. We're getting ready to kick off that phase of review with the regulator. We'll wrap that up and get to Ofgem and get approval from Ofgem later this year and get that in the November tariff for 2021. And so again, our thinking there has not really changed with respect to the amount of funding required in the future from customers. As we talked about previously, we expect that to decline by about $0.05 per share when we get to that period, just from the funded status and the lower collection that's required over the next several years."

Overall, the solar costs, as you know, the curves are coming down. We are not quite at the inflection point at this point. It is getting closer. You see in the state, a couple of things dynamically happening already. One is on the commercial/industrial front, we've gotten a lot more requests for solar options. Fortunately, we've been able to provide those to both small, large customers as well, and they are receiving those very well. The economics, at least in their view, have gotten close enough that they believe based on their own corporate environmental objectives and the economics that it makes sense for them to begin placing solar on their facilities at this time. Relative to the coal fleet, as I mentioned, we're still not at the inflection point. However, we do see that on the -- what I would say, the medium-term horizon might be in the next, say, couple of years to 5 years. We're beginning to think about how do we approach that from a -- not only from an economics standpoint but also from an operational and generation mix standpoint going forward.

We're pleased that you've joined us for our first quarter earnings call. With me today are Vince Sorgi, PPL President and Chief Operating Officer; and Joe Bergstein, Chief Financial Officer. Moving to Slide 3",1031,"Thank you, Andy, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased that you've joined us for our first quarter earnings call. With me today are Vince Sorgi, PPL President and Chief Operating Officer; and Joe Bergstein, Chief Financial Officer. 
Moving to Slide 3. I'll begin this morning's call with an executive overview, including our response to the COVID-19 pandemic and PPL's strong position in the face of this challenge. Joe will then provide a more detailed review of first quarter earnings and discuss our approach to managing certain financial risks relating to COVID. Then Vince will take a few moments on how we are maintaining our safe and reliable operations and focus on PPL's long-term strategy. As always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions. 
Turning to Slide 4. I'm extremely proud of our team's response to the pandemic, which was early and aggressive. This proactive approach helped us adapt quickly to ensure that we continue to provide safe and reliable services during these challenging times. Importantly, we have been able to keep electricity and gas flowing to our over 10 million customers despite the extensive measures necessary to protect our employees and our communities. 
First and foremost, we've taken steps to practice social distancing in all of our operations. This has included shifting almost 40% of our workforce to work from home. That represents more than 4,500 employees, and it has included creating additional separation for those who must still report to a PPL facility due to the nature of their job. These measures have proven effective as we've had just a handful of positive COVID-19 cases across our company. These encouraging results are in part due to the substantial investments we've made, which enable our staff to complete a lot of the work remotely and without direct interaction with customers. And in those cases where our employees need to enter our customer premises, we've ensured our employees have the proper equipment to keep them safe. We've experienced shutdowns of nonessential businesses across the regions we serve, which has supported our social distancing effort. In all of our jurisdictions, the support by our local trade union has been fantastic. As we've worked in true partnership to protect our workers and the public. And it's a testament to our employee whose patience, persistence and professionalism continues to shine through in these unprecedented times. Importantly, we continue to deliver an essential service for our customers when they need us most, especially the health care facilities that are literally on the frontline fighting this pandemic. 
As we focus on meeting our customers' needs, we also remain well positioned to manage an extended economic downturn brought on by COVID-19. This is a reflection of the low risk, adaptable, great regulated business model that we have strategically built over the past decade. We have a strong liquidity position and took further steps to strengthen our financial position demonstrating our abilities to access the capital markets, which Joe will discuss more in a few moments. 
We also have substantial flexibility in our capital plan without major project risk, which enables us to be agile and focused on the immediate needs of our customers, shifting noncritical work without significant implications to our overall capital plan. In short, we are confident in our ability to weather the storm as we confront the challenge of COVID-19. 
Lastly, I would note that we are committed to supporting customers who may be struggling financially through these difficult times. Our foundations in Pennsylvania and Kentucky, along with our U.K. business, have pledged $1.6 million combined in donations to coronavirus relief funds and programs that help customers with financial hardship. Our companies have also suspended disconnect and late fees and worked to connect -- reconnect customers who had previously been disconnected. In addition, we continue to offer payment assistant programs and other services to help customers manage their energy bills. We know the road won't be easy for many, and we will continue to look for opportunities to support our local communities going forward. 
Now turning to Slide 5. Today, we announced first quarter reported earnings of $0.72 per share compared with $0.64 per share during the same period a year ago. Adjusting for special items, first quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.60 per -- $0.67 per share compared to $0.70 per share a year ago. The decrease was driven largely by $0.04 of dilution and lower sales volumes, primarily due to the mild weather in the first quarter. These factors were partially offset by returns on our additional capital investment.
Turning to the full year. We have not changed our 2020 forecast of $2.40 a share to $2.60 per share. And while we're on track through the first quarter with minimal impact from COVID, we have largely been under a lockdown for the past 6 weeks. This has resulted in lower C&I load and higher residential loads in all of our jurisdiction. At this point, it is too early to predict clearly what the pandemic impact will be on full year results. This will depend on how long the pandemic lasts, the pace and extent of the economic recovery and the degree companies continue into employ work-from-home protocols, which is what's driving the higher residential loads. Given these uncertainties and how early we are in the process, we are providing sensitivities in today's material, which Joe will cover in more detail in his remarks. We felt it was more helpful and transparent to provide sensitivities that allow shareowners and analysts to assess the potential impact as time goes on. 
As you'll see in our sensitivity analysis, the monthly impact may be manageable, especially if the economies in our jurisdictions recover quickly, and we see more favorable weather, coupled with other levers that we can pull. So while we're bringing stability to our communities and customers in the face of unprecedented challenges, we also remain confident in our long-term prospects for our shareowners, including our 2021 forecast. We see minimal, if any, impact to our capital and rate-based growth plans, and we maintain an attractive dividend and strong investment-grade credit rating. 
I'll now turn the call over to Joe for a financial update."

As Bill mentioned, PPL delivered first quarter 2020 earnings from ongoing operations of $0.67 per share versus $0.70 per share in the first quarter of 2019. Walking from our Q1 2019 results on the left, we first make weather adjustments for comparability purposes of the underlying businesses. As felt across much of the U.S. during the first quarter, we experienced a very mild winter, which drove a $0.03 negative variance compared to Q1 2019 and about $0.05 variance to our forecast. Heating degree days were down by about 30% in Pennsylvania and 15% in Kentucky compared to normal weather conditions. We also adjust for the effects of dilution, primarily driven by the November 2019 draw on our equity forward contracts. 
Turning to the individual segment drivers, which exclude the impacts of these items, we'll begin first with the U.K. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.39 per share, a $0.02 decrease compared to the same period a year ago. The decrease in U.K. earnings was primarily due to lower other income due to lower pension income and higher operation and maintenance expense. These decreases were partially offset by higher adjusted gross margins, primarily driven by higher prices through the April 1, 2019, price increases. I'll note, foreign currency was not a significant driver for Q1 based on the shape of our hedge portfolio. We remain substantially hedged for the balance of 2020 at an average hedge rate of $1.55 per pound. We'll see the benefit of higher hedge rates compared to 2019 in the balance of the year. 
Moving to Pennsylvania. We earned $0.16 per share, which was $0.02 higher than our comparable results for 2019. The increase was primarily driven to -- by higher adjusted gross margins, primarily resulting from returns on additional capital investment and transmission. 
Turning to our Kentucky regulated segment, we earned $0.16 per share, a $0.03 increase over our results 1 year ago. The increase was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins, primarily resulting from higher retail rates effective May 1, 2019. Results at Corporate and Other were $0.01 higher compared to a year ago, driven by several factors, none of which were individually significant. 
Turning to Slide 8. As Bill noted, the company is well positioned to manage the challenges of COVID, and we did not see material impacts to our financial results through the first quarter. With that said, there are a number of key areas of potential risk that we have been managing and continue to monitor. Our preliminary estimates reflect the monthly impact of approximately $0.03 to $0.04 per share based on April lockdowns. Importantly, we believe a substantial portion of these risks will be mitigated through constructive regulatory mechanisms, primarily U.K. decoupling. 
Breaking down the overall potential risk, starting with customer sales, we are seeing lower C&I volumes across the board, given that each one of our jurisdictions have been operating under some form of mandatory lockdown. However, that has also driven strong increases in residential volumes that partially offset these declines. I'll touch on load-specific sensitivities in each of our jurisdictions on the next slide, but it's important to highlight that any impacts due to U.K. volume variances are fully recoverable in 2 years and are NPV neutral. Domestically, we have various fixed and demand charges in our tariffs that help to reduce the impact to changes in load and about 40% of our Pennsylvania margins come from transmission under a FERC formula rate. 
Regarding bad debts, our U.K. operations are very well insulated as we do not directly bill the end-use customer in the U.K. WPD bills about 150 suppliers with the largest 7 suppliers comprising approximately 2/3 of those receivables. And as part of each U.K. supplier license agreement, these counterparties are required to post collateral in the form of letters of credit, escrow account deposits and cash deposits, supporting the DNOs in the event of a supplier default. 
Turning to the U.S., while we have experienced some delayed payments, we haven't seen a material drop-off in cash received to date. We believe that is in part due to the unemployment and small business provisions in the stimulus packages approved by Congress. I'll also note that our commissions are encouraging customers to continue to pay their utility bills, including contacting us directly for payment options. In the event we see the trend of delinquent payments rising to a significant level, we will explore regulatory mechanisms with our commissions to recover late or miss payments related to COVID-19. 
In regard to our capital plan, in the U.S., we do not expect major changes to our plans and expect to complete as much of our planned capital work as possible with minimal notable delays experienced to date. In the U.K., the national shutdown ordered by Prime Minister Johnson has caused us to dial back capital spending to just the essential work, focused on ensuring reliability and safety of our network. Ofgem has provided guidance branding the network's flexibility in this area to prioritize our work accordingly. 
While we could see some modifications in our plan for 2020, we do not expect this to have a significant impact on our overall CapEx planned for RAV growth. We have the flexibility to shift some of the project to the back half of 2020 or into future periods, depending on the duration of the lockdown. As a reminder, under the favorable U.K. regulatory construct for rate making purposes, 80% of our projected totex or total expenditures goes towards increasing the RAV and 20% is recovered as current period revenue. So shifting or deferring capital investment at, at least the amount we are talking about does not materially impact our RAV or our annual revenues. I'll cover our detailed liquidity update in a few moments, but I'll just reaffirm Bill's comment on our strong position and confidence to manage a prolonged downturn. The recent actions we have taken plus the flexibility we have with our low-risk capital plan gives us further levers to pull to effectively manage the company's cash flow and liquidity through these challenges. 
Turning to Slide 9. We are providing an update and more detailed view of our load trends by customer class and related sensitivities to better reflect potential risks associated with any prolonged shutdown in our service territory. Of the $0.03 to $0.04 per share of monthly exposure that I mentioned on the prior slide, $0.02 to $0.03 is driven by load. And of that, about $0.02 is recoverable in future periods due to decoupling in the U.K. Based on our observations in April, we estimate the potential impact on C&I load is a decline of approximately 15% to 25% depending on the jurisdiction. The decline in C&I load is partially offset by stronger residential demand, where we observed 1% to 3% increases in the U.K. and 5% to 8% increases domestically. Given this load profile, we are projecting about 2/3 of the impact to come from the U.K. In April, this resulted in Kentucky margins being off about $0.01 per share relative to our original business plan. In Pennsylvania, margins were flat to plan, and we do not have WPD's results yet, given the normal lag in receiving that data from suppliers. If our projections are accurate, it would result in about a $0.02 impact for the U.K. for the month. 
On the right side of the slide, we provide an example of the U.K. decoupling mechanism. This is an essential part of the regulation that provides stability to our cash flows, supporting the low business risk profile from the credit rating agencies. One of the key points is that in addition to recovering the lost revenue from any declines in volume, we also receive inflation on top of those revenues to make us whole. So economically, we're very well protected in the U.K. from the potential impacts of COVID, weather or any volume-related variances, despite any current-year impact to earnings. 
Turning to Slide 10. I'd now like to take a moment and describe a number of steps we've taken to improve our liquidity position in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic and the uncertainty in the capital markets. As Bill mentioned, we are very well situated with about $5 billion of total available liquidity as we sit here today. During March and April, we secured term loan facilities of $400 million to 12- and 24-month durations. We also issued $1 billion of senior notes at PPL Capital Funding, providing incremental liquidity and prefunding the LKE maturity we have in November of this year. We believe this positions the company very well from a liquidity perspective for the remainder of 2020. While we have $700 million of additional debt maturities at the operating companies in November, we believe we'll have the ability to access the capital markets to refinance that debt. 
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call to Vince for a brief operational update. Vince?"

I'd first like to echo Bill's commentary on how proud we are of our collective team's response to the challenges of COVID-19. There's no doubt that COVID-19 has had a significant impact on the way we're operating t",1072,"Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. I'd first like to echo Bill's commentary on how proud we are of our collective team's response to the challenges of COVID-19. There's no doubt that COVID-19 has had a significant impact on the way we're operating the business. But as a company, we acted early and aggressively to foster social distancing and minimize the spread of the coronavirus. 
As a result, I'm pleased to report that we have not had any significant operational issues related to COVID-19. There's no denying how vital our service is to our customers, particularly in times of adversity and uncertainty. We are committed to be a source of stability at this time and to continue to power their lives, regardless of the challenges that are thrown our way. 
Turning to Slide 12. I want to take a moment to highlight some of the actions that we've taken to maintain that stability and reliability of service. We've taken extensive measures across PPL to protect our employees in the public in order to deliver gas and electricity safely and reliably for our customers as they cope with the challenges of COVID-19. But simply, safety is our top priority. We are following comprehensive emergency management and pandemic plans as well as the guidance of the CDC and state and local health departments. The work-at-home and social distancing measures that Bill discussed earlier are core to our strategy. In addition, we've taken a number of other measures, including temperature testing, we're using masks and gloves, and enhancing our industrial cleaning. With our critical employees, which are primarily the control room operators, we've split the crews into multiple teams where possible, having them work in different locations, and with the work-from-home numbers that we have, we're able to enforce social distancing much better at our PPL facility. From a customer perspective, we are very focused on maintaining safety and reliability during these challenging times and that starts with not cutting service to customers and deferring the charging of late fees, which we and most utilities in the U.S. have agreed to do. 
In the U.K., while WPD does not bill the end customer, we continue to work with a wider energy industry to consider liquidity issues, all focused on helping the end consumer. Despite these changes to how we operate, it has been critically important to ensure our top-tier reliability remains unchanged. We had our first round of spring storms in all 3 of our jurisdictions, and we were able to restore power in all cases without any issues and without mutual assistant. These restoration efforts highlight the importance of preserving a strong supply chain, and we've increased our inventories for storm-related supply. Despite the lockdowns in our jurisdictions, we've been successful in getting our critical suppliers on the list of companies that are permitted to operate. As a result, we're well positioned with sufficient spares and supplies to operate effectively even in the COVID environment. We're also scenario planning in the event this will continue for an extended period of time to ensure we have adequate supplies and to assess the employee working arrangements that we've put in place, both on PPL premises and off. 
As Joe indicated, we've already dialed back our U.K. capital spend to essential only work, but we are continuing to execute the original capital plans in the U.S. and expect to continue to do so. Having said that, based on the nature of our capital projects, we have the flexibility in the U.S. as well to defer capital spending into future periods, if necessary. In addition, our planned rate case calendar is relatively light, with no outstanding base rate cases in the U.S., and our current U.K. price control continues through March of 2023. 
Turning to Slide 13. I covered the key points of our capital plan on the prior slide, but it's important to point out that a lot of our work in the U.K. is done on our customers' premises. So it's critically important, for the safety of our employees, to take a more conservative approach to work, and we're extremely pleased that Ofgem has been a great supporter of these efforts. At this point, we expect any delayed asset replacement work and/or deferred asset reinforcement work to be completed in future periods. Of course, we'll continue to assess these needs in the context of our overall capital plan and as we look at the deliverables we committed to both our customers and to Ofgem. 
Looking forward, we do not expect the current environment to materially impact our overall capital plan, and we continue to see future investment opportunity across the PPL portfolio with about $14 billion of CapEx projected in the next 5 years focused on advancing a cleaner energy future. As discussed on our year-end call, we expect incremental CapEx opportunities of up to $500 million beyond the identified projects in our current plan. And longer term, we continue to see significant opportunities with the electrification initiatives in the U.K. as well as the transition of our coal generation fleet in Kentucky. 
And finally, moving to Slide 14. While we are certainly managing the current crisis at hand and ensuring that our customers and employees are protected during these difficult times, I want to further emphasize that we remain focused on the long-term strategy of the company. For PPL, in many utilities, that includes the transition to cleaner energy, and we continue to position our utilities to fight climate change in a manner that balances the needs of our customers and the environment. PPL remains committed to our updated CO2 emission reduction targets announced earlier this year, increasing our reduction target to at least 80% from 2010 levels by 2050. We are also showing a glide path that has already resulted in a 56% reduction in CO2 through the end of last year and at least a 70% reduction by 2040. I want to remind investors that these targets are based on current economics and technologies as well as current legislation and regulation. We believe these targets are credible, and we are confident in our ability to achieve them. Of course, if there are further advancements in technology or the cost of renewables continues to come down, we could certainly see even greater CO2 reduction than what we are currently targeting. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Bill for some closing remarks. Bill?"

I'd like to take a moment now to reiterate that PPL remains well positioned for the future. Our strong financial profile consisting of a significant liquidity position and low-risk capital plan will enable us to manage through an extended economic downturn. Our commitment to exceptional operational performance and customer satisfaction shines bright as we continue to deliver electricity and natural gas during this period of uncertainty. We remain steadfast in our goals to advance the cleaner energy future and delivering on commitments to shareowner.
In closing, I would note that this will be the last earnings call led by me as PPL's Chief Executive Officer. As we announced in February, I will be retiring as CEO on June 1, and will become nonexecutive Chairman of the Board of Directors. Vince will become President and CEO of PPL at that time. It has truly been an honor to lead a tremendous team of employees we have here at PPL. They are among the very best our industry has to offer. They are talented, creative, caring and hardworking. And above all, they are dedicated to making life better for our customers and our community. As we look to the future, I'm confident that the company will be in good hands, led by Vince, guided by an outstanding management team, supported by more than 12,000 strong in the U.S. and U.K. and poised to deliver for our share owners moving forward. 
Lastly, we talked at length today about the challenge of COVID-19 and PPL's response. And I think it's worth noting that PPL has delivered power safely and reliably for the communities we serve for 100 years, overcoming many difficult challenges in that time. Through World War II, the Great Depression, hurricanes, snowstorms and more generations of PPL employees have answered the call with great determination and creativity. I have no doubt we will continue to do the same once again in the face of this new and unprecedented challenge. 
With that, operator, let's open the call for questions, please."

To your point, given just the current backdrop with COVID, we are uncertain as to the timing of when we would file that next rate case. Our normal cadence that we've been on in Kentucky was basically every other year, that would have suggested filing something at the end of this year with rates going into effect mid-next year, but we are currently assessing that timing given COVID, just backdrop there. For Pennsylvania, we don't have a rate case in the business plan through our guidance period through, at least, 2021. I don't think COVID, in and of itself, would drive us to alter the timing of any rate case decisions in Pennsylvania. As Joe talked about in his remarks, when we looked at April's results, Pennsylvania was actually flat. So the residential load offset the C&I, the negative impacts on C&I. So again, I think given the tariff structure in PA, I wouldn't say COVID is going to drive us to alter our current plan there in PA."

So we certainly have levers that we can pull, Julien, as we do in typical years to face the challenges that we may see from weather or other headwinds. And obviously, we had a weather impact, a negative impact for the first quarter, yet we still were confident in our forecast through the first quarter results. So I think if you think of it in terms of our ability to manage in a weather year, I think that's kind of what we were about $0.05 short of our business plan for the first quarter. I think at least we have that level of opportunity as we move through the balance of the year. Ultimately, we'll have to assess the full impact. And again, given the recoverability nature of the U.K. with their decoupling mechanism, it's really just a timing difference as we see it. So from a cash flow or credit or dividend perspective, over the next 2 years, we really don't see an impact. So we'll have to just continue to assess the situation and the impact as we move through the balance of the year and decide which levers and how we want to flex them. But of course, I think we'll have the normal levers that we typically have. And then in addition to that, just given the current situation, we'll have things like travel, training, open positions across the company and things like that, that we'll take a look at as well."

Overall, the solar costs, as you know, the curves are coming down. We are not quite at the inflection point at this point. It is getting closer.

Fortunately, we've been able to provide those to both small, large customers as well, and they are receiving those very well. The economics, at least in their view, have gotten close enough that they believe based on their own corporate environmental objectives and the economics that it makes sense for them to begin placing solar on their facilities at this time. Relative to the coal fleet, as I mentioned, we're still not at the inflection point. However, we do see that on the -- what I would say, the medium-term horizon might be in the next, say, couple of years to 5 years.

I'm excited to be leading my first earnings call as CEO, as we certainly have a lot to talk about this morning. With me today are Joe Bergstein, our Chief Financial Officer; Greg Dudkin, the Head of our Pennsylvania Utility business; Paul Thompson, the Head of our Kentucky Utility business; and Phil Swift, who leads WPD, our electric distribution business in the U.K.
Moving to Slide 3. I'll begin this morning's call with comments on today's announcement to initiate a process to sell our operations in the U.K. Then I'll discuss some quarterly highlights and operational updates, including our continued strong performance during COVID-19 pandemic and some thoughts around Ofgem's latest publications on the RIIO-2 process. Joe will then provide a more detailed review of the second quarter financial update and as always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions.
So turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced after completing a comprehensive strategic review with our Board of Directors, that we are going to initiate a process to sell our U.K. business, WPD. We've engaged JPMorgan to lead that process for us. The sale would strategically reposition PPL as a purely U.S. utility holding company, sharpening our focus on rate-regulated assets in the U.S. and improving our ability to invest in sustainable energy solutions. We expect the proceeds from the sale would be used to strengthen our balance sheet, and enhance our long-term earnings growth, which could include supporting U.S. asset acquisitions and returning capital to shareowners.
We believe there are multiple ways in which this transaction will create shareowner value. First, we strongly believe the sale price, net of any tax, will be higher than the sum of the parts value currently embedded in PPL stock price. Second, we believe we will have a much stronger balance sheet post sale. Targeting mid- teens FFO to debt metric. Third, we believe we can target an EPS growth rate more in line with our U.S. utility peers. And finally, assuming we acquire another U.S. utility, we believe we can leverage our operational excellence and efficient business model to create even more value for both customers and shareowners.
We've been very transparent with investors that while we constantly analyze strategic alternatives, we would not engage in M&A unless we could do it in a way that would create shareholder value. We firmly believe that the sale of WPD at this time will unlock value for our shareholders. As we've been saying for a number of years, we believe WPD represents the premier asset group with an extremely high-performing management team in the best energy subsector in the U.K., i.e., electric distribution. We are more confident than ever that the road to net 0 carbon emissions in the U.K. will flow through electric distribution. And significant investment will be required in that sector, if the U.K. is going to achieve its net 0 goals, which Ofgem reaffirmed over a week ago in the electric distribution subsector consultation.
I expect that WPD will have the opportunity to earn reasonable returns and invest significant amounts of capital during RIIO-ED2 and well beyond that. As such, the decision to sell WPD is in no way a negative reflection on our WPD team or the WPD business. In fact, it's quite the opposite. We are extremely proud of the financial and operational results that WPD has achieved over the past 2 decades, and we are confident they will continue to deliver in the future.
And while we believe the public market continues to discount the value of WPD and our share price, we firmly expect that a wide range of strategic and financial buyers will demonstrate significant interest in this highly attractive asset. There are several recent precedent transactions of regulated networks in the U.K. and across broader Europe that support our position.
Given the relative attractiveness of electric distribution and the superior quality of the WPD business, we would expect WPD to attract a premium valuation. We expect to evaluate a variety of offers for the purchase of WPD, including all cash or a combination of cash and U.S. utility assets. Regarding timing, we would intend to announce a transaction within the first half of next year.
Let me just end by saying the plan to sell WPD as part of a broader strategic repositioning of the company, which we believe will result in a new PPL with a stronger balance sheet, a more focused growth strategy in the U.S. and an improved position to reduce its carbon footprint. We believe this will lead to a stronger outlook for the company with a competitive TSR and compelling growth prospects. The dividend has been and will remain an important part of total shareowner return for PPL investors. There's no change in the dividend as a result of the announcement this morning. The Board will assess the dividend at the appropriate time in connection with the resulting transaction.
Now let me make some high-level comments on the quarterly results before turning it over to Joe for the more detailed quarterly review. Turning to Slide 5. Today, we announced second quarter reported earnings of $0.45 per share. Adjusting for special items, second quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.55 per share compared with $0.58 per share a year ago.
Turning to a brief update on the impacts of COVID-19. I'm pleased to report that we continue to deliver electricity and natural gas safely and reliably as our customers navigate the challenges of this pandemic. As we highlighted on our first quarter call, we acted swiftly and aggressively to implement social distancing and minimize the spread of the virus within our company. This included shifting about 35% to 40% of our workforce or more than 4,500 employees to work from home, and creating additional separation for those who must still report to a PPL facility due to the nature of their jobs. With health and safety, our top priority, these steps remain in place today, even as restrictions have begun to ease in the regions in which we operate. While we continue to plan for what reentry to the workplace will look like for those now at home, we plan to move very cautiously and continue to follow guidance from the CDC and state and local health departments. As a result of the measures we've taken, we've been very effective in minimizing the impact of COVID-19 on our workforce and our operations.
While the most recent tropical storm, is impacted about 70,000 of our customers in Pennsylvania, we were able to restore power to most of them within 24 hours and all of them within 48 hours, reinforcing, again, little to no impact from COVID-19 on our ability to serve our customers even in the worst of conditions. Further, we remain well positioned from a supply chain perspective, and our capital plans remain on track if we've experienced minimal delays, apart from the early lockdown phase in the U.K.
Finally, from a financial perspective, we've maintained a strong liquidity position of over $4 billion. Our cash receipts have remained steady and minimal impact on our allowance for bad debt.
Turning to a U.K. regulatory update. We've seen some recent developments pertaining to the next price control period, RIIO-2. First, we were not surprised at all by the recent outcomes of the draft determinations for gas and transmission published in early July. Ofgem has been very clear about 3 things in their RIIO-2 messaging. They are going to incentivize investment that supports the U.K.'s net 0 carbon ambitions, they will ensure customer bills remain affordable, and there will be significant investment required in electric distribution over at least the next decade. We've said all along that Ofgem was going to deemphasize the gas and transmission sectors in favor of electric distribution, not because they are picking winners and losers, but because they fundamentally know the electric distribution networks will require significant investment going forward. In order for customers to afford that level of investment, they need to build headroom into customer bills, with lower returns and lower investment levels in gas and transmission. We believe that is why Ofgem has been so critical of the investment plans of both the gas and transmission subsectors.
On average, Ofgem cut the gas investment plans by about 20% and cut the transmission plans by about 45%. While Ofgem indicated there would be potential opportunity for some of that investment to be approved in the final determinations, which will come out later this year, I don't believe Ofgem is going to make it easy on these sectors.
WPD is in the fortunate position, however, to be able to follow the gas and transmission process through to the end, prior to us having to submit our business plans mid next year. Therefore, we are expecting that the RIIO-ED2 process for WPD will be much smoother and more successful.
The sector-specific methodology consultation on electric distribution that was released just over a week ago was also largely in line with our expectations. Ofgem made it clear that the DNOs were going to be critical to supporting the decarbonization efforts in the U.K. to deliver a net 0 economy, and we continue to agree that we are best positioned to deliver on those objectives. While we are still in the early stages of this process, WPD is very focused and engaged with our stakeholders and Ofgem to ensure we deliver a plan that will achieve these goals. We've led the way in RIIO-1 in terms of stakeholder engagement, and we'll continue to lead in this area as we begin our business planning process towards the end of this year.
While many of the parameters are still being developed, let me talk a little bit about our expectations for the electric distribution incentive package. Based on our recent discussions with Ofgem, we expect the incentive scheme for ED2 to continue to play a significant role in the overall returns for the electric distribution sector, much more significant compared to gas and transmission. In addition to the reliability and customer incentives we're accustomed to, I would expect to see significant output measures for low-carbon initiatives, promoting flexibility of the network and other net 0 related outputs. So while incentives are not a significant component of the gas and transmission subsector reviews, we absolutely continue to expect it to be meaningful for ED2.
And finally, regarding our 2020 earnings forecast, while COVID-19 has had an impact on our year-to-date financial results, and we expect it to negatively impact the remainder of the year as well, we continue to believe the full year impact will be manageable. Therefore, we reiterated our earnings guidance range for 2020 of $2.40 to $2.60 per share, with results expected to track towards the lower end of our forecast range given COVID and unfavorable weather in the first half of the year.
In a positive sign, we began to see a gradual easing of restrictions later in the quarter that dampened some of the impact we were seeing in April from strict lockdown measures. Residential load continues to be stronger than planned as a result of the continued work from home measures. And while C&I is still below plan in all 3 business units, it is not as bad as we were originally expecting it to be.
Regarding 2021, we are withdrawing our prior 2021 forecast as a result of today's announcement regarding the potential sale of the U.K. business, and we will provide an updated 2021 forecast at the conclusion of the process, which we expect to occur in the first half of 2021.
I'll now turn the call over to Joe for a more detailed financial update. Joe?"

I'll cover our second quarter segment results on Slide 6. First, I'd like to highlight that the estimated impact from COVID on our second quarter results was about $0.06 per share, which was primarily due to lower sales volumes in the U.K. and lower demand revenue in Kentucky. As we outlined in our projections on the first quarter call, about 2/3 of the impact or $0.04 per share is recoverable through the U.K. decoupling mechanism on a 2-year lag. I'll discuss further the impacts of COVID on the quarterly sales volumes in more detail in a few moments.
Turning to the quarterly walk and starting with Q2 2019 ongoing results on the left, we first reflect adjustments for weather and dilution for comparability purposes of the underlying businesses. During the second quarter, we experienced a $0.01 favorable variance due to weather compared to the second quarter of 2019, primarily in Pennsylvania.
Compared to our forecast, weather in the second quarter was about $0.01 a unfavorable variance with stronger load in Pennsylvania being offset by more mild weather in the U.K. and Kentucky versus normal conditions. In terms of dilution, we saw a $0.03 impact in the quarter primarily driven by the November 2019 draw on our equity forward contracts.
Moving to the segment drivers, excluding these items, our U.K. regulated segment earned $0.33 per share in the second quarter 2020. This represents a $0.01 decrease compared to a year ago. The decline was primarily due to lower sales volumes, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 and lower other income due to lower pension income. These decreases were partially offset by higher realized foreign currency exchange rates compared to the prior period. With Q2 2020 average rates of $1.63 per pound compared to $1.36 per pound in Q2 2019. I'll note that we layered on additional hedges since our last quarterly call, and are now hedged at 95% for the balance of 2020 at an average hedge rate of $1.47 per pound. And in light of today's announcement, we do not plan to add additional earnings hedges to 2021.
Moving to Pennsylvania, we earned $0.15 per share, which was $0.02 higher than our comparable results in Q2 2019. The increase was primarily driven by higher adjusted gross margins, primarily resulting from returns on additional capital investments in transmission. This increase was partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expense.
I'll note that our customer mix mitigated the impact on sales from COVID-19 is our positive impact from our significant residential base in Pennsylvania and fixed charges more than offset lower demand in the C&I sectors.
Turning to our Kentucky regulated segment. We earned $0.10 per share, a $0.03 decrease from our results 1 year ago. The decline was primarily due to lower commercial and industrial demand due to the impact of COVID-19 and higher income taxes due to a tax credit recognized in the second quarter of 2019. These decreases were partially offset by higher retail rates that were effective May 1, 2019. Results at Corporate and other were $0.01 higher compared with a year ago, driven by several factors, none of which were individually significant.
Turning to Slide 7. We outline the changes in weather-normalized sales for each segment by customer class. As expected and reflected in the financial results, we saw lower demand in the C&I sectors, partially offset by higher demand in the residential space in each of our service territories. In addition, as Vince pointed out, the reopenings that we observed, primarily in June, substantially reduced the impact on load. For example, in Kentucky and Pennsylvania, we went from 15% to 20% C&I load declines at the peak of the lockdowns in April to more modest declines of 8% and 2%, respectively, for the month of June.
In the U.K., we saw some positive momentum as the U.K. government downgraded its alert level midmonth, although the recovery was more modest, with June demand down about 11% versus the prior year. I'll note for this slide, the quarterly information presented for the U.K. aligns with our financial statement presentation on a 1 month lag and shows the period-over-period variances from March, April and May. Looking forward, we are encouraged by the recovery we've seen in June, which gives us more comfort in reaffirming the 2020 forecast today, albeit at the lower end of the range. We expect the annualized load sensitivities by segment that we provided last quarter, will remain as good guide as we move through the balance of the year.
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Vince."

Let me conclude today's remarks with an outline of some of my key areas of focus for the company and my excitement for PPL's bright future. As I've mentioned to many of you over the past few months, I'm extremely proud of our operational excellence at PPL, which is core to our mission of delivering safe and reliable service at an affordable price. This has been and will continue to be a priority for the company as it has led to continuous innovation and operational improvements that are driving our premier customer service and satisfaction levels.
One of my goals is to take this culture of operational excellence and find ways to leverage it to drive additional value for our customers and shareowners. Another one of my goals is to improve our overall TSR performance and the strategic repositioning announced this morning is 1 step in that direction.
I'm sure our decision to launch a sale process for WPD doesn't become as a surprise to investors, given PPL's stock performance over the past few years. We believe today's announcement creates the best path forward to improve our TSR by simplifying the business mix, reducing our leverage, improving our earnings growth rate and enhancing our ability to invest in sustainable energy solutions.
Another key area of focus will be to reduce the carbon footprint of the company. We've already communicated our targets of reducing CO2 emissions by at least 70% by 2040, and at least 80% by 2050. With the declining cost of renewable energy, we believe there will be a real opportunity to accelerate decarbonization of our Kentucky fleet under regulatory oversight and with economic benefit for our customers.
In closing, I'm very excited for the future of PPL. I firmly believe that the company's organic growth opportunities and strengthen financial flexibility expected from today's announced strategic repositioning best position PPL to deliver long-term value to both our shareowners and our customers. We look forward to providing further updates at the conclusion of the process or as appropriate.

And as I said in my prepared remarks, at this point, we believe that the market has shifted and that executing a sale of WPD will, in fact, create not only immediate value for shareowners. But will set the company up going forward for longer-term growth with a stronger balance sheet.
In terms of the market backdrop, right, last year, we had the general election in the U.K. Corbin election, they failed. Renationalization risk is in the rearview mirror. We believe there's been additional clarity around the RIIO-2 process, primarily for electric distribution, which supports what we've been saying from the beginning in terms of supporting electric distribution and the rope to 0 kind of flowing through that subsector. So we've gotten some clarity on all that. Unfortunately, that additional clarity really has not improved our stock price performance. Certainly not to the level we would have expected. And in fact, the discount has widened compared to our peers. So again, the market also on the buy side for these types of assets is pretty strong right now in Europe. There has been a number of comps that we saw starting with gas distribution in the U.K., electric distribution in the U.K. and then some other electric assets in broader Europe that have yielded some very strong results. So we think given the quality of the U.K. business and the management team and again, the subsector that we're dealing with, we firmly believe that the process will be successful, and will garner a greater value for WPD and a sale process that will be recognized in the share price."

So that would kind of the bucket #1.
The second, which is kind of to your point, looking at future long-term earnings growth with investments in regulated utility assets. As we think about the operating model that we've deployed at PPL and the efficiency of that model. We think we can acquire some U.S. utility assets, whether it's part of the consideration coming from the deal or to your point, a potential follow-on and create significant shareholder and customer value. I'll just use PPL Electric Utilities here in Pennsylvania as an example of what we've been able to accomplish. Since 2011, we've grown our rate base CAGR in PA by about 12% at the same time, our O&M has grown less than 1%. And our average PPL electric utility rate is about 25% less than the average in the Mid-Atlantic region. We've improved our customer satisfaction score from J.D. Power by about 20%. And of course, improved reliability at the same time by about 30%. So the kind of the strategy that underpinned that was a clear focus on hardening our system as we were making these investments, including advanced market technology and grid automation, of course, looking at a better integration of distributed energy resources, including distributed energy resource management system. So the software side of that as well.
And then moving to digital technologies on the IT front has done a lot to actually reduce the O&M and drive that less than 1% CAGR that I talked about. And so all of that kind of results in our ability to become more efficient, deploy that capital into the network and bring the network into a state that's more flexible, more automated and more friendly to distributed energy resources and green sources of power.
So we think at this point that we've gotten that model that to a point where we could replicate that. And so again, if we're able to acquire an asset in the U.S., either through the consideration or a follow-on, we think that would be another opportunity to create long-term value, again, both for shareholders and customers.
Kind of the third bucket..."

And a lot of your questions may depend on what the actual transaction is, the proceeds and then the use of those proceeds. But given the amount of questions that we've gotten from investors and from sell-side over the years, specifically regarding strategic alternatives for WPD. We just wanted to be transparent with the market and announced the process. It also has benefits in terms of the process itself. It is common in Europe to announce these types of sale processes at the time you launch it as opposed to waiting. And so we believe the buyer universe will be those that -- or will include those that have played in that European market. So having a process that's more into what they're accustomed to, we think, will help with the process itself. So we think we've just maximized the flexibility. We think there'll be a lot of interest and it just improves the probability that we'll be able to execute it. So I just wanted to just make a general comment on that.

And as some of the regulations and economic may change, we'll continue to look at retiring those at the appropriate time and with the appropriate approvals. But I guess I would leave you with the thought that today, the fossil fleet is a pretty efficient one."

With me today are Joe Bergstein, our Chief Financial Officer; Greg Dudkin, the Head of our Pennsylvania utility business; Paul Thompson, the Head of our Kentucky utility business; and Phil Swift, who leads WPD, our electric distribution business in the U.K. 
Moving to Slide 3. I'll begin this morning's call with comments on today's announcement to initiate a process to sell our operations in the U.K. Then I'll discuss some quarterly highlights and operational updates, including our continued strong performance during COVID-19 pandemic and some thoughts around Ofgem's latest publications on the RIIO-2 process. Joe will then provide a more detailed review of the second quarter financial update and as always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions. 
So turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced after completing a comprehensive strategic review with our Board of Directors, that we are going to initiate a process to sell our U.K. business, WPD. We've engaged JPMorgan to lead that process for us. The sale would strategically reposition PPL as a purely U.S. utility holding company, sharpening our focus on rate-regulated assets in the U.S. and improving our ability to invest in sustainable energy solutions. We expect the proceeds from the sale would be used to strengthen our balance sheet, and enhance our long-term earnings growth, which could include supporting U.S. asset acquisitions and returning capital to shareowners. 
We believe there are multiple ways in which this transaction will create shareowner value. First, we strongly believe the sale price, net of any tax, will be higher than the sum of the parts value currently embedded in PPL stock price. Second, we believe we will have a much stronger balance sheet post sale. Targeting mid- teens FFO to debt metric. Third, we believe we can target an EPS growth rate more in line with our U.S. utility peers. And finally, assuming we acquire another U.S. utility, we believe we can leverage our operational excellence and efficient business model to create even more value for both customers and shareowners. 
We've been very transparent with investors that while we constantly analyze strategic alternatives, we would not engage in M&A unless we could do it in a way that would create shareholder value. We firmly believe that the sale of WPD at this time will unlock value for our shareowners. As we've been saying for a number of years, we believe WPD represents the premier asset group with an extremely high-performing management team in the best energy subsector in the U.K., i.e., electric distribution. We are more confident than ever that the road to net-zero carbon emissions in the U.K. will flow through electric distribution. 
And significant investment will be required in that sector, if the U.K. is going to achieve its net-zero goals, which Ofgem reaffirmed over a week ago in the electric distribution subsector consultation. I expect that WPD will have the opportunity to earn reasonable returns and invest significant amounts of capital during RIIO-ED2 and well beyond that. As such, the decision to sell WPD is in no way a negative reflection on our WPD team or the WPD business. In fact, it's quite the opposite. We are extremely proud of the financial and operational results that WPD has achieved over the past 2 decades, and we are confident they will continue to deliver in the future. 
And while we believe the public market continues to discount the value of WPD and our share price, we firmly expect that a wide range of strategic and financial buyers will demonstrate significant interest in this highly attractive asset. There are several recent precedent transactions of regulated networks in the U.K. and across broader Europe that support our position. 
Given the relative attractiveness of electric distribution and the superior quality of the WPD business, we would expect WPD to attract a premium valuation. We expect to evaluate a variety of offers for the purchase of WPD, including all cash or a combination of cash and U.S. utility assets. Regarding timing, we would intend to announce a transaction within the first half of next year. Let me just end by saying the plan to sell WPD as part of a broader strategic repositioning of the company, which we believe will result in a new PPL with a stronger balance sheet, a more focused growth strategy in the U.S. and an improved position to reduce its carbon footprint. 
We believe this will lead to a stronger outlook for the company with a competitive TSR and compelling growth prospects. The dividend has been and will remain an important part of total shareowner return for PPL investors. There's no change in the dividend as a result of the announcement this morning. The Board will assess the dividend at the appropriate time in connection with the resulting transaction. 
Now let me make some high-level comments on the quarterly results before turning it over to Joe for the more detailed quarterly review. Turning to Slide 5. Today, we announced second quarter reported earnings of $0.45 per share. Adjusting for special items, second quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.55 per share compared with $0.58 per share a year ago. 
Turning to a brief update on the impacts of COVID-19. I'm pleased to report that we continue to deliver electricity and natural gas safely and reliably as our customers navigate the challenges of this pandemic. As we highlighted on our first quarter call, we acted swiftly and aggressively to implement social distancing and minimize the spread of the virus within our company. This included shifting about 35% to 40% of our workforce or more than 4,500 employees to work from home, and creating additional separation for those who must still report to a PPL facility due to the nature of their jobs. 
With health and safety, our top priority, these steps remain in place today, even as restrictions have begun to ease in the regions in which we operate. And while we continue to plan for what reentry to the workplace will look like for those now at home, we plan to move very cautiously and continue to follow guidance from the CDC and state and local health departments. As a result of the measures we've taken, we've been very effective in minimizing the impact of COVID-19 on our workforce and our operations. 
While the most recent tropical storm, Isaias, has impacted about 70,000 of our customers in Pennsylvania, we were able to restore power to most of them within 24 hours and all of them within 48 hours, reinforcing, again, little to no impact from COVID-19 on our ability to serve our customers even in the worst of conditions. 
Further, we remain well positioned from a supply chain perspective, and our capital plans remain on track if we've experienced minimal delays, apart from the early lockdown phase in the U.K. 
Finally, from a financial perspective, we've maintained a strong liquidity position of over $4 billion. Our cash receipts have remained steady and minimal impact on our allowance for bad debt. 
Turning to a U.K. regulatory update. We've seen some recent developments pertaining to the next price control period, RIIO-2. First, we were not surprised at all by the recent outcomes of the draft determinations for gas and transmission published in early July. Ofgem has been very clear about 3 things in their RIIO-2 messaging. They are going to incentivize investment that supports the U.K.'s net-zero carbon ambitions, they will ensure customer bills remain affordable, and there will be significant investment required in electric distribution over at least the next decade. 
We've said all along that Ofgem was going to deemphasize the gas and transmission sectors in favor of electric distribution, not because they are picking winners and losers, but because they fundamentally know the electric distribution networks will require significant investment going forward. In order for customers to afford that level of investment, they need to build headroom into customer bills, with lower returns and lower investment levels in gas and transmission. We believe that is why Ofgem has been so critical of the investment plans of both the gas and transmission subsectors. On average, Ofgem cut the gas investment plans by about 20% and cut the transmission plans by about 45%. While Ofgem indicated there would be potential opportunity for some of that investment to be approved in the final determinations, which will come out later this year, I don't believe Ofgem is going to make it easy on these sectors. 
WPD is in the fortunate position, however, to be able to follow the gas and transmission process through to the end, prior to us having to submit our business plans mid next year. Therefore, we are expecting that the RIIO-ED2 process for WPD will be much smoother and more successful. 
The sector-specific methodology consultation on electric distribution that was released just over a week ago was also largely in line with our expectations. Ofgem made it clear that the DNOs were going to be critical to supporting the decarbonization efforts in the U.K. to deliver a net-zero economy. And we continue to agree that we are best positioned to deliver on those objectives. While we are still in the early stages of this process, WPD is very focused and engaged with our stakeholders and Ofgem to ensure we deliver a plan that will achieve these goals. We've led the way in RIIO-1 in terms of stakeholder engagement, and we'll continue to lead in this area as we begin our business planning process towards the end of this year. 
While many of the parameters are still being developed, let me talk a little bit about our expectations for the electric distribution incentive package. Based on our recent discussions with Ofgem, we expect the incentive scheme for ED2 to continue to play a significant role in the overall returns for the electric distribution sector, much more significant compared to gas and transmission. In addition to the reliability and customer incentives we're accustomed to, I would expect to see significant output measures for low-carbon initiatives, promoting flexibility of the network and other net-zero-related outputs. So while incentives are not a significant component of the gas and transmission subsector reviews, we absolutely continue to expect it to be meaningful for ED2. 
And finally, regarding our 2020 earnings forecast, while COVID-19 has had an impact on our year-to-date financial results and we expect it to negatively impact the remainder of the year as well, we continue to believe the full year impact will be manageable. Therefore, we reiterated our earnings guidance range for 2020 of $2.40 to $2.60 per share, with results expected to track towards the lower end of our forecast range given COVID and unfavorable weather in the first half of the year. 
In a positive sign, we began to see a gradual easing of restrictions later in the quarter that dampened some of the impact we were seeing in April from strict lockdown measures. Residential load continues to be stronger than planned as a result of the continued work-from-home measures. And while C&I is still below plan in all 3 business units, it is not as bad as we were originally expecting it to be. 
Regarding 2021, we are withdrawing our prior 2021 forecast as a result of today's announcement regarding the potential sale of the U.K. business, and we will provide an updated 2021 forecast at the conclusion of the process, which we expect to occur in the first half of 2021. 
I'll now turn the call over to Joe for a more detailed financial update. Joe?"

I'll cover our second quarter segment results on Slide 6. First, I'd like to highlight that the estimated impact from COVID on our second quarter results was about $0.06 per share, which was primarily due to lower sales volumes in the U.K. and lower demand revenue in Kentucky. As we outlined in our projections on the first quarter call, about 2/3 of the impact or $0.04 per share is recoverable through the U.K. decoupling mechanism on a 2-year lag. I'll discuss further the impacts of COVID on the quarterly sales volumes in more detail in a few moments. 
Turning to the quarterly walk and starting with Q2 2019 ongoing results on the left, we first reflect adjustments for weather and dilution for comparability purposes of the underlying businesses. During the second quarter, we experienced a $0.01 favorable variance due to weather compared to the second quarter of 2019, primarily in Pennsylvania. Compared to our forecast, weather in the second quarter was about $0.01 unfavorable variance with stronger load in Pennsylvania being offset by more mild weather in the U.K. and Kentucky versus normal conditions. In terms of dilution, we saw a $0.03 impact in the quarter primarily driven by the November 2019 draw on our equity forward contracts. 
Moving to the segment drivers, excluding these items, our U.K. regulated segment earned $0.33 per share in the second quarter 2020. This represents a $0.01 decrease compared to a year ago. The decline was primarily due to lower sales volumes, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 and lower other income due to lower pension income. These decreases were partially offset by higher realized foreign currency exchange rates compared to the prior period, with Q2 2020 average rates of $1.63 per pound compared to $1.36 per pound in Q2 2019. I'll note that we layered on additional hedges since our last quarterly call, and are now hedged at 95% for the balance of 2020 at an average hedge rate of $1.47 per pound. And in light of today's announcement, we do not plan to add additional earnings hedges to 2021. 
Moving to Pennsylvania, we earned $0.15 per share, which was $0.02 higher than our comparable results in Q2 2019. The increase was primarily driven by higher adjusted gross margins, primarily resulting from returns on additional capital investments in transmission. This increase was partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expense. 
I'll note that our customer mix mitigated the impact on sales from COVID-19, as our positive impact from our significant residential base in Pennsylvania and fixed charges more than offset lower demand in the C&I sectors. 
Turning to our Kentucky regulated segment. We earned $0.10 per share a $0.03 decrease from our results 1 year ago. The decline was primarily due to lower commercial and industrial demand due to the impact of COVID-19 and higher income taxes due to a tax credit recognized in the second quarter of 2019. These decreases were partially offset by higher retail rates that were effective May 1, 2019. Results at Corporate and Other were $0.01 higher compared with a year ago, driven by several factors, none of which were individually significant. 
Turning to Slide 7. We outline the changes in weather-normalized sales for each segment by customer class. As expected and reflected in the financial results, we saw lower demand in the C&I sectors, partially offset by higher demand in the residential space in each of our service territories. In addition, as Vince pointed out, the reopenings that we observed, primarily in June, substantially reduced the impact on load. For example, in Kentucky and Pennsylvania, we went from 15% to 20% C&I load declines at the peak of the lockdowns in April to more modest declines of 8% and 2%, respectively, for the month of June. 
In the U.K., we saw some positive momentum as the U.K. government downgraded its alert level midmonth, although the recovery was more modest, with June demand down about 11% versus the prior year. I'll note for this slide, the quarterly information presented for the U.K. aligns with our financial statement presentation on a 1-month lag and shows the period-over-period variances from March, April and May. Looking forward, we are encouraged by the recovery we've seen in June, which gives us more comfort in reaffirming the 2020 forecast today, albeit at the lower end of the range. We expect the annualized load sensitivities by segment that we provided last quarter, will remain as good guide as we move through the balance of the year. 
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Vince."

Let me conclude today's remarks with an outline of some of my key areas of focus for the company and my excitement for PPL's bright future. As I've mentioned to many of you over the past few months, I'm extremely proud of our operational excellence at PPL, which is core to our mission of delivering safe and reliable service at an affordable price. This has been and will continue to be a priority for the company as it has led to continuous innovation and operational improvements that are driving our premier customer service and satisfaction levels. One of my goals is to take this culture of operational excellence and find ways to leverage it to drive additional value for our customers and shareowners. Another one of my goals is to improve our overall TSR performance and the strategic repositioning announced this morning as one step in that direction. 
I'm sure our decision to launch a sale process for WPD doesn't become as a surprise to investors, given PPL's stock performance over the past few years. We believe today's announcement creates the best path forward to improve our TSR by simplifying the business mix, reducing our leverage, improving our earnings growth rate and enhancing our ability to invest in sustainable energy solutions. 
Another key area of focus will be to reduce the carbon footprint of the company. We've already communicated our targets of reducing CO2 emissions by at least 70% by 2040, and at least 80% by 2050. With the declining cost of renewable energy, we believe there will be a real opportunity to accelerate decarbonization of our Kentucky fleet under regulatory oversight and with economic benefit for our customers. 
In closing, I'm very excited for the future of PPL. I firmly believe that the company's organic growth opportunities and strengthened financial flexibility expected from today's announced strategic repositioning, best position PPL to deliver long-term value to both our shareowners and our customers. We look forward to providing further updates at the conclusion of the process or as appropriate. 
With that, operator, let's open the call for questions."

We've been very transparent with the market and our investors that while we constantly review strategic options to maximize value, that we would not engage in M&A unless we thought, right, that it would create value for our shareowners. And as I said in my prepared remarks, at this point, we believe that the market has shifted and that executing a sale of WPD will, in fact, create not only immediate value for shareowners, but will set the company up going forward for longer-term growth with a stronger balance sheet.
In terms of the market backdrop, right, last year, we had the general election in the U.K. Corbyn election they had failed. Re-nationalization risk is in the rearview mirror. We believe there's been additional clarity around the RIIO-2 process, primarily for electric distribution, which supports what we've been saying from the beginning in terms of supporting electric distribution and the road to 0 kind of flowing through that subsector. So we've gotten some clarity on all that. Unfortunately, that additional clarity really has not improved our stock price performance, certainly not to the level we would have expected. And in fact, the discount has widened compared to our peers. So again, the market also on the buy side for these types of assets is pretty strong right now in Europe. There has been a number of comps that we saw starting with gas distribution in the U.K., electric distribution in the U.K. and then some other electric assets in broader Europe that have yielded some very strong results. So we think given the quality of the U.K. business and the management team and again, the subsector that we're dealing with, we firmly believe that the process will be successful, and will garner a greater value for WPD and a sale process then will be recognized in the share price."

So on the generic use of proceeds, Julien, maybe let me just talk about how we're kind of thinking about that. I kind of put it into 4 main buckets, right? The first will be to strengthen the balance sheet, better position us moving forward. And again, I think, targeting a mid-teens FFO to debt based on our discussions with the agencies, we think that maintain solid investment-grade credit ratings, where we are currently coming out of this with a lot more flexibility and levers to pull as we think about future growth of the company moving forward. So that would kind of the bucket #1.
The second, which is kind of to your point, looking at future long-term earnings growth with investments in regulated utility assets. As we think about the operating model that we've deployed at PPL and the efficiency of that model. We think we can acquire some U.S. utility assets, whether it's part of the consideration coming from the deal or to your point, a potential follow-on and create significant shareholder and customer value. I'll just use PPL Electric Utilities here in Pennsylvania as an example of what we've been able to accomplish. 
Since 2011, we've grown our rate base CAGR in PA by about 12% at the same time, our O&M has grown less than 1%. And our average PPL Electric Utility rate is about 25% less than the average in the Mid-Atlantic region. We've improved our customer satisfaction score from J.D. Power by about 20%. And of course, improved reliability at the same time by about 30%. So the kind of the strategy that underpinned that was a clear focus on hardening our system as we were making these investments, including advanced market technology and grid automation, of course, looking at a better integration of distributed energy resources, including distributed energy resource management system. So the software side of that as well.
And then moving to digital technologies on the IT front has done a lot to actually reduce the O&M and drive that less than 1% CAGR that I talked about. And so all of that kind of results in our ability to become more efficient, deploy that capital into the network and bring the network into a state that's more flexible, more automated and more friendly to distributed energy resources and green sources of power.
So we think at this point that we've gotten that model that to a point where we could replicate that. And so again, if we're able to acquire an asset in the U.S., either through the consideration or a follow-on, we think that would be another opportunity to create long-term value, again, both for shareholders and customers.

It is common in Europe to announce these types of sale processes at the time you launch it as opposed to waiting. And so we believe the buyer universe will be those that -- or will include those that have played in that European market. So having a process that's more into what they're accustomed to, we think, will help with the process itself. So we think we've just maximized the flexibility.

But as a result of the announcement today, we're not adjusting the dividend at all. And that will continue to remain an important part of our overall TSR, which has always been the case for PPL and will continue.

I'm excited to be leading my first earnings call as CEO, as we certainly have a lot to talk about this morning. With me today are Joe Bergstein, our Chief Financial Officer; Greg Dudkin, the Head of our Pennsylvania utility business; Paul Thompson, the Head of our Kentucky utility business; and Phil Swift, who leads WPD, our electric distribution business in the U.K. 
Moving to Slide 3. I'll begin this morning's call with comments on today's announcement to initiate a process to sell our operations in the U.K. Then I'll discuss some quarterly highlights and operational updates, including our continued strong performance during COVID-19 pandemic and some thoughts around Ofgem's latest publications on the RIIO-2 process. Joe will then provide a more detailed review of the second quarter financial update and as always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions. 
So turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced after completing a comprehensive strategic review with our Board of Directors, that we are going to initiate a process to sell our U.K. business, WPD. We've engaged JPMorgan to lead that process for us. The sale would strategically reposition PPL as a purely U.S. utility holding company, sharpening our focus on rate-regulated assets in the U.S. and improving our ability to invest in sustainable energy solutions. We expect the proceeds from the sale would be used to strengthen our balance sheet, and enhance our long-term earnings growth, which could include supporting U.S. asset acquisitions and returning capital to shareowners. 
We believe there are multiple ways in which this transaction will create shareowner value. First, we strongly believe the sale price, net of any tax, will be higher than the sum of the parts value currently embedded in PPL stock price. Second, we believe we will have a much stronger balance sheet post sale. Targeting mid- teens FFO to debt metric. Third, we believe we can target an EPS growth rate more in line with our U.S. utility peers. And finally, assuming we acquire another U.S. utility, we believe we can leverage our operational excellence and efficient business model to create even more value for both customers and shareowners. 
We've been very transparent with investors that while we constantly analyze strategic alternatives, we would not engage in M&A unless we could do it in a way that would create shareholder value. We firmly believe that the sale of WPD at this time will unlock value for our shareowners. As we've been saying for a number of years, we believe WPD represents the premier asset group with an extremely high-performing management team in the best energy subsector in the U.K., i.e., electric distribution. We are more confident than ever that the road to net-zero carbon emissions in the U.K. will flow through electric distribution. 
And significant investment will be required in that sector, if the U.K. is going to achieve its net-zero goals, which Ofgem reaffirmed over a week ago in the electric distribution subsector consultation. I expect that WPD will have the opportunity to earn reasonable returns and invest significant amounts of capital during RIIO-ED2 and well beyond that. As such, the decision to sell WPD is in no way a negative reflection on our WPD team or the WPD business. In fact, it's quite the opposite. We are extremely proud of the financial and operational results that WPD has achieved over the past 2 decades, and we are confident they will continue to deliver in the future. 
And while we believe the public market continues to discount the value of WPD and our share price, we firmly expect that a wide range of strategic and financial buyers will demonstrate significant interest in this highly attractive asset. There are several recent precedent transactions of regulated networks in the U.K. and across broader Europe that support our position. 
Given the relative attractiveness of electric distribution and the superior quality of the WPD business, we would expect WPD to attract a premium valuation. We expect to evaluate a variety of offers for the purchase of WPD, including all cash or a combination of cash and U.S. utility assets. Regarding timing, we would intend to announce a transaction within the first half of next year. Let me just end by saying the plan to sell WPD as part of a broader strategic repositioning of the company, which we believe will result in a new PPL with a stronger balance sheet, a more focused growth strategy in the U.S. and an improved position to reduce its carbon footprint. 
We believe this will lead to a stronger outlook for the company with a competitive TSR and compelling growth prospects. The dividend has been and will remain an important part of total shareowner return for PPL investors. There's no change in the dividend as a result of the announcement this morning. The Board will assess the dividend at the appropriate time in connection with the resulting transaction. 
Now let me make some high-level comments on the quarterly results before turning it over to Joe for the more detailed quarterly review. Turning to Slide 5. Today, we announced second quarter reported earnings of $0.45 per share. Adjusting for special items, second quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.55 per share compared with $0.58 per share a year ago. 
Turning to a brief update on the impacts of COVID-19. I'm pleased to report that we continue to deliver electricity and natural gas safely and reliably as our customers navigate the challenges of this pandemic. As we highlighted on our first quarter call, we acted swiftly and aggressively to implement social distancing and minimize the spread of the virus within our company. This included shifting about 35% to 40% of our workforce or more than 4,500 employees to work from home, and creating additional separation for those who must still report to a PPL facility due to the nature of their jobs. 
With health and safety, our top priority, these steps remain in place today, even as restrictions have begun to ease in the regions in which we operate. And while we continue to plan for what reentry to the workplace will look like for those now at home, we plan to move very cautiously and continue to follow guidance from the CDC and state and local health departments. As a result of the measures we've taken, we've been very effective in minimizing the impact of COVID-19 on our workforce and our operations. 
While the most recent tropical storm, Isaias, has impacted about 70,000 of our customers in Pennsylvania, we were able to restore power to most of them within 24 hours and all of them within 48 hours, reinforcing, again, little to no impact from COVID-19 on our ability to serve our customers even in the worst of conditions. 
Further, we remain well positioned from a supply chain perspective, and our capital plans remain on track if we've experienced minimal delays, apart from the early lockdown phase in the U.K. 
Finally, from a financial perspective, we've maintained a strong liquidity position of over $4 billion. Our cash receipts have remained steady and minimal impact on our allowance for bad debt. 
Turning to a U.K. regulatory update. We've seen some recent developments pertaining to the next price control period, RIIO-2. First, we were not surprised at all by the recent outcomes of the draft determinations for gas and transmission published in early July. Ofgem has been very clear about 3 things in their RIIO-2 messaging. They are going to incentivize investment that supports the U.K.'s net-zero carbon ambitions, they will ensure customer bills remain affordable, and there will be significant investment required in electric distribution over at least the next decade. 
We've said all along that Ofgem was going to deemphasize the gas and transmission sectors in favor of electric distribution, not because they are picking winners and losers, but because they fundamentally know the electric distribution networks will require significant investment going forward. In order for customers to afford that level of investment, they need to build headroom into customer bills, with lower returns and lower investment levels in gas and transmission. We believe that is why Ofgem has been so critical of the investment plans of both the gas and transmission subsectors. On average, Ofgem cut the gas investment plans by about 20% and cut the transmission plans by about 45%. While Ofgem indicated there would be potential opportunity for some of that investment to be approved in the final determinations, which will come out later this year, I don't believe Ofgem is going to make it easy on these sectors. 
WPD is in the fortunate position, however, to be able to follow the gas and transmission process through to the end, prior to us having to submit our business plans mid next year. Therefore, we are expecting that the RIIO-ED2 process for WPD will be much smoother and more successful. 
The sector-specific methodology consultation on electric distribution that was released just over a week ago was also largely in line with our expectations. Ofgem made it clear that the DNOs were going to be critical to supporting the decarbonization efforts in the U.K. to deliver a net-zero economy. And we continue to agree that we are best positioned to deliver on those objectives. While we are still in the early stages of this process, WPD is very focused and engaged with our stakeholders and Ofgem to ensure we deliver a plan that will achieve these goals. We've led the way in RIIO-1 in terms of stakeholder engagement, and we'll continue to lead in this area as we begin our business planning process towards the end of this year. 
While many of the parameters are still being developed, let me talk a little bit about our expectations for the electric distribution incentive package. Based on our recent discussions with Ofgem, we expect the incentive scheme for ED2 to continue to play a significant role in the overall returns for the electric distribution sector, much more significant compared to gas and transmission. In addition to the reliability and customer incentives we're accustomed to, I would expect to see significant output measures for low-carbon initiatives, promoting flexibility of the network and other net-zero-related outputs. So while incentives are not a significant component of the gas and transmission subsector reviews, we absolutely continue to expect it to be meaningful for ED2. 
And finally, regarding our 2020 earnings forecast, while COVID-19 has had an impact on our year-to-date financial results and we expect it to negatively impact the remainder of the year as well, we continue to believe the full year impact will be manageable. Therefore, we reiterated our earnings guidance range for 2020 of $2.40 to $2.60 per share, with results expected to track towards the lower end of our forecast range given COVID and unfavorable weather in the first half of the year. 
In a positive sign, we began to see a gradual easing of restrictions later in the quarter that dampened some of the impact we were seeing in April from strict lockdown measures. Residential load continues to be stronger than planned as a result of the continued work-from-home measures. And while C&I is still below plan in all 3 business units, it is not as bad as we were originally expecting it to be. 
Regarding 2021, we are withdrawing our prior 2021 forecast as a result of today's announcement regarding the potential sale of the U.K. business, and we will provide an updated 2021 forecast at the conclusion of the process, which we expect to occur in the first half of 2021. 
I'll now turn the call over to Joe for a more detailed financial update. Joe?"

I'll cover our second quarter segment results on Slide 6. First, I'd like to highlight that the estimated impact from COVID on our second quarter results was about $0.06 per share, which was primarily due to lower sales volumes in the U.K. and lower demand revenue in Kentucky. As we outlined in our projections on the first quarter call, about 2/3 of the impact or $0.04 per share is recoverable through the U.K. decoupling mechanism on a 2-year lag. I'll discuss further the impacts of COVID on the quarterly sales volumes in more detail in a few moments. 
Turning to the quarterly walk and starting with Q2 2019 ongoing results on the left, we first reflect adjustments for weather and dilution for comparability purposes of the underlying businesses. During the second quarter, we experienced a $0.01 favorable variance due to weather compared to the second quarter of 2019, primarily in Pennsylvania. Compared to our forecast, weather in the second quarter was about $0.01 unfavorable variance with stronger load in Pennsylvania being offset by more mild weather in the U.K. and Kentucky versus normal conditions. In terms of dilution, we saw a $0.03 impact in the quarter primarily driven by the November 2019 draw on our equity forward contracts. 
Moving to the segment drivers, excluding these items, our U.K. regulated segment earned $0.33 per share in the second quarter 2020. This represents a $0.01 decrease compared to a year ago. The decline was primarily due to lower sales volumes, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 and lower other income due to lower pension income. These decreases were partially offset by higher realized foreign currency exchange rates compared to the prior period, with Q2 2020 average rates of $1.63 per pound compared to $1.36 per pound in Q2 2019. I'll note that we layered on additional hedges since our last quarterly call, and are now hedged at 95% for the balance of 2020 at an average hedge rate of $1.47 per pound. And in light of today's announcement, we do not plan to add additional earnings hedges to 2021. 
Moving to Pennsylvania, we earned $0.15 per share, which was $0.02 higher than our comparable results in Q2 2019. The increase was primarily driven by higher adjusted gross margins, primarily resulting from returns on additional capital investments in transmission. This increase was partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expense. 
I'll note that our customer mix mitigated the impact on sales from COVID-19, as our positive impact from our significant residential base in Pennsylvania and fixed charges more than offset lower demand in the C&I sectors. 
Turning to our Kentucky regulated segment. We earned $0.10 per share a $0.03 decrease from our results 1 year ago. The decline was primarily due to lower commercial and industrial demand due to the impact of COVID-19 and higher income taxes due to a tax credit recognized in the second quarter of 2019. These decreases were partially offset by higher retail rates that were effective May 1, 2019. Results at Corporate and Other were $0.01 higher compared with a year ago, driven by several factors, none of which were individually significant. 
Turning to Slide 7. We outline the changes in weather-normalized sales for each segment by customer class. As expected and reflected in the financial results, we saw lower demand in the C&I sectors, partially offset by higher demand in the residential space in each of our service territories. In addition, as Vince pointed out, the reopenings that we observed, primarily in June, substantially reduced the impact on load. For example, in Kentucky and Pennsylvania, we went from 15% to 20% C&I load declines at the peak of the lockdowns in April to more modest declines of 8% and 2%, respectively, for the month of June. 
In the U.K., we saw some positive momentum as the U.K. government downgraded its alert level midmonth, although the recovery was more modest, with June demand down about 11% versus the prior year. I'll note for this slide, the quarterly information presented for the U.K. aligns with our financial statement presentation on a 1-month lag and shows the period-over-period variances from March, April and May. Looking forward, we are encouraged by the recovery we've seen in June, which gives us more comfort in reaffirming the 2020 forecast today, albeit at the lower end of the range. We expect the annualized load sensitivities by segment that we provided last quarter, will remain as good guide as we move through the balance of the year. That concludes my prepared remarks. 
And I'll turn the call back over to Vince."

Let me conclude today's remarks with an outline of some of my key areas of focus for the company and my excitement for PPL's bright future. As I've mentioned to many of you over the past few months, I'm extremely proud of our operational excellence at PPL, which is core to our mission of delivering safe and reliable service at an affordable price. This has been and will continue to be a priority for the company as it has led to continuous innovation and operational improvements that are driving our premier customer service and satisfaction levels. One of my goals is to take this culture of operational excellence and find ways to leverage it to drive additional value for our customers and shareowners. Another one of my goals is to improve our overall TSR performance and the strategic repositioning announced this morning as one step in that direction. 
I'm sure our decision to launch a sale process for WPD doesn't become as a surprise to investors, given PPL's stock performance over the past few years. We believe today's announcement creates the best path forward to improve our TSR by simplifying the business mix, reducing our leverage, improving our earnings growth rate and enhancing our ability to invest in sustainable energy solutions. 
Another key area of focus will be to reduce the carbon footprint of the company. We've already communicated our targets of reducing CO2 emissions by at least 70% by 2040, and at least 80% by 2050. With the declining cost of renewable energy, we believe there will be a real opportunity to accelerate decarbonization of our Kentucky fleet under regulatory oversight and with economic benefit for our customers. 
In closing, I'm very excited for the future of PPL. I firmly believe that the company's organic growth opportunities and strengthened financial flexibility expected from today's announced strategic repositioning, best position PPL to deliver long-term value to both our shareowners and our customers. We look forward to providing further updates at the conclusion of the process or as appropriate.

And as I said in my prepared remarks, at this point, we believe that the market has shifted and that executing a sale of WPD will, in fact, create not only immediate value for shareowners, but will set the company up going forward for longer-term growth with a stronger balance sheet.
In terms of the market backdrop, right, last year, we had the general election in the U.K. Corbyn election they had failed. Re-nationalization risk is in the rearview mirror. We believe there's been additional clarity around the RIIO-2 process, primarily for electric distribution, which supports what we've been saying from the beginning in terms of supporting electric distribution and the road to 0 kind of flowing through that subsector. So we've gotten some clarity on all that. Unfortunately, that additional clarity really has not improved our stock price performance, certainly not to the level we would have expected. And in fact, the discount has widened compared to our peers. So again, the market also on the buy side for these types of assets is pretty strong right now in Europe. There has been a number of comps that we saw starting with gas distribution in the U.K., electric distribution in the U.K. and then some other electric assets in broader Europe that have yielded some very strong results. So we think given the quality of the U.K. business and the management team and again, the subsector that we're dealing with, we firmly believe that the process will be successful, and will garner a greater value for WPD and a sale process then will be recognized in the share price."

So on the generic use of proceeds, Julien, maybe let me just talk about how we're kind of thinking about that. I kind of put it into 4 main buckets, right? The first will be to strengthen the balance sheet, better position us moving forward. And again, I think, targeting a mid-teens FFO to debt based on our discussions with the agencies, we think that maintain solid investment-grade credit ratings, where we are currently coming out of this with a lot more flexibility and levers to pull as we think about future growth of the company moving forward. So that would kind of the bucket #1.
The second, which is kind of to your point, looking at future long-term earnings growth with investments in regulated utility assets. As we think about the operating model that we've deployed at PPL and the efficiency of that model. We think we can acquire some U.S. utility assets, whether it's part of the consideration coming from the deal or to your point, a potential follow-on and create significant shareholder and customer value. I'll just use PPL Electric Utilities here in Pennsylvania as an example of what we've been able to accomplish. 
Since 2011, we've grown our rate base CAGR in PA by about 12% at the same time, our O&M has grown less than 1%. And our average PPL Electric Utility rate is about 25% less than the average in the Mid-Atlantic region. We've improved our customer satisfaction score from J.D. Power by about 20%. And of course, improved reliability at the same time by about 30%. So the kind of the strategy that underpinned that was a clear focus on hardening our system as we were making these investments, including advanced market technology and grid automation, of course, looking at a better integration of distributed energy resources, including distributed energy resource management system. So the software side of that as well.
And then moving to digital technologies on the IT front has done a lot to actually reduce the O&M and drive that less than 1% CAGR that I talked about. And so all of that kind of results in our ability to become more efficient, deploy that capital into the network and bring the network into a state that's more flexible, more automated and more friendly to distributed energy resources and green sources of power.
So we think at this point that we've gotten that model that to a point where we could replicate that. And so again, if we're able to acquire an asset in the U.S., either through the consideration or a follow-on, we think that would be another opportunity to create long-term value, again, both for shareholders and customers.
Kind of the third bucket..."

But given the amount of questions that we've gotten from investors and from sell-side over the years, specifically regarding strategic alternatives for WPD. We just wanted to be transparent with the market and announced the process. It also has benefits in terms of the process itself. It is common in Europe to announce these types of sale processes at the time you launch it as opposed to waiting. And so we believe the buyer universe will be those that -- or will include those that have played in that European market. So having a process that's more into what they're accustomed to, we think, will help with the process itself. So we think we've just maximized the flexibility. We think there'll be a lot of interest and just improves the probability that we'll be able to execute it. So I just wanted to just make a general comment on that.

I'm excited to be leading my first earnings call as CEO, as we certainly have a lot to talk about this morning. With me today are Joe Bergstein, our Chief Financial Officer; Greg Dudkin, the Head of our Pennsylvania utility business; Paul Thompson, the Head of our Kentucky utility business; and Phil Swift, who leads WPD, our electric distribution business in the U.K. 
Moving to Slide 3. I'll begin this morning's call with comments on today's announcement to initiate a process to sell our operations in the U.K. Then I'll discuss some quarterly highlights and operational updates, including our continued strong performance during COVID-19 pandemic and some thoughts around Ofgem's latest publications on the RIIO-2 process. Joe will then provide a more detailed review of the second quarter financial update and as always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions. 
So turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced after completing a comprehensive strategic review with our Board of Directors, that we are going to initiate a process to sell our U.K. business, WPD. We've engaged JPMorgan to lead that process for us. The sale would strategically reposition PPL as a purely U.S. utility holding company, sharpening our focus on rate-regulated assets in the U.S. and improving our ability to invest in sustainable energy solutions. We expect the proceeds from the sale would be used to strengthen our balance sheet, and enhance our long-term earnings growth, which could include supporting U.S. asset acquisitions and returning capital to shareowners. 
We believe there are multiple ways in which this transaction will create shareowner value. First, we strongly believe the sale price, net of any tax, will be higher than the sum of the parts value currently embedded in PPL stock price. Second, we believe we will have a much stronger balance sheet post sale. Targeting mid- teens FFO to debt metric. Third, we believe we can target an EPS growth rate more in line with our U.S. utility peers. And finally, assuming we acquire another U.S. utility, we believe we can leverage our operational excellence and efficient business model to create even more value for both customers and shareowners. 
We've been very transparent with investors that while we constantly analyze strategic alternatives, we would not engage in M&A unless we could do it in a way that would create shareholder value. We firmly believe that the sale of WPD at this time will unlock value for our shareowners. As we've been saying for a number of years, we believe WPD represents the premier asset group with an extremely high-performing management team in the best energy subsector in the U.K., i.e., electric distribution. We are more confident than ever that the road to net-zero carbon emissions in the U.K. will flow through electric distribution. 
And significant investment will be required in that sector, if the U.K. is going to achieve its net-zero goals, which Ofgem reaffirmed over a week ago in the electric distribution subsector consultation. I expect that WPD will have the opportunity to earn reasonable returns and invest significant amounts of capital during RIIO-ED2 and well beyond that. As such, the decision to sell WPD is in no way a negative reflection on our WPD team or the WPD business. In fact, it's quite the opposite. We are extremely proud of the financial and operational results that WPD has achieved over the past 2 decades, and we are confident they will continue to deliver in the future. 
And while we believe the public market continues to discount the value of WPD and our share price, we firmly expect that a wide range of strategic and financial buyers will demonstrate significant interest in this highly attractive asset. There are several recent precedent transactions of regulated networks in the U.K. and across broader Europe that support our position. 
Given the relative attractiveness of electric distribution and the superior quality of the WPD business, we would expect WPD to attract a premium valuation. We expect to evaluate a variety of offers for the purchase of WPD, including all cash or a combination of cash and U.S. utility assets. Regarding timing, we would intend to announce a transaction within the first half of next year. Let me just end by saying the plan to sell WPD as part of a broader strategic repositioning of the company, which we believe will result in a new PPL with a stronger balance sheet, a more focused growth strategy in the U.S. and an improved position to reduce its carbon footprint. 
We believe this will lead to a stronger outlook for the company with a competitive TSR and compelling growth prospects. The dividend has been and will remain an important part of total shareowner return for PPL investors. There's no change in the dividend as a result of the announcement this morning. The Board will assess the dividend at the appropriate time in connection with the resulting transaction. 
Now let me make some high-level comments on the quarterly results before turning it over to Joe for the more detailed quarterly review. Turning to Slide 5. Today, we announced second quarter reported earnings of $0.45 per share. Adjusting for special items, second quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.55 per share compared with $0.58 per share a year ago. 
Turning to a brief update on the impacts of COVID-19. I'm pleased to report that we continue to deliver electricity and natural gas safely and reliably as our customers navigate the challenges of this pandemic. As we highlighted on our first quarter call, we acted swiftly and aggressively to implement social distancing and minimize the spread of the virus within our company. This included shifting about 35% to 40% of our workforce or more than 4,500 employees to work from home, and creating additional separation for those who must still report to a PPL facility due to the nature of their jobs. 
With health and safety, our top priority, these steps remain in place today, even as restrictions have begun to ease in the regions in which we operate. And while we continue to plan for what reentry to the workplace will look like for those now at home, we plan to move very cautiously and continue to follow guidance from the CDC and state and local health departments. As a result of the measures we've taken, we've been very effective in minimizing the impact of COVID-19 on our workforce and our operations. 
While the most recent tropical storm, Isaias, has impacted about 70,000 of our customers in Pennsylvania, we were able to restore power to most of them within 24 hours and all of them within 48 hours, reinforcing, again, little to no impact from COVID-19 on our ability to serve our customers even in the worst of conditions. 
Further, we remain well positioned from a supply chain perspective, and our capital plans remain on track if we've experienced minimal delays, apart from the early lockdown phase in the U.K. 
Finally, from a financial perspective, we've maintained a strong liquidity position of over $4 billion. Our cash receipts have remained steady and minimal impact on our allowance for bad debt. 
Turning to a U.K. regulatory update. We've seen some recent developments pertaining to the next price control period, RIIO-2. First, we were not surprised at all by the recent outcomes of the draft determinations for gas and transmission published in early July. Ofgem has been very clear about 3 things in their RIIO-2 messaging. They are going to incentivize investment that supports the U.K.'s net-zero carbon ambitions, they will ensure customer bills remain affordable, and there will be significant investment required in electric distribution over at least the next decade. 
We've said all along that Ofgem was going to deemphasize the gas and transmission sectors in favor of electric distribution, not because they are picking winners and losers, but because they fundamentally know the electric distribution networks will require significant investment going forward. In order for customers to afford that level of investment, they need to build headroom into customer bills, with lower returns and lower investment levels in gas and transmission. We believe that is why Ofgem has been so critical of the investment plans of both the gas and transmission subsectors. On average, Ofgem cut the gas investment plans by about 20% and cut the transmission plans by about 45%. While Ofgem indicated there would be potential opportunity for some of that investment to be approved in the final determinations, which will come out later this year, I don't believe Ofgem is going to make it easy on these sectors. 
WPD is in the fortunate position, however, to be able to follow the gas and transmission process through to the end, prior to us having to submit our business plans mid next year. Therefore, we are expecting that the RIIO-ED2 process for WPD will be much smoother and more successful. 
The sector-specific methodology consultation on electric distribution that was released just over a week ago was also largely in line with our expectations. Ofgem made it clear that the DNOs were going to be critical to supporting the decarbonization efforts in the U.K. to deliver a net-zero economy. And we continue to agree that we are best positioned to deliver on those objectives. While we are still in the early stages of this process, WPD is very focused and engaged with our stakeholders and Ofgem to ensure we deliver a plan that will achieve these goals. We've led the way in RIIO-1 in terms of stakeholder engagement, and we'll continue to lead in this area as we begin our business planning process towards the end of this year. 
While many of the parameters are still being developed, let me talk a little bit about our expectations for the electric distribution incentive package. Based on our recent discussions with Ofgem, we expect the incentive scheme for ED2 to continue to play a significant role in the overall returns for the electric distribution sector, much more significant compared to gas and transmission. In addition to the reliability and customer incentives we're accustomed to, I would expect to see significant output measures for low-carbon initiatives, promoting flexibility of the network and other net-zero-related outputs. So while incentives are not a significant component of the gas and transmission subsector reviews, we absolutely continue to expect it to be meaningful for ED2. 
And finally, regarding our 2020 earnings forecast, while COVID-19 has had an impact on our year-to-date financial results and we expect it to negatively impact the remainder of the year as well, we continue to believe the full year impact will be manageable. Therefore, we reiterated our earnings guidance range for 2020 of $2.40 to $2.60 per share, with results expected to track towards the lower end of our forecast range given COVID and unfavorable weather in the first half of the year. 
In a positive sign, we began to see a gradual easing of restrictions later in the quarter that dampened some of the impact we were seeing in April from strict lockdown measures. Residential load continues to be stronger than planned as a result of the continued work-from-home measures. And while C&I is still below plan in all 3 business units, it is not as bad as we were originally expecting it to be. 
Regarding 2021, we are withdrawing our prior 2021 forecast as a result of today's announcement regarding the potential sale of the U.K. business, and we will provide an updated 2021 forecast at the conclusion of the process, which we expect to occur in the first half of 2021. 
I'll now turn the call over to Joe for a more detailed financial update. Joe?"
185508,678480436,2114804,"PPL Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 10, 2020",2020-08-10,"Earnings Calls","PPL Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. I'll cover our second quarter segment results on Slide 6.

I'll cover our second quarter segment results on Slide 6. First, I'd like to highlight that the estimated impact from COVID on our second quarter results was about $0.06 per share, which was primarily due to lower sales volumes in the U.K. and lower demand revenue in Kentucky. As we outlined in our projections on the first quarter call, about 2/3 of the impact or $0.04 per share is recoverable through the U.K. decoupling mechanism on a 2-year lag. I'll discuss further the impacts of COVID on the quarterly sales volumes in more detail in a few moments. 
Turning to the quarterly walk and starting with Q2 2019 ongoing results on the left, we first reflect adjustments for weather and dilution for comparability purposes of the underlying businesses. During the second quarter, we experienced a $0.01 favorable variance due to weather compared to the second quarter of 2019, primarily in Pennsylvania. Compared to our forecast, weather in the second quarter was about $0.01 unfavorable variance with stronger load in Pennsylvania being offset by more mild weather in the U.K. and Kentucky versus normal conditions. In terms of dilution, we saw a $0.03 impact in the quarter primarily driven by the November 2019 draw on our equity forward contracts. 
Moving to the segment drivers, excluding these items, our U.K. regulated segment earned $0.33 per share in the second quarter 2020. This represents a $0.01 decrease compared to a year ago. The decline was primarily due to lower sales volumes, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 and lower other income due to lower pension income. These decreases were partially offset by higher realized foreign currency exchange rates compared to the prior period, with Q2 2020 average rates of $1.63 per pound compared to $1.36 per pound in Q2 2019. I'll note that we layered on additional hedges since our last quarterly call, and are now hedged at 95% for the balance of 2020 at an average hedge rate of $1.47 per pound. And in light of today's announcement, we do not plan to add additional earnings hedges to 2021. 
Moving to Pennsylvania, we earned $0.15 per share, which was $0.02 higher than our comparable results in Q2 2019. The increase was primarily driven by higher adjusted gross margins, primarily resulting from returns on additional capital investments in transmission. This increase was partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expense. 
I'll note that our customer mix mitigated the impact on sales from COVID-19, as our positive impact from our significant residential base in Pennsylvania and fixed charges more than offset lower demand in the C&I sectors. 
Turning to our Kentucky regulated segment. We earned $0.10 per share a $0.03 decrease from our results 1 year ago. The decline was primarily due to lower commercial and industrial demand due to the impact of COVID-19 and higher income taxes due to a tax credit recognized in the second quarter of 2019. These decreases were partially offset by higher retail rates that were effective May 1, 2019. Results at Corporate and Other were $0.01 higher compared with a year ago, driven by several factors, none of which were individually significant. 
Turning to Slide 7. We outline the changes in weather-normalized sales for each segment by customer class. As expected and reflected in the financial results, we saw lower demand in the C&I sectors, partially offset by higher demand in the residential space in each of our service territories. In addition, as Vince pointed out, the reopenings that we observed, primarily in June, substantially reduced the impact on load. For example, in Kentucky and Pennsylvania, we went from 15% to 20% C&I load declines at the peak of the lockdowns in April to more modest declines of 8% and 2%, respectively, for the month of June. 
In the U.K., we saw some positive momentum as the U.K. government downgraded its alert level midmonth, although the recovery was more modest, with June demand down about 11% versus the prior year. I'll note for this slide, the quarterly information presented for the U.K. aligns with our financial statement presentation on a 1-month lag and shows the period-over-period variances from March, April and May. Looking forward, we are encouraged by the recovery we've seen in June, which gives us more comfort in reaffirming the 2020 forecast today, albeit at the lower end of the range. We expect the annualized load sensitivities by segment that we provided last quarter, will remain as good guide as we move through the balance of the year. That concludes my prepared remarks. 
And I'll turn the call back over to Vince."

Let me conclude today's remarks with an outline of some of my key areas of focus for the company and my excitement for PPL's bright future. As I've mentioned to many of you over the past few months, I'm extremely proud of our operational excellence at PPL, which is core to our mission of delivering safe and reliable service at an affordable price. This has been and will continue to be a priority for the company as it has led to continuous innovation and operational improvements that are driving our premier customer service and satisfaction levels. One of my goals is to take this culture of operational excellence and find ways to leverage it to drive additional value for our customers and shareowners. Another one of my goals is to improve our overall TSR performance and the strategic repositioning announced this morning as one step in that direction. 
I'm sure our decision to launch a sale process for WPD doesn't become as a surprise to investors, given PPL's stock performance over the past few years. We believe today's announcement creates the best path forward to improve our TSR by simplifying the business mix, reducing our leverage, improving our earnings growth rate and enhancing our ability to invest in sustainable energy solutions. 
Another key area of focus will be to reduce the carbon footprint of the company. We've already communicated our targets of reducing CO2 emissions by at least 70% by 2040, and at least 80% by 2050. With the declining cost of renewable energy, we believe there will be a real opportunity to accelerate decarbonization of our Kentucky fleet under regulatory oversight and with economic benefit for our customers. 
In closing, I'm very excited for the future of PPL. I firmly believe that the company's organic growth opportunities and strengthened financial flexibility expected from today's announced strategic repositioning, best position PPL to deliver long-term value to both our shareowners and our customers. We look forward to providing further updates at the conclusion of the process or as appropriate.

So I think there's been quite a bit of change, actually, right? We've been very transparent with the market and our investors that while we constantly review strategic options to maximize value, that we would not engage in M&A unless we thought, right, that it would create value for our shareowners. And as I said in my prepared remarks, at this point, we believe that the market has shifted and that executing a sale of WPD will, in fact, create not only immediate value for shareowners, but will set the company up going forward for longer-term growth with a stronger balance sheet.
In terms of the market backdrop, right, last year, we had the general election in the U.K. Corbyn election they had failed. Re-nationalization risk is in the rearview mirror. We believe there's been additional clarity around the RIIO-2 process, primarily for electric distribution, which supports what we've been saying from the beginning in terms of supporting electric distribution and the road to 0 kind of flowing through that subsector. So we've gotten some clarity on all that. Unfortunately, that additional clarity really has not improved our stock price performance, certainly not to the level we would have expected. And in fact, the discount has widened compared to our peers. So again, the market also on the buy side for these types of assets is pretty strong right now in Europe. There has been a number of comps that we saw starting with gas distribution in the U.K., electric distribution in the U.K. and then some other electric assets in broader Europe that have yielded some very strong results. So we think given the quality of the U.K. business and the management team and again, the subsector that we're dealing with, we firmly believe that the process will be successful, and will garner a greater value for WPD and a sale process then will be recognized in the share price."

So on the generic use of proceeds, Julien, maybe let me just talk about how we're kind of thinking about that. I kind of put it into 4 main buckets, right? The first will be to strengthen the balance sheet, better position us moving forward. And again, I think, targeting a mid-teens FFO to debt based on our discussions with the agencies, we think that maintain solid investment-grade credit ratings, where we are currently coming out of this with a lot more flexibility and levers to pull as we think about future growth of the company moving forward. So that would kind of the bucket #1.
The second, which is kind of to your point, looking at future long-term earnings growth with investments in regulated utility assets. As we think about the operating model that we've deployed at PPL and the efficiency of that model. We think we can acquire some U.S. utility assets, whether it's part of the consideration coming from the deal or to your point, a potential follow-on and create significant shareholder and customer value. I'll just use PPL Electric Utilities here in Pennsylvania as an example of what we've been able to accomplish. 
Since 2011, we've grown our rate base CAGR in PA by about 12% at the same time, our O&M has grown less than 1%. And our average PPL Electric Utility rate is about 25% less than the average in the Mid-Atlantic region. We've improved our customer satisfaction score from J.D. Power by about 20%. And of course, improved reliability at the same time by about 30%. So the kind of the strategy that underpinned that was a clear focus on hardening our system as we were making these investments, including advanced market technology and grid automation, of course, looking at a better integration of distributed energy resources, including distributed energy resource management system. So the software side of that as well.
And then moving to digital technologies on the IT front has done a lot to actually reduce the O&M and drive that less than 1% CAGR that I talked about. And so all of that kind of results in our ability to become more efficient, deploy that capital into the network and bring the network into a state that's more flexible, more automated and more friendly to distributed energy resources and green sources of power.
So we think at this point that we've gotten that model that to a point where we could replicate that. And so again, if we're able to acquire an asset in the U.S., either through the consideration or a follow-on, we think that would be another opportunity to create long-term value, again, both for shareholders and customers.
Kind of the third bucket..."

And a lot of your questions may depend on what the actual transaction is, the proceeds and then the use of those proceeds. But given the amount of questions that we've gotten from investors and from sell-side over the years, specifically regarding strategic alternatives for WPD. We just wanted to be transparent with the market and announced the process. It also has benefits in terms of the process itself. It is common in Europe to announce these types of sale processes at the time you launch it as opposed to waiting. And so we believe the buyer universe will be those that -- or will include those that have played in that European market. So having a process that's more into what they're accustomed to, we think, will help with the process itself. So we think we've just maximized the flexibility. We think there'll be a lot of interest and just improves the probability that we'll be able to execute it. So I just wanted to just make a general comment on that.

We appreciate you joining us for our third quarter earnings call. 
With me today are Joe Bergstein, our Chief Financial Officer; Greg Dudkin, the Head of our Pennsylvania Utility Business; Paul Thompson, the Head of our Kentucky Utility Business; and Phil Swift, the Head of our U.K. Electric distribution business. 
Moving to Slide 3. I'll begin this morning with brief highlights on third quarter earnings results and our continued strong performance during the COVID-19 pandemic. I'll share a few updates on regulatory and ESG-related matters. And Joe will then provide a more detailed overview of the third quarter financial results. And as always, we'll leave ample time for your questions. 
Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced third quarter reported earnings of $0.37 per share. Adjusting for special items, primarily a deferred tax adjustment in the U.K. based on the 2020 Finance Act and unrealized losses on foreign currency economic hedges, third quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.58 per share compared with $0.61 per share a year ago. At a high level, results for the quarter were in line with our expectations. 
I'll note that the lower earnings compared to last year include $0.02 of lower volumes in the U.K., which will recover in future. And $0.01 due to the timing of our estimated federal income tax computation, which will reverse in Q4. Joe will cover the financial results in more detail in his section. 
Regarding a COVID update, throughout the quarter, we continued to deliver strong operational performance, providing outstanding customer service and reliability. At the same time, we've remained focused on innovation and building for the future. In September, we launched the new digitalization strategy in the U.K. The strategy focuses on transforming the way we develop and operate the network, to empower customers drive greater efficiency and deliver faster decarbonization. 
And in Pennsylvania during Q3, we reached the $1 million mark for customer outages avoided as a result of our investments in automated power restoration technology. Regarding customer sales during the quarter, residential load continued to be strong than our weather-normalized forecast, driven by sustained work from home measures in all of our service territories. Conversely, C&I demand remains lower in all 3 business units albeit less pronounced in Q3 than it had been earlier in the pandemic. 
From a financial perspective, we are well positioned to weather the continued economic downturn. We've maintained a strong liquidity position of over $4 billion. Our cash receipts remain steady and our capital plans remain largely intact. And as the moratoria are starting to lift across our U.S. service territories, we will comply with all state utility commission requirements and continue to work with our customers to maintain uninterrupted electricity and gas service. This means offering flexible payment plans, connecting our customers with agencies and programs that can provide assistance and working with them to address overdue balances before they become unmanageable. Service terminations are always the last resort. 
Overall, we continue to believe the full year impact of COVID-19 will be manageable as we close out the year. As a result, we've narrowed our forecast range to $2.40 to $2.50 per share from the prior range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share. We continue to expect to track towards the lower end of this guidance range due to the impacts of COVID-19 and warmer than normal weather during the first quarter. 
Lastly, on the slide, I would note that the U.K. sale process remains on track, and we continue to expect to announce a transaction in the first half of 2021. 
Moving to Slide 5, and starting with key regulatory developments. On October 1, WPD responded to Ofgem's RIIO-ED2 sector-specific methodology consultation, advocating for the continuation of a strong incentive-based regulatory regime that supports the best outcomes for our customers in terms of low prices and high-quality service. We believe RIIO-ED1 largely achieved this balance and that the basic structure of the RIIO-ED1 regime should broadly remain intact under RIIO-ED2. WPD's response to the consultation focused on several areas, where we believe Ofgem should reconsider its position and the robustness of its supporting evidence before making its methodology decision. 
In the end, we continue to believe that Ofgem has made it clear that DNOs will be critical to supporting decarbonization efforts in the U.K. to deliver a net 0 economy. Based on our discussions with Ofgem, we expect the incentive scheme for ED2 to continue to play a significant role in the overall returns for electric distribution companies. And we expect that WPD will have the opportunity to earn reasonable returns and invest significant amounts of capital during RIIO-ED2 and beyond. 
Moving forward, WPD will remain very focused and engaged with its stakeholders and Ofgem to ensure it delivers a plan that will achieve the U.K.'s ambitious carbon reduction goals. Ofgem is expected to issue its RIIO-ED2 sector-specific methodology decision in December. 
In other U.K. developments, the Competition and Markets Authority or CMA, issued a recent provisional ruling that supports more stable returns for regulated utilities in the U.K. to incentivize appropriate levels of investment. The CMA ruling concluded that the water sector regulator off lot, went too far in its efforts to sharply reduce returns for water utilities. We expect the provisional ruling will be one that Ofgem studies closely as it nears its decision on the RIIO-ED2 final determinations for the gas and electric transmission sectors and ultimately, for the electric distribution sector. 
Turning to the U.S. The FERC on October 15, issued an order in a complaint filed by a third-party challenging PPL Electric Utilities based return on equity for transmission. The FERC order sent the complaint to settlement procedures. If no settlement can be reached, the case will go to public hearing. We continue to believe that PPL Electric Utilities' current transmission return on equity is just and that complaint is without merit and based on flawed assumptions and calculations. Also in the U.S. on October 23, LG&E and KU notified the KPSC of the company's intent to file a rate request later this month. As part of the rate case, we will be applying for approval to deploy advanced metering to further enhance grid automation and reliability in the state. 
Assuming the maximum suspension period for such a proceeding, the resulting base rate changes would be effective July 1, 2021. Shifting gears to a few notable highlights related to our sustainability efforts and governance updates, in August, we announced that we joined an exciting new initiative to accelerate the development of low-carbon technology. The low carbon resources initiative led by the Electric Power Research Institute and the Gas Technology Institute, focuses on identifying, developing and demonstrating affordable pathways to economy-wide decarbonization. BPL is an anchor sponsor for the 5-year program, which supports our clean energy strategy. At a high level, that strategy is focused on decarbonizing PPL generation, decarbonizing our non generation operations, enabling third-party decarbonization and advancing research and development into clean energy technologies. 
As we've shared previously, PPL has set a goal to reduce its carbon emissions by at least 80% by 2050. We're confident this goal is achievable with today's technology. At the same time, we recognize that going further and faster, will require new ideas, new technology and new systems that can be delivered at scale safely, reliably and affordably for those we serve. We also remain really focused on diversity, equity and inclusion as part of our long-term corporate strategy. I'm pleased to share that PPL has been named a best place to work for people with disabilities. 
In July, the company earned a top score of 100% on the 2020 Disability Equality Index, the nation's most comprehensive annual benchmarking tool for disability inclusion. PPL's top score is the result of policies and practices that we've put in place to promote the success of those with disability. And it's just the latest recognition of PPL policies focused on ensuring all employees have the opportunity to succeed. 
Earlier this year, for example, PPL was named the best place to work for LGBTQ equality by the human rights campaign after achieving a perfect score on their corporate quality index. Moving forward, we will continue to work with employee led affinity groups to better enable all employees to reach their full potential. In other updates, PPL recently earned a trend setter ranking by the CPA-Zicklin index, which benchmarks political disclosure and accountability policies and practices of leading U.S. public companies. We believe it's important to be transparent on these matters, highlighting one of our core values of integrity and openness and our overall compliance and ethics commitment that is supported by robust internal controls. 
Lastly, PPL's Board of Directors appointed Arthur Beattie as a new director effective October 1. Art brings to the Board a wealth of knowledge and experience with regulated utilities and the energy it and we're certainly glad to have him on board as we strategically reposition PPL for the future. 
With that, I'll now turn it over to Joe for a more detailed financial update. Joe?"

I'll cover our third quarter segment results on Slide six. First, I would like to highlight that the estimated impact of COVID on our third quarter results was about $0.04 per share, which was primarily due to lower sales volumes in the U.K. and lower demand revenue in Kentucky. This is less than the $0.06 impact we experienced during the second quarter, primarily due to the improving electricity demand that Vince mentioned earlier in his remarks. 
As a reminder, the majority of this impact is recoverable via the U.K. decoupling mechanism, which adjusts revenues on a 2-year lag. Turning to the quarterly walk, starting with the Q3 2019 ongoing results on the left. We first separate the impact of weather and dilution for comparability purposes of the underlying businesses. During the third quarter, we experienced a $0.02 unfavorable variance due to weather compared to the third quarter of 2019, primarily in Kentucky. We experienced substantially higher degree days in Kentucky during the third quarter of 2019 that led to a favorable variance last year. 
Weather in the third quarter of 2020 was about $0.01 favorable overall compared to plan, primarily due to stronger load in Pennsylvania versus normal due to the warmer conditions in July. In terms of dilution, during the third quarter, we continued to recognize the impact of the November 2019 draw on our equity forward contracts, which resulted in dilution of about $0.03 per share for the quarter. 
Moving to the segment drivers. Excluding these items, our U.K. regulated segment earnings increased by $0.01 per share compared to a year ago. Factors driving the U.K. earnings results include higher foreign currency exchange rates compared to the prior period, with Q3 2020 average rates of $1.54 per pound compared to $1.26 per pound in Q3 2019, and lower interest expense, primarily due to lower interest on index-linked debt. These increases were partially offset by lower sales volumes, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19, lower other income due to lower pension income and higher income taxes. 
Moving to Pennsylvania. Segment earnings were $0.02 per share higher than our comparable results in Q3 2019. The increase was primarily driven by higher adjusted gross margins, primarily resulting from returns on additional capital investments in transmission. And as we saw in Q2, our customer mix mitigated the impact on sales from COVID-19 as our positive impact from our significant residential base in Pennsylvania and fixed charges more than offset lower demand in the C&I sectors. 
Turning to our Kentucky regulated segment. Results were flat to the comparable results 1 year ago. Factors impacting the results include lower commercial and industrial demand due to the impact of COVID-19 offset by factors that were individually not significant. Results at corporate and other were $0.01 per share lower compared to a year ago, driven primarily by higher income taxes due to timing, which is expected to reverse in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to Slide 7. We again outlined the changes in weather-normalized sales for each segment by customer class as we did last quarter. And like Q2, we saw lower demand in the C&I sectors, partially offset by higher residential load in each of our service territories. Demand in the C&I sector, while still lower than last year, has been steadily recovering as certain COVID restrictions have been lifted. 
In Pennsylvania, demand improved from about an 11% decline in C&I load in the second quarter to a 4% decline during Q3 compared to a year ago. C&I declines in Pennsylvania continue to be primarily in retail trade and services industry and manufacturing, respectively. Our large industrial customers have generally returned to pre-COVID operations and are not expecting future reductions at this time. 
Moving to Kentucky. Our Kentucky segment reported about a 7% C&I load decline during Q3 compared to the greater than 14% decline we saw last quarter versus the prior year. And like Pennsylvania, the services industry, such as restaurants, retail and hotels continue to be negatively impacted in our commercial sector in Kentucky. Much of the improvement we experienced during Q3 was on the industrial side as many manufacturing companies were able to reopen after temporarily being forced to shut down in Q2. Specifically, industrial volumes were driven in part by auto manufacturing volumes returning to pre-COVID levels. Coal mining and non-auto manufacturing continue to be more negatively affected. 
Finally, in the U.K., C&I load improved to about a 14% decline in the third quarter compared to a 20% decline that we experienced last quarter versus a year ago. As government restrictions put in place in late March were further eased throughout the month of July. The primary driver of the increase was seen in the large industrial and manufacturing sectors that have largely closed during the full lockdown phase and have since opened, albeit not quite the pre COVID levels. It's clear on this slide that the U.K. demand has not recovered as sharply as our U.S. service territories which underscores the value of the effective decoupling mechanism there. We remain encouraged by the recovery we have observed in each of our service territories during the third quarter but we'll continue to monitor load impacts as we move into the winter months, including the impact of additional temporary lockdowns, should they arise, such as the lockdowns we are currently experiencing in England and Wales. 
At this time, the current lockdown is not as stringent as what we experienced early in the year as workers that are not able to work from home can still go to work and many retail establishments can still provide takeout options. In addition, strong residential demand is expected to continue to act as a hedge to lower C&I demand. Now I know I just stated a lot of percentages. So let me take a moment to summarize the impact of COVID-19 on our ongoing results in 2020. We experienced a $0.10 per share impact to the end of the third quarter. 70% of that relates to lower U.K. sales volumes that will be recovered through the U.K. decoupling mechanism. The remaining $0.03 is primarily from lower demand in Kentucky, and we have been able to offset the majority of that through effective cost management. Overall, we believe our strong regulatory constructs, balanced rate structures and customer mix positions PPL well to continue to operate at a high level in this challenging environment. 
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Vince."

We do have a preference towards electric, but electric and gas utilities are also attractive to us. In terms of geography, I'm not sure that, that contiguous service territories or anything like that is necessarily something that we put a high emphasis on. So at this point, I would say we're we're pretty open to opportunities that may come up in the market. Again, where our base case is fix the balance sheet, not really fix the balance sheet, but improve the balance sheet from where we are to kind of the mid-teens and then share buybacks, right? It would be the kind of the base as that we would look at M&A as potential to improving value above that. Renewables is also another area that I think we're seriously considering. We did acquire Safari Energy back in 2018, hasn't been a significant component of the PPL earnings profile to date. However, when we come out of the WPD sale we could possibly be a cash taxpayer at that time, which obviously would put us in a good position around the renewables business. So I think we have opportunity to organically grow that business given kind of how we've positioned the the per business that we acquired a couple of years ago, but also there could be possibility or potential to do some M&A there as well."

So our stated goals are to reduce our carbon emissions by 80% by 2050, 70% -- at least 70% by 2040. As of 12/31/2019, so at the end of last year, we've already delivered about a 56% reduction compared to 2010, and that compares to about a 45% reduct",517,"Sure. So our stated goals are to reduce our carbon emissions by 80% by 2050, 70% -- at least 70% by 2040. As of 12/31/2019, so at the end of last year, we've already delivered about a 56% reduction compared to 2010, and that compares to about a 45% reduction for the sector. So we're feeling very, very good about our transition strategy and the glide path that we're on to achieve that at least 70% by 40% and at least 80% by 50%. Our reduction targets are, we think they're comparable to our industry peers, even some of those peers that have indicated net 0 target by 2050, they've indicated that they see a pretty clear path to 80% deduction, but would require incremental technological improvements to get the remaining 20%. And that's very consistent with how we're seeing things as well. It's one of the reasons why we joined the EPRI, GTI, LCRI R&D project over the next 5 years to to really try to identify that technology to actually get to net 0 by 2050. Again, as we're thinking about the declining costs of renewable energy, we think there'll be continued opportunity to accelerate decarbonization, even in Kentucky, even without retiring coal plants to the extent that the LCOE of solar continues to come down. It could end up being cheaper than the variable cost of generating in Kentucky. But again, a long-term carbon reduction goals for us is around the retirement of the coal fleet. But we will continue to do that in a very balanced way. We're focused on working with the commission, making sure that the power that we continue to generate in the state is affordable and reliable for our customers. That is critical, relatively cheap electric in the state of Kentucky is an important component of their economic development strategy. So again, as we think about our carbon reduction strategy, it's in a very balanced way to make sure that we're keeping our customers and our regulators in mind. And again, we think we're in a good position to balance all of those things. If technology were to improve or the cost curves continue to come down significantly, what we've noticed and experienced in Kentucky is that the commission has been very supportive of coal retirements when it makes economic sense to do so. They are not supportive when it does not make economic sense. Just to remind everybody, we've retired over 1,200 megawatts of coal fire generation since 2010, and that was all based on economics. So we think, again, the regulatory construct is supportive down there, but it's all based on economics and as the right now, the economics are not quite there to accelerate the retirement. But as that continues to progress, certainly, our team in Kentucky is looking at that. We think the commission will continue to be supportive things like that as well. I think just the key there is to ensure that the generation is reliable and affordable. And again, I think we're in a good position to balance all of those factors."

And as always, we'll leave ample time for your questions. 
Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced third quarter reported earnings of $0.37 per share. Adjusting for special items, primarily a deferred tax adjustment in the U.K. based on the 2020 Finance Act and unrealized losses on foreign currency economic hedges. Third quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.58 per share compared with $0.61 per share a year ago. At a high level, results for the quarter were in line with our expectations. 
I'll note that the lower earnings compared to last year include $0.02 of lower volumes in the U.K., which will recover in future periods. And $0.01 due to the timing of our estimated federal income tax computation, which will reverse in Q4. Joe will cover the financial results in more detail in his section. 
Regarding a COVID update, throughout the quarter, we continued to deliver strong operational performance, providing outstanding customer service and reliability. At the same time, we've remained focused on innovation and building for the future. In September, we launched the new digitalization strategy in the U.K. The strategy focuses on transforming the way we develop and operate the network to empower customers drive greater efficiency and deliver faster decarbonization. 
And in Pennsylvania, during Q3, we reached the $1 million mark for customer outages avoided as a result of our investments in automated power restoration technology. Regarding customer sales during the quarter, residential load continued to be strong than our weather-normalized forecast, driven by sustained work-from-home measures in all of our service territories. Conversely, C&I demand remained lower in all 3 business units albeit less pronounced in Q3 than it had been earlier in the pandemic. 
From a financial perspective, we are well positioned to weather the continued economic downturn. We've maintained a strong liquidity position of over $4 billion. Our cash receipts remain steady and our capital plans remain largely intact. And as the moratoria are starting to lift across our U.S. service territories, we will comply with all state utility commission requirements and continue to work with our customers to maintain uninterrupted electricity and gas service. This means offering flexible payment plans, connecting our customers with agencies and programs that can provide assistance and working with them to address overdue balances before they become unmanageable. Service terminations are always a last resort.
Overall, we continue to believe the full year impact of COVID-19 will be manageable as we close out the year. As a result, we've narrowed our forecast range to $2.40 to $2.50 per share from the prior range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share. We continue to expect to track towards the lower end of this guidance range due to the impacts of COVID-19 and warmer than normal weather during the first quarter. 
Lastly, on the slide, I would note that the U.K. sale process remains on track, and we continue to expect to announce a transaction in the first half of 2021. 
Moving to Slide 5, and starting with key regulatory developments. On October 1, WPD responded to Ofgem's RIIO-ED2 sector-specific methodology consultation, advocating for the continuation of a strong incentive-based regulatory regime that supports the best outcomes for our customers in terms of low prices and high-quality service. We believe RIIO-ED1 largely achieved this balance and that the basic structure of the RIIO-ED1 regime should broadly remain intact under ED2. WPD's response to the consultation focused on several areas, where we believe Ofgem should reconsider its position and the robustness of its supporting evidence before making its methodology decision.
In the end, we continue to believe that Ofgem has made it clear that DNOs will be critical to supporting decarbonization efforts in the U.K. to deliver a net 0 economy. Based on our discussions with Ofgem, we expect the incentive scheme for ED2 to continue to play a significant role in the overall returns for electric distribution companies. And we expect that WPD will have the opportunity to earn reasonable returns and invest significant amounts of capital during RIIO-ED2 and beyond. 
Moving forward, WPD will remain very focused and engaged with its stakeholders and Ofgem to ensure it delivers a plan that will achieve the U.K.'s ambitious carbon reduction goals. Ofgem is expected to issue its RIIO-ED2 sector-specific methodology decision in December. 
In other U.K. developments, the Competition and Markets Authority or CMA issued a recent provisional ruling that supports more stable returns for regulated utilities in the U.K. to incentivize appropriate levels of investment. The CMA ruling concluded that the water sector regulator, Ofwat, went too far in its efforts to sharply reduce returns for water utilities. We expect the provisional ruling will be one that Ofgem studies closely as it nears its decision on the RIIO-2 final determinations for the gas and electric transmission sectors and ultimately for the electric distribution sector. 
Turning to the U.S. The FERC on October 15 issued an order in a complaint filed by a third-party challenging PPL Electric Utilities based return on equity for transmission. The FERC order sent the complaint to settlement procedures. If no settlement can be reached, the case will go to public hearing. We continue to believe that PPL Electric Utilities' current transmission return on equity is just and reasonable, and that complaint is without merit and based on flawed assumptions and calculations. 
Also in the U.S. on October 23, LG&E and KU notified the KPSC of the company's intent to file a rate request later this month. As part of the rate case, we will be applying for approval to deploy advanced metering to further enhance grid automation and reliability in the state.
Assuming the maximum suspension period for such a proceeding, the resulting base rate changes would be effective July 1, 2021. Shifting gears to a few notable highlights related to our sustainability efforts and governance updates, in August, we announced that we joined an exciting new initiative to accelerate the development of low-carbon technology. The low carbon resources initiative led by the Electric Power Research Institute and the Gas Technology Institute, focuses on identifying, developing and demonstrating affordable pathways to economy-wide decarbonization. BPL is an anchor sponsor for the 5-year program, which supports our clean energy strategy. At a high level, that strategy is focused on decarbonizing PPL's own generation, decarbonizing our non-generation operations, enabling third-party decarbonization and advancing research and development into clean energy technologies.
As we've shared previously, PPL has set a goal to reduce its carbon emissions by at least 80% by 2050. We're confident this goal is achievable with today's technology. At the same time, we recognize that going further and faster, we'll require new ideas, new technology and new systems that can be delivered at scale safely, reliably and affordably for those we serve. We also remain squarely focused on diversity, equity and inclusion as part of our long-term corporate strategy. I'm pleased to share that PPL has been named a best place to work for people with disabilities. 
In July, the company earned a top score of 100% on the 2020 Disability Equality Index, the nation's most comprehensive annual benchmarking tool for disability inclusion. PPL's top score is the result of policies and practices that we've put in place to promote the success of those with disability. And it's just the latest recognition of PPL policies focused on ensuring all employees have the opportunity to succeed. 
Earlier this year, for example, PPL was named the best place to work for LGBTQ equality by The Human Rights Campaign after achieving a perfect score on their corporate equality index. Moving forward, we will continue to work with employee-led affinity groups to better enable all employees to reach their full potential. In other updates, PPL recently earned a trend-setter ranking by the CPA-Zicklin Index, which benchmarks political disclosure and accountability policies and practices of leading U.S. public companies. We believe it's important to be transparent on these matters, highlighting one of our core values of integrity and openness and our overall compliance and ethics commitment that is supported by robust internal controls.
Lastly, PPL's Board of Directors appointed Ar Beattie as a new director effective October 1. Ar brings to the Board a wealth of knowledge and experience with regulated utilities and the energy industry and we're certainly glad to have him on board as we strategically reposition PPL for the future.
With that, I'll now turn it over to Joe for a more detailed financial update. Joe?"
185508,692702346,2130753,"PPL Corporation, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2020",2020-11-05,"Earnings Calls","PPL Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. I'll cover our third quarter segment results on Slide 6. First, I would like to highlight that the estimated impact of COVID on our third quarter results was about $0.04 per share, which was primarily due to l",1086,"Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. I'll cover our third quarter segment results on Slide 6. First, I would like to highlight that the estimated impact of COVID on our third quarter results was about $0.04 per share, which was primarily due to lower sales volumes in the U.K. and lower demand revenue in Kentucky. This is less than the $0.06 impact we experienced during the second quarter, primarily due to the improving electricity demand that Vince mentioned earlier in his remarks. 
As a reminder, the majority of this impact is recoverable via the U.K. decoupling mechanism, which adjusts revenues on a 2-year lag.
Turning to the quarterly walk, starting with the Q3 2019 ongoing results on the left. We first separate the impact of weather and dilution for comparability purposes of the underlying businesses. During the third quarter, we experienced a $0.02 unfavorable variance due to weather compared to the third quarter of 2019, primarily in Kentucky. We experienced substantially higher degree days in Kentucky during the third quarter of 2019 that led to a favorable variance last year.
Weather in the third quarter of 2020 was about $0.01 favorable overall compared to plan, primarily due to stronger load in Pennsylvania versus normal due to the warmer conditions in July. In terms of dilution, during the third quarter, we continued to recognize the impact of the November 2019 draw on our equity forward contracts, which resulted in dilution of about $0.03 per share for the quarter. 
Moving to the segment drivers. Excluding these items, our U.K. regulated segment earnings increased by $0.01 per share compared to a year ago. Factors driving the U.K. earnings results include higher foreign currency exchange rates compared to the prior period, with Q3 2020 average rates of $1.54 per pound compared to $1.26 per pound in Q3 2019, and lower interest expense, primarily due to lower interest on index-linked debt. These increases were partially offset by lower sales volumes, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19, lower other income due to lower pension income and higher income taxes. 
Moving to Pennsylvania. Segment earnings were $0.02 per share higher than our comparable results in Q3 2019. The increase was primarily driven by higher adjusted gross margins, primarily resulting from returns on additional capital investments in transmission. And as we saw in Q2, our customer mix mitigated the impact on sales from COVID-19 as our positive impact from our significant residential base in Pennsylvania and fixed charges more than offset lower demand in the C&I sectors. 
Turning to our Kentucky Regulated segment. Results were flat to the comparable results one year ago. Factors impacting the results include lower commercial and industrial demand due to the impact of COVID-19 offset by factors that were individually not significant. Results at Corporate & Other were $0.01 per share lower compared to a year ago, driven primarily by higher income taxes due to timing, which is expected to reverse in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to Slide 7. We again outlined the changes in weather-normalized sales for each segment by customer class as we did last quarter. And like Q2, we saw lower demand in the C&I sectors, partially offset by higher residential load in each of our service territories. Demand in the C&I sector, while still lower than last year, has been steadily recovering as certain COVID restrictions have been lifted.
In Pennsylvania, demand improved from about an 11% decline in C&I load in the second quarter to a 4% decline during Q3 compared to a year ago. C&I declines in Pennsylvania continue to be primarily in retail trade and services industry and manufacturing, respectively. Our large industrial customers have generally returned to pre-COVID operations and are not expecting future reductions at this time.
Moving to Kentucky. Our Kentucky segment reported about a 7% C&I load decline during Q3 compared to the greater than 14% decline we saw last quarter versus the prior year. And like Pennsylvania, the services industry, such as restaurants, retail and hotels continue to be negatively impacted in our commercial sector in Kentucky. Much of the improvement we experienced during Q3 was on the industrial side as many manufacturing companies were able to reopen after temporarily being forced to shut down in Q2. Specifically, industrial volumes were driven in part by auto manufacturing volumes returning to pre-COVID levels. Coal mining and non-auto manufacturing continue to be more negatively affected. 
Finally, in the U.K., C&I load improved to about a 14% decline in the third quarter compared to a 20% decline that we experienced last quarter versus a year ago as government restrictions put in place in late March were further eased throughout the month of July. The primary driver of the increase was seen in the large industrial and manufacturing sectors that have largely closed during the full lockdown phase and have since opened, albeit not quite the pre-COVID levels. 
It's clear on this slide that the U.K. demand has not recovered as sharply as our U.S. service territories which underscores the value of the effective decoupling mechanism there. We remain encouraged by the recovery we have observed in each of our service territories during the third quarter, but we'll continue to monitor load impacts as we move into the winter months, including the impact of additional temporary lockdowns should they arise, such as the lockdowns we are currently experiencing in England and Wales. 
At this time, the current lockdown is not as stringent as what we experienced early in the year as workers that are not able to work from home can still go to work and many retail establishments can still provide takeout options. In addition, strong residential demand is expected to continue to act as a hedge to lower C&I demand. Now I know I just stated a lot of percentages. So let me take a moment to summarize the impact of COVID-19 on our ongoing results in 2020. 
We experienced a $0.10 per share impact to the end of the third quarter. 70% of that relates to lower U.K. sales volumes that will be recovered through the U.K. decoupling mechanism. The remaining $0.03 is primarily from lower demand in Kentucky, and we have been able to offset the majority of that through effective cost management. Overall, we believe our strong regulatory constructs, balanced rate structures and customer mix, positions PPL well to continue to operate at a high level in this challenging environment. 
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Vince."

We do have a preference towards electric, but electric and gas utilities are also attractive to us. In terms of geography, I'm not sure that, that contiguous service territories or anything like that is necessarily something that we put a high emphasis on. So at this point, I would say, we're pretty open to opportunities that may come up in the market.
Again, where -- our base case is fix the balance sheet, not really fix the balance sheet, but improve the balance sheet from where we are to kind of the mid-teens and then share buybacks, right? It would be the kind of the base case as that we would look at M&A as potential to improving value above that.
Renewables is also another area that I think we're seriously considering. We did acquire Safari Energy back in 2018, hasn't been a significant component of the PPL earnings profile to date. However, when we come out of the WPD sale we could possibly be a cash taxpayer at that time, which obviously would put us in a good position around the renewables business. So I think we have opportunity to organically grow that business given kind of how we've positioned the the DER business that we acquired a couple of years ago, but also there could be possibility or potential to do some M&A there as well."

Our reduction targets are, we think they're comparable to our industry peers, even some of those peers that have indicated a net 0 target by 2050, they've indicated that they see a pretty clear path to 80% reduction, but would require incremental technological improvements to get the remaining 20%.

It's one of the reasons why we joined the EPRI, GTI, LCRI R&D project over the next 5 years to really try to identify that technology to actually get to net 0 by 2050. 
Again, as we're thinking about the declining costs of renewable energy, we think there'll be continued opportunity to accelerate decarbonization, even in Kentucky, even without retiring coal plants to the extent that the LCOE of solar continues to come down, it could end up being cheaper than the variable cost of generating in Kentucky. But again, a long-term carbon reduction goals for us is around the retirement of the coal fleet. But we will continue to do that in a very balanced way. We're focused on working with the commission making sure that the power that we continue to generate in the state is affordable and reliable for our customers that is critical. 
Relatively cheap electric in the State of Kentucky is an important component of their economic development strategy. So again, as we think about our carbon reduction strategy, it's in a very balanced way to make sure that we're keeping our customers and our regulators in mind. And again, we think we're in a good position to balance all of those things. If technology were to improve or the cost curves continue to come down significantly, what we've noticed and experienced in Kentucky is that the commission has been very supportive of coal retirements when it makes economic sense to do so. They are not supportive when it does not make economic sense. Just to remind everybody, we've retired over 1,200 megawatts of coal fire generation since 2010, and that was all based on economics. 
So we think again, the regulatory construct is supportive down there, but it's all based on economics and as -- right now, the economics are not quite there to accelerate the retirement. But as that continues to progress, certainly, our team in Kentucky is looking at that. We think the commission will continue to be supportive of things like that as well. I think just the key there is to ensure that the generation is reliable and affordable. And again, I think we're in a good position to balance all of those factors."

My preference would be in electric and gas utility. Again, I think over time, gas will be deemphasized as we think about a longer-term carbon transition strategy for the U.S. And so that's why I like electric and gas a little better because you can build in that direct edge for electrification there. But I wouldn't say today that we wouldn't take a look at that."
