I'm very pleased with the fourth quarter and the reasons to be a concho shareholder continues to be compelling. We're growing margins, growing free cash flow. Growing distributions to shareholders and doing this while advancing sustainability. We've assembled a top-tier Permian asset base in our own backyard with multiple decades of project inventory that strengthens our ability to generate free cash flow and increase returns to shareholders. In this dynamic environment, we'll continue to focus on disciplined reinvestment, controlling costs and maintaining a strong financial position. Since our third quarter of '19 earnings call, we've seen oil prices road coaster between 50 and 60, and we've been both places twice. 
Despite the commodity price volatility and many uncertainties, our business model is designed to deliver free cash flow across a wide range of commodity prices. Last year, we identified 6 key areas for improvement, which included reducing well costs. Our well costs continue to move in the right direction as a result of safely drilling and completing wells faster. We're also transitioning to next-generation frac equipment that is more efficient and provides cost savings and emission reductions. 
Second, lowering our cost structure. For the fourth quarter of '19, controllable costs were 17% lower year-over-year, and we're well below our target of $9 per BOE. Third, selling noncore assets. We closed the New Mexico shelf asset sale on November 1, bringing full year 2019 sales proceeds to $1.3 billion. 
Fourth, delivering profitable growth. Fourth quarter oil volumes increased 4% quarter-over-quarter in spite of the production impact resulting from the New Mexico Shelf asset sale. Fifth, reducing debt, with the proceeds from the shelf sale, we ended the year with no bank debt and $70 million of cash on the balance sheet. And finally, increasing returns to shareholders. In 2019, we paid $100 million of dividends and repurchased $250 million of stock. 
Going forward, we recognize that both asset quality and execution are necessary to the success of our business. We made real progress toward our goals in the second half of the year, and I'm proud of our employees for their performance. Their efforts are directly benefiting our bottom line and driving the inflection in free cash flow that we delivered in the fourth quarter. 
Now turning to 2020. Jack will speak to the specific numbers, but I want to summarize our high-level strategy for the year. We're focused on 4 things: first, growing margins. We have several ways within our control to grow margins, including cost reductions and a better capital program. We also stand to benefit from better oil price realizations as Permian barrels are now pricing at a premium. 
Second, growing free cash flow. We expect lower well costs and our focus on smaller projects and wider spacing will result in better well productivity, which supports growing free cash flow. And we have the inventory and operational capability to support our commitment to free cash flow over the long term. Third, growing distributions. Yesterday, we announced a 60% increase to our dividend. The dividend raise demonstrates our confidence in the cash flow potential of our business. Also in the fourth quarter of '19, we initiated a $1.5 billion share repurchase program. We were active in the fourth quarter and bought back 3.3 million shares at an average price of $76 per share. 
Fourth, advancing sustainability. Our stakeholders are seeking greater transparency regarding sustainability, and we take this seriously. Our flared volumes averaged 1.6% of gross in '19 compared to 2.7% in '18. We've published a 2-degree scenario report, and we're working on the sustainability report to detail our progress. This set of priorities and the results of our drilling in '19 guided our capital allocation and development strategy for 2020 and beyond. We're developing the assets with wider spacing and have multiple decades of inventory. 
Additionally, we're looking to optimize our acreage position through trades with adjacent operators. Our portfolio management efforts in 2019, increased the average lateral length of our inventory by 7% and our working interest by 2%. Our inventory is a key advantage that enables us to deliver attractive long-term returns. We've talked about the evolution of the E&P business model from pure growth to restrain growth, greater free cash flow and higher returns. We've built momentum over the last 2 quarters, delivering on strategic focus that we laid out last year and providing a plan for 2020 that we believe makes a compelling investment case for the future. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Jack."

I am proud of the results of an increase in cash flow the team delivered in the fourth quarter. We continue to prioritize financial discipline and cost management, and our performance over the past 2 quarters enhances our competitiveness improves our platform for continued growth and strengthens the investment case for Concho. Reviewing the fourth quarter specifically, oil volumes totaled 215,000 barrels per day, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range. It also represented an 8% increase from the same period last year. On the cost side, we made significant progress as well. Controllable costs, which includes lease operating, cash G&A and interest expense totaled $8.43 per unit, achieving our $9 target ahead of schedule. Also during the final quarter of the year, we reinforced our investment-grade balance sheet by eliminating our revolver balance. 
Now to the key metric, free cash flow. We generated $187 million in free cash flow for the quarter, which reflects the difference between operating cash flow before changes in working capital of $801 million and exploration and development cost incurred of $614 million. There are 2 important drivers for the cash flow growth. Our high cash margin production and improving efficiencies across our drilling and completion operations. 
For 2019, average drilling, completion and equipment costs per foot were just below $1,000, which reflects an 18% decrease compared to 2018. Despite all the movement during 2019, we stayed within our guided capital budget and grew oil production 25% year-over-year. We also moved to a steadier drilling program in the second half of 2019, which carries into 2020 and will lead to a more efficient capital program. 
For 2020, we are planning a $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion capital budget with our activity equally split between the Delaware and Midland basins. We expect this level of investment will result in drilling, completing and turning online approximately 300 wells during the year. The average project size will be 6 wells, and our average well spacing will be 700 to 800 feet as compared to approximately 550 feet last year. 
Rolling our cost improvements in faster cycle times together, we expect to spend approximately 10% less year-over-year while completing about 10% more lateral feet. Our activity is expected to generate 10% to 12% oil production growth, which represents 217,000 to 221,000 barrels of oil per day compared to pro forma 2019 volumes of 197,000 barrels per day. 
Gas and NGL prices have fallen since our third quarter '19 call that our hedge book has us in a position to deliver on the priorities and targets that we've previously discussed. We expect to fund the capital program and generate $350 million of free cash flow at $50 oil and current prices for gas and NGLs, due to lower well cost, a lower cost structure, and beneficial hedges that provide stability in a volatile market. After our third quarter call, we layered on hedges at $57 WTI. So while they limit our upside and a $60 scenario, they are substantially above market in today's $50 environment. 
Our forecast for $650 million of free cash flow at $60 oil, includes the new hedges as well as current NGL prices. We see the potential to deliver $750 million in free cash flow with strong execution and an NGL environment consistent with $60 crude. So again, 2020 is off to a great start, and we will continue to focus on growing margins, growing free cash flow, growing distribution and advancing sustainability. These priorities will support our performance. We also have a very strong commitment to capital discipline because we believe it's key to maintaining a strong balance sheet and growing long-term value through the cycles. 
We'll now turn the call back over to the moderator for questions."

I'm very pleased with the fourth quarter, and the reasons to be a concho shareholder continue to be compelling. We're growing margins, growing free cash flow, growing distributions to shareholders and doing this while advancing sustainability. We've assembled a top-tier Permian asset base in our own backyard with multiple decades of project inventory that strengthens our ability to generate free cash flow and increase returns to shareholders. In this dynamic environment, we'll continue to focus on disciplined reinvestment, controlling costs and maintaining a strong financial position. Since our third quarter of '19 earnings call, we've seen oil prices rollercoaster between $50 and $60, and we've been both places twice. Despite the commodity price volatility and many uncertainties, our business model is designed to deliver free cash flow across a wide range of commodity prices.
Last year, we identified 6 key areas for improvement, which included reducing well cost. Our well cost continue to move in the right direction as a result of safely drilling and completing wells faster. We're also transitioning to next-generation frac equipment that is more efficient and provides cost savings and emission reductions.
Second, lowering our cost structure. For the fourth quarter of '19, controllable costs were 17% lower year-over-year, and we're well below our target of $9 per BOE. Third, selling noncore assets. We closed the New Mexico Shelf asset sale on November 1, bringing full year 2019 sales proceeds to $1.3 billion.
Fourth, delivering profitable growth. Fourth quarter oil volumes increased 4% quarter-over-quarter in spite of the production impact resulting from the New Mexico Shelf asset sale. Fifth, reducing debt, with the proceeds from the shelf sale, we ended the year with no bank debt and $70 million of cash on the balance sheet. And finally, increasing returns to shareholders. In 2019, we paid $100 million of dividends and repurchased $250 million of stock.
Going forward, we recognize that both asset quality and execution are necessary to the success of our business. We made real progress toward our goals in the second half of the year, and I'm proud of our employees for their performance. Their efforts are directly benefiting our bottom line and driving the inflection in free cash flow that we delivered in the fourth quarter.
Now turning to 2020. Jack will speak to the specific numbers, but I want to summarize our high-level strategy for the year. We're focused on 4 things. First, growing margins. We have several ways within our control to grow margins, including cost reductions and a better capital program. We also stand to benefit from better oil price realizations, as Permian barrels are now pricing at a premium.
Second, growing free cash flow. We expect lower well cost and our focus on smaller projects and wider spacing will result in better well productivity, which supports growing free cash flow. And we have the inventory and operational capability to support our commitment to free cash flow over the long term.
Third, growing distributions. Yesterday, we announced a 60% increase to our dividend. The dividend raise demonstrates our confidence in the cash flow potential of our business. Also in the fourth quarter of '19, we initiated a $1.5 billion share repurchase program. We were active in the fourth quarter and bought back 3.3 million shares at an average price of $76 per share.
Fourth, advancing sustainability. Our stakeholders are seeking greater transparency regarding sustainability, and we take this seriously. Our flared volumes averaged 1.6% of gross in '19 compared to 2.7% in '18. We've published a 2-degree scenario report, and we're working on the sustainability report to detail our progress. This set of priorities and the results of our drilling in '19 guided our capital allocation and development strategy for 2020 and beyond. We're developing the assets with wider spacing and have multiple decades of inventory.
Additionally, we're looking to optimize our acreage position through trades with adjacent operators. Our portfolio management efforts in 2019, increased the average lateral length of our inventory by 7% and our working interest by 2%. Our inventory is a key advantage that enables us to deliver attractive long-term returns. We've talked about the evolution of the E&P business model from pure growth to restrain growth, greater free cash flow and higher returns. We've built momentum over the last 2 quarters, delivering on strategic focus that we laid out last year and providing a plan for 2020 that we believe makes a compelling investment case for the future. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Jack."

I am proud of the results and increase in cash flow the team delivered in the fourth quarter. We continue to prioritize financial discipline and cost management, and our performance over the past 2 quarters enhances our competitiveness, improves our platform for continued growth and strengthens the investment case for Concho. Reviewing the fourth quarter specifically, oil volumes totaled 215,000 barrels per day, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range. It also represented an 8% increase from the same period last year. On the cost side, we made significant progress as well. Controllable costs, which includes lease operating, cash G&A and interest expense totaled $8.43 per unit, achieving our $9 target ahead of schedule. Also, during the final quarter of the year, we reinforced our investment-grade balance sheet by eliminating our revolver balance.
Now to the key metric, free cash flow. We generated $187 million in free cash flow for the quarter, which reflects the difference between operating cash flow before changes in working capital of $801 million and exploration and development cost incurred of $614 million. There are 2 important drivers for the cash flow growth. Our high-cash margin production and improving efficiencies across our drilling and completion operations.
For 2019, average drilling, completion and equipment costs per foot were just below $1,000, which reflects an 18% decrease compared to 2018. Despite all the movement during 2019, we stayed within our guided capital budget and grew oil production 25% year-over-year. We also moved to a steadier drilling program in the second half of 2019, which carries into 2020 and will lead to a more efficient capital program.
For 2020, we are planning a $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion capital budget with our activity equally split between the Delaware and Midland basins. We expect this level of investment will result in drilling, completing and turning online approximately 300 wells during the year. The average project size will be 6 wells, and our average well spacing will be 700 to 800 feet as compared to approximately 550 feet last year.
Rolling our cost improvements in faster cycle times together, we expect to spend approximately 10% less year-over-year, while completing about 10% more lateral feet. Our activity is expected to generate 10% to 12% oil production growth, which represents 217,000 to 221,000 barrels of oil per day compared to pro forma 2019 volumes of 197,000 barrels per day. 
Gas and NGL prices have fallen since our third quarter '19 call, but our hedge book has this in a position to deliver on the priorities and targets that we've previously discussed. We expect to fund the capital program and generate $350 million of free cash flow at $50 oil and current prices for gas and NGLs due to lower well cost, a lower cost structure and beneficial hedges that provide stability in a volatile market. After our third quarter call, we layered on hedges at $57 WTI. So while they limit our upside and a $60 scenario, they are substantially above market in today's $50 environment.
Our forecast for $650 million of free cash flow at $60 oil, includes the new hedges as well as current NGL prices. We see the potential to deliver $750 million in free cash flow with strong execution and an NGL environment consistent with $60 crude. So again, 2020 is off to a great start, and we will continue to focus on growing margins, growing free cash flow, growing distributions and advancing sustainability. These priorities will support our performance. We also have a very strong commitment to capital discipline because we believe it's key to maintaining a strong balance sheet and growing long-term value through the cycles. 
We'll now turn the call back over to the moderator for questions."

If I kind of back out the shelf sale in the fourth quarter of '19, I mean, it looks like 2020 is kind of expected to be sort of flattish with fourth quarter, but I guess down a little bit in the first quarter of '20. Just kind of wanted to get a little color on that. I mean, I guess do you guys just see production starting to pick up in terms of the growth coming in, in the second quarter? And I guess, just overall, I mean, looking at that kind of level there? It seemed like maybe there was a little conservatism in those numbers?"

For 2019, we're projecting to grow our oil rates in 2020 a little more than 10%. And so that -- I think your question really is about the cadence of that growth because you point correctly to that fourth quarter number, we reported 215 MBoepd. If you take the shelf out, then it's about 210 MBoepd. And our first quarter guide at the high end is essentially flat with that number, so I wouldn't read too much into that. There's a little bit just inter-quarter noise around the first quarter. There's probably more completion or more wells put on production in the back half of the quarter than the front. But as Jack has mentioned, the theme of steady should be the way you think about 2020's growth."

I'm very pleased with the fourth quarter, and the reasons to be a Concho shareholder continue to be compelling.

I'm very pleased with the fourth quarter, and the reasons to be a Concho shareholder continue to be compelling. We're growing margins, growing free cash flow, growing distributions to shareholders and doing this while advancing sustainability. We've assembled a top-tier Permian asset base in our own backyard with multiple decades of project inventory that strengthens our ability to generate free cash flow and increase returns to shareholders. In this dynamic environment, we'll continue to focus on disciplined reinvestment, controlling costs and maintaining a strong financial position. Since our third quarter of '19 earnings call, we've seen oil prices rollercoaster between $50 and $60, and we've been both places twice. Despite the commodity price volatility and many uncertainties, our business model is designed to deliver free cash flow across a wide range of commodity prices.
Last year, we identified 6 key areas for improvement, which included reducing well cost. Our well cost continue to move in the right direction as a result of safely drilling and completing wells faster. We're also transitioning to next-generation frac equipment that is more efficient and provides cost savings and emission reductions.
Second, lowering our cost structure. For the fourth quarter of '19, controllable costs were 17% lower year-over-year, and we're well below our target of $9 per BOE.
Third, selling noncore assets. We closed the New Mexico Shelf asset sale on November 1, bringing full year 2019 sales proceeds to $1.3 billion.
Fourth, delivering profitable growth. Fourth quarter oil volumes increased 4% quarter-over-quarter in spite of the production impact resulting from the New Mexico Shelf asset sale.
Fifth, reducing debt. With the proceeds from the shelf sale, we ended the year with no bank debt and $70 million of cash on the balance sheet. And finally, increasing returns to shareholders. In 2019, we paid $100 million of dividends and repurchased $250 million of stock.
Going forward, we recognize that both asset quality and execution are necessary to the success of our business. We made real progress toward our goals in the second half of the year, and I'm proud of our employees for their performance. Their efforts are directly benefiting our bottom line and driving the inflection in free cash flow that we delivered in the fourth quarter.
Now turning to 2020. Jack will speak with -- to the specific numbers, but I want to summarize our high-level strategy for the year. We're focused on 4 things. First, growing margins. We have several ways within our control to grow margins, including cost reductions and a better capital program. We also stand to benefit from better oil price realizations, as Permian barrels are now pricing at a premium.
Second, growing free cash flow. We expect lower well cost and our focus on smaller projects and wider spacing will result in better well productivity, which supports growing free cash flow. And we have the inventory and operational capability to support our commitment to free cash flow over the long term.
Third, growing distributions. Yesterday, we announced a 60% increase to our dividend. The dividend raise demonstrates our confidence in the cash flow potential of our business. Also in the fourth quarter of '19, we initiated a $1.5 billion share repurchase program. We were active in the fourth quarter and bought back 3.3 million shares at an average price of $76 per share.
Fourth, advancing sustainability. Our stakeholders are seeking greater transparency regarding sustainability, and we take this seriously. Our flared volumes averaged 1.6% of gross in '19 compared to 2.7% in '18. We've published a 2-degree scenario report, and we're working on a sustainability report to detail our progress. This set of priorities and the results of our drilling in '19 guided our capital allocation and development strategy for 2020 and beyond. We're developing the assets with wider spacing and have multiple decades of inventory.
Additionally, we're looking to optimize our acreage position through trades with adjacent operators. Our portfolio management efforts in 2019 increased the average lateral length of our inventory by 7% and our working interest by 2%. Our inventory is a key advantage that enables us to deliver attractive long-term returns. We've talked about the evolution of the E&P business model from pure growth to restrain growth, greater free cash flow and higher returns. We've built momentum over the last 2 quarters, delivering on strategic focus that we laid out last year and providing a plan for 2020 that we believe makes a compelling investment case for the future.
With that, I'll turn it over to Jack."

We continue to prioritize financial discipline and cost management, and our performance over the past 2 quarters enhances our competitiveness, improves our platform for continued growth and strengthens the investment case for Concho.
Reviewing the fourth quarter specifically, oil volumes totaled 215,000 barrels per day, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range. It also represented an 8% increase from the same period last year. On the cost side, we made significant progress as well. Controllable cost, which includes lease operating cash, G&A and interest expense totaled $8.43 per unit, achieving our $9 target ahead of schedule. Also, during the final quarter of the year, we reinforced our investment-grade balance sheet by eliminating our revolver balance.
Now to the key metric, free cash flow. We generated $187 million in free cash flow for the quarter, which reflects the difference between operating cash flow before changes in working capital of $801 million and exploration and development cost incurred of $614 million. There are 2 important drivers for the cash flow growth. Our high-cash margin production and improving efficiencies across our drilling and completion operations.
For 2019, average drilling, completion and equipment costs per foot were just below $1,000, which reflects an 18% decrease compared to 2018. Despite all the movement during 2019, we stayed within our guided capital budget and grew oil production 25% year-over-year. We also moved to a steadier drilling program in the second half of 2019, which carries into 2020 and will lead to a more efficient capital program.
For 2020, we are planning a $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion capital budget with our activity equally split between the Delaware and Midland basins. We expect this level of investment will result in drilling, completing and turning online approximately 300 wells during the year. The average project size will be 6 wells, and our average well spacing will be 700 to 800 feet as compared to approximately 550 feet last year.
Rolling our cost improvements and faster cycle times together, we expect to spend approximately 10% less year-over-year, while completing about 10% more lateral feet. Our activity is expected to generate 10% to 12% oil production growth, which represents 217,000 to 221,000 barrels of oil per day compared to pro forma 2019 volumes of 197,000 barrels per day.
Gas and NGL prices have fallen since our third quarter '19 call, but our hedge book has this in a position to deliver on the priorities and targets that we've previously discussed. We expect to fund the capital program and generate $350 million of free cash flow at $50 oil and current prices for gas and NGLs due to lower well cost, a lower cost structure and beneficial hedges that provide stability in a volatile market. After our third quarter call, we layered on hedges at $57 WTI. So while they limit our upside and a $60 scenario, they are substantially above market in today's $50 environment.
Our forecast for $650 million of free cash flow at $60 oil, includes the new hedges as well as current NGL prices. We see the potential to deliver $750 million in free cash flow with strong execution and an NGL environment consistent with $60 crude. So again, 2020 is off to a great start, and we will continue to focus on growing margins, growing free cash flow, growing distributions and advancing sustainability. These priorities will support our performance. We also have a very strong commitment to capital discipline because we believe it's key to maintaining a strong balance sheet and growing long-term value through the cycles.
We'll now turn the call back over to the moderator for questions."

I'm very pleased with the fourth quarter, and the reasons to be a Concho shareholder continue to be compelling. We're growing margins, growing free cash flow, growing distributions to shareholders and doing this while advancing sustainability. We've assembled a top-tier Permian asset base in our own backyard with multiple decades of project inventory that strengthens our ability to generate free cash flow and increase returns to shareholders. In this dynamic environment, we'll continue to focus on disciplined reinvestment, controlling costs and maintaining a strong financial position. Since our third quarter of '19 earnings call, we've seen oil prices rollercoaster between $50 and $60, and we've been both places twice. Despite the commodity price volatility and many uncertainties, our business model is designed to deliver free cash flow across a wide range of commodity prices.
Last year, we identified 6 key areas for improvement, which included reducing well cost. Our well cost continue to move in the right direction as a result of safely drilling and completing wells faster. We're also transitioning to next-generation frac equipment that is more efficient and provides cost savings and emission reductions.
Second, lowering our cost structure. For the fourth quarter of '19, controllable costs were 17% lower year-over-year, and we're well below our target of $9 per BOE.
Third, selling noncore assets. We closed the New Mexico Shelf asset sale on November 1, bringing full year 2019 sales proceeds to $1.3 billion.
Fourth, delivering profitable growth. Fourth quarter oil volumes increased 4% quarter-over-quarter in spite of the production impact resulting from the New Mexico Shelf asset sale.
Fifth, reducing debt. With the proceeds from the shelf sale, we ended the year with no bank debt and $70 million of cash on the balance sheet. And finally, increasing returns to shareholders. In 2019, we paid $100 million of dividends and repurchased $250 million of stock.
Going forward, we recognize that both asset quality and execution are necessary to the success of our business. We made real progress toward our goals in the second half of the year, and I'm proud of our employees for their performance. Their efforts are directly benefiting our bottom line and driving the inflection in free cash flow that we delivered in the fourth quarter.
Now turning to 2020. Jack will speak with -- to the specific numbers, but I want to summarize our high-level strategy for the year. We're focused on 4 things. First, growing margins. We have several ways within our control to grow margins, including cost reductions and a better capital program. We also stand to benefit from better oil price realizations, as Permian barrels are now pricing at a premium.
Second, growing free cash flow. We expect lower well cost and our focus on smaller projects and wider spacing will result in better well productivity, which supports growing free cash flow. And we have the inventory and operational capability to support our commitment to free cash flow over the long term.
Third, growing distributions. Yesterday, we announced a 60% increase to our dividend. The dividend raise demonstrates our confidence in the cash flow potential of our business. Also in the fourth quarter of '19, we initiated a $1.5 billion share repurchase program. We were active in the fourth quarter and bought back 3.3 million shares at an average price of $76 per share.
Fourth, advancing sustainability. Our stakeholders are seeking greater transparency regarding sustainability, and we take this seriously. Our flared volumes averaged 1.6% of gross in '19 compared to 2.7% in '18. We've published a 2-degree scenario report, and we're working on a sustainability report to detail our progress. This set of priorities and the results of our drilling in '19 guided our capital allocation and development strategy for 2020 and beyond. We're developing the assets with wider spacing and have multiple decades of inventory.
Additionally, we're looking to optimize our acreage position through trades with adjacent operators. Our portfolio management efforts in 2019 increased the average lateral length of our inventory by 7% and our working interest by 2%. Our inventory is a key advantage that enables us to deliver attractive long-term returns. We've talked about the evolution of the E&P business model from pure growth to restrain growth, greater free cash flow and higher returns. We've built momentum over the last 2 quarters, delivering on strategic focus that we laid out last year and providing a plan for 2020 that we believe makes a compelling investment case for the future.
With that, I'll turn it over to Jack."

I am proud of the results and increase in cash flow the team delivered in the fourth quarter. We continue to prioritize financial discipline and cost management, and our performance over the past 2 quarters enhances our competitiveness, improves our platform for continued growth and strengthens the investment case for Concho.
Reviewing the fourth quarter specifically, oil volumes totaled 215,000 barrels per day, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range. It also represented an 8% increase from the same period last year. On the cost side, we made significant progress as well. Controllable cost, which includes lease operating cash, G&A and interest expense totaled $8.43 per unit, achieving our $9 target ahead of schedule. Also, during the final quarter of the year, we reinforced our investment-grade balance sheet by eliminating our revolver balance.
Now to the key metric, free cash flow. We generated $187 million in free cash flow for the quarter, which reflects the difference between operating cash flow before changes in working capital of $801 million and exploration and development cost incurred of $614 million. There are 2 important drivers for the cash flow growth. Our high-cash margin production and improving efficiencies across our drilling and completion operations.
For 2019, average drilling, completion and equipment costs per foot were just below $1,000, which reflects an 18% decrease compared to 2018. Despite all the movement during 2019, we stayed within our guided capital budget and grew oil production 25% year-over-year. We also moved to a steadier drilling program in the second half of 2019, which carries into 2020 and will lead to a more efficient capital program.
For 2020, we are planning a $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion capital budget with our activity equally split between the Delaware and Midland basins. We expect this level of investment will result in drilling, completing and turning online approximately 300 wells during the year. The average project size will be 6 wells, and our average well spacing will be 700 to 800 feet as compared to approximately 550 feet last year.
Rolling our cost improvements and faster cycle times together, we expect to spend approximately 10% less year-over-year, while completing about 10% more lateral feet. Our activity is expected to generate 10% to 12% oil production growth, which represents 217,000 to 221,000 barrels of oil per day compared to pro forma 2019 volumes of 197,000 barrels per day.
Gas and NGL prices have fallen since our third quarter '19 call, but our hedge book has this in a position to deliver on the priorities and targets that we've previously discussed. We expect to fund the capital program and generate $350 million of free cash flow at $50 oil and current prices for gas and NGLs due to lower well cost, a lower cost structure and beneficial hedges that provide stability in a volatile market. After our third quarter call, we layered on hedges at $57 WTI. So while they limit our upside and a $60 scenario, they are substantially above market in today's $50 environment.
Our forecast for $650 million of free cash flow at $60 oil, includes the new hedges as well as current NGL prices. We see the potential to deliver $750 million in free cash flow with strong execution and an NGL environment consistent with $60 crude. So again, 2020 is off to a great start, and we will continue to focus on growing margins, growing free cash flow, growing distributions and advancing sustainability. These priorities will support our performance. We also have a very strong commitment to capital discipline because we believe it's key to maintaining a strong balance sheet and growing long-term value through the cycles.
We'll now turn the call back over to the moderator for questions."

Before I talk about the business, our priority right now is ensuring the health and safety of our team. 7 weeks ago, we implemented mandatory work from home for employees who can work remotely. Our strategy has 4 principle",745,"Thanks, Megan, and good morning. Before I talk about the business, our priority right now is ensuring the health and safety of our team. 7 weeks ago, we implemented mandatory work from home for employees who can work remotely. Our strategy has 4 principles, which I'll talk about in a minute, but the first principle is always our team. Their commitment to our business has been excellent during these unique circumstances. Our operational performance this quarter reflects their focus. Although the Permian is big, it's a small close knit community, and our health professionals, first responders, teachers and philanthropic community have shown courage and compassion during this crisis. I want to thank them for their dedication. 
With half the world's population under some kind of shelter in place restriction, we've seen a collapse in oil demand, record-setting inventory and a test of oil storage levels. The uncertainty has pushed oil prices to record lows, even trading negative as the May contract expired, and about $400 billion has been erased from the stock market value of energy companies. The landscape, the players and the duration, which is the biggest unknown, are all fundamentally different from anything that we've seen before. 
We started Concho in 1997, which also wasn't a very good year for oil prices. We built the company around 4 principles: team, assets, returns and balance sheet. It's a simple set of principles, but we believe all 4 of them are critical to thrive when oil prices are high and to do more than just survive when oil prices are low. While our principles have not changed over the last 20-plus years, today's economic environment changes our tactics. We continue to respond to what the market is telling us through low oil prices. So we're further reducing our capital spend rate. We spent roughly $550 million in the first quarter and plan to spend around $1 billion in the remaining 3 quarters of the year as we focus on 4 priorities. First, optimizing our cash flow by adjusting our spend rate, production and cost structure. Second, maintaining a strong balance sheet. Third, continuing to return capital to shareholders through our dividend. And finally, maintaining flexibility to cut further while also preserving our operational capacity. 
The world's population continues to grow. So I don't believe that reduced demand is the new norm. Demand for oil will return. However, the shape, whether it's a V or U is unknown. Well, there's a great deal of uncertainty regarding demand. We believe the current market signals will result in substantially less supply. Over the last 7 weeks, U.S. producers have laid down 305 oil rigs, bringing the current oil rig count to 378. More than half of the losses in the Permian where the oil rig count is down 40% to 246 rigs. More than $35 billion of planned capital expenditures have been cut from upstream budgets in the U.S. so far. We believe these capital and activity cuts will likely have a long-term impact on U.S. supply. In addition, like many U.S. producers, we are curtailing and shutting in volumes, which will also have an impact in the near-term on U.S. oil supply. We've long said that oil prices are going to be more volatile, not less, and oil prices have made a significant departure from the normal trading range. The significant drop in demand and current oil supply amplified commodity price volatility, but we don't believe today's current price represents the future of our industry or business. 
We recognize that every dollar we spend is an investment. We're investing to build value, not volume, and we find long-term value in keeping our machine running although at a much lower level. We still have levers we can pull if conditions deteriorate further, and we will maintain flexibility to make additional cuts to our spending. 
Even as we operate under challenging business conditions, we're not losing focus on sustainability efforts, especially flaring and water recycling. We're committed to this work in advancing our progress even in this difficult time. I'm proud of our team and the operational results they delivered in the first quarter. Our machine is running well, and I'm confident of our position today. The investment case for Concho becomes especially clear during times like these. I expect this not only to survive but to emerge stronger and even more competitive when we're on the other side of this. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Jack."
26906,664879403,1967935,"Concho Resources Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 01, 2020",2020-05-01,"Earnings Calls","Concho Resources Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tim. Today's broader economic situation is unclear. Which makes it impractical to provide detailed quarterly and annual guidance at this time. However, we are more focused than ever on positioning the company to be competitive in every environment",824,"Thanks, Tim. Today's broader economic situation is unclear. Which makes it impractical to provide detailed quarterly and annual guidance at this time. However, we are more focused than ever on positioning the company to be competitive in every environment. To this end, we expect to realize combined LOE and G&A savings of $100 million this year. Additionally, due to strong operational performance and lower cost, we expect DC&E cost per foot to be below the low end of our prior guidance range. And finally, we are quickly decreasing activity by reducing rigs from 18 to 10 in the second quarter and then to 8 for the remainder of the year. This level of activity allows us to predict our strong financial position and preserve our inventory and our ability to lead in a price recovery. 
As Tim mentioned, we now anticipate $1.6 billion in capital spending, which, absent additional curtailments, could sustain full year 2019 divestiture adjusted oil volumes of about 200,000 barrels per day in 2020. While our lower spend rate demonstrates our commitment to capital discipline, it also highlights the efficiencies our team has captured over the last 9 months as well as cost savings, allowing us to do more with less. However, I do want to emphasize that conditions are changing daily and we are likely to curtail additional volumes and possibly in meaningful quantities. I am confident that our continued progress on costs, combined with our operating performance, will translate into better margins and capital productivity when commodity prices improve. 
Turning now to the first quarter's results. Oil volumes totaled 209,000 barrels per day which exceeded the high end of our guidance range. Controllable costs, which includes lease operating, cash G&A and interest, totaled $8.68 per unit. This is below the midpoint of our guidance range and our combined per unit cost target of $9. On an absolute basis, controllable costs in the first quarter were about $255 million. Which based on our outlook for reducing operating and G&A costs by $100 million is a reasonable run rate for the remainder of the year. 
The quick drop in commodity prices and equity markets, including our share price, led to an impairment of $12.6 billion across proved and unproved properties in goodwill. For a third consecutive quarter, we generated free cash flow. Operating cash flow before working capital, less capital expenditures, was $188 million. The cash went to funding the increased dividend and reinforcing the balance sheet. In January, we repurchased $100 million of shares, which delivered on our commitment to apply 40% of New Mexico shale sales proceeds to a buyback. 
On last quarter's call, we said that our business allows Concho to deliver free cash flow across a wide range of commodity prices. At the time, we didn't envision oil going to 0, that our large hedge position absorbs the impact of the volatility. And even at 0, we can continue to accrue cash to the balance sheet. 
First quarter cash receipts from our hedges totaled $201 million, and we ended March with a $1.5 billion asset. Slide 9 of the earnings materials highlights the potential receipts we could generate in 2020. While our hedging strategy serves us well in today's environment, our hedges are intended to protect our cash flows and balance sheet from commodity price volatility and not to justify investments or production decisions. The economics of those decisions are stand-alone and today undergo more scrutiny than ever. We've made the economic decision to curtail some of our highest cost properties already and continue to evaluate the need for larger curtailments. Many inputs go into these decisions. But rest assured, we are navigating these uncertain times, focused on maximizing near-term cash flow and the long-term value of the company. 
Finally, regarding our balance sheet. We've long maintained a strong balance sheet. And in fact, at the end of the first quarter, our net debt-to-EBITDAX ratio was one of the lowest it's ever been for a trailing 12-month period. Our maturity profile is long-dated and we remain investment grade. We ended the period with about $200 million of cash on hand, which combined with our credit facility, gives us $2.2 billion in total liquidity and is further supported by a strong cash flow generation. 
In summary, I hope you come away with a few important messages. First, the health and safety of our employees and communities comes first. Second, our performance in the first quarter builds on the prior 2 quarters and provides a good foundation as we confront a challenging and uncertain period. Third, we're focused on all the things we can control. We're cutting capital, reducing our cost structure and positioning for recovery. And last, our hedge book, balance sheet and overall strategy are differentiating advantages that provide comfort that we will persevere and emerge from this current situation as a stronger company.

And I think that we have shown that the U.S. shale production is the swing production in the world. And we've talked a lot with you and others about how that's going to be sloppy going forward because we're not a cartel. We're a bunch of individually managed private companies.

Like previously, I think you were talking about the 7% to 10% production growth, is that now still the number or that actually being revised downward further? And also, what our balance sheet, do you even want to be more conservative and keep more cash on the balance sheet going forward?"

And I think it's also important to just get there that Jack referenced that our hedges don't justify producing a barrel that's otherwise uneconomic on an unhedged basis. And so that all allows us to be very thoughtful and reactive in our decision-making. We have a tremendous amount of flexibility as it relates to our contractual situation. We have some limitations here in the month of May, just around the nomination process and all of those things. But as you move further into this into June, we have tremendous flexibility to curtail significant amounts of volumes. And as to the duration question, I think that's one of the hardest things to try and estimate. I do think we see May and especially June as the most challenging period of this and then expect as the restrictions on kind of commerce and things, allow demand to come back that you come out the other side to some regard, but then you still have a pretty significant amount of oil and storage that you're going to have to deal with over a period of time. So I think time will tell. I think the next couple of weeks will be helpful to see how our industry is responding in terms of curtailment and the supply side of the equation."

Before I talk about the business, our priority right now is ensuring the health and safety of our team. 7 weeks ago, we implemented mandatory work from home for employees who can work remotely. Our strategy has 4 principle",744,"Thanks, Megan, and good morning. Before I talk about the business, our priority right now is ensuring the health and safety of our team. 7 weeks ago, we implemented mandatory work from home for employees who can work remotely. Our strategy has 4 principles, which I'll talk about in a minute, but the first principle is always our team. Their commitment to our business has been excellent during these unique circumstances. Our operational performance this quarter reflects their focus. Although the Permian is big, it's a small close-knit community, and our health professionals, first responders, teachers and philanthropic community have shown courage and compassion during this crisis. I want to thank them for their dedication. 
With half the world's population under some kind of shelter-in-place restriction, we've seen a collapse in oil demand, record-setting inventory and a test of oil storage levels. The uncertainty has pushed oil prices to record lows, even trading negative as the May contract expired, and about $400 billion has been erased from the stock market value of energy companies. The landscape, the players and the duration, which is the biggest unknown, are all fundamentally different from anything that we've seen before. 
We started Concho in 1997, which also wasn't a very good year for oil prices. We built the company around 4 principles: team, assets, returns and balance sheet. It's a simple set of principles, but we believe all 4 of them are critical to thrive when oil prices are high and to do more than just survive when oil prices are low. While our principles have not changed over the last 20-plus years, today's economic environment changes our tactics. We continue to respond to what the market is telling us through low oil prices. So we're further reducing our capital spend rate. We spent roughly $550 million in the first quarter and plan to spend around $1 billion in the remaining 3 quarters of the year as we focus on 4 priorities. First, optimizing our cash flow by adjusting our spend rate, production and cost structure. Second, maintaining a strong balance sheet. Third, continuing to return capital to shareholders through our dividend. And finally, maintaining flexibility to cut further while also preserving our operational capacity. 
The world's population continues to grow. So I don't believe that reduced demand is the new norm. Demand for oil will return. However, the shape, whether it's a V or U is unknown. Well, there's a great deal of uncertainty regarding demand, we believe the current market signals will result in substantially less supply. Over the last 7 weeks, U.S. producers have laid down 305 oil rigs, bringing the current oil rig count to 378. More than half of the losses in the Permian where the oil rig count is down 40% to 246 rigs. More than $35 billion of planned capital expenditures have been cut from upstream budgets in the U.S. so far. We believe these capital and activity cuts will likely have a long-term impact on U.S. supply. In addition, like many U.S. producers, we are curtailing and shutting in volumes, which will also have an impact in the near term on U.S. oil supply. We've long said that oil prices are going to be more volatile, not less, and oil prices have made a significant departure from the normal trading range. The significant drop in demand and current oil supply have amplified commodity price volatility, but we don't believe today's current price represents the future of our industry or business. 
We recognize that every dollar we spend is an investment. We're investing to build value, not volume, and we find long-term value in keeping our machine running although at a much lower level. We still have levers we can pull if conditions deteriorate further, and we will maintain flexibility to make additional cuts to our spending. 
Even as we operate under challenging business conditions, we're not losing focus on sustainability efforts, especially flaring and water recycling. We're committed to this work in advancing our progress even in this difficult time. I'm proud of our team and the operational results they delivered in the first quarter. Our machine is running well, and I'm confident of our position today. The investment case for Concho becomes especially clear during times like these. I expect this not only to survive but to emerge stronger and even more competitive when we're on the other side of this. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Jack."
26906,664879403,1968137,"Concho Resources Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 01, 2020",2020-05-01,"Earnings Calls","Concho Resources Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tim. Today's broader economic situation is unclear, which makes it impractical to provide detailed quarterly and annual guidance at this time. However, we are more focused than ever on positioning the company to be competitive in every environment",826,"Thanks, Tim. Today's broader economic situation is unclear, which makes it impractical to provide detailed quarterly and annual guidance at this time. However, we are more focused than ever on positioning the company to be competitive in every environment. To this end, we expect to realize combined LOE and G&A savings of $100 million this year. Additionally, due to strong operational performance and lower cost, we expect DC&E cost per foot to be below the low end of our prior guidance range. And finally, we are quickly decreasing activity by reducing rigs from 18 to 10 in the second quarter and then to 8 for the remainder of the year. This level of activity allows us to predict our strong financial position and preserve our inventory and our ability to lead in a price recovery. 
As Tim mentioned, we now anticipate $1.6 billion in capital spending, which, absent additional curtailments, could sustain full year 2019 divestiture adjusted oil volumes of about 200,000 barrels per day in 2020. While our lower spend rate demonstrates our commitment to capital discipline, it also highlights the efficiencies our team has captured over the last 9 months as well as cost savings, allowing us to do more with less. However, I do want to emphasize that conditions are changing daily, and we are likely to curtail additional volumes and possibly in meaningful quantities. I am confident that our continued progress on costs, combined with our operating performance, will translate into better margins and capital productivity when commodity prices improve. 
Turning now to the first quarter's results. Oil volumes totaled 209,000 barrels per day which exceeded the high end of our guidance range. Controllable costs, which includes lease operating, cash G&A and interest, totaled $8.68 per unit. This is below the midpoint of our guidance range and our combined per unit cost target of $9. On an absolute basis, controllable costs in the first quarter were about $255 million, which based on our outlook for reducing operating and G&A costs by $100 million is a reasonable run rate for the remainder of the year. 
The quick drop in commodity prices and equity markets, including our share price, led to an impairment of $12.6 billion across proved and unproved properties in goodwill. For a third consecutive quarter, we generated free cash flow. Operating cash flow before working capital, less capital expenditures, was $188 million. The cash went to funding the increased dividend and reinforcing the balance sheet. In January, we repurchased $100 million of shares, which delivered on our commitment to apply 40% of New Mexico Shelf sales proceeds to a buyback. 
On last quarter's call, we said that our business allows Concho to deliver free cash flow across a wide range of commodity prices. At the time, we didn't envision oil going to 0, that our large hedge position absorbs the impact of the volatility. And even at 0, we can continue to accrue cash to the balance sheet. 
First quarter cash receipts from our hedges totaled $201 million, and we ended March with a $1.5 billion asset. Slide 9 of the earnings materials highlights the potential receipts we could generate in 2020. While our hedging strategy serves us well in today's environment, our hedges are intended to protect our cash flows and balance sheet from commodity price volatility and not to justify investments or production decisions. The economics of those decisions are stand-alone and today undergo more scrutiny than ever. We've made the economic decision to curtail some of our highest cost properties already and continue to evaluate the need for larger curtailments. Many inputs go into these decisions. But rest assured, we are navigating these uncertain times, focused on maximizing near-term cash flow and the long-term value of the company. 
Finally, regarding our balance sheet. We've long maintained a strong balance sheet. And in fact, at the end of the first quarter, our net debt-to-EBITDAX ratio was one of the lowest it's ever been for a trailing 12-month period. Our maturity profile is long dated, and we remain investment grade. We ended the period with about $200 million of cash on hand, which combined with our credit facility, gives us $2.2 billion in total liquidity and is further supported by a strong cash flow generation. 
In summary, I hope you come away with a few important messages. First, the health and safety of our employees and communities comes first. Second, our performance in the first quarter builds on the prior 2 quarters and provides a good foundation as we confront a challenging and uncertain period. Third, we're focused on all the things we can control. We're cutting capital, reducing our cost structure and positioning for a recovery. And last, our hedge book, balance sheet and overall strategy are differentiating advantages that provide comfort that we will persevere and emerge from this current situation as a stronger company. 
With that, let me turn the call over to the operator for Q&A."

I think a good way to think about that is just resetting closer to that average number throughout the rest of the year and then being able to maintain that."

Obviously, you guys had written to the Texas Railroad Commission. You've seen what Wayne has come out with. And I'm sure we're all watching to see what happens next week. But my question is probably, Tim, for you. When you come out the other side of this, what does Concho look like? You're very early to try and balance cash returns with growth. And I know it's a long way, we -- I expect. But when you come out the other side of this, what is the right business model growth rate balance or maybe reinvestment rates, the right way to think about it in terms of cash flow? How will Concho manage its business going forward in light of I guess, what is now a headline of wasteful production from Texas, you could say, based on the case has been put forward by Pioneer?"

And it's more of a model of moderated growth and cash flow generation. It will be companies, and our company with a stronger balance sheet with less leverage. And I think that we have shown that the U.S. shale production is the swing production in the world. And we've talked a lot with you and others about how that's going to be sloppy going forward because we're not a cartel. We're a bunch of individually managed private companies. And that from time to time, we will get strong price signals that will cause us either to add production or curtail production. And -- so we're strong believers in the market working. You asked me about the lane and that. And I think the market is working.

We're comfortably below that low end that we had previously guided to of $850 to $900 a foot in the first quarter. And I think from April going forward, we will continue to drive that down modestly, and it's a blend of both. It's a blend of secular and cyclical.

We have some limitations here in the month of May, just around the nomination process and all of those things. But as you move further into this into June, we have tremendous flexibility to curtail significant amounts of volumes. 
And as to the duration question, I think that's one of the hardest things to try and estimate. I do think we see May and especially June as the most challenging period of this and then expect as the restrictions on kind of commerce and things, allow demand to come back that you come out the other side to some regard, but then you still have a pretty significant amount of oil and storage that you're going to have to deal with over a period of time.

Before I talk about the business, our priority right now is ensuring the health and safety of our team. 7 weeks ago, we implemented mandatory work from home for employees who can work remotely.

Before I talk about the business, our priority right now is ensuring the health and safety of our team. 7 weeks ago, we implemented mandatory work from home for employees who can work remotely. Our strategy has 4 principles, which I'll talk about in a minute, but the first principle is always our team. Their commitment to our business has been excellent during these unique circumstances. Our operational performance this quarter reflects their focus. Although the Permian is big, it's a small close-knit community, and our health professionals, first responders, teachers and philanthropic community have shown courage and compassion during this crisis. I want to thank them for their dedication. 
With half the world's population under some kind of shelter-in-place restriction, we've seen a collapse in oil demand, record-setting inventory and a test of oil storage levels. The uncertainty has pushed oil prices to record lows, even trading negative as the May contract expired, and about $400 billion has been erased from the stock market value of energy companies. The landscape, the players and the duration, which is the biggest unknown, are all fundamentally different from anything that we've seen before. 
We started Concho in 1997, which also wasn't a very good year for oil prices. We built the company around 4 principles: team, assets, returns and balance sheet. It's a simple set of principles, but we believe all 4 of them are critical to thrive when oil prices are high and to do more than just survive when oil prices are low. While our principles have not changed over the last 20-plus years, today's economic environment changes our tactics. We continue to respond to what the market is telling us through low oil prices. So we're further reducing our capital spend rate. We spent roughly $550 million in the first quarter and plan to spend around $1 billion in the remaining 3 quarters of the year as we focus on 4 priorities. First, optimizing our cash flow by adjusting our spend rate, production and cost structure. Second, maintaining a strong balance sheet. Third, continuing to return capital to shareholders through our dividend. And finally, maintaining flexibility to cut further while also preserving our operational capacity. 
The world's population continues to grow. So I don't believe that reduced demand is the new norm. Demand for oil will return. However, the shape, whether it's a V or U is unknown. Where there's a great deal of uncertainty regarding demand, we believe the current market signals will result in substantially less supply. Over the last 7 weeks, U.S. producers have laid down 305 oil rigs, bringing the current oil rig count to 378. More than half of the losses in the Permian where the oil rig count is down 40% to 246 rigs. More than $35 billion of planned capital expenditures have been cut from upstream budgets in the U.S. so far. We believe these capital and activity cuts will likely have a long-term impact on U.S. supply. In addition, like many U.S. producers, we are curtailing and shutting in volumes, which will also have an impact in the near term on U.S. oil supply. We've long said that oil prices are going to be more volatile, not less, and oil prices have made a significant departure from the normal trading range. The significant drop in demand and current oil supply have amplified commodity price volatility, but we don't believe today's current price represents the future of our industry or business. 
We recognize that every dollar we spend is an investment. We're investing to build value, not volume, and we find long-term value in keeping our machine running although at a much lower level. We still have levers we can pull if conditions deteriorate further, and we will maintain flexibility to make additional cuts to our spending. 
Even as we operate under challenging business conditions, we're not losing focus on sustainability efforts, especially flaring and water recycling. We're committed to this work in advancing our progress even in this difficult time. I'm proud of our team and the operational results they delivered in the first quarter. Our machine is running well, and I'm confident of our position today. The investment case for Concho becomes especially clear during times like these. I expect this not only to survive but to emerge stronger and even more competitive when we're on the other side of this. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Jack."
26906,664879403,1990065,"Concho Resources Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 01, 2020",2020-05-01,"Earnings Calls","Concho Resources Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tim. Today's broader economic situation is unclear, which makes it impractical to provide detailed quarterly and annual guidance at this time. However, we are more focused than ever on positioning the company to be competitive in every environment",826,"Thanks, Tim. Today's broader economic situation is unclear, which makes it impractical to provide detailed quarterly and annual guidance at this time. However, we are more focused than ever on positioning the company to be competitive in every environment. To this end, we expect to realize combined LOE and G&A savings of $100 million this year. Additionally, due to strong operational performance and lower cost, we expect DC&E cost per foot to be below the low end of our prior guidance range. And finally, we are quickly decreasing activity by reducing rigs from 18 to 10 in the second quarter and then to 8 for the remainder of the year. This level of activity allows us to predict our strong financial position and preserve our inventory and our ability to lead in a price recovery. 
As Tim mentioned, we now anticipate $1.6 billion in capital spending, which, absent additional curtailments, could sustain full year 2019 divestiture adjusted oil volumes of about 200,000 barrels per day in 2020. While our lower spend rate demonstrates our commitment to capital discipline, it also highlights the efficiencies our team has captured over the last 9 months as well as cost savings, allowing us to do more with less. However, I do want to emphasize that conditions are changing daily, and we are likely to curtail additional volumes and possibly in meaningful quantities. I am confident that our continued progress on costs, combined with our operating performance, will translate into better margins and capital productivity when commodity prices improve. 
Turning now to the first quarter's results. Oil volumes totaled 209,000 barrels per day which exceeded the high end of our guidance range. Controllable costs, which includes lease operating, cash G&A and interest, totaled $8.68 per unit. This is below the midpoint of our guidance range and our combined per unit cost target of $9. On an absolute basis, controllable costs in the first quarter were about $255 million, which based on our outlook for reducing operating and G&A costs by $100 million is a reasonable run rate for the remainder of the year. 
The quick drop in commodity prices and equity markets, including our share price, led to an impairment of $12.6 billion across proved and unproved properties in goodwill. For a third consecutive quarter, we generated free cash flow. Operating cash flow before working capital, less capital expenditures, was $188 million. The cash went to funding the increased dividend and reinforcing the balance sheet. In January, we repurchased $100 million of shares, which delivered on our commitment to apply 40% of New Mexico Shelf sales proceeds to a buyback. 
On last quarter's call, we said that our business allows Concho to deliver free cash flow across a wide range of commodity prices. At the time, we didn't envision oil going to 0, that our large hedge position absorbs the impact of the volatility. And even at 0, we can continue to accrue cash to the balance sheet. 
First quarter cash receipts from our hedges totaled $201 million, and we ended March with a $1.5 billion asset. Slide 9 of the earnings materials highlights the potential receipts we could generate in 2020. While our hedging strategy serves us well in today's environment, our hedges are intended to protect our cash flows and balance sheet from commodity price volatility and not to justify investments or production decisions. The economics of those decisions are stand-alone and today undergo more scrutiny than ever. We've made the economic decision to curtail some of our highest cost properties already and continue to evaluate the need for larger curtailments. Many inputs go into these decisions. But rest assured, we are navigating these uncertain times, focused on maximizing near-term cash flow and the long-term value of the company. 
Finally, regarding our balance sheet. We've long maintained a strong balance sheet. And in fact, at the end of the first quarter, our net debt-to-EBITDAX ratio was one of the lowest it's ever been for a trailing 12-month period. Our maturity profile is long dated, and we remain investment grade. We ended the period with about $200 million of cash on hand, which combined with our credit facility, gives us $2.2 billion in total liquidity and is further supported by a strong cash flow generation. 
In summary, I hope you come away with a few important messages. First, the health and safety of our employees and communities comes first. Second, our performance in the first quarter builds on the prior 2 quarters and provides a good foundation as we confront a challenging and uncertain period. Third, we're focused on all the things we can control. We're cutting capital, reducing our cost structure and positioning for a recovery. And last, our hedge book, balance sheet and overall strategy are differentiating advantages that provide comfort that we will persevere and emerge from this current situation as a stronger company. 
With that, let me turn the call over to the operator for Q&A."

And I think that we have shown that the U.S. shale production is the swing production in the world. And we've talked a lot with you and others about how that's going to be sloppy going forward because we're not a cartel. We're a bunch of individually managed private companies.

Over the last couple of quarters, I think the teams have done a fantastic job, doing that both on a kind of sustainable efficiency gain side, but also to your point, on more of a cyclical, absolute service cost savings side. 1Q was a continuation of that. We're comfortably below that low end that we had previously guided to of $850 to $900 a foot in the first quarter. And I think from April going forward, we will continue to drive that down modestly, and it's a blend of both. It's a blend of secular and cyclical.

We have some limitations here in the month of May, just around the nomination process and all of those things. But as you move further into this into June, we have tremendous flexibility to curtail significant amounts of volumes. 
And as to the duration question, I think that's one of the hardest things to try and estimate. I do think we see May and especially June as the most challenging period of this and then expect as the restrictions on kind of commerce and things, allow demand to come back that you come out the other side to some regard, but then you still have a pretty significant amount of oil and storage that you're going to have to deal with over a period of time.

Before I talk about the business, our priority right now is ensuring the health and safety of our team. 7 weeks ago, we implemented mandatory work from home for employees who can work remotely. Our strategy has 4 principle",744,"Thanks, Megan, and good morning. Before I talk about the business, our priority right now is ensuring the health and safety of our team. 7 weeks ago, we implemented mandatory work from home for employees who can work remotely. Our strategy has 4 principles, which I'll talk about in a minute, but the first principle is always our team. Their commitment to our business has been excellent during these unique circumstances. Our operational performance this quarter reflects their focus. Although the Permian is big, it's a small close-knit community, and our health professionals, first responders, teachers and philanthropic community have shown courage and compassion during this crisis. I want to thank them for their dedication. 
With half the world's population under some kind of shelter-in-place restriction, we've seen a collapse in oil demand, record-setting inventory and a test of oil storage levels. The uncertainty has pushed oil prices to record lows, even trading negative as the May contract expired, and about $400 billion has been erased from the stock market value of energy companies. The landscape, the players and the duration, which is the biggest unknown, are all fundamentally different from anything that we've seen before. 
We started Concho in 1997, which also wasn't a very good year for oil prices. We built the company around 4 principles: team, assets, returns and balance sheet. It's a simple set of principles, but we believe all 4 of them are critical to thrive when oil prices are high and to do more than just survive when oil prices are low. While our principles have not changed over the last 20-plus years, today's economic environment changes our tactics. We continue to respond to what the market is telling us through low oil prices. So we're further reducing our capital spend rate. We spent roughly $550 million in the first quarter and plan to spend around $1 billion in the remaining 3 quarters of the year as we focus on 4 priorities. First, optimizing our cash flow by adjusting our spend rate, production and cost structure. Second, maintaining a strong balance sheet. Third, continuing to return capital to shareholders through our dividend. And finally, maintaining flexibility to cut further while also preserving our operational capacity. 
The world's population continues to grow. So I don't believe that reduced demand is the new norm. Demand for oil will return. However, the shape, whether it's a V or U is unknown. Where there's a great deal of uncertainty regarding demand, we believe the current market signals will result in substantially less supply. Over the last 7 weeks, U.S. producers have laid down 305 oil rigs, bringing the current oil rig count to 378. More than half of the losses in the Permian where the oil rig count is down 40% to 246 rigs. More than $35 billion of planned capital expenditures have been cut from upstream budgets in the U.S. so far. We believe these capital and activity cuts will likely have a long-term impact on U.S. supply. In addition, like many U.S. producers, we are curtailing and shutting in volumes, which will also have an impact in the near term on U.S. oil supply. We've long said that oil prices are going to be more volatile, not less, and oil prices have made a significant departure from the normal trading range. The significant drop in demand and current oil supply have amplified commodity price volatility, but we don't believe today's current price represents the future of our industry or business. 
We recognize that every dollar we spend is an investment. We're investing to build value, not volume, and we find long-term value in keeping our machine running although at a much lower level. We still have levers we can pull if conditions deteriorate further, and we will maintain flexibility to make additional cuts to our spending. 
Even as we operate under challenging business conditions, we're not losing focus on sustainability efforts, especially flaring and water recycling. We're committed to this work in advancing our progress even in this difficult time. I'm proud of our team and the operational results they delivered in the first quarter. Our machine is running well, and I'm confident of our position today. The investment case for Concho becomes especially clear during times like these. I expect this not only to survive but to emerge stronger and even more competitive when we're on the other side of this. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Jack."
26906,664879403,1992925,"Concho Resources Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 01, 2020",2020-05-01,"Earnings Calls","Concho Resources Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tim. Today's broader economic situation is unclear, which makes it impractical to provide detailed quarterly and annual guidance at this time. However, we are more focused than ever on positioning the company to be competitive in every environment",826,"Thanks, Tim. Today's broader economic situation is unclear, which makes it impractical to provide detailed quarterly and annual guidance at this time. However, we are more focused than ever on positioning the company to be competitive in every environment. To this end, we expect to realize combined LOE and G&A savings of $100 million this year. Additionally, due to strong operational performance and lower cost, we expect DC&E cost per foot to be below the low end of our prior guidance range. And finally, we are quickly decreasing activity by reducing rigs from 18 to 10 in the second quarter and then to 8 for the remainder of the year. This level of activity allows us to predict our strong financial position and preserve our inventory and our ability to lead in a price recovery. 
As Tim mentioned, we now anticipate $1.6 billion in capital spending, which, absent additional curtailments, could sustain full year 2019 divestiture adjusted oil volumes of about 200,000 barrels per day in 2020. While our lower spend rate demonstrates our commitment to capital discipline, it also highlights the efficiencies our team has captured over the last 9 months as well as cost savings, allowing us to do more with less. However, I do want to emphasize that conditions are changing daily, and we are likely to curtail additional volumes and possibly in meaningful quantities. I am confident that our continued progress on costs, combined with our operating performance, will translate into better margins and capital productivity when commodity prices improve. 
Turning now to the first quarter's results. Oil volumes totaled 209,000 barrels per day which exceeded the high end of our guidance range. Controllable costs, which includes lease operating, cash G&A and interest, totaled $8.68 per unit. This is below the midpoint of our guidance range and our combined per unit cost target of $9. On an absolute basis, controllable costs in the first quarter were about $255 million, which based on our outlook for reducing operating and G&A costs by $100 million is a reasonable run rate for the remainder of the year. 
The quick drop in commodity prices and equity markets, including our share price, led to an impairment of $12.6 billion across proved and unproved properties in goodwill. For a third consecutive quarter, we generated free cash flow. Operating cash flow before working capital, less capital expenditures, was $188 million. The cash went to funding the increased dividend and reinforcing the balance sheet. In January, we repurchased $100 million of shares, which delivered on our commitment to apply 40% of New Mexico Shelf sales proceeds to a buyback. 
On last quarter's call, we said that our business allows Concho to deliver free cash flow across a wide range of commodity prices. At the time, we didn't envision oil going to 0, that our large hedge position absorbs the impact of the volatility. And even at 0, we can continue to accrue cash to the balance sheet. 
First quarter cash receipts from our hedges totaled $201 million, and we ended March with a $1.5 billion asset. Slide 9 of the earnings materials highlights the potential receipts we could generate in 2020. While our hedging strategy serves us well in today's environment, our hedges are intended to protect our cash flows and balance sheet from commodity price volatility and not to justify investments or production decisions. The economics of those decisions are stand-alone and today undergo more scrutiny than ever. We've made the economic decision to curtail some of our highest cost properties already and continue to evaluate the need for larger curtailments. Many inputs go into these decisions. But rest assured, we are navigating these uncertain times, focused on maximizing near-term cash flow and the long-term value of the company. 
Finally, regarding our balance sheet. We've long maintained a strong balance sheet. And in fact, at the end of the first quarter, our net debt-to-EBITDAX ratio was one of the lowest it's ever been for a trailing 12-month period. Our maturity profile is long dated, and we remain investment grade. We ended the period with about $200 million of cash on hand, which combined with our credit facility, gives us $2.2 billion in total liquidity and is further supported by a strong cash flow generation. 
In summary, I hope you come away with a few important messages. First, the health and safety of our employees and communities comes first. Second, our performance in the first quarter builds on the prior 2 quarters and provides a good foundation as we confront a challenging and uncertain period. Third, we're focused on all the things we can control. We're cutting capital, reducing our cost structure and positioning for a recovery. And last, our hedge book, balance sheet and overall strategy are differentiating advantages that provide comfort that we will persevere and emerge from this current situation as a stronger company. 
With that, let me turn the call over to the operator for Q&A."

And I think that we have shown that the U.S. shale production is the swing production in the world. And we've talked a lot with you and others about how that's going to be sloppy going forward because we're not a cartel. We're a bunch of individually managed private companies.

I do think -- I mean you've seen pretty dramatic improvement in our cost structure on like a DC&E basis. Over the last couple of quarters, I think the teams have done a fantastic job, doing that both on a kind of sustainable efficiency gain side, but also to your point, on more of a cyclical, absolute service cost savings side. 1Q was a continuation of that. We're comfortably below that low end that we had previously guided to of $850 to $900 a foot in the first quarter. And I think from April going forward, we will continue to drive that down modestly, and it's a blend of both. It's a blend of secular and cyclical. And I would say from here, probably the absolute cost savings are outweighing some of those more sustainable efficiency gains just because activity levels have gotten so low."

We have some limitations here in the month of May, just around the nomination process and all of those things. But as you move further into this into June, we have tremendous flexibility to curtail significant amounts of volumes. 
And as to the duration question, I think that's one of the hardest things to try and estimate. I do think we see May and especially June as the most challenging period of this and then expect as the restrictions on kind of commerce and things, allow demand to come back that you come out the other side to some regard, but then you still have a pretty significant amount of oil and storage that you're going to have to deal with over a period of time.

The second quarter tested the strength of the industry, and I'm confident we're even stronger company after the recent challenges.

The second quarter tested the strength of the industry, and I'm confident we're even stronger company after the recent challenges. Not many companies are going to come out of this stronger, but I believe that we're one of them. 
As I think about the first half of this year, we've made real progress on several priorities that will position us for the future. Maximizing our cash flow by adjusting our spend rate, production and cost structure; increasing the strength of our balance sheet; continuing to return capital to shareholders through our dividend; and managing the oil price volatility with capital discipline, while also preserving our operational capacity. 
The last several months have been more volatile than anything we've ever seen. Oil ended the quarter up 92%, the largest move in the quarter in 30 years. The water ride, oil prices dropped to negative $38 then rebounded to positive $40 as the U.S. and OPEC+ cut production. Against a volatile backdrop and historically weak price realizations, Concho delivered strong operational and financial performance in the second quarter. Our results reflect the strength of our portfolio and our team. We delivered strong cash flows and lower cost while we cut our activity. 
Moving forward, we're maintaining the same level of focus that helped us navigate the first half of the year. In short, we'll continue to remain flexible. And as we look past 2020, we will be patient for sustained higher prices before increasing spending. 
Today, there are 125 rigs running in the Permian. A year ago, there were 440 and frac spreads have declined even more dramatically. This reduction in activity is starting to show up as declining Permian production. In addition, fuel declines are setting in, capital continues to be scarce and we're seeing the effects of a shrinking industry. We believe the future of our industry requires better capitalized companies, more capital discipline, less leverage and being more aware of market signals for growth. Before the pandemic, we outlined a clear vision for the evolution of our business, delivering both sustainable cash flow growth, production growth and increasing returns to shareholders. While there's more uncertainty than usual around the macroeconomic environment, this plan remains unchanged. And the principles that form our strategy, people, assets, returns and financial strength will guide us along the way. 
Operating responsibly is key to the evolution of the business model as well. We believe that operating responsibly and delivering good financial performance are not mutually exclusive. Our flaring performance in 2020 is trending toward 1% of gross operated gas volumes as compared to 1.8% in 2019. In August, we'll publish our first sustainability report. We look forward to engaging with you on these important topics. 
We continue to work through the pandemic and the impact that it's having on our communities and workforce. I want to acknowledge the hard work of our employees. They continue to perform well in a tough environment. This was a great quarter, and I'm proud of our performance. 
Before I turn the call over to Jack, I want to summarize a few things that I hope you will come away with. First, we're successfully managing this cycle without losing focus on the long-term value and operational capacity of the company. Also, we're improving our operational performance, which is lowering our cost structure. Next, we're continuing to reduce our net debt. And finally, we will be patient on the recovery, prioritizing free cash flow and reinforcing our machine. With that, let me turn it over to Jack."

Our results for the second quarter not only continue our trend of solid financial and operating performance, they also demonstrate that we are controlling what we can. And by doing so, we are well positioned to become a more profitable company. Last quarter, we outlined the steps that we're taking to align our business with the current environment. Those steps include reducing our capital program, improving our cost structure and reinforcing our balance sheet. 
Regarding our capital program. CapEx in the second quarter totaled $312 million, 24% lower than the first quarter this year. The step down in the quarter reflects less overall activity as well as continued improvement in well costs. For the second time this year, we are reducing our well cost guidance due to better operational efficiencies and a lower service cost environment. We expect the cost to drill complete and equip a well to average less than $800 per foot or more than 30% lower than the cost to do that work last year. 
With respect to our cost structure. Controllable costs, which includes lease operating, cash G&A and interest expense totaled $7.49 per unit, down 20% from 2019. We are managing all aspects of our cost structure. Examples include the logical items like well maintenance, workovers, water handling and optimizing artificial lift. We also made the difficult decision to implement a voluntary separation program. These combined efforts are expected to result in more than $135 million in reduced operating and G&A costs, up from our prior target of $100 million. Quickly adjusting our capital program and managing our costs lower, combined with our hedge position, drove strong cash flow generation. Operating cash flow before working capital was $550 million, which resulted in $238 million of free cash flow, which brings me to reinforcing our balance sheet. 
Our cash position nearly doubled to $320 million, and at the end of the second quarter, our net debt was $3.6 billion, down from $4.3 billion a year ago despite commodity price volatility. And although we have one of the better balance sheets in the industry, we plan to direct the $375 million to $450 million of free cash flow anticipated in the back half of the year to our balance sheet, making quick progress towards our goal to reduce net debt by another $600 million. 
Oil volumes for the second quarter averaged 200,000 barrels per day, and we remain on track with our full year guide of approximately 197,000 barrels per day and $1.6 billion in capital spending. We've built a leading position in 1 of the best resource basins in the world. Our portfolio quality, depth and durability are nearly unmatched. Importantly, we have a good mix of investment opportunities across federal state and private lands. This mix allows us to redirect capital without degrading the returns or the capital efficiency of our drilling program. And as Tim discussed, we are working to minimize our emissions as well. I'm confident that our operating principles and performance regardless of the environment we're in. Without question, this has been a challenging year thus far, testing every company. To meet the challenge, we're maintaining our approach to capital discipline and prioritizing free cash flow. I believe that our second quarter results show that the steps we are taking are enabling us to build a better company, driven by more efficient capital investment and cost control. 
With that, let me turn the call over to the operator for Q&A."

And additionally, exit-to-exit rate basis, we see our production holding up well and better than most. And secondly, we described in the last quarter, our focus on free cash flow generation.

I also mentioned that I thought our industry as a whole needed to be more aware of price signals and what was going on in the market. So as we entered this cycle, no one really thought that U.S. shales could grow as much as they did, add as much production, and that threw everything out of balance at a really bad time.

I mean, a lot of the commentary we gave around the transaction we did with them in Eddy County a couple of quarters ago would apply to this conversation around what we've done now with them, expanding into Lea County. The benefits to us are on both the capital side and that this entity will be spending capital dollars to build out water infrastructure as opposed to ourselves. It will also help on the lease operating expense side and help us continue to drive down to the extent we're trucking any water. This will -- should get all of our water on the pipe over time. And then one of the kind of longer term, but still very important goal is to increase our percentage of recycled water use. And our opinion is that you're going to need to have big third-party infrastructure to handle big bonds of water and move it around the basin where it's needed as opposed to the older model where individual companies kind of build it themselves and utilize it at pretty low rates. And so those are kind of the drivers for it. I think an important also piece of it is the existing equity owners agreed to increase their capital commitment to the entity. So I think it sits in a very good position and helps take the burden off of us from a capital standpoint."

As to your kind of broader question on drill completing the costs and where they go in the future, the number we're talking about is a annual program-wide number. It's not aspirational. It's kind of the whole program, short laterals, long laterals, et cetera.

The second quarter tested the strength of the industry, and I'm confident we're even stronger company after the recent challenges. Not many companies are going to come out of this stronger, but I believe that we're one of them",591,"Thanks, Megan. Good morning. The second quarter tested the strength of the industry, and I'm confident we're even stronger company after the recent challenges. Not many companies are going to come out of this stronger, but I believe that we're one of them. 
As I think about the first half of this year, we've made real progress on several priorities that will position us for the future: maximizing our cash flow by adjusting our spend rate, production and cost structure; increasing the strength of our balance sheet; continuing to return capital to shareholders through our dividend; and managing the oil price volatility with capital discipline, while also preserving our operational capacity. 
The last several months have been more volatile than anything we've ever seen. Oil ended the quarter up 92%, the largest move in the quarter in 30 years. But what a ride. Oil prices dropped to negative $38 then rebounded to positive $40 as the U.S. and OPEC+ cut production. Against a volatile backdrop and historically weak price realizations, Concho delivered strong operational and financial performance in the second quarter. Our results reflect the strength of our portfolio and our team. We delivered strong cash flows and lower cost while we cut our activity.
Moving forward, we're maintaining the same level of focus that helped us navigate the first half of the year. In short, we'll continue to remain flexible. And as we look past 2020, we will be patient for sustained higher prices before increasing spending.
Today, there are 125 rigs running in the Permian. A year ago, there were 440 and frac spreads have declined even more dramatically. This reduction in activity is starting to show up as declining Permian production. In addition, fuel declines are setting in, capital continues to be scarce and we're seeing the effects of a shrinking industry. We believe the future of our industry requires better-capitalized companies, more capital discipline, less leverage and being more aware of market signals for growth. Before the pandemic, we outlined a clear vision for the evolution of our business, delivering both sustainable cash flow growth, production growth and increasing returns to shareholders. While there's more uncertainty than usual around the macroeconomic environment, this plan remains unchanged. And the principles that form our strategy, people, assets, returns and financial strength, will guide us along the way. 
Operating responsibly is key to the evolution of the business model as well. We believe that operating responsibly and delivering good financial performance are not mutually exclusive. Our flaring performance in 2020 is trending toward 1% of gross operated gas volumes as compared to 1.8% in 2019. In August, we'll publish our first sustainability report. We look forward to engaging with you on these important topics.
We continue to work through the pandemic and the impact that it's having on our communities and workforce. I want to acknowledge the hard work of our employees. They continue to perform well in a tough environment. This was a great quarter, and I'm proud of our performance. 
Before I turn the call over to Jack, I want to summarize a few things that I hope you will come away with. First, we're successfully managing this cycle without losing focus on the long-term value and operational capacity of the company. Also, we're improving our operational performance, which is lowering our cost structure. Next, we're continuing to reduce our net debt. And finally, we will be patient on the recovery, prioritizing free cash flow and reinforcing our machine. 
With that, let me turn it over to Jack."

Our results for the second quarter not only continue our trend of solid financial and operating performance, they also demonstrate that we are controlling what we can. And by doing so, we are well positioned to become a more profitable company. Last quarter, we outlined the steps that we're taking to align our business with the current environment. Those steps include reducing our capital program, improving our cost structure and reinforcing our balance sheet.
Regarding our capital program. CapEx in the second quarter totaled $312 million, 44% lower than the first quarter this year. The step down in the quarter reflects less overall activity as well as continued improvement in well costs. For the second time this year, we are reducing our well cost guidance due to better operational efficiencies and a lower service cost environment. We expect the cost to drill, complete and equip a well to average less than $800 per foot or more than 30% lower than the cost to do that work last year. 
With respect to our cost structure. Controllable costs, which includes lease operating, cash G&A and interest expense totaled $7.49 per unit, down 20% from 2019. We are managing all aspects of our cost structure. Examples include the logical items like well maintenance, workovers, water handling and optimizing artificial lift. We also made the difficult decision to implement a voluntary separation program. These combined efforts are expected to result in more than $135 million in reduced operating and G&A costs, up from our prior target of $100 million. Quickly adjusting our capital program and managing our costs lower, combined with our hedge position drove strong cash flow generation. Operating cash flow before working capital was $550 million, which resulted in $238 million of free cash flow, which brings me to reinforcing our balance sheet. 
Our cash position nearly doubled to $320 million, and at the end of the second quarter, our net debt was $3.6 billion, down from $4.3 billion a year ago, despite commodity price volatility. And although we have one of the better balance sheets in the industry, we plan to direct the $375 million to $450 million of free cash flow anticipated in the back half of the year to our balance sheet, making quick progress towards our goal to reduce net debt by another $600 million. 
Oil volumes for the second quarter averaged 200,000 barrels per day, and we remain on track with our full year guide of approximately 197,000 barrels per day and $1.6 billion in capital spending. We've built a leading position in one of the best resource basins in the world. Our portfolio quality, depth and durability are nearly unmatched. Importantly, we have a good mix of investment opportunities across federal state and private lands. This mix allows us to redirect capital without degrading the returns or the capital efficiency of our drilling program. And as Tim discussed, we are working to minimize our emissions as well. I'm confident that our operating principles and performance regardless of the environment we're in. Without question, this has been a challenging year thus far, testing every company. To meet the challenge, we're maintaining our approach to capital discipline and prioritizing free cash flow. I believe that our second quarter results show that the steps we are taking are enabling us to build a better company, driven by more efficient capital investment and cost control.
With that, let me turn the call over to the operator for Q&A."

First off, mid-90s on oil in the back half of the year, only positively impacts that annual number by about 1%. And additionally, exit-to-exit rate basis, we see our production holding up well and better than most. And secondly, we described in the last quarter, our focus on free cash flow generation.

I also mentioned that I thought our industry as a whole needed to be more aware of price signals and what was going on in the market. So as we entered this cycle, no one really thought that U.S. shales could grow as much as they did, add as much production, and that threw everything out of balance at a really bad time.

And then one of the kind of longer term, but it's still a very important goal is to increase our percentage of recycled water use. And our opinion is that you're going to need to have big third-party infrastructure to handle big bonds of water and move it around the basin where it's needed as opposed to the older model where individual companies kind of built it themselves and utilized it at pretty low rates. And so those are kind of the drivers for it. I think an important also piece of it is that the existing equity owners agreed to increase their capital commitment to the entity. So I think it sits in a very good position and helps take the burden off of us from a capital standpoint."

As to your kind of broader question on drill completing the equip costs and where they go in the future, the number we're talking about is a annual program-wide number. It's not aspirational. It's kind of the whole program, short laterals, long laterals, et cetera.

The second quarter tested the strength of the industry, and I'm confident we're even stronger company after the recent challenges.

The second quarter tested the strength of the industry, and I'm confident we're even stronger company after the recent challenges. Not many companies are going to come out of this stronger, but I believe that we're one of them. 
As I think about the first half of this year, we've made real progress on several priorities that will position us for the future: maximizing our cash flow by adjusting our spend rate, production and cost structure; increasing the strength of our balance sheet; continuing to return capital to shareholders through our dividend; and managing the oil price volatility with capital discipline, while also preserving our operational capacity. 
The last several months have been more volatile than anything we've ever seen. Oil ended the quarter up 92%, the largest move in the quarter in 30 years. But what a ride. Oil prices dropped to negative $38 then rebounded to positive $40 as the U.S. and OPEC+ cut production. Against a volatile backdrop and historically weak price realizations, Concho delivered strong operational and financial performance in the second quarter. Our results reflect the strength of our portfolio and our team. We delivered strong cash flows and lower cost while we cut our activity.
Moving forward, we're maintaining the same level of focus that helped us navigate the first half of the year. In short, we'll continue to remain flexible. And as we look past 2020, we will be patient for sustained higher prices before increasing spending.
Today, there are 125 rigs running in the Permian. A year ago, there were 440 and frac spreads have declined even more dramatically. This reduction in activity is starting to show up as declining Permian production. In addition, fuel declines are setting in, capital continues to be scarce and we're seeing the effects of a shrinking industry. We believe the future of our industry requires better-capitalized companies, more capital discipline, less leverage and being more aware of market signals for growth. Before the pandemic, we outlined a clear vision for the evolution of our business, delivering both sustainable cash flow growth, production growth and increasing returns to shareholders. While there's more uncertainty than usual around the macroeconomic environment, this plan remains unchanged. And the principles that form our strategy, people, assets, returns and financial strength, will guide us along the way. 
Operating responsibly is key to the evolution of the business model as well. We believe that operating responsibly and delivering good financial performance are not mutually exclusive. Our flaring performance in 2020 is trending toward 1% of gross operated gas volumes as compared to 1.8% in 2019. In August, we'll publish our first sustainability report. We look forward to engaging with you on these important topics.
We continue to work through the pandemic and the impact that it's having on our communities and workforce. I want to acknowledge the hard work of our employees. They continue to perform well in a tough environment. This was a great quarter, and I'm proud of our performance. 
Before I turn the call over to Jack, I want to summarize a few things that I hope you will come away with. First, we're successfully managing this cycle without losing focus on the long-term value and operational capacity of the company. Also, we're improving our operational performance, which is lowering our cost structure. Next, we're continuing to reduce our net debt. And finally, we will be patient on the recovery, prioritizing free cash flow and reinforcing our machine. 
With that, let me turn it over to Jack."

Our results for the second quarter not only continue our trend of solid financial and operating performance, they also demonstrate that we are controlling what we can. And by doing so, we are well positioned to become a more profitable company. Last quarter, we outlined the steps that we're taking to align our business with the current environment. Those steps include reducing our capital program, improving our cost structure and reinforcing our balance sheet.
Regarding our capital program. CapEx in the second quarter totaled $312 million, 44% lower than the first quarter this year. The step down in the quarter reflects less overall activity as well as continued improvement in well costs. For the second time this year, we are reducing our well cost guidance due to better operational efficiencies and a lower service cost environment. We expect the cost to drill, complete and equip a well to average less than $800 per foot or more than 30% lower than the cost to do that work last year. 
With respect to our cost structure. Controllable costs, which includes lease operating, cash G&A and interest expense totaled $7.49 per unit, down 20% from 2019. We are managing all aspects of our cost structure. Examples include the logical items like well maintenance, workovers, water handling and optimizing artificial lift. We also made the difficult decision to implement a voluntary separation program. These combined efforts are expected to result in more than $135 million in reduced operating and G&A costs, up from our prior target of $100 million. Quickly adjusting our capital program and managing our costs lower, combined with our hedge position drove strong cash flow generation. Operating cash flow before working capital was $550 million, which resulted in $238 million of free cash flow, which brings me to reinforcing our balance sheet. 
Our cash position nearly doubled to $320 million, and at the end of the second quarter, our net debt was $3.6 billion, down from $4.3 billion a year ago, despite commodity price volatility. And although we have one of the better balance sheets in the industry, we plan to direct the $375 million to $450 million of free cash flow anticipated in the back half of the year to our balance sheet, making quick progress towards our goal to reduce net debt by another $600 million. 
Oil volumes for the second quarter averaged 200,000 barrels per day, and we remain on track with our full year guide of approximately 197,000 barrels per day and $1.6 billion in capital spending. We've built a leading position in one of the best resource basins in the world. Our portfolio quality, depth and durability are nearly unmatched. Importantly, we have a good mix of investment opportunities across federal state and private lands. This mix allows us to redirect capital without degrading the returns or the capital efficiency of our drilling program. And as Tim discussed, we are working to minimize our emissions as well. 
I'm confident that our operating principles and performance regardless of the environment we're in. Without question, this has been a challenging year thus far, testing every company. To meet the challenge, we're maintaining our approach to capital discipline and prioritizing free cash flow. I believe that our second quarter results show that the steps we are taking are enabling us to build a better company, driven by more efficient capital investment and cost control.
With that, let me turn the call over to the operator for Q&A."

First off, mid-90s on oil in the back half of the year, only positively impacts that annual number by about 1%. And additionally, exit-to-exit rate basis, we see our production holding up well and better than most. 
And secondly, we described in the last quarter, our focus on free cash flow generation. And our improved cost structure, along with a stable production base have us ahead of plan in that regard.

My question is this, if and when oil prices do recover, how do you think about a planning process going forward? I mean, obviously, some level of growth versus the broader market is probably desirable, just not 20%, 25%, 30% where the industry was. So how do you think about that reinvestment rate? Is there a cap on your spending? Is there a cap on your growth rate?

Well, that's not how it's going to work in the future. And so I think philosophically staying focused on the efficiency of the business, driving down cost, what does it cost to add a barrel of production, what are your returns, those types of things, I think it's probably going to be measured in percentages of your total cash flow that are reinvested into the business and reducing those percentages over time to be able to show continued growth. I also mentioned that I thought our industry as a whole needed to be more aware of price signals and what was going on in the market. 
So as we entered this cycle, no one really thought that U.S. shales could grow as much as they did, add as much production, and that threw everything out of balance at a really bad time. And so I think as consolidation takes place and the major producers get their shops in order, I think everybody is going to have to be more aware of supply and demand fundamentals in the world. And yes, I think what you're talking about is lower growth required bigger cash flow distributions, less percentage of your total cash flow reinvested into the business, more efficient machines."

I mean a lot of the commentary we gave around the transaction we did with them in Eddy County, a couple of quarters ago, would apply to this conversation around what we've done now with them, expanding into Lea County.

It will also help on the lease operating expense side and help us continue to drive down to the extent we're trucking any water. This will get -- should get all of our water on the pipe over time. 
And then one of the kind of longer term, but it's still a very important goal is to increase our percentage of recycled water use. And our opinion is that you're going to need to have big third-party infrastructure to handle big bonds of water and move it around the basin where it's needed as opposed to the older model where individual companies kind of built it themselves and utilized it at pretty low rates.

The second quarter tested the strength of the industry, and I'm confident we're even stronger company after the recent challenges. Not many companies are going to come out of this stronger, but I believe that we're one of them",591,"Thanks, Megan. Good morning. The second quarter tested the strength of the industry, and I'm confident we're even stronger company after the recent challenges. Not many companies are going to come out of this stronger, but I believe that we're one of them. 
As I think about the first half of this year, we've made real progress on several priorities that will position us for the future: maximizing our cash flow by adjusting our spend rate, production and cost structure; increasing the strength of our balance sheet; continuing to return capital to shareholders through our dividend; and managing the oil price volatility with capital discipline, while also preserving our operational capacity. 
The last several months have been more volatile than anything we've ever seen. Oil ended the quarter up 92%, the largest move in the quarter in 30 years. But what a ride. Oil prices dropped to negative $38 then rebounded to positive $40 as the U.S. and OPEC+ cut production. Against a volatile backdrop and historically weak price realizations, Concho delivered strong operational and financial performance in the second quarter. Our results reflect the strength of our portfolio and our team. We delivered strong cash flows and lower cost while we cut our activity.
Moving forward, we're maintaining the same level of focus that helped us navigate the first half of the year. In short, we'll continue to remain flexible. And as we look past 2020, we will be patient for sustained higher prices before increasing spending.
Today, there are 125 rigs running in the Permian. A year ago, there were 440 and frac spreads have declined even more dramatically. This reduction in activity is starting to show up as declining Permian production. In addition, fuel declines are setting in, capital continues to be scarce and we're seeing the effects of a shrinking industry. We believe the future of our industry requires better-capitalized companies, more capital discipline, less leverage and being more aware of market signals for growth. Before the pandemic, we outlined a clear vision for the evolution of our business, delivering both sustainable cash flow growth, production growth and increasing returns to shareholders. While there's more uncertainty than usual around the macroeconomic environment, this plan remains unchanged. And the principles that form our strategy, people, assets, returns and financial strength, will guide us along the way. 
Operating responsibly is key to the evolution of the business model as well. We believe that operating responsibly and delivering good financial performance are not mutually exclusive. Our flaring performance in 2020 is trending toward 1% of gross operated gas volumes as compared to 1.8% in 2019. In August, we'll publish our first sustainability report. We look forward to engaging with you on these important topics.
We continue to work through the pandemic and the impact that it's having on our communities and workforce. I want to acknowledge the hard work of our employees. They continue to perform well in a tough environment. This was a great quarter, and I'm proud of our performance. 
Before I turn the call over to Jack, I want to summarize a few things that I hope you will come away with. First, we're successfully managing this cycle without losing focus on the long-term value and operational capacity of the company. Also, we're improving our operational performance, which is lowering our cost structure. Next, we're continuing to reduce our net debt. And finally, we will be patient on the recovery, prioritizing free cash flow and reinforcing our machine. 
With that, let me turn it over to Jack."
26906,672798972,2091533,"Concho Resources Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2020",2020-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Concho Resources Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tim.

Our results for the second quarter not only continue our trend of solid financial and operating performance, they also demonstrate that we are controlling what we can. And by doing so, we are well positioned to become a more profitable company. Last quarter, we outlined the steps that we're taking to align our business with the current environment. Those steps include reducing our capital program, improving our cost structure and reinforcing our balance sheet.
Regarding our capital program. CapEx in the second quarter totaled $312 million, 44% lower than the first quarter this year. The step down in the quarter reflects less overall activity as well as continued improvement in well costs. For the second time this year, we are reducing our well cost guidance due to better operational efficiencies and a lower service cost environment. We expect the cost to drill, complete and equip a well to average less than $800 per foot or more than 30% lower than the cost to do that work last year. 
With respect to our cost structure. Controllable costs, which includes lease operating, cash G&A and interest expense totaled $7.49 per unit, down 20% from 2019. We are managing all aspects of our cost structure. Examples include the logical items like well maintenance, workovers, water handling and optimizing artificial lift. We also made the difficult decision to implement a voluntary separation program. These combined efforts are expected to result in more than $135 million in reduced operating and G&A costs, up from our prior target of $100 million. Quickly adjusting our capital program and managing our costs lower, combined with our hedge position drove strong cash flow generation. Operating cash flow before working capital was $550 million, which resulted in $238 million of free cash flow, which brings me to reinforcing our balance sheet. 
Our cash position nearly doubled to $320 million, and at the end of the second quarter, our net debt was $3.6 billion, down from $4.3 billion a year ago, despite commodity price volatility. And although we have one of the better balance sheets in the industry, we plan to direct the $375 million to $450 million of free cash flow anticipated in the back half of the year to our balance sheet, making quick progress towards our goal to reduce net debt by another $600 million. 
Oil volumes for the second quarter averaged 200,000 barrels per day, and we remain on track with our full year guide of approximately 197,000 barrels per day and $1.6 billion in capital spending. We've built a leading position in one of the best resource basins in the world. Our portfolio quality, depth and durability are nearly unmatched. Importantly, we have a good mix of investment opportunities across federal state and private lands. This mix allows us to redirect capital without degrading the returns or the capital efficiency of our drilling program. And as Tim discussed, we are working to minimize our emissions as well. 
I'm confident that our operating principles and performance regardless of the environment we're in. Without question, this has been a challenging year thus far, testing every company. To meet the challenge, we're maintaining our approach to capital discipline and prioritizing free cash flow. I believe that our second quarter results show that the steps we are taking are enabling us to build a better company, driven by more efficient capital investment and cost control.
With that, let me turn the call over to the operator for Q&A."

If anything, since our last call and our last conversation, my confidence has increased in our business. And as for the second half oil production, I do still expect for it to stabilize in that 190 to 200 a day range. But we left our annual guidance unchanged for a couple of reasons. First off, mid-90s on oil in the back half of the year, only positively impacts that annual number by about 1%. And additionally, exit-to-exit rate basis, we see our production holding up well and better than most. 
And secondly, we described in the last quarter, our focus on free cash flow generation. And our improved cost structure, along with a stable production base have us ahead of plan in that regard.

First, our activity in the second half has a little bit more activity on higher working interest properties, including 5 rigs that are currently on the Mabee Ranch, where we've got 100% working interest.

My question is this, if and when oil prices do recover, how do you think about a planning process going forward? I mean, obviously, some level of growth versus the broader market is probably desirable, just not 20%, 25%, 30% where the industry was. So how do you think about that reinvestment rate? Is there a cap on your spending? Is there a cap on your growth rate?

And so I think philosophically staying focused on the efficiency of the business, driving down cost, what does it cost to add a barrel of production, what are your returns, those types of things, I think it's probably going to be measured in percentages of your total cash flow that are reinvested into the business and reducing those percentages over time to be able to show continued growth. I also mentioned that I thought our industry as a whole needed to be more aware of price signals and what was going on in the market. 
So as we entered this cycle, no one really thought that U.S. shales could grow as much as they did, add as much production, and that threw everything out of balance at a really bad time. And so I think as consolidation takes place and the major producers get their shops in order, I think everybody is going to have to be more aware of supply and demand fundamentals in the world. And yes, I think what you're talking about is lower growth required bigger cash flow distributions, less percentage of your total cash flow reinvested into the business, more efficient machines."

It will also help on the lease operating expense side and help us continue to drive down to the extent we're trucking any water. This will get -- should get all of our water on the pipe over time. 
And then one of the kind of longer term, but it's still a very important goal is to increase our percentage of recycled water use. And our opinion is that you're going to need to have big third-party infrastructure to handle big bonds of water and move it around the basin where it's needed as opposed to the older model where individual companies kind of built it themselves and utilized it at pretty low rates.

And so we won't be waiting for any particular price to add hedges. We will continue quarterly to look at that and kind of plan around what the future looks like. But I think, as Tim and really all of us have alluded to here on the reinvestment, it's -- we need to be more mindful of all the things going on in the world and the signals that we're getting. And right now, adding a lot of production and activity doesn't seem to be the signal."

I think you've deferred some workovers and maintenance activity. How should we think about LOE? I think your guidance for the rest of the year bakes that in, but how should we think about it long term? Is the $4.50-or-so number for LOE an achievable target in 2021? Or should we stick with somewhere between $5 to $5.50?"

We're at kind of $5.50 in the first quarter and we were around at the $4.50 in the second quarter. And if you try and look and see what drove that pretty dramatic improvement, it's a combination of things, including just kind of process improvement, some of these things we're doing around water, around power generation and getting off of generators and ESPs and other things we're doing on artificial lift. So those gains should be sustainable, and that's probably about half of the improvement. The other half, as you referenced, kind of came from an unnatural, basically stopping our workover program in conjunction with trying to manage through the curtailment period there in the second quarter, and so that piece is not sustainable. So I think kind of half of that gain is and half is not. If that helps you dial it in."

That has been a major focal point in our company here for a couple of years. And it really -- you got to give the operational team and especially the guys in the field a lot of credit for doing that. A big key is not having any flaring around new well hookups. And so there's been great coordination with our midstream partners making sure that we have the gas pipe there when you're ready to go on the production side. And also, frankly, in getting down to the numbers we're in, being unwilling to produce new oil unless you have that gas oil gathering. And so that has barrel impact from a production standpoint. And we, as an organization, have decided that, that's worth it to achieve the goals around flaring. The rest of it, what's left, is really around the typical plant upsets and things that happen in the field on a daily basis, and you definitely had a more benign operating environment here in the second quarter just as activity was coming off, typically."
