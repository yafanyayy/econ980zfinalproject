Let me start by saying that we have a lot of grant cover on today's call, which reflects the exciting progress we are making on our investment program, our financial targets, and on our ESG efforts, including the introduction of an enterprise-wide net 0 emission initiative. Over the last several years, Dominion Energy has transitioned into a larger, more regulated and more predictable company. And this is reflected in our ability to extend our track record of delivering financial performance consistent with our guidance. I'm pleased to report on Slide 3, that the fourth quarter of 2019 was the 16th consecutive quarter of achieving operating earnings per share that adjusted for normal weather, met or exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range.  Quarterly operating earnings were $1.18 per share, which includes a benefit from better-than-normal weather of less than $0.01. Even without adjusting for weather, this was still the 16th consecutive quarter of results that align with our guidance range. 2019 full year operating earnings of $4.24 also exceeded the midpoint of our annual guidance range of $4.15 to $4.30 per share. When adjusted for about $0.02 of help relative to normal weather, these operating earnings for the year met the midpoint of our annual guidance range and represent a 5.5% increase over 2018 weather-normalized operating EPS. GAAP earnings for the quarter and for the year were $1.32 and $1.73 per share, respectively. Recall that full year reported results were materially impacted during the first 2 quarters of the year by charges associated with the SCANA merger, including a substantial customer refund as approved by the South Carolina Public Service Commission. Adjusted for these merger and integration-related costs, our trailing 3-year aggregate GAAP earnings are actually higher than our total operating earnings over the same period. A summary of adjustments between operating and reported results are included in the appendix with a detailed reconciliation available on Schedule 2 of the earnings release kit. 
Turning now to Slide 4. As usual, our operating earnings guidance ranges assume normal weather, variations from which could cause results to be toward the top or the bottom of these ranges. We are initiating 2020 operating earnings guidance with a range of $4.25 to $4.60 per share. The midpoint of this range represents a 5% increase over our weather-normalized 2019 results, which aligns with the guidance we provided at our Investor Day last March. Select drivers in 2020 as compared to 2019 include increased earnings from regulated investment growth across our electric and gas businesses, lower interest expense due to lower average debt balances and a lower rate environment. The full year impact of the Millstone 0 carbon contract and lower depreciation expense associated with an anticipated extension of the useful life assumption for our regulated nuclear plants in Virginia.
Negative drivers include increased minority interest expense associated with the equity recapitalization of Cove point, share dilution, lower New England capacity prices and a double outage year at Millstone. Note that the double outage year occurs every third year and will, therefore, be a positive driver in 2021. We are introducing first quarter consolidated operating earnings guidance of $1.05 to $1.25 per share. We are also affirming our post-2020 guidance of 5-plus percent annual operating EPS growth as well as our dividend per share growth rate of 2.5% per annum subject as is customary to board approval. We have successfully changed the way we manage and report our businesses as shown on Slide 5, to better reflect the larger and more regulated nature of our operations. We expect that these realigned segments will also make it easier to model and analyze our company. 
On Slide 6, we provide annual operating income guidance at the new segment level. Let me take a moment and highlight a few points. First, except for contracted generation, which I'll explain in a minute, each of our segments exhibit strong operating earnings growth trends, driven primarily by regulated investment and general cost discipline. Contracted generation earnings trend is negatively impacted by the sale of Manchester and Fairless at the end of 2018, and by the double outage year at Millstone in 2020. As I mentioned previously, the double outage driver will reverse for 2021. Second, we've adjusted the CAGR of the Gas distribution segment to exclude the impact of the addition of PS&C in 2019 to demonstrate the very strong core growth rate at the segment absent merger activity. Third, we are not showing a 2018 to 2020 CAGR for Dominion Energy South Carolina as the merger with SCANA did not conclude until 2019. Growth in 2020 is primarily driven by merger cost savings, which we expect to accrue to the benefit of our customers in South Carolina as part of our upcoming electric rate case. In other words, this growth is good for both customers and shareholders. Finally, these segment level operating income CAGR, of course, don't reflect equity issuance at the parent over the period shown, including shares issued in exchange for SCANA stock early last year in which active produced a consolidated EPS growth rate that is slightly below the segment level growth numbers shown here. 
On Slide 7, we show expected 2020 operating EPS contribution by segment. This page underscores 2 of the key investment themes we have emphasized. First, that the strategic progression of our company has resulted in having approximately 95% of our operating earnings derived from regulated and regulated like operations; and second, that around 70% of our operating earnings come from state-regulated utility operations centered around 5 highly attractive states, including Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Ohio and Utah. Going forward, we plan to provide this segment level operating guidance annually. We have also simplified or added to our existing disclosures, including with regards to weather impacts, customer growth, rate base estimates, Millstone hedging fixed income and other topics. We hope you find these changes, which are included in our earnings release kit and in the appendix of today's presentation, helpful. 
Turning to Slide 8. We've summarized our current capital structure. We now have distinct and aligned financing entities related to our Dominion Energy Virginia, Dominion Energy South Carolina and gas transmission and storage operating segments. These financing vehicles are in addition to our parent level entity, SEC registrants, and therefore, we'll continue to file 10-Ks and 10-Qs. For the gas distribution and the contracted generation segments, we show here the aggregate of existing financing balances across the individual opco entities, which primarily due to their smaller size are financed in the private market. 
Let me now address credit more generally. I frequently remind our investors that we manage our balance sheet to a target credit rating range and not just to one of the specific credit metrics. Also that the cash coverage metrics, such as FFO, our CFO preworking capital to debt represent only a small weighting within the overall rating methodologies employed by our credit rating agencies. 
Nonetheless, on Slide 9, we illustrate the meaningful improvement we have achieved in the cash coverage metric over the last 4 years and which we expect will continue to gradually improve over the next several years. We've included in the appendix additional detail on the calculation of this metric for 2019. On a related topic, strong performance of our retirement plan assets, combined with an earnings-neutral fourth quarter contribution more than offset a year-on-year reduction in discount rates, resulting in an increase in the overall funded balance of these plans by around 7 percentage points. This leads me to our 2020 CapEx and financing plan. Slide 10 provides our 2020 capital investment plan, which are broadly in line though a little higher in aggregate than forecast we provided at our Investor Day due to a handful of small positive revisions and timing deltas. 
And Slide 11 provides an overview of our 2020 external financing plan. A couple of things to highlight here. First, consistent with previous guidance, our common equity plans for the year include only around $300 million via our DRIP program. You may recall that we have previously forecast $300 million to $500 million of ATM issuance in 2020, but subsequently announced that we would use proceeds from the Cove point equity recapitalization to reduce or eliminate that issuance which is reflected here. Next, I'll point out that during 2020, we intend to issue up to $1.8 billion of privately placed fixed income securities at Dominion East Ohio, which as a result of the Dominion Energy Gas Holdings reorganization we completed last November, is currently levered only on an intercompany basis. We currently expect this issuance in mid-year, and we'll use proceeds to retire current level . Finally, as is the norm, this annual financing plan does not reflect in the opportunistic refinancing activities, which may arise during the year. For example, in 2019, we rebalanced the capital structure at Dominion Energy South Carolina via a series of bond repurchases. In the fourth quarter, we took advantage of an attractive financing environment to replace existing debt with an equity credit preferred security that priced at an all-time industry low. We will continue to monitor opportunities to similarly strengthen our balance sheet and an earnings supportive manner. 
Turning now to the Atlantic Coast pipeline, which Tom will address in greater detail in a moment. Since about a year ago, when we announced the last material increase in our estimated total capital cost for ACP. Discussions have been ongoing between the project owners and the anchor shipper customers regarding the equitable sharing of those increases within the contract tariff. Those negotiations have been productive, and we expect to formalize an agreement in the coming weeks. As part of those discussions, the major project customers have confirmed their willingness to take on higher project rates given the strategic importance of ACP as an alternative pipeline option to the region. As a reminder, these are 20-year take-or-pay agreement with regulated utility customers and no commodity exposure. This customer negotiation process -- progress allows us to provide guidance related to the project's economic contribution after entering commercial service. As shown on Slide 12, we expect the 2022 contribution to be between $0.20 and $0.25 per share, which includes supply header and assumes a full year of commercial and service. This estimate also reflects the transition from AFUDC to contract-based cash earnings potential. We expect this contribution to increase over time as we expand the project via compression and laterals. There is no change to our expected contribution this year of mid- to high-teen cents per share. In related news, we're announcing today that we have agreed to acquire certain modestly sized gas transmission and storage assets from Southern company, subject to HSR regulatory approval. The first is pivotal LNG, which liquefies and delivers LNG as fuel for transportation in the Southeast U.S., primarily from a new LNG production facility located in Jacksonville, Florida. Tom will discuss how this asset together with Cove Point, support the expansion of our LNG strategy to include maritime transportation. The second asset being acquired is Southern Company's 5% stake in the Atlantic Coast pipeline, which upon closing will bring the project ownership to 53% Dominion Energy and 47% Duke Energy. Note that the governance arrangements for the project company remains such that it will continue to be recognized on an unconsolidated equity method basis in Dominion's financial statements. Likewise, there is no change to Southern Company's status as one of the anchor customers for the project through its Virginia natural gas local distribution company. The near-term financial impact of the acquisition of these 2 assets is positive, but relatively small, and that increased ACP ownership is reflected in the earnings contribution estimates I provided previously. Total cash consideration for these acquisitions is around $175 million. 
Turning to Santee Cooper. Our interest remains limited to a management proposal arrangement designed to cooperatively improve operational efficiency from our nearly colocated utility footprint. Consistent with our previous messaging on this topic, by the potential financial impact of any such arrangement would not be a material near-term financial driver for Dominion, we are glad to participate if selected by the Department of Administration and the South Carolina General Assembly, especially if the collaborative approach, resulting in cost savings that can be passed on to our and Santee Cooper's customers in the state. We will provide updates as warranted as that process moves into the next phase. Finally, let me offer just a brief comment on the recent first quarter related to the PJM capacity market structure, commonly referred to as . We will continue to monitor that situation as it winds towards resolution. In the meantime, we do not see this as the material financial risk for our company given the even balance of supply and demand at Dominion Energy Virginia. Further, if we determine it to be in the best interest of our customers, we have the option to make a fixed resource requirement or FRR election. This would require a notification to PJM and what we'd also notify the Virginia State Corporation Commission and the North Carolina Utilities Commission. With that, let me conclude my remarks by reiterating the key investment themes that I spoke to on our last quarterly call. We are highly regulated -- we are highly regulated, with about 95% of our company's operating earnings derived from regulated and regulated-like operations. 70% of our earnings are from utility operations centered around 5 attractive states. Another 25% of our earnings are from FERC-regulated transmission and storage operations primarily serving utility customers under long-term capacity contract. During 2019, we grew our regulated rate base by approximately 6%. We continue to expect 5-year rate base CAGR of approximately 7%, consistent with our expectations at Investor Day. We are executing on our previously announced 5-year and $26 billion growth capital plan that will modernize, strengthen and improve the sustainability of the services we offer to our customers. And finally, this customer-focused approach also benefits our shareholders as demonstrated by our growing track record of meeting and affirming our financial guidance, including a 16th consecutive quarter of meeting or exceeding our guidance midpoint. I'll now turn the call over to Tom."
267105,650327854,1905214,"Dominion Energy, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2020",2020-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. First, a reminder that safety is our first core value. On Slide 14, we have recast our historic city results to incorporate our mergers with Questar and SCANA. As you can see, the overall trend reflects a continuous focus",3131,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. First, a reminder that safety is our first core value. On Slide 14, we have recast our historic city results to incorporate our mergers with Questar and SCANA. As you can see, the overall trend reflects a continuous focus on employee health and welfare. Pro forma for past mergers, our company-wide ocean recordable incident rate decreased in 2019 for an 11th time over the last 13 years. .
Turning now to our consistent national leadership as it relates to environmental, social and governance matters. Over the course of the last year, we have intensified our efforts to reduce emissions of all types. As shown on Slide 15, we have already reduced carbon emissions by around 50% since 2005, which is nearly twice as much as the most recently reported industry average. We have followed a similar path for methane emissions, which have fallen by around 25% since 2010, a significant reduction driven by industry-leading efforts. 
Further, as shown on the next slide. We have reduced coal-fired generation's contribution to company-wide electricity production by 80% from 52% in 2005 to 12% in 2019. And  we estimate that coal-fired generation today accounts for less than 8% of our total regulated investment base. 
Turning to Slide 17. I'm pleased to announce a new commitment to achieve net 0 emissions by 2050. The goal includes both carbon dioxide and methane emissions and incurs all of our businesses, including electricity generation and gas infrastructure. This represents a significant expansion from the company's previous greenhouse gas emission reduction goals, which included a commitment to cut methane emissions from our natural gas operations by 50% and between 2010 and 2030, and carbon emissions from our power generating facilities by 80% between 2005 and 2050. Reducing emissions as fast as possible and achieving net 0 emissions company-wide requires immediate and direct action. That is why the company continues to make meaningful steps to extend licenses for its 0 carbon nuclear generation fleet, promote customer energy efficiency programs, invest heavily in wind and solar power, reduce the amount of coal-fired generation on our system, enhanced gas infrastructure leak detection, systematically replace legacy gas distribution lines and harvest agricultural methane emissions to be repurposed as renewable natural gas. All of these initiatives are included in our capital investment plan guidance through 2023 and will extend well beyond that. 
Over the long term, achieving these goals will require supportive legislative and regulatory policies and broader investments across the economy. This includes support for the testing and deployment of technologies. Such as large-scale energy storage and carbon capture, which, though still early stage, have the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions significantly when deployed in conjunction with carbon-free generation. Hence, we will never lose sight of our fundamental responsibility to customers, provision of safe, reliable and affordable energy. We have issued a press release this morning that addresses the topic in additional detail. And you should expect to hear more about our plans, including an upcoming climate and corporate and social responsibility reports. Though certain approaches will undoubtedly evolve over the coming decades to reflect the most up-to-date assumptions. Our commitment to net 0 emissions will not change. I'm pleased to report that our work on reducing emissions and enhancing our ESG disclosures was recognized with a leadership rating by CDP, an influential nonprofit that monitors and measures environmental impact. These ratings put Dominion Energy in the upper echelon of not just U.S. utility companies. But all companies of all industries globally. 
In addition, Just Capital, an organization that promotes corporate responsibility in partnership with Forbes, has ranked Dominion among America's top 100 corporate citizens. It is, of course, nice to receive accolades like these, but we are not declaring victory. In addition to minimizing our own operational environmental footprint in line with the carbon and methane goals I just described, we are also embracing the notion of beyond Dominion Energy as it relates to our ability to transform the emissions profiles of our customers and energy end users, as shown on Slide 19, in the transportation sector, which accounts for 29% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. We are leading the way in the development of the largest electric school bus program in the nation. We are enhancing the resiliency and flexibility of our electric grid to enable the more rapid deployment of electric vehicle charging infrastructure has enabled in Virginia by the Grid Transformation and Security Act, and we are developing infrastructure that will make liquefied natural gas, compressed renewable natural gas and potentially hydrogen fuels more available and more affordable for use in transportation applications, including maritime shipping vessels. 
In the agricultural sector, which accounts for 9% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, we are partnering with the nation's largest hog and dairy producers to capture methane from farm operations. These partnerships have already committed $700 million of shared investment to capture methane emissions and use RNG to serve homes, businesses and vehicle fleets. These are large and ambitious, multi-decade plans that are consistent with the spirit of Dominion Energy and its nearly 20,000 employees. Many of these efforts are well underway, including our solar, offshore wind, nuclear relicensing and energy efficiency programs. Others are in more nascent stages, including our electric school bus, RNG and marine LNG programs. Over the coming months and years, you should expect to hear more on these strategies as we work diligently to reduce the emissions profiles of our company and our customer. I will address several of these now. 
Turning to Slide 20. Late last year, we announced plans to install over 2.6 gigawatts of wind generation capacity, approximately 27 miles off the coast of Virginia, a major milestone for a project we began developing in 2013. Since that announcement, we have achieved several additional milestones, including selecting Siemens Gamesa as our preferred turbine supplier, and entering into an agreement with 3 prominent trade unions to support the onshore electric interconnection work. We will begin ocean survey work in April, which will help to support the submission of the construction and operations plan at the end of this year. We expect to commence construction in 2024, upon timely completion of the BoM permitting process with full in service by the end of 2026. We will continue to work to refine the preliminary capital cost estimate of approximately $8 billion. The vast majority of which will occur in the 24 to 26 time frame as major components are fabricated and installed. Cost reductions as well as any tax benefits that we achieved will accrue directly to the benefit of our customers. Dominion Energy Virginia will be the sole equity owner of this regulated asset. We will seek recovery via Orion from the Virginia State Corporation Commission. While the existing GTSA provides a strong framework for regulated cost recovery for offshore wind investments, legislation, which was supported by the governor's office in recent legislative committee meetings, is working its way through the current Virginia general assembly session that if enacted, would provide additional regulatory clarity. Our related 12-megawatt pilot project will begin turbine installation in May and is expected to achieve commercial operation in late summer of this year. The lessons learned on this project will be invaluable to the successful completion of our full-scale deployment. The pilot is the first and only offshore wind project in Federal Waters, to have completed the BOM permitting process, which included a cumulative impact analysis. We expect to leverage the right-of-way and other work already performed under the pilot project to facilitate routing the export cable to shore and connecting to the onshore electric transmission system. Also in Virginia, our weather-normalized sales increased 1.4% year-over-year, driven primarily by increased data center and residential demand. We connected nearly 34,000 new accounts, about 10% more than last year, including 26 data centers, which set another annual record. Earlier this year, PJM revised upwards their peak load assumptions for our service territory to reflect, among other things, continued strong data center growth. PJM, Tom zone, summer peak load growth is now expected to be 1.2% per year over the next 10 years and 1% annually over the next 15. These rates are double the PJM system-wide growth rates and rank our zone as one of the fastest-growing regions among the 13 states that comprise PJM. 
Turning to Slide 21. Last month, the State Corporation Commission approved our U.S. forward solar CPCN application, the second such approval in the last 12 months. We expect subsequent rider approval in April. Overall, we have now achieved 57% of our commitment to Virginians to have 3,000 megawatts of solar in development or in operation by the end of 2021. To date, an inclusive of around $800 million of spending in 2019 alone. Dominion Energy's enterprise-wide total solar investment now stands at approximately $4 billion with an additional nearly $3 billion expected through 2023. We anticipate continued solar investment for years to come, which is why we expect to improve our current ranking fourth among the largest utility owners of solar in the country. Phase 2 of our grid modernization program is before the commission. Representing around $500 million of Capex, the request includes deployment of automated metering, a new customer 
[Audio Gap] 
well, withstanding climate related risks. We are optimistic that we will receive approval next month. Our other investment programs shown on Slide 22, such as electric transmission, nuclear relicensing, distribution, undergrounding, pump storage, renewable-enabling quick-start generation and rural broadband are tracking in line with our expectations. Virginia General Assembly has been in session for about 5 weeks and is scheduled to conclude in less than a month. There are 2 proposals currently pending that I believe weren't highlighting. One is related to offshore wind, which I previously addressed. The other relates to our nation leading initiative to replace diesel with electric school buses. We have already selected a vendor and work with local school districts in our service territory to allocate an initial delivery of 50 school buses by year-end. Pending legislation calls for replacing an additional 1,500 buses by 2025, representing an estimated Dominion capital investment of approximately $400 million which will be eligible for cost recovery subject to commission approval. Ultimately, we would place all 13,000 diesel school buses in our Virginia service territory. Not only will this effort dramatically improve the air quality for our students and their communities, it will provide valuable real-world experience with vehicle to grid battery technology as the first 1,500 buses, while idle represent up to 60 megawatts of effective battery storage. We are monitoring other active pieces of legislation, all of which we expect to represent a reasonable and balanced approach to statewide energy policy priorities. 
Turning now to South Carolina on Slide 23. We are pleased with the work done by our team members to provide for a smooth integration while maintaining their historically excellent levels of reliability and customer service. Around midyear, we plan to file an electric rate case as stipulated in the merger agreement. Our most recent earned return was around 7.5% and our current authorized return is 10.25%. The most significant driver of the under earnings is related to normal course, safety, customer growth and reliability utility investment over the last 8 years, that is not currently captured in rates. We believe the case will conclude by year-end with an outcome that appropriately balances the interest of customers and shareholders. Turning to gas distribution. Recently, we have begun to hear of investor concern that, at least in some states, municipal level ordinances could limit overall demand growth for natural gas utility service. While that may be true elsewhere, we simply do not see any evidence of slowing customer or investment growth in the states in which we operate cash utilities: Utah, Idaho, Wyoming, Ohio, West Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Compounded annual customer growth across this segment was 1.5% over the last 3 years and as high as 2.6% and in Utah and North Carolina, with no signs of abating anytime soon. For many of our customers, the alternative to natural gas for home heating is fuel oil or even wood, which have significantly higher carbon signatures. And in certain communities within reach of our system, a lack of energy infrastructure is constraining growth and impacting everyday quality of life. Further, we are an industry leader in minimizing the emissions footprint of natural gas utility operations, including through promoting energy efficiency, utilizing innovative technologies and increasing access for our customers to renewable natural gas. We also continue to invest hundreds of millions of dollars every year in modernizing our distribution infrastructure, which improves safety reduces emissions and is recoverable in the form of riders or trackers that will continue over the course of at least the next decade. Regulators continue to approve new investments like our on system peaking storage facility in Utah that will improve system reliability for decades to come. Our gas distribution segment is focused on being part of the solution to a sustainable future. Finally, let me now discuss our gas transmission and storage business. First, RNG. We are the largest agricultural waste-to-energy investor in the United States, with investments of $700 million across our partnerships over the next 10 years. These investments will grow as the offtake market matures. Through these efforts, we capture otherwise future of methane from livestock and converted to pipeline quality natural gas for use in homes, businesses and vehicle fleets. Every captured unit of methane is the equivalent of eliminating 25 units of carbon dioxide. Dominion is uniquely positioned to lead the industry in this effort, given the geography of our assets. At Investor Day last year, we identified marine LNG is one of the many innovative ideas we were working to advance. By way of background, crews and cargo vessels primarily consume diesel or fuel oil, each of which is a major contributor of greenhouse gas and other emissions. The maritime industry is taking steps encouraged by recent global regulation to reduce its emissions footprint, which is expected to result in a material shift to LNG. This expected growth in LNG as a fuel source, allows Dominion attractive opportunity to provide natural gas liquefaction and LNG distribution services to a growing list of maritime customers. As Jim mentioned, we are acquiring an interest in existing Florida-based operation that currently services marine vessels with an onshore liquefier coupled with marine fuel delivery infrastructure, customer contracts in this business are typically long term, take-or-pay with no commodity exposure. This initial acquisition will support a broader marine LNG strategy that would include Cove Point, where we're partnering with an existing export customer to redirect a portion of their liquefied natural gas inventory to provide LNG to constrained markets along the East Coast and to provide fuel for marine vessels under 0 commodity risk, take-or-pay contracts. Importantly, this arrangement does not and will not alter the existing 20-year take-or-pay, export contract revenues or terms. So modest initially, this market has the potential to support the significant decarbonization of the country's marine industry in addition to radically reducing pollution at our nation's ports. Overall, inclusive of the acquisition from Southern Company, we expect to deploy approximately $200 million on this strategy over the next 5 years. This is an innovative element of our long-term beyond Dominion Energy effort to help our customers, new and old, meet their emissions production targets. 
Turning now to an update on activities related to the Atlantic Coast pipeline, as shown on Slide 24. Two weeks from yesterday, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments related to the Appalachian Trail crossing aspect of our U.S. forest service permit. We remain optimistic that the court will issue an order reversing the 4 circuit in the May or June time frame. We continue to work with U.S. fish and Wildlife service on a reissued biological opinion and are pleased that FERC reinitiated formal consultation yesterday. We applaud the service for taking the time to consider thoroughly. The feedback provided by the court during the prior judicial proceedings. And we believe an updated biological opinion will be issued during the first half of this year. Upon receipt of the updated biological opinion, we intend to notify FERC and anticipate thereafter, the recommencement of construction across major portions of the pipeline. We're also pleased with the progress related to projects nationwide 12 permit. Which was issued by and subsequently voluntary remanded to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Last month, the core adopted repromulgated regulations that would allow for ACP to seek reissuance of the permit. As it relates to the Buckingham County Compressor station air permit, which was vacated late last year, I repeat my message from our last earnings call. We can deliver a very material amount of contracted volumes to customers on our existing schedule, even if permit resolution delays the in-service date of the project's third compression station. We are working on a number of solutions, which we expect will resolve the issue during the second half of this year. We believe that the options we are evaluating will satisfy the court's concerns. We centered on process, not the substance. Of the permit itself. Based on our expectation of the biological opinion being reissued during the first half of the year, we are confirming our project time line, the calls for construction completion by the end of next year and commissioning to be completed shortly thereafter. Project costs of approximately $8 billion are in line with the high end of the judicial option range we provided about a year ago. This estimate incorporates the various potential approaches to permitting issues and construction plans and timing, including as it relates to the Buckingham compressor station, which are being contemplated in the customer discussions that Jim described. Also have noted, we have agreed to acquire the 5% ownership in the project from Southern Company, further underscoring our confidence in the successful completion of the project. With that, I will summarize today's call as follows: our first value is safety, and we achieved another year of record safety performance. We introduced a net 0 emissions by 2050 target that accounts for carbon and methane emissions across both electric and gas operations. We achieved weather-normalized operating earnings that exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range for the 16th consecutive quarter.

We introduced 2020 earnings guidance that represents a 5% year-over-year increase consistent with previous messaging.

Let me start by saying that we have a lot of ground to cover on today's call, which reflects the exciting progress we are making on our investment program, our financial targets, and on our ESG efforts, including the introduction of an enterprise-wide net 0 emissions initiative. Over the last several years, Dominion Energy has transitioned into a larger, more regulated and more predictable company and this is reflected in our ability to extend our track record of delivering financial performance consistent with our guidance. I'm pleased to report on Slide 3, that the fourth quarter of 2019 was the 16th consecutive quarter of achieving operating earnings per share that, adjusted for normal weather, met or exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range. Quarterly operating earnings were $1.18 per share, which includes a benefit from better-than-normal weather of less than $0.01. Even without adjusting for weather, this was still the 16th consecutive quarter of results that align with our guidance range. 2019 full year operating earnings of $4.24 also exceeded the midpoint of our annual guidance range of $4.15 to $4.30 per share. When adjusted for about $0.02 of help relative to normal weather, these operating earnings for the year met the midpoint of our annual guidance range and represent a 5.5% increase over 2018 weather-normalized operating EPS. GAAP earnings for the quarter and for the year were $1.32 and $1.73 per share, respectively. Recall that full year reported results were materially impacted during the first 2 quarters of the year by charges associated with the SCANA merger, including a substantial customer refund as approved by the South Carolina Public Service Commission. Adjusted for these merger and integration-related costs, our trailing 3-year aggregate GAAP earnings are actually higher than our total operating earnings over the same period. A summary of adjustments between operating and reported results are included in the appendix with a detailed reconciliation available on Schedule 2 of the earnings release kit. 
Turning now to Slide 4. As usual, our operating earnings guidance ranges assume normal weather, variations from which could cause results to be toward the top or the bottom of these ranges. We are initiating 2020 operating earnings guidance with a range of $4.25 to $4.60 per share. The midpoint of this range represents a 5% increase over our weather-normalized 2019 results, which aligns with the guidance we provided at our Investor Day last March. Select drivers in 2020 as compared to 2019 include increased earnings from regulated investment growth across our electric and gas businesses, lower interest expense due to lower average debt balances and a lower rate environment, the full year impact of the Millstone 0 carbon contract and lower depreciation expense associated with an anticipated extension of the useful life assumption for our regulated nuclear plants in Virginia.
Negative drivers include increased minority interest expense associated with the equity recapitalization of Cove Point, share dilution, lower New England capacity prices and a double outage year at Millstone. Note that the double outage year -- the double outage occurs every third year and will, therefore, be a positive driver in 2021. We are introducing first quarter consolidated operating earnings guidance of $1.05 to $1.25 per share. We are also affirming our post-2020 guidance of 5-plus percent annual operating EPS growth as well as our dividend per share growth rate of 2.5% per annum subject, as is customary, to board approval. We have successfully changed the way we manage and report our businesses as shown on Slide 5, to better reflect the larger and more regulated nature of our operations. We expect that these realigned segments will also make it easier to model and analyze our company. 
On Slide 6, we provide annual operating income guidance at the new segment level. Let me take a moment and highlight a few points. First, except for contracted generation, which I'll explain in a minute, each of our segments exhibit strong operating earnings growth trends, driven primarily by regulated investment and general cost discipline. Contracted generations earnings trend is negatively impacted by the sale of Manchester and Fairless at the end of 2018, and by the double outage year at Millstone in 2020. As I mentioned previously, the double outage driver will reverse for 2021. Second, we've adjusted the CAGR of the Gas Distribution segment to exclude the impact of the addition of PSNC in 2019 to demonstrate the very strong core growth rate at the segment absent merger activity. Third, we are not showing a 2018 to 2020 CAGR for Dominion Energy South Carolina as the merger with SCANA did not conclude until 2019. Growth in 2020 is primarily driven by merger cost savings, which we expect to accrue to the benefit of our customers in South Carolina as part of our upcoming electric rate case. In other words, this growth is good for both customers and shareholders. Finally, these segment level operating income CAGRs, of course, don't reflect equity issuance at the parent over the period shown, including shares issued in exchange for SCANA stock early last year, and which act to produce a consolidated EPS growth rate that is slightly below the segment level growth numbers shown here. 
On Slide 7, we show expected 2020 operating EPS contribution by segment. This page underscores 2 of the key investment themes we have emphasized. First, that the strategic progression of our company has resulted in having approximately 95% of our operating earnings derived from regulated and regulated-like operations; and second, that around 70% of our operating earnings come from state-regulated utility operations centered around 5 highly attractive states, including Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Ohio and Utah. Going forward, we plan to provide this segment level operating guidance annually. We have also simplified or added to our existing disclosures, including with regards to weather impacts, customer growth, rate base estimates, Millstone hedging, fixed income and other topics. We hope you find these changes, which are included in our earnings release kit and in the appendix of today's presentation, helpful. 
Turning to Slide 8. We've summarized our current capital structure. We now have distinct and aligned financing entities related to our Dominion Energy Virginia, Dominion Energy South Carolina and gas transmission and storage operating segments. These financing vehicles are, in addition to our parent level entity, SEC registrants, and therefore, will continue to file 10-Ks and 10-Qs. For the Gas Distribution and the Contracted Generation segments, we show here the aggregate of existing financing balances across the individual opco entities, which, primarily due to their smaller size, are financed in the private market. 
Let me now address credit more generally. I frequently remind our investors that we manage our balance sheet to a target credit rating range and not just to one of the specific credit metrics. Also that the cash coverage metrics, such as FFO or CFO pre-working capital to debt represent only a small weighting within the overall rating methodologies employed by our credit rating agencies. 
Nonetheless, on Slide 9, we illustrate the meaningful improvement we have achieved in the cash coverage metric over the last 4 years and which we expect will continue to gradually improve over the next several years. We've included in the appendix additional detail on the calculation of this metric for 2019. On a related topic, strong performance of our retirement plan assets, combined with an earnings-neutral fourth quarter contribution more than offset a year-on-year reduction in discount rates, resulting in an increase in the overall funded balance of these plans by around 7 percentage points. This leads me to our 2020 CapEx and financing plan. Slide 10 provides our 2020 capital investment plan, which are broadly in line though a little higher in aggregate than the forecast we provided at our Investor Day due to a handful of small positive revisions and timing deltas. 
And Slide 11 provides an overview of our 2020 external financing plan. A couple of things to highlight here. First, consistent with previous guidance, our common equity plans for the year include only around $300 million via our DRIP program. You may recall that we have previously forecast $300 million to $500 million of ATM issuance in 2020, but subsequently announced that we would use proceeds from the Cove Point equity recapitalization to reduce or eliminate that issuance which is reflected here. Next, I'll point out that during 2020, we intend to issue up to $1.8 billion of privately placed fixed income securities at Dominion East Ohio, which as a result of the Dominion Energy Gas Holdings reorganization we completed last November, is currently levered only on an intercompany basis. We currently expect this issuance in the mid-year, and we'll use proceeds to retire current level debt. Finally, as is the norm, this annual financing plan does not reflect any opportunistic refinancing activities, which may arise during the year. For example, in 2019, we rebalanced the capital structure at Dominion Energy South Carolina via a series of bond repurchases. In this fourth quarter, we took advantage of an attractive financing environment to replace existing debt with an equity credit preferred security that's priced at an all-time industry low. We will continue to monitor opportunities to similarly strengthen our balance sheet in an earnings supportive manner. 
Turning now to the Atlantic Coast pipeline, which Tom will address in greater detail in a moment. Since about a year ago, when we announced the last material increase in our estimated total capital cost for ACP, discussions have been ongoing between the project owners and the anchor shipper customers regarding the equitable sharing of those increases within the contract tariff. Those negotiations have been productive, and we expect to formalize an agreement in the coming weeks. As part of those discussions, the major project customers have confirmed their willingness to take on higher project rates given the strategic importance of ACP as an alternative pipeline option to the region. As a reminder, these are 20-year take-or-pay agreement with regulated utility customers and no commodity exposure. This customer negotiation process -- progress allows us to provide guidance related to the project's economic contribution after entering commercial service. As shown on Slide 12, we expect the 2022 contribution to be between $0.20 and $0.25 per share, which includes Supply Header and assumes a full year of commercial in-service. This estimate also reflects the transition from AFUDC to contract-based cash earnings potential. We expect this contribution to increase over time as we expand the project via compression and laterals. There is no change to our expected contribution this year of mid- to high-teen cents per share. In related news, we're announcing today that we have agreed to acquire certain modestly sized gas transmission and storage assets from Southern company, subject to HSR regulatory approval. The first is pivotal LNG, which liquefies and delivers LNG as fuel for transportation in the Southeast U.S., primarily from a new LNG production facility located in Jacksonville, Florida. Tom will discuss how this asset together with Cove Point, support the expansion of our LNG strategy to include maritime transportation. The second asset being acquired is Southern Company's 5% stake in the Atlantic Coast pipeline, which upon closing will bring the project ownership to 53% Dominion Energy and 47% Duke Energy. Note that the governance arrangements for the project company remains such that it will continue to be recognized on an unconsolidated equity method basis in Dominion's financial statements. Likewise, there is no change to Southern Company's status as one of the anchor customers for the project through its Virginia natural gas local distribution company. The near-term financial impact of the acquisition of these 2 assets is positive, but relatively small, and that increased ACP ownership is reflected in the earnings contribution estimates I provided previously. Total cash consideration for these acquisitions is around $175 million. 
Turning to Santee Cooper. Our interest remains limited to a management proposal arrangement designed to cooperatively improve operational efficiency from our nearly colocated utility footprint. Consistent with our previous messaging on this topic, while the potential financial impact of any such arrangement would not be a material near-term financial driver for Dominion, we are glad to participate if selected by the Department of Administration and the South Carolina General Assembly, especially if the collaborative approach results in cost savings that can be passed on to our and Santee Cooper's customers in the state. We will provide updates as warranted as that process moves into the next phase. Finally, let me offer just a brief comment on the recent third quarter related to the PJM capacity market structure, commonly referred to as MOPR-Ex. We will continue to monitor that situation as it winds towards resolution. In the meantime, we do not see this as the material financial risk for our company given the even balance of supply and demand at Dominion Energy Virginia. Further, if we determine it to be in the best interest of our customers, we have the option to make a fixed resource requirement or FRR election. This would require a notification to PJM and where we'd also notify the Virginia State Corporation Commission and the North Carolina Utilities Commission. With that, let me conclude my remarks by reiterating the key investment themes that I spoke to on our last quarterly call. We are highly regulated -- we are highly regulated, with about 95% of our company's operating earnings derived from regulated and regulated-like operations. 70% of our earnings are from utility operations centered around 5 attractive states. Another 25% of our earnings are from FERC-regulated transmission and storage operations primarily serving utility customers under long-term capacity contracts. During 2019, we grew our regulated rate base by approximately 6%. We continue to expect 5-year rate base CAGR of approximately 7%, consistent with our expectations at Investor Day. We are executing on our previously announced 5-year and $26 billion growth capital plan that will modernize, strengthen and improve the sustainability of the services we offer to our customers. And finally, this customer-focused approach also benefits our shareholders as demonstrated by our growing track record of meeting and affirming our financial guidance, including a 16th consecutive quarter of meeting or exceeding our guidance midpoint. I'll now turn the call over to Tom."

On Slide 14, we have recast our historic safety results to incorporate our mergers with Questar and SCANA. As you can see, the overall trend reflects a continuous focus on employee health and welfare. Pro forma for past mergers, our company-wide OSHA recordable incident rate decreased in 2019 for an 11th time over the last 13 years. .
Turning now to our consistent national leadership as it relates to environmental, social and governance matters. Over the course of the last year, we have intensified our efforts to reduce emissions of all types. As shown on Slide 15, we have already reduced carbon emissions by around 50% since 2005, which is nearly twice as much as the most recently reported industry average. We have followed a similar path for methane emissions, which have fallen by around 25% since 2010, a significant reduction driven by industry-leading efforts. 
Further, as shown on the next slide. We have reduced coal-fired generation's contribution to company-wide electricity production by 80% from 52% in 2005 to 12% in 2019. And we estimate that coal-fired generation today accounts for less than 8% of our total regulated investment base. 
Turning to Slide 17. I'm pleased to announce a new commitment to achieve net 0 emissions by 2050. The goal includes both carbon dioxide and methane emissions and encompasses all of our businesses, including electricity generation and gas infrastructure. This represents a significant expansion from the company's previous greenhouse gas emission reduction goals, which included a commitment to cut methane emissions from our natural gas operations by 50% between 2010 and 2030, and carbon emissions from our power generating facilities by 80% between 2005 and 2050. Reducing emissions as fast as possible and achieving net 0 emissions company-wide requires immediate and direct action. That is why the company continues to make meaningful steps to extend licenses for its 0 carbon nuclear generation fleet, promote customer energy efficiency programs, invest heavily in wind and solar power, reduce the amount of coal-fired generation on our system, enhance gas infrastructure leak detection, systematically replace legacy gas distribution lines and harvest agricultural methane emissions to be repurposed as renewable natural gas. All of these initiatives are included in our capital investment plan guidance through 2023 and will extend well beyond that. 
Over the long term, achieving these goals will require supportive legislative and regulatory policies and broader investments across the economy. This includes support for the testing and deployment of technologies, such as large-scale energy storage and carbon capture, which though still early stage, have the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions significantly when deployed in conjunction with carbon-free generation. And we will never lose sight of our fundamental responsibility to customers: Provision of safe, reliable and affordable energy. We have issued a press release this morning that addresses the topic in additional detail. And you should expect to hear more about our plans, including an upcoming climate and corporate and social responsibility reports. Though certain approaches will undoubtedly evolve over the coming decades to reflect the most up-to-date assumptions, our commitment to net 0 emissions will not change. I'm pleased to report that our work on reducing emissions and enhancing our ESG disclosures was recognized with a leadership rating by CDP, an influential nonprofit that monitors and measures environmental impact. These ratings put Dominion Energy in the upper echelon of not just U.S. utility companies. But all companies of all industries globally. 
In addition, Just Capital, an organization that promotes corporate responsibility in partnership with Forbes, has ranked Dominion among America's top 100 corporate citizens. It is, of course, nice to receive accolades like these, but we are not declaring victory. In addition to minimizing our own operational environmental footprint in line with the carbon and methane goals I just described, we are also embracing the notion of Beyond Dominion Energy as it relates to our ability to transform the emissions profiles of our customers and energy end users, as shown on Slide 19, in the transportation sector, which accounts for 29% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. We are leading the way in the development of the largest electric school bus program in the nation. We are enhancing the resiliency and flexibility of our electric grid to enable the more rapid deployment of electric vehicle charging infrastructure as enabled in Virginia by the Grid Transformation and Security Act, and we are developing infrastructure that will make liquefied natural gas, compressed renewable natural gas and potentially hydrogen fuels more available and more affordable for use in transportation applications, including maritime shipping vessels. 
In the agricultural sector, which accounts for 9% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, we are partnering with the nation's largest hog and dairy producers to capture methane from farm operations. These partnerships have already committed $700 million of shared investment to capture methane emissions and use RNG to serve homes, businesses and vehicle fleets. These are large and ambitious, multi-decade plans that are consistent with the spirit of Dominion Energy and its nearly 20,000 employees. Many of these efforts are well underway, including our solar, offshore wind, nuclear relicensing and energy efficiency programs. Others are in more nascent stages, including our electric school bus, RNG and marine LNG programs. Over the coming months and years, you should expect to hear more on these strategies as we work diligently to reduce the emissions profiles of our company and our customer. I will address several of these now. 
Turning to Slide 20. Late last year, we announced plans to install over 2.6 gigawatts of wind generation capacity, approximately 27 miles off the coast of Virginia, a major milestone for a project we began developing in 2013. Since that announcement, we have achieved several additional milestones, including selecting Siemens Gamesa as our preferred turbine supplier, and entering into an agreement with 3 prominent trade unions to support the onshore electric interconnection work. We will begin ocean survey work in April, which will help to support the submission of the construction and operations plan at the end of this year. We expect to commence construction in 2024, upon timely completion of the BOEM permitting process with full in-service by the end of 2026. We will continue to work to refine the preliminary capital cost estimate of approximately $8 billion, the vast majority of which will occur in the '24 to '26 time frame as major components are fabricated and installed. Cost reductions as well as any tax benefits that we achieve will accrue directly to the benefit of our customers. Dominion Energy Virginia will be the sole equity owner of this regulated asset. We will seek recovery via Orion from the Virginia State Corporation Commission. While the existing GTSA provides a strong framework for regulated cost recovery for offshore wind investments, legislation, which was supported by the governor's office in recent legislative committee meetings, is working its way through the current Virginia general assembly session that if enacted, would provide additional regulatory clarity. Our related 12-megawatt pilot project will begin turbine installation in May and is expected to achieve commercial operation in late summer of this year. The lessons learned on this project will be invaluable to the successful completion of our full-scale deployment. The pilot is the first and only offshore wind project in Federal Waters, to have completed the BOM permitting process, which included a cumulative impact analysis. We expect to leverage the right-of-way and other work already performed under the pilot project to facilitate routing the export cable to shore and connecting it to the onshore electric transmission system. Also in Virginia, our weather-normalized sales increased 1.4% year-over-year, driven primarily by increased data center and residential demand. We connected nearly 34,000 new accounts, about 10% more than last year, including 26 data centers, which set another annual record. Earlier this year, PJM revised upwards their peak load assumptions for our service territory to reflect, among other things, continued strong data center growth. PJM, Dom Zone, summer peak load growth is now expected to be 1.2% per year over the next 10 years and 1% annually over the next 15. These rates are double the PJM system-wide growth rates and rank our zone as one of the fastest-growing regions among the 13 states that comprise PJM. 
Turning to Slide 21. Last month, the State Corporation Commission approved our U.S. forward solar CPCN application, the second such approval in the last 12 months. We expect subsequent rider approval in April. Overall, we have now achieved 57% of our commitment to Virginians to have 3,000 megawatts of solar in development or in operation by the end of 2021. To date, and inclusive of around $800 million of spending in 2019 alone, dominion Energy's enterprise-wide total solar investment now stands at approximately $4 billion with an additional nearly $3 billion expected through 2023. We anticipate continued solar investment for years to come, which is why we expect to improve our current ranking of fourth among the largest utility owners of solar in the country. Phase 2 of our grid modernization program is before the commission. Representing around $500 million of Capex, the request includes deployment of automated metering, a new customer information platform, and investments in grid resiliency and telecommunications that are essential to delivering the products and services that our customers desire and which provides for a system more capable of withstanding climate-related risks. We are optimistic that we will receive approval next month. Our other investment programs shown on Slide 22, such as electric transmission, nuclear relicensing, distribution undergrounding, pump storage, renewable-enabling quick-start generation and rural broadband are tracking in line with our expectations. Virginia General Assembly has been in session for about 5 weeks and is scheduled to conclude in less than a month. There are 2 proposals currently pending that I believe warrant highlighting. One is related to offshore wind, which I previously addressed. The other relates to our nation-leading initiative to replace diesel with electric school buses. We have already selected a vendor and worked with local school districts in our service territory to allocate an initial delivery of 50 school buses by year-end. Pending legislation calls for replacing an additional 1,500 buses by 2025, representing an estimated Dominion capital investment of approximately $400 million which will be eligible for cost recovery subject to commission approval. Ultimately, we would place all 13,000 diesel school buses in our Virginia service territory. Not only will this effort dramatically improve the air quality for our students and their communities, it will provide valuable real-world experience with vehicle to grid battery technology as the first 1,500 buses, while idle, represent up to 60 megawatts of effective battery storage. We are monitoring other active pieces of legislation, all of which we expect to represent a reasonable and balanced approach to statewide energy policy priorities. 
Turning now to South Carolina on Slide 23. We are pleased with the work done by our team members to provide for a smooth integration while maintaining their historically excellent levels of reliability and customer service. Around midyear, we plan to file an electric rate case as stipulated in the merger agreement. Our most recent earned return was around 7.5% and our current authorized return is 10.25%. The most significant driver of the under earnings is related to normal course, safety, customer growth and reliability utility investment over the last 8 years. This is not currently captured in rates. We believe the case will conclude by year-end with an outcome that appropriately balances the interest of customers and shareholders. Turning to Gas Distribution. Recently, we have begun to hear of investor concern that, at least in some states, municipal level ordinances could limit overall demand growth for natural gas utility service. While that may be true elsewhere, we simply do not see any evidence of slowing customer or investment growth in the states in which we operate gas utilities: Utah, Idaho, Wyoming, Ohio, West Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Compounded annual customer growth across this segment was 1.5% over the last 3 years and as high as 2.6% and in Utah and North Carolina, with no signs of abating anytime soon. For many of our customers, the alternative to natural gas for home heating is fuel oil or even wood, which have significantly higher carbon signatures. And in certain communities within reach of our system, a lack of energy infrastructure is constraining growth and impacting everyday quality of life. Further, we are an industry leader in minimizing the emissions footprint of natural gas utility operations, including through promoting energy efficiency, utilizing innovative technologies and increasing access for our customers to renewable natural gas. We also continue to invest hundreds of millions of dollars every year in modernizing our distribution infrastructure, which improves safety reduces emissions and is recoverable in the form of riders or trackers that will continue over the course of at least the next decade. Regulators continue to approve new investments like our on-system peaking storage facility in Utah that will improve system reliability for decades to come. Our gas distribution segment is focused on being part of the solution to a sustainable future. Finally, let me now discuss our gas transmission and storage business. First, RNG. We are the largest agricultural waste-to-energy investor in the United States, with investments of $700 million across our partnerships over the next 10 years. These investments will grow as the offtake market matures. Through these efforts, we capture otherwise fugitive methane from livestock and convert it to pipeline quality natural gas for use in homes, businesses and vehicle fleets. Every captured unit of methane is the equivalent of eliminating 25 units of carbon dioxide. Dominion is uniquely positioned to lead the industry in this effort, given the geography of our assets. At Investor Day last year, we identified marine LNG as one of the many innovative ideas we were working to advance. By way of background, crews and cargo vessels primarily consume diesel or fuel oil, each of which is a major contributor of greenhouse gas and other emissions. The maritime industry is taking steps encouraged by recent global regulation to reduce its emissions footprint, which is expected to result in a material shift to LNG. This expected growth in LNG as a fuel source, allows Dominion attractive opportunity to provide natural gas liquefaction and LNG distribution services to a growing list of maritime customers. As Jim mentioned, we are acquiring an interest in existing Florida-based operation that currently services marine vessels with an onshore liquefier coupled with marine fuel delivery infrastructure, customer contracts in this business are typically long term, take-or-pay with no commodity exposure. This initial acquisition will support a broader marine LNG strategy that would include Cove Point, where we're partnering with an existing export customer to redirect a portion of their liquefied natural gas inventory to provide LNG to constrained markets along the East Coast and to provide fuel for marine vessels under 0 commodity risk, take-or-pay contracts. Importantly, this arrangement does not and will not alter the existing 20-year take-or-pay, export contract revenues or terms. While modest initially, this market has the potential to support the significant decarbonization of the country's marine industry in addition to radically reducing pollution at our nation's ports. Overall, inclusive of the acquisition from Southern Company, we expect to deploy approximately $200 million on this strategy over the next 5 years. This is an innovative element of our long-term Beyond Dominion Energy effort to help our customers, new and old, meet their emissions reduction targets. 
Turning now to an update on activities related to the Atlantic Coast pipeline, as shown on Slide 24. Two weeks from yesterday, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments related to the Appalachian Trail crossing aspect of our U.S. Forest Service permit. We remain optimistic that the court will issue an order reversing the 4th Circuit in the May or June time frame. We continue to work with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service on a reissued biological opinion and are pleased that FERC reinitiated formal consultation yesterday. We applaud the service for taking the time to consider thoroughly the feedback provided by the court during the prior judicial proceedings and we believe an updated biological opinion will be issued during the first half of this year. Upon receipt of the updated biological opinion, we intend to notify FERC and anticipate thereafter, the recommencement of construction across major portions of the pipeline. We're also pleased with the progress related to projects' Nationwide 12 permit which was issued by and subsequently voluntarily remanded to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Last month, The Corps adopted, repromulgated regulations that would allow for ACP to seek reissuance of the permit. As it relates to the Buckingham County compressor station air permit, which was vacated late last year, I repeat my message from our last earnings call. We can deliver a very material amount of contracted volumes to customers on our existing schedule, even if permit resolution delays the in-service date of the project's third compression station. We are working on a number of solutions, which we expect will resolve the issue during the second half of this year. We believe that the options we are evaluating will satisfy the court's concerns. We started on process, not the substance, of the permit itself. Based on our expectation of the biological opinion being reissued during the first half of the year, we are confirming our project time line, the calls for construction completion by the end of next year and commissioning to be completed shortly thereafter. Project costs of approximately $8 billion are in line with the high end of the judicial option range we provided about a year ago. This estimate incorporates the various potential approaches to permitting issues and construction plans and timing, including, as relates to the Buckingham compressor station, which are being contemplated in the customer discussions that Jim described. Also as noted, we have agreed to acquire the 5% ownership in the project from Southern Company, further underscoring our confidence in the successful completion of the project. With that, I will summarize today's call as follows: our first value is safety, and we achieved another year of record safety performance. We introduced a net 0 emissions by 2050 target that accounts for carbon and methane emissions across both electric and gas operations. We achieved weather-normalized operating earnings that exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range for the 16th consecutive quarter. We further improved our credit metrics and successfully completed the restructuring of our operating segments. We introduced 2020 earnings guidance that represents a 5% year-over-year increase consistent with previous messaging. We confirmed our earnings per share growth expectations of 5-plus percent post-2020, and we are making significant progress across our capital investment programs to the benefit of our customers. We will now be happy to answer your questions."

Over the last several years, Dominion Energy has transitioned into a larger, more regulated and more predictable company and this is reflected in our ability to extend our track record of delivering financial performance consistent with our guidance. I'm pleased to report on Slide 3, that the fourth quarter of 2019 was the 16th consecutive quarter of achieving operating earnings per share that, adjusted for normal weather, met or exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range. Quarterly operating earnings were $1.18 per share, which includes a benefit from better-than-normal weather of less than $0.01. Even without adjusting for weather, this was still the 16th consecutive quarter of results that aligned with our guidance range. 2019 full year operating earnings of $4.24 also exceeded the midpoint of our annual guidance range of $4.15 to $4.30 per share. When adjusted for about $0.02 of help relative to normal weather, these operating earnings for the year met the midpoint of our annual guidance range and represent a 5.5% increase over 2018 weather-normalized operating EPS. 
GAAP earnings for the quarter and for the year were $1.32 and $1.73 per share, respectively. Recall that full year reported results were materially impacted during the first 2 quarters of the year by charges associated with the SCANA merger, including a substantial customer refund as approved by the South Carolina Public Service Commission. Adjusted for these merger and integration-related costs, our trailing 3-year aggregate GAAP earnings are actually higher than our total operating earnings over the same period. A summary of adjustments between operating and reported results are included in the appendix with a detailed reconciliation available on Schedule 2 of the earnings release kit. 
Turning now to Slide 4. As usual, our operating earnings guidance ranges assume normal weather, variations from which could cause results to be toward the top or the bottom of these ranges. We are initiating 2020 operating earnings guidance with a range of $4.25 to $4.60 per share. The midpoint of this range represents a 5% increase over our weather-normalized 2019 results, which aligns with the guidance we provided at our Investor Day last March. Select drivers in 2020 as compared to 2019 include increased earnings from regulated investment growth across our electric and gas businesses, lower interest expense due to lower average debt balances and a lower rate environment, the full year impact of the Millstone 0 carbon contract and lower depreciation expense associated with an anticipated extension of the useful life assumption for our regulated nuclear plants in Virginia.
Negative drivers include increased minority interest expense associated with the equity recapitalization of Cove Point, share dilution, lower New England capacity prices and a double outage year at Millstone. Note that the double outage year -- the double outage occurs every third year and will, therefore, be a positive driver in 2021. We are introducing first quarter consolidated operating earnings guidance of $1.05 to $1.25 per share. We are also affirming our post-2020 guidance of 5-plus percent annual operating EPS growth as well as our dividend per share growth rate of 2.5% per annum, subject, as is customary, to Board approval. We have successfully changed the way we manage and report our businesses, as shown on Slide 5, to better reflect the larger and more regulated nature of our operations. We expect that these realigned segments will also make it easier to model and analyze our company. 
On Slide 6, we provide annual operating income guidance at the new segment level. Let me take a moment and highlight a few points. First, except for Contracted Generation, which I'll explain in a minute, each of our segments exhibit strong operating earnings growth trends, driven primarily by regulated investment and general cost discipline. Contracted Generation's earnings trend is negatively impacted by the sale of Manchester and Fairless at the end of 2018 and by the double outage year at Millstone in 2020. As I mentioned previously, the double outage driver will reverse for 2021. Second, we've adjusted the CAGR of the Gas Distribution segment to exclude the impact of the addition of PSNC in 2019 to demonstrate the very strong core growth rate at the segment absent merger activity. Third, we are not showing a 2018 to 2020 CAGR for Dominion Energy South Carolina as the merger with SCANA did not conclude until 2019. Growth in 2020 is primarily driven by merger cost savings, which we expect to accrue to the benefit of our customers in South Carolina as part of our upcoming electric rate case. In other words, this growth is good for both customers and shareholders. 
Finally, these segment level operating income CAGRs, of course, don't reflect equity issuance at the parent over the period shown, including shares issued in exchange for SCANA stock early last year, and which act to produce a consolidated EPS growth rate that is slightly below the segment level growth numbers shown here. 
On Slide 7, we show expected 2020 operating EPS contribution by segment. This page underscores 2 of the key investment themes we have emphasized. First, that the strategic progression of our company has resulted in having approximately 95% of our operating earnings derived from regulated and regulated-like operations; and second, that around 70% of our operating earnings come from state-regulated utility operations centered around 5 highly attractive states, including Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Ohio and Utah. Going forward, we plan to provide this segment level operating guidance annually. We have also simplified or added to our existing disclosures, including with regards to weather impacts, customer growth, rate base estimates, Millstone hedging, fixed income and other topics. We hope you find these changes, which are included in our earnings release kit and in the appendix of today's presentation, helpful. 
Turning to Slide 8. We've summarized our current capital structure. We now have distinct and aligned financing entities related to our Dominion Energy Virginia, Dominion Energy South Carolina and Gas Transmission & Storage operating segments. These financing vehicles are, in addition to our parent level entity, SEC registrants, and therefore, will continue to file 10-Ks and 10-Qs. For the Gas Distribution and the Contracted Generation segments, we show here the aggregate of existing financing balances across the individual opco entities, which, primarily due to their smaller size, are financed in the private market. 
Let me now address credit more generally. I frequently remind our investors that we manage our balance sheet to a target credit rating range and not just to one of the specific credit metrics. Also that the cash coverage metrics, such as FFO or CFO pre-working capital to debt, represent only a small weighting within the overall rating methodologies employed by our credit rating agencies. 
Nonetheless, on Slide 9, we illustrate the meaningful improvement we have achieved in the cash coverage metric over the last 4 years and which we expect will continue to gradually improve over the next several years. We've included in the appendix additional detail on the calculation of this metric for 2019. On a related topic, strong performance of our retirement plan assets, combined with an earnings-neutral fourth quarter contribution more than offset a year-on-year reduction in discount rates, resulting in an increase in the overall funded balance of these plans by around 7 percentage points. This leads me to our 2020 CapEx and financing plan. Slide 10 provides our 2020 capital investment plan, which are broadly in line though a little higher in aggregate than the forecast we provided at our Investor Day due to a handful of small positive revisions and timing deltas. 
And Slide 11 provides an overview of our 2020 external financing plan. A couple of things to highlight here. First, consistent with previous guidance, our common equity plans for the year include only around $300 million via our DRIP program. You may recall that we have previously forecast $300 million to $500 million of ATM issuance in 2020, but subsequently announced that we would use proceeds from the Cove Point equity recapitalization to reduce or eliminate that issuance which is reflected here. Next, I'll point out that during 2020, we intend to issue up to $1.8 billion of privately placed fixed income securities at Dominion East Ohio, which, as a result of the Dominion Energy Gas Holdings reorganization we completed last November, is currently levered only on an intercompany basis. We currently expect this issuance in the midyear, and we'll use proceeds to retire current level debt. 
Finally, as is the norm, this annual financing plan does not reflect any opportunistic refinancing activities which may arise during the year. For example, in 2019, we rebalanced the capital structure at Dominion Energy South Carolina via a series of bond repurchases. In this fourth quarter, we took advantage of an attractive financing environment to replace existing debt with an equity credit preferred security that's priced at an all-time industry low. We will continue to monitor opportunities to similarly strengthen our balance sheet in an earnings supportive manner. 
Turning now to the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, which Tom will address in greater detail in a moment. Since about a year ago, when we announced the last material increase in our estimated total capital cost for ACP, discussions have been ongoing between the project owners and the anchor shipper customers regarding the equitable sharing of those increases within the contract tariff. Those negotiations have been productive, and we expect to formalize an agreement in the coming weeks. As part of those discussions, the major project customers have confirmed their willingness to take on higher project rates given the strategic importance of ACP as an alternative pipeline option to the region. As a reminder, these are 20-year take-or-pay agreement with regulated utility customers and no commodity exposure. This customer negotiation process -- progress allows us to provide guidance related to the project's economic contribution after entering commercial service. 
As shown on Slide 12, we expect the 2022 earnings contribution to be between $0.20 and $0.25 per share, which includes Supply Header and assumes a full year of commercial in-service. This estimate also reflects the transition from AFUDC to contract-based cash earnings potential. We expect this contribution to increase over time as we expand the project via compression and laterals. There is no change to our expected contribution this year of mid- to high teen cents per share. 
In related news, we're announcing today that we have agreed to acquire certain modestly sized gas transmission and storage assets from Southern company, subject to HSR regulatory approval. The first is Pivotal LNG, which liquefies and delivers LNG as fuel for transportation in the Southeast U.S., primarily from a new LNG production facility located in Jacksonville, Florida. Tom will discuss how this asset together with Cove Point, support the expansion of our LNG strategy to include maritime transportation. The second asset being acquired is Southern Company's 5% stake in the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, which upon closing will bring the project ownership to 53% Dominion Energy and 47% Duke Energy. 
Note that the governance arrangements for the project company remains such that it will continue to be recognized on an unconsolidated equity method basis in Dominion's financial statements. Likewise, there is no change to Southern Company's status as one of the anchor customers for the project through its Virginia natural gas local distribution company. The near-term financial impact of the acquisition of these 2 assets is positive, but relatively small, and the increased ACP ownership is reflected in the earnings contribution estimates I provided previously. Total cash consideration for these acquisitions is around $175 million. 
Turning to Santee Cooper. Our interest remains limited to a management proposal arrangement designed to cooperatively improve operational efficiency from our nearly colocated utility footprint. Consistent with our previous messaging on this topic, while the potential financial impact of any such arrangement would not be a material near-term financial driver for Dominion, we are glad to participate if selected by the Department of Administration and the South Carolina General Assembly, especially if the collaborative approach results in cost savings that can be passed on to our and Santee Cooper's customers in the state. We will provide updates as warranted as that process moves into the next phase. 
Finally, let me offer just a brief comment on the recent third quarter related to the PJM capacity market structure, commonly referred to as MOPR-Ex. We will continue to monitor that situation as it winds towards resolution. In the meantime, we do not see this as a material financial risk for our company given the even balance of supply and demand at Dominion Energy Virginia. Further, if we determine it to be in the best interest of our customers, we have the option to make a fixed resource requirement or FRR election. This would require a notification to PJM and where we'd also notify the Virginia State Corporation Commission and the North Carolina Utilities Commission. 
With that, let me conclude my remarks by reiterating the key investment themes that I spoke to on our last quarterly call. We are highly regulated -- we are highly regulated, with about 95% of our company's operating earnings derived from regulated and regulated-like operations. 70% of our earnings are from utility operations centered around 5 attractive states. Another 25% of our earnings are from FERC-regulated transmission and storage operations primarily serving utility customers under long-term capacity contracts. During 2019, we grew our regulated rate base by approximately 6%. We continue to expect 5-year rate base CAGR of approximately 7%, consistent with our expectations at Investor Day. We are executing on our previously announced 5-year and $26 billion growth capital plan that will modernize, strengthen and improve the sustainability of the services we offer to our customers. And finally, this customer-focused approach also benefits our shareholders as demonstrated by our growing track record of meeting and affirming our financial guidance, including a 16th consecutive quarter of meeting or exceeding our guidance midpoint. 
I'll now turn the call over to Tom."
267105,650327854,1911546,"Dominion Energy, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2020",2020-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. First, a reminder that safety is our first core value. On Slide 14, we have recast our historic safety results to incorporate our mergers with Questar and SCANA.

On Slide 14, we have recast our historic safety results to incorporate our mergers with Questar and SCANA. As you can see, the overall trend reflects a continuous focus on employee health and welfare. Pro forma for past mergers, our company-wide OSHA recordable incident rate decreased in 2019 for an 11th time over the last 13 years.
Turning now to our consistent national leadership as it relates to environmental, social and governance matters. Over the course of the last year, we have intensified our efforts to reduce emissions of all types. As shown on Slide 15, we have already reduced carbon emissions by around 50% since 2005, which is nearly twice as much as the most recently reported industry average. We have followed a similar path for methane emissions, which have fallen by around 25% since 2010, a significant reduction driven by industry-leading efforts. 
Further, as shown on the next slide, we have reduced coal-fired generation's contribution to company-wide electricity production by 80% from 52% in 2005 to 12% in 2019. And we estimate that coal-fired generation today accounts for less than 8% of our total regulated investment base. 
Turning to Slide 17. I'm pleased to announce a new commitment to achieve net 0 emissions by 2050. The goal includes both carbon dioxide and methane emissions and covers all of our businesses, including electricity generation and gas infrastructure. This represents a significant expansion from the company's previous greenhouse gas emission reduction goals, which included a commitment to cut methane emissions from our natural gas operations by 50% between 2010 and 2030 and carbon emissions from our power generating facilities by 80% between 2005 and 2050. 
Reducing emissions as fast as possible and achieving net 0 emissions company-wide requires immediate and direct action. That is why the company continues to make meaningful steps to extend licenses for its 0 carbon nuclear generation fleet, promote customer energy efficiency programs, invest heavily in wind and solar power, reduce the amount of coal-fired generation on our system, enhance gas infrastructure leak detection, systematically replace legacy gas distribution lines and harvest agricultural methane emissions to be repurposed as renewable natural gas. All of these initiatives are included in our capital investment plan guidance through 2023 and will extend well beyond that. 
Over the long term, achieving these goals will require supportive legislative and regulatory policies and broader investments across the economy. This includes support for the testing and deployment of technologies, such as large-scale energy storage and carbon capture, which, though still early stage, have the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions significantly when deployed in conjunction with carbon-free generation. And we will never lose sight of our fundamental responsibility to customers: provision of safe, reliable and affordable energy. We have issued a press release this morning that addresses the topic in additional detail. And you should expect to hear more about our plans, including in upcoming climate and corporate and social responsibility reports. Though certain approaches will undoubtedly evolve over the coming decades to reflect the most up-to-date assumptions, our commitment to net 0 emissions will not change. 
I'm pleased to report that our work on reducing emissions and enhancing our ESG disclosures was recognized with a leadership rating by CDP, an influential nonprofit that monitors and measures environmental impact. These ratings put Dominion Energy in the upper echelon of not just U.S. utility companies but all companies of all industries globally. In addition, Just Capital, an organization that promotes corporate responsibility in partnership with Forbes, has ranked Dominion among America's top 100 corporate citizens. It is, of course, nice to receive accolades like these, but we are not declaring victory. 
In addition to minimizing our own operational environmental footprint in line with the carbon and methane goals I just described, we are also embracing the notion of Beyond Dominion Energy as it relates to our ability to transform the emissions profiles of our customers and energy end users, as shown on Slide 19, in the transportation sector, which accounts for 29% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. We are leading the way in the development of the largest electric school bus program in the nation. We are enhancing the resiliency and flexibility of our electric grid to enable the more rapid deployment of electric vehicle charging infrastructure as enabled in Virginia by the Grid Transformation & Security Act, and we are developing infrastructure that will make liquefied natural gas, compressed renewable natural gas and potentially hydrogen fuels more available and more affordable for use in transportation applications, including maritime shipping vessels. 
In the agricultural sector, which accounts for 9% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, we are partnering with the nation's largest hog and dairy producers to capture methane from farm operations. These partnerships have already committed $700 million of shared investment to capture methane emissions and use RNG to serve homes, businesses and vehicle fleets. These are large and ambitious, multi-decade plans that are consistent with the spirit of Dominion Energy and its nearly 20,000 employees. 
Many of these efforts are well underway, including our solar, offshore wind, nuclear relicensing and energy efficiency programs. Others are in more nascent stages, including our electric school bus, RNG and marine LNG programs. Over the coming months and years, you should expect to hear more on these strategies as we work diligently to reduce the emissions profiles of our company and our customer. I will address several of these now. 
Turning to Slide 20. Late last year, we announced plans to install over 2.6 gigawatts of wind generation capacity, approximately 27 miles off the coast of Virginia, a major milestone for a project we began developing in 2013. Since that announcement, we have achieved several additional milestones, including selecting Siemens Gamesa as our preferred turbine supplier and entering into an agreement with 3 prominent trade unions to support the onshore electric interconnection work. We will begin ocean survey work in April, which will help to support the submission of the construction and operations plan at the end of this year. We expect to commence construction in 2024, upon timely completion of the BOEM permitting process, with full in-service by the end of 2026. 
We will continue to work to refine the preliminary capital cost estimate of approximately $8 billion, the vast majority of which will occur in the '24 to '26 time frame as major components are fabricated and installed. Cost reductions as well as any tax benefits that we achieve will accrue directly to the benefit of our customers. Dominion Energy Virginia will be the sole equity owner of this regulated asset. We will seek recovery via a rider from the Virginia State Corporation Commission. While the existing GTSA provides a strong framework for regulated cost recovery for offshore wind investments, a legislation, which was supported by the governor's office in recent legislative committee meetings, is working its way through the current Virginia General Assembly session that, if enacted, would provide additional regulatory clarity. 
Our related 12-megawatt pilot project will begin turbine installation in May and is expected to achieve commercial operation in late summer of this year. The lessons learned on this project will be invaluable to the successful completion of our full-scale deployment. The pilot is the first and only offshore wind project in Federal waters to have completed the BOEM permitting process, which included a cumulative impact analysis. We expect to leverage the right-of-way and other work already performed under the pilot project to facilitate routing the export cable to shore and connecting it to the onshore electric transmission system. 
Also in Virginia, our weather-normalized sales increased 1.4% year-over-year, driven primarily by increased data center and residential demand. We connected nearly 34,000 new accounts, about 10% more than last year, including 26 data centers, which set another annual record. Earlier this year, PJM revised upwards their peak load assumptions for our service territory to reflect, among other things, continued strong data center growth. PJM's DOM zone summer peak load growth is now expected to be 1.2% per year over the next 10 years and 1% annually over the next 15. These rates are double the PJM system-wide growth rates and rank our zone as one of the fastest-growing regions among the 13 states that comprise PJM. 
Turning to Slide 21. Last month, the State Corporation Commission approved our U.S. forward solar CPCN application, the second such approval in the last 12 months. We expect subsequent rider approval in April. Overall, we have now achieved 57% of our commitment to Virginians to have 3,000 megawatts of solar in development or in operation by the end of 2021. To date, and inclusive of around $800 million of spending in 2019 alone, Dominion Energy's enterprise-wide total solar investment now stands at approximately $4 billion with an additional nearly $3 billion expected through 2023. We anticipate continued solar investment for years to come, which is why we expect to improve our current ranking of fourth among the largest utility owners of solar in the country. 
Phase 2 of our grid modernization program is before the commission. Representing around $500 million of Capex, the request includes deployment of automated metering, a new customer information platform and investments in grid resiliency and telecommunications that are essential to delivering the products and services that our customers desire and which provides for a system more capable of withstanding climate-related risks. We are optimistic that we will receive approval next month. 
Our other investment programs shown on Slide 22, such as electric transmission, nuclear relicensing, distribution undergrounding, pump storage, renewable-enabling quick-start generation and rural broadband, are tracking in line with our expectations. Virginia General Assembly has been in session for about 5 weeks and is scheduled to conclude in less than a month. There are 2 proposals currently pending that I believe warrant highlighting. One is related to offshore wind, which I previously addressed. The other relates to our nation-leading initiative to replace diesel with electric school buses. We have already selected a vendor and worked with local school districts in our service territory to allocate an initial delivery of 50 school buses by year-end. Pending legislation calls for replacing an additional 1,500 buses by 2025, representing an estimated Dominion capital investment of approximately $400 million which will be eligible for cost recovery subject to commission approval. 
Ultimately, we would place all 13,000 diesel school buses in our Virginia service territory. Not only will this effort dramatically improve the air quality for our students and their communities, it will provide valuable real-world experience with vehicle-to-grid battery technology as the first 1,500 buses, while idle, represent up to 60 megawatts of effective battery storage. We are monitoring other active pieces of legislation, all of which we expect to represent a reasonable and balanced approach to statewide energy policy priorities. 
Turning now to South Carolina on Slide 23. We are pleased with the work done by our team members to provide for a smooth integration while maintaining their historically excellent levels of reliability and customer service. Around midyear, we plan to file an electric rate case as stipulated in the merger agreement. Our most recent earned return was around 7.5% and our current authorized return is 10.25%. The most significant driver of the under earnings is related to normal course, safety, customer growth and reliability utility investment over the last 8 years. This is not currently captured in rates. We believe the case will conclude by year-end with an outcome that appropriately balances the interest of customers and shareholders. 
Turning to Gas Distribution. Recently, we have begun to hear of investor concern that, at least in some states, municipal level ordinances could limit overall demand growth for natural gas utility service. While that may be true elsewhere, we simply do not see any evidence of slowing customer or investment growth in the states in which we operate gas utilities: Utah, Idaho, Wyoming, Ohio, West Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Compounded annual customer growth across this segment was 1.5% over the last 3 years and as high as 2.6% and in Utah and North Carolina, with no signs of abating anytime soon. For many of our customers, the alternative to natural gas for home heating is fuel oil or even wood, which have significantly higher carbon signatures. And in certain communities within reach of our system, a lack of energy infrastructure is constraining growth and impacting everyday quality of life. 
Further, we are an industry leader in minimizing the emissions footprint of natural gas utility operations, including through promoting energy efficiency, utilizing innovative technologies and increasing access for our customers to renewable natural gas. We also continue to invest hundreds of millions of dollars every year in modernizing our distribution infrastructure, which improves safety, reduces emissions and is recoverable in the form of riders or trackers that will continue over the course of at least the next decade. Regulators continue to approve new investments like our on-system peaking storage facility in Utah that will improve system reliability for decades to come. Our Gas Distribution segment is focused on being part of the solution to a sustainable future. 
Finally, let me now discuss our Gas Transmission & Storage business. First, RNG. We are the largest agricultural waste-to-energy investor in the United States, with investments of $700 million across our partnerships over the next 10 years. These investments will grow as the offtake market matures. Through these efforts, we capture otherwise fugitive methane from livestock and convert it to pipeline quality natural gas for use in homes, businesses and vehicle fleets. Every captured unit of methane is the equivalent of eliminating 25 units of carbon dioxide. Dominion is uniquely positioned to lead the industry in this effort, given the geography of our assets. 
At Investor Day last year, we identified marine LNG as one of the many innovative ideas we were working to advance. By way of background, crews and cargo vessels primarily consume diesel or fuel oil, each of which is a major contributor of greenhouse gas and other emissions. The maritime industry is taking steps encouraged by recent global regulation to reduce its emissions footprint, which is expected to result in a material shift to LNG. This expected growth in LNG as a fuel source allows Dominion attractive opportunity to provide natural gas liquefaction and LNG distribution services to a growing list of maritime customers. As Jim mentioned, we are acquiring an interest in existing Florida-based operation that currently services marine vessels with an onshore liquefier coupled with marine fuel delivery infrastructure. Customer contracts in this business are typically long term take-or-pay with no commodity exposure. 
This initial acquisition will support a broader marine LNG strategy that would include Cove Point, where we're partnering with an existing export customer to redirect a portion of their liquefied natural gas inventory to provide LNG to constrained markets along the East Coast and to provide fuel for marine vessels under 0 commodity risk take-or-pay contracts. Importantly, this arrangement does not and will not alter the existing 20-year take-or-pay export contract revenues or terms. While modest initially, this market has the potential to support the significant decarbonization of the country's marine industry in addition to radically reducing pollution at our nation's ports. Overall, inclusive of the acquisition from Southern Company, we expect to deploy approximately $200 million on this strategy over the next 5 years. This is an innovative element of our long-term Beyond Dominion Energy effort to help our customers, new and old, meet their emissions reduction targets. 
Turning now to an update on activities related to the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, as shown on Slide 24. 2 weeks from yesterday, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments related to the Appalachian Trail crossing aspect of our U.S. Forest Service permit. We remain optimistic that the court will issue an order reversing the Fourth Circuit in the May or June time frame. 
We continue to work with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on a reissued biological opinion and are pleased that FERC reinitiated formal consultation yesterday. We applaud the service for taking the time to consider thoroughly the feedback provided by the court during the prior judicial proceedings and we believe an updated biological opinion will be issued during the first half of this year. Upon receipt of the updated biological opinion, we intend to notify FERC and anticipate thereafter, the recommencement of construction across major portions of the pipeline. 
We're also pleased with the progress related to projects' Nationwide 12 Permit, which was issued by and subsequently voluntarily remanded to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Last month, the Corps adopted repromulgated regulations that would allow for ACP to seek reissuance of the permit. 
As it relates to the Buckingham County compressor station air permit, which was vacated late last year, I repeat my message from our last earnings call. We can deliver a very material amount of contracted volumes to customers on our existing schedule, even if permit resolution delays the in-service date of the project's third compression station. We are working on a number of solutions, which we expect will resolve the issue during the second half of this year. We believe that the options we are evaluating will satisfy the court's concerns, which centered on process not the substance of the permit itself. 
Based on our expectation of the biological opinion being reissued during the first half of the year, we are confirming our project time line that calls for construction completion by the end of next year and commissioning to be completed shortly thereafter. Project costs of approximately $8 billion are in line with the high end of the judicial option range we provided about a year ago. This estimate incorporates the various potential approaches to permitting issues and construction plans and timing, including as it relates to the Buckingham Compressor Station, which are being contemplated in the customer discussions that Jim described. Also as noted, we have agreed to acquire the 5% ownership in the project from Southern Company, further underscoring our confidence in the successful completion of the project. 
With that, I will summarize today's call as follows: our first value is safety, and we achieved another year of record safety performance. We introduced a net 0 emissions by 2050 target that accounts for carbon and methane emissions across both electric and gas operations. We achieved weather-normalized operating earnings that exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range for the 16th consecutive quarter. We further improved our credit metrics and successfully completed the restructuring of our operating segments. We introduced 2020 earnings guidance that represents a 5% year-over-year increase, consistent with previous messaging. We confirmed our earnings per share growth expectations of 5-plus percent post-2020, and we are making significant progress across our capital investment programs to the benefit of our customers. 
We will now be happy to answer your questions."

Over the last several years, Dominion Energy has transitioned into a larger, more regulated and more predictable company and this is reflected in our ability to extend our track record of delivering financial performance consistent with our guidance. I'm pleased to report on Slide 3, that the fourth quarter of 2019 was the 16th consecutive quarter of achieving operating earnings per share that, adjusted for normal weather, met or exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range. Quarterly operating earnings were $1.18 per share, which includes a benefit from better-than-normal weather of less than $0.01. Even without adjusting for weather, this was still the 16th consecutive quarter of results that aligned with our guidance range. 2019 full year operating earnings of $4.24 also exceeded the midpoint of our annual guidance range of $4.15 to $4.30 per share. When adjusted for about $0.02 of help relative to normal weather, these operating earnings for the year met the midpoint of our annual guidance range and represent a 5.5% increase over 2018 weather-normalized operating EPS. 
GAAP earnings for the quarter and for the year were $1.32 and $1.73 per share, respectively. Recall that full year reported results were materially impacted during the first 2 quarters of the year by charges associated with the SCANA merger, including a substantial customer refund as approved by the South Carolina Public Service Commission. Adjusted for these merger and integration-related costs, our trailing 3-year aggregate GAAP earnings are actually higher than our total operating earnings over the same period. A summary of adjustments between operating and reported results are included in the appendix with a detailed reconciliation available on Schedule 2 of the earnings release kit. 
Turning now to Slide 4. As usual, our operating earnings guidance ranges assume normal weather, variations from which could cause results to be toward the top or the bottom of these ranges. We are initiating 2020 operating earnings guidance with a range of $4.25 to $4.60 per share. The midpoint of this range represents a 5% increase over our weather-normalized 2019 results, which aligns with the guidance we provided at our Investor Day last March. Select drivers in 2020 as compared to 2019 include increased earnings from regulated investment growth across our electric and gas businesses, lower interest expense due to lower average debt balances and a lower rate environment, the full year impact of the Millstone 0 carbon contract and lower depreciation expense associated with an anticipated extension of the useful life assumption for our regulated nuclear plants in Virginia.
Negative drivers include increased minority interest expense associated with the equity recapitalization of Cove Point, share dilution, lower New England capacity prices and a double outage year at Millstone. Note that the double outage year -- the double outage occurs every third year and will, therefore, be a positive driver in 2021. We are introducing first quarter consolidated operating earnings guidance of $1.05 to $1.25 per share. We are also affirming our post-2020 guidance of 5-plus percent annual operating EPS growth as well as our dividend per share growth rate of 2.5% per annum, subject, as is customary, to Board approval. We have successfully changed the way we manage and report our businesses, as shown on Slide 5, to better reflect the larger and more regulated nature of our operations. We expect that these realigned segments will also make it easier to model and analyze our company. 
On Slide 6, we provide annual operating income guidance at the new segment level. Let me take a moment and highlight a few points. First, except for Contracted Generation, which I'll explain in a minute, each of our segments exhibit strong operating earnings growth trends, driven primarily by regulated investment and general cost discipline. Contracted Generation's earnings trend is negatively impacted by the sale of Manchester and Fairless at the end of 2018 and by the double outage year at Millstone in 2020. As I mentioned previously, the double outage driver will reverse for 2021. Second, we've adjusted the CAGR of the Gas Distribution segment to exclude the impact of the addition of PSNC in 2019 to demonstrate the very strong core growth rate at the segment absent merger activity. Third, we are not showing a 2018 to 2020 CAGR for Dominion Energy South Carolina as the merger with SCANA did not conclude until 2019. Growth in 2020 is primarily driven by merger cost savings, which we expect to accrue to the benefit of our customers in South Carolina as part of our upcoming electric rate case. In other words, this growth is good for both customers and shareholders. 
Finally, these segment level operating income CAGRs, of course, don't reflect equity issuance at the parent over the period shown, including shares issued in exchange for SCANA stock early last year, and which act to produce a consolidated EPS growth rate that is slightly below the segment level growth numbers shown here. 
On Slide 7, we show expected 2020 operating EPS contribution by segment. This page underscores 2 of the key investment themes we have emphasized. First, that the strategic progression of our company has resulted in having approximately 95% of our operating earnings derived from regulated and regulated-like operations; and second, that around 70% of our operating earnings come from state-regulated utility operations centered around 5 highly attractive states, including Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Ohio and Utah. Going forward, we plan to provide this segment level operating guidance annually. We have also simplified or added to our existing disclosures, including with regards to weather impacts, customer growth, rate base estimates, Millstone hedging, fixed income and other topics. We hope you find these changes, which are included in our earnings release kit and in the appendix of today's presentation, helpful. 
Turning to Slide 8. We've summarized our current capital structure. We now have distinct and aligned financing entities related to our Dominion Energy Virginia, Dominion Energy South Carolina and Gas Transmission & Storage operating segments. These financing vehicles are, in addition to our parent level entity, SEC registrants and therefore, will continue to file 10-Ks and 10-Qs. For the Gas Distribution and the Contracted Generation segments, we show here the aggregate of existing financing balances across the individual opco entities, which, primarily due to their smaller size, are financed in the private market. 
Let me now address credit more generally. I frequently remind our investors that we manage our balance sheet to a target credit rating range and not just to one of the specific credit metrics. Also that the cash coverage metrics, such as FFO or CFO pre-working capital to debt, represent only a small weighting within the overall rating methodologies employed by our credit rating agencies. 
Nonetheless, on Slide 9, we illustrate the meaningful improvement we have achieved in the cash coverage metric over the last 4 years and which we expect will continue to gradually improve over the next several years. We've included in the appendix additional detail on the calculation of this metric for 2019. On a related topic, strong performance of our retirement plan assets, combined with an earnings-neutral fourth quarter contribution more than offset a year-on-year reduction in discount rates, resulting in an increase in the overall funded balance of these plans by around 7 percentage points. This leads me to our 2020 CapEx and financing plan. Slide 10 provides our 2020 capital investment plan, which are broadly in line though a little higher in aggregate than the forecast we provided at our Investor Day due to a handful of small positive revisions and timing deltas. 
And Slide 11 provides an overview of our 2020 external financing plan. A couple of things to highlight here. First, consistent with previous guidance, our common equity plans for the year include only around $300 million via our DRIP program. You may recall that we have previously forecast $300 million to $500 million of ATM issuance in 2020, but subsequently announced that we would use proceeds from the Cove Point equity recapitalization to reduce or eliminate that issuance which is reflected here. Next, I'll point out that during 2020, we intend to issue up to $1.8 billion of privately placed fixed income securities at Dominion East Ohio, which, as a result of the Dominion Energy Gas Holdings reorganization we completed last November, is currently levered only on an intercompany basis. We currently expect this issuance in the midyear, and we'll use proceeds to retire current level debt. 
Finally, as is the norm, this annual financing plan does not reflect any opportunistic refinancing activities which may arise during the year. For example, in 2019, we rebalanced the capital structure at Dominion Energy South Carolina via a series of bond repurchases. In this fourth quarter, we took advantage of an attractive financing environment to replace existing debt with an equity credit preferred security that's priced at an all-time industry low. We will continue to monitor opportunities to similarly strengthen our balance sheet in an earnings supportive manner. 
Turning now to the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, which Tom will address in greater detail in a moment. Since about a year ago, when we announced the last material increase in our estimated total capital cost for ACP, discussions have been ongoing between the project owners and the anchor shipper customers regarding the equitable sharing of those increases within the contract tariff. Those negotiations have been productive, and we expect to formalize an agreement in the coming weeks. As part of those discussions, the major project customers have confirmed their willingness to take on higher project rates given the strategic importance of ACP as an alternative pipeline option to the region. As a reminder, these are 20-year take-or-pay agreement with regulated utility customers and no commodity exposure. This customer negotiation process -- progress allows us to provide guidance related to the project's economic contribution after entering commercial service. 
As shown on Slide 12, we expect the 2022 earnings contribution to be between $0.20 and $0.25 per share, which includes Supply Header and assumes a full year of commercial in-service. This estimate also reflects the transition from AFUDC to contract-based cash earnings potential. We expect this contribution to increase over time as we expand the project via compression and laterals. There is no change to our expected contribution this year of mid- to high teen cents per share. 
In related news, we're announcing today that we have agreed to acquire certain modestly sized gas transmission and storage assets from Southern company, subject to HSR regulatory approval. The first is Pivotal LNG, which liquefies and delivers LNG as fuel for transportation in the Southeast U.S., primarily from a new LNG production facility located in Jacksonville, Florida. Tom will discuss how this asset together with Cove Point, support the expansion of our LNG strategy to include maritime transportation. The second asset being acquired is Southern Company's 5% stake in the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, which upon closing will bring the project ownership to 53% Dominion Energy and 47% Duke Energy. 
Note that the governance arrangements for the project company remains such that it will continue to be recognized on an unconsolidated equity method basis in Dominion's financial statements. Likewise, there is no change to Southern Company's status as one of the anchor customers for the project through its Virginia natural gas local distribution company. The near-term financial impact of the acquisition of these 2 assets is positive, but relatively small, and the increased ACP ownership is reflected in the earnings contribution estimates I provided previously. Total cash consideration for these acquisitions is around $175 million. 
Turning to Santee Cooper. Our interest remains limited to a management proposal arrangement designed to cooperatively improve operational efficiency from our nearly colocated utility footprint. Consistent with our previous messaging on this topic, while the potential financial impact of any such arrangement would not be a material near-term financial driver for Dominion, we are glad to participate if selected by the Department of Administration and the South Carolina General Assembly, especially if the collaborative approach results in cost savings that can be passed on to our and Santee Cooper's customers in the state. We will provide updates as warranted as that process moves into the next phase. 
Finally, let me offer just a brief comment on the recent third quarter related to the PJM capacity market structure, commonly referred to as MOPR-Ex. We will continue to monitor that situation as it winds towards resolution. In the meantime, we do not see this as a material financial risk for our company given the even balance of supply and demand at Dominion Energy Virginia. Further, if we determine it to be in the best interest of our customers, we have the option to make a fixed resource requirement or FRR election. This would require a notification to PJM and where we'd also notify the Virginia State Corporation Commission and the North Carolina Utilities Commission. 
With that, let me conclude my remarks by reiterating the key investment themes that I spoke to on our last quarterly call. We are highly regulated -- we are highly regulated, with about 95% of our company's operating earnings derived from regulated and regulated-like operations. 70% of our earnings are from utility operations centered around 5 attractive states. Another 25% of our earnings are from FERC-regulated transmission and storage operations primarily serving utility customers under long-term capacity contracts. During 2019, we grew our regulated rate base by approximately 6%. We continue to expect 5-year rate base CAGR of approximately 7%, consistent with our expectations at Investor Day. We are executing on our previously announced 5-year and $26 billion growth capital plan that will modernize, strengthen and improve the sustainability of the services we offer to our customers. And finally, this customer-focused approach also benefits our shareholders as demonstrated by our growing track record of meeting and affirming our financial guidance, including a 16th consecutive quarter of meeting or exceeding our guidance midpoint. 
I'll now turn the call over to Tom."

On Slide 14, we have recast our historic safety results to incorporate our mergers with Questar and SCANA. As you can see, the overall trend reflects a continuous focus on employee health and welfare. Pro forma for past mergers, our company-wide OSHA recordable incident rate decreased in 2019 for an 11th time over the last 13 years.
Turning now to our consistent national leadership as it relates to environmental, social and governance matters. Over the course of the last year, we have intensified our efforts to reduce emissions of all types. As shown on Slide 15, we have already reduced carbon emissions by around 50% since 2005, which is nearly twice as much as the most recently reported industry average. We have followed a similar path for methane emissions, which have fallen by around 25% since 2010, a significant reduction driven by industry-leading efforts. 
Further, as shown on the next slide, we have reduced coal-fired generation's contribution to company-wide electricity production by 80% from 52% in 2005 to 12% in 2019. And we estimate that coal-fired generation today accounts for less than 8% of our total regulated investment base. 
Turning to Slide 17. I'm pleased to announce a new commitment to achieve net 0 emissions by 2050. The goal includes both carbon dioxide and methane emissions and covers all of our businesses, including electricity generation and gas infrastructure. This represents a significant expansion from the company's previous greenhouse gas emission reduction goals, which included a commitment to cut methane emissions from our natural gas operations by 50% between 2010 and 2030 and carbon emissions from our power generating facilities by 80% between 2005 and 2050. 
Reducing emissions as fast as possible and achieving net 0 emissions company-wide requires immediate and direct action. That is why the company continues to make meaningful steps to extend licenses for its 0 carbon nuclear generation fleet, promote customer energy efficiency programs, invest heavily in wind and solar power, reduce the amount of coal-fired generation on our system, enhance gas infrastructure leak detection, systematically replace legacy gas distribution lines and harvest agricultural methane emissions to be repurposed as renewable natural gas. All of these initiatives are included in our capital investment plan guidance through 2023 and will extend well beyond that. 
Over the long term, achieving these goals will require supportive legislative and regulatory policies and broader investments across the economy. This includes support for the testing and deployment of technologies, such as large-scale energy storage and carbon capture, which, though still early stage, have the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions significantly when deployed in conjunction with carbon-free generation. And we will never lose sight of our fundamental responsibility to customers: provision of safe, reliable and affordable energy. We have issued a press release this morning that addresses the topic in additional detail. And you should expect to hear more about our plans, including in upcoming climate and corporate and social responsibility reports. Though certain approaches will undoubtedly evolve over the coming decades to reflect the most up-to-date assumptions, our commitment to net 0 emissions will not change. 
I'm pleased to report that our work on reducing emissions and enhancing our ESG disclosures was recognized with a leadership rating by CDP, an influential nonprofit that monitors and measures environmental impact. These ratings put Dominion Energy in the upper echelon of not just U.S. utility companies but all companies of all industries globally. In addition, Just Capital, an organization that promotes corporate responsibility in partnership with Forbes, has ranked Dominion among America's top 100 corporate citizens. It is, of course, nice to receive accolades like these, but we are not declaring victory. 
In addition to minimizing our own operational environmental footprint in line with the carbon and methane goals I just described, we are also embracing the notion of Beyond Dominion Energy as it relates to our ability to transform the emissions profiles of our customers and energy end users, as shown on Slide 19, in the transportation sector, which accounts for 29% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. We are leading the way in the development of the largest electric school bus program in the nation. We are enhancing the resiliency and flexibility of our electric grid to enable the more rapid deployment of electric vehicle charging infrastructure as enabled in Virginia by the Grid Transformation & Security Act, and we are developing infrastructure that will make liquefied natural gas, compressed renewable natural gas and potentially hydrogen fuels more available and more affordable for use in transportation applications, including maritime shipping vessels. 
In the agricultural sector, which accounts for 9% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, we are partnering with the nation's largest hog and dairy producers to capture methane from farm operations. These partnerships have already committed $700 million of shared investment to capture methane emissions and use RNG to serve homes, businesses and vehicle fleets. These are large and ambitious, multi-decade plans that are consistent with the spirit of Dominion Energy and its nearly 20,000 employees. 
Many of these efforts are well underway, including our solar, offshore wind, nuclear relicensing and energy efficiency programs. Others are in more nascent stages, including our electric school bus, RNG and marine LNG programs. Over the coming months and years, you should expect to hear more on these strategies as we work diligently to reduce the emissions profiles of our company and our customer. I will address several of these now. 
Turning to Slide 20. Late last year, we announced plans to install over 2.6 gigawatts of wind generation capacity, approximately 27 miles off the coast of Virginia, a major milestone for a project we began developing in 2013. Since that announcement, we have achieved several additional milestones, including selecting Siemens Gamesa as our preferred turbine supplier and entering into an agreement with 3 prominent trade unions to support the onshore electric interconnection work. We will begin ocean survey work in April, which will help to support the submission of the construction and operations plan at the end of this year. We expect to commence construction in 2024, upon timely completion of the BOEM permitting process, with full in-service by the end of 2026. 
We will continue to work to refine the preliminary capital cost estimate of approximately $8 billion, the vast majority of which will occur in the '24 to '26 time frame as major components are fabricated and installed. Cost reductions as well as any tax benefits that we achieve will accrue directly to the benefit of our customers. Dominion Energy Virginia will be the sole equity owner of this regulated asset. We will seek recovery via a rider from the Virginia State Corporation Commission. While the existing GTSA provides a strong framework for regulated cost recovery for offshore wind investments, a legislation, which was supported by the governor's office in recent legislative committee meetings, is working its way through the current Virginia General Assembly session that, if enacted, would provide additional regulatory clarity. 
Our related 12-megawatt pilot project will begin turbine installation in May and is expected to achieve commercial operation in late summer of this year. The lessons learned on this project will be invaluable to the successful completion of our full-scale deployment. The pilot is the first and only offshore wind project in Federal waters to have completed the BOEM permitting process, which included a cumulative impact analysis. We expect to leverage the right-of-way and other work already performed under the pilot project to facilitate routing the export cable to shore and connecting it to the onshore electric transmission system. 
Also in Virginia, our weather-normalized sales increased 1.4% year-over-year, driven primarily by increased data center and residential demand. We connected nearly 34,000 new accounts, about 10% more than last year, including 26 data centers, which set another annual record. Earlier this year, PJM revised upwards their peak load assumptions for our service territory to reflect, among other things, continued strong data center growth. PJM's DOM zone summer peak load growth is now expected to be 1.2% per year over the next 10 years and 1% annually over the next 15. These rates are double the PJM system-wide growth rates and rank our zone as one of the fastest-growing regions among the 13 states that comprise PJM. 
Turning to Slide 21. Last month, the State Corporation Commission approved our U.S. forward solar CPCN application, the second such approval in the last 12 months. We expect subsequent rider approval in April. Overall, we have now achieved 57% of our commitment to Virginians to have 3,000 megawatts of solar in development or in operation by the end of 2021. To date and inclusive of around $800 million of spending in 2019 alone, Dominion Energy's enterprise-wide total solar investment now stands at approximately $4 billion with an additional nearly $3 billion expected through 2023. We anticipate continued solar investment for years to come, which is why we expect to improve our current ranking of fourth among the largest utility owners of solar in the country. 
Phase 2 of our grid modernization program is before the commission. Representing around $500 million of Capex, the request includes deployment of automated metering, a new customer information platform and investments in grid resiliency and telecommunications that are essential to delivering the products and services that our customers desire and which provides for a system more capable of withstanding climate-related risks. We are optimistic that we will receive approval next month. 
Our other investment programs shown on Slide 22, such as electric transmission, nuclear relicensing, distribution undergrounding, pump storage, renewable-enabling quick-start generation and rural broadband, are tracking in line with our expectations. Virginia General Assembly has been in session for about 5 weeks and is scheduled to conclude in less than a month. There are 2 proposals currently pending that I believe warrant highlighting. One is related to offshore wind, which I previously addressed. The other relates to our nation-leading initiative to replace diesel with electric school buses. We have already selected a vendor and worked with local school districts in our service territory to allocate an initial delivery of 50 school buses by year-end. Pending legislation calls for replacing an additional 1,500 buses by 2025, representing an estimated Dominion capital investment of approximately $400 million which will be eligible for cost recovery subject to commission approval. 
Ultimately, we would place all 13,000 diesel school buses in our Virginia service territory. Not only will this effort dramatically improve the air quality for our students and their communities, it will provide valuable real-world experience with vehicle-to-grid battery technology as the first 1,500 buses, while idle, represent up to 60 megawatts of effective battery storage. We are monitoring other active pieces of legislation, all of which we expect to represent a reasonable and balanced approach to statewide energy policy priorities. 
Turning now to South Carolina on Slide 23. We are pleased with the work done by our team members to provide for a smooth integration while maintaining their historically excellent levels of reliability and customer service. Around midyear, we plan to file an electric rate case as stipulated in the merger agreement. Our most recent earned return was around 7.5% and our current authorized return is 10.25%. The most significant driver of the under earnings is related to normal course, safety, customer growth and reliability utility investment over the last 8 years. This is not currently captured in rates. We believe the case will conclude by year-end with an outcome that appropriately balances the interest of customers and shareholders. 
Turning to Gas Distribution. Recently, we have begun to hear of investor concern that, at least in some states, municipal level ordinances could limit overall demand growth for natural gas utility service. While that may be true elsewhere, we simply do not see any evidence of slowing customer or investment growth in the states in which we operate gas utilities: Utah, Idaho, Wyoming, Ohio, West Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Compounded annual customer growth across this segment was 1.5% over the last 3 years and as high as 2.6% and in Utah and North Carolina, with no signs of abating anytime soon. For many of our customers, the alternative to natural gas for home heating is fuel oil or even wood, which have significantly higher carbon signatures. And in certain communities within reach of our system, a lack of energy infrastructure is constraining growth and impacting everyday quality of life. 
Further, we are an industry leader in minimizing the emissions footprint of natural gas utility operations, including through promoting energy efficiency, utilizing innovative technologies and increasing access for our customers to renewable natural gas. We also continue to invest hundreds of millions of dollars every year in modernizing our distribution infrastructure, which improves safety, reduces emissions and is recoverable in the form of riders or trackers that will continue over the course of at least the next decade. Regulators continue to approve new investments like our on-system peaking storage facility in Utah that will improve system reliability for decades to come. Our Gas Distribution segment is focused on being part of the solution to a sustainable future. 
Finally, let me now discuss our Gas Transmission & Storage business. First, RNG. We are the largest agricultural waste-to-energy investor in the United States, with investments of $700 million across our partnerships over the next 10 years. These investments will grow as the offtake market matures. Through these efforts, we capture otherwise fugitive methane from livestock and convert it to pipeline quality natural gas for use in homes, businesses and vehicle fleets. Every captured unit of methane is the equivalent of eliminating 25 units of carbon dioxide. Dominion is uniquely positioned to lead the industry in this effort, given the geography of our assets. 
At Investor Day last year, we identified marine LNG as one of the many innovative ideas we were working to advance. By way of background, crews and cargo vessels primarily consume diesel or fuel oil, each of which is a major contributor of greenhouse gas and other emissions. The maritime industry is taking steps encouraged by recent global regulation to reduce its emissions footprint, which is expected to result in a material shift to LNG. This expected growth in LNG as a fuel source allows Dominion attractive opportunity to provide natural gas liquefaction and LNG distribution services to a growing list of maritime customers. As Jim mentioned, we are acquiring an interest in existing Florida-based operation that currently services marine vessels with an onshore liquefier coupled with marine fuel delivery infrastructure. Customer contracts in this business are typically long term take-or-pay with no commodity exposure. 
This initial acquisition will support a broader marine LNG strategy that would include Cove Point, where we're partnering with an existing export customer to redirect a portion of their liquefied natural gas inventory to provide LNG to constrained markets along the East Coast and to provide fuel for marine vessels under 0 commodity risk take-or-pay contracts. Importantly, this arrangement does not and will not alter the existing 20-year take-or-pay export contract revenues or terms. While modest initially, this market has the potential to support the significant decarbonization of the country's marine industry in addition to radically reducing pollution at our nation's ports. Overall, inclusive of the acquisition from Southern Company, we expect to deploy approximately $200 million on this strategy over the next 5 years. This is an innovative element of our long-term Beyond Dominion Energy effort to help our customers, new and old, meet their emissions reduction targets. 
Turning now to an update on activities related to the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, as shown on Slide 24. 2 weeks from yesterday, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments related to the Appalachian Trail crossing aspect of our U.S. Forest Service permit. We remain optimistic that the court will issue an order reversing the Fourth Circuit in the May or June time frame. 
We continue to work with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on a reissued biological opinion and are pleased that FERC reinitiated formal consultation yesterday. We applaud the service for taking the time to consider thoroughly the feedback provided by the court during the prior judicial proceedings and we believe an updated biological opinion will be issued during the first half of this year. Upon receipt of the updated biological opinion, we intend to notify FERC and anticipate thereafter, the recommencement of construction across major portions of the pipeline. 
We're also pleased with the progress related to projects' Nationwide 12 Permit, which was issued by and subsequently voluntarily remanded to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Last month, the Corps adopted repromulgated regulations that would allow for ACP to seek reissuance of the permit. 
As it relates to the Buckingham County compressor station air permit, which was vacated late last year, I repeat my message from our last earnings call. We can deliver a very material amount of contracted volumes to customers on our existing schedule, even if permit resolution delays the in-service date of the project's third compression station. We are working on a number of solutions, which we expect will resolve the issue during the second half of this year. We believe that the options we are evaluating will satisfy the court's concerns, which centered on process not the substance of the permit itself. 
Based on our expectation of the biological opinion being reissued during the first half of the year, we are confirming our project time line that calls for construction completion by the end of next year and commissioning to be completed shortly thereafter. Project costs of approximately $8 billion are in line with the high end of the judicial option range we provided about a year ago. This estimate incorporates the various potential approaches to permitting issues and construction plans and timing, including as it relates to the Buckingham Compressor Station, which are being contemplated in the customer discussions that Jim described. Also as noted, we have agreed to acquire the 5% ownership in the project from Southern Company, further underscoring our confidence in the successful completion of the project. 
With that, I will summarize today's call as follows: our first value is safety, and we achieved another year of record safety performance. We introduced a net 0 emissions by 2050 target that accounts for carbon and methane emissions across both electric and gas operations. We achieved weather-normalized operating earnings that exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range for the 16th consecutive quarter. We further improved our credit metrics and successfully completed the restructuring of our operating segments. We introduced 2020 earnings guidance that represents a 5% year-over-year increase, consistent with previous messaging. We confirmed our earnings per share growth expectations of 5-plus percent post-2020, and we are making significant progress across our capital investment programs to the benefit of our customers. 
We will now be happy to answer your questions."

And that will, of course, imply an ROE, which folks can do the math on, but it's reflective of the expected rate for the anchor shippers. Now when you do calculate that ROE that's implied by that math, you'll get to a number that is reflective of the first full year of operation only, meaning, over time, as that project expands through laterals or compression or whatever, that's not reflected in that year 1 ROE, but the -- that will all flow from the input, which is a agreed upon customer rate and cost."

I would like to start by expressing our gratitude for the health care and other frontline professionals who are engaged in a heroic effort to assist those who have been most acutely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We salute their efforts with deep appreciation and express our sympathy to all those who have lost love ones to the disease. I also want to thank our own field personnel who are performing a vital public service by literally keeping the lights on and critical energy flowing. These frontline employees are supported by thousands and thousands of others who provide equally important service to our customers. As everyone who follows Dominion knows, the safety of our employees is paramount. As the pandemic began to emerge, we acted quickly to ensure that our employees were equipped to handle the impact of the virus. 
We have utilized our frequently drilled crisis response plans now continually supplemented by the most up-to-date health service and government recommendations. Our efforts include implementing appropriate social distancing policies and activating our remote connection infrastructure, which has enabled more than half of our workforce to operate remotely. We have followed best practices in the distribution and use of PPE. And we are extending health and paid time off benefits as well as establishing a financial assistance program for employees that provides grants up to $2,000 to employees in need. We've also donated $1 million to the American Red Cross and local nonprofits to assist directly with coronavirus relief. This is in addition to the millions of dollars we provide each year to customer assistance programs and charitable causes throughout our communities. This is the core value of one Dominion Energy in practice. While even a single case of COVID-19 is a serious concern. We have been fortunate that across more than 19,000 employees in 20 states of operation, we have had very few tests positive. The majority of which are either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and most of whom have already returned to work. We are keeping those employees in our thoughts, and we'll continue to be focused on the health and well-being of our entire workforce, while not losing sight of our essential duty to provide reliable and affordable energy. 
Our thoughts are also with our customers. We are mindful of the hardships many are enduring. That is why, for example, we voluntarily suspended nonpayment service disconnections and waived late fees across all our utility service territories. We will also offer our customers tools designed to assist them overcome the financial challenges they may be facing. As our state and regional economies gradually begin to reopen, we are taking preventative steps to ensure that our workplaces are safe, and that our customers receive the best possible customer service.

I'll first turn to Slide 4 to report that our quarterly operating earnings per share, when adjusted for normal -- first quarter 2020 operating earnings were $0.09 per share, which included a $0.09 hurt from significantly worse than normal",2385,"Thank you, Tom. I'll first turn to Slide 4 to report that our quarterly operating earnings per share, when adjusted for normal -- first quarter 2020 operating earnings were $0.09 per share, which included a $0.09 hurt from significantly worse than normal weather. This was the third warmest first quarter in Virginia on record. Weather-normalized results of $1.18 per share exceeded the guidance range midpoint. Recall that weather in the first quarter of last year was a $0.06 hurt. But during the following 3 quarters, we more than overcame that and finished the year with a total weather help of $0.02. Even without adjusting for weather, this was the 17th consecutive quarter of results within our guidance range. 
GAAP earnings for the quarter were negative $0.34 per share. This result is driven in part by a noncash charge related to the planned early retirement of certain coal and oil-fired generating units in Virginia, consistent with the requirements of the recently enacted Virginia Clean Economy Act. The retirement of these units has been contemplated in previous versions of our integrated resource plan and was formally announced in late March. We also had a noncash impact attributable to unrealized losses on our nuclear decommissioning trust funds. And as a reminder, we report such unrealized gains and losses on these funds as nonoperating. A summary of adjustments between operating and reported results is included in Schedule 2 of the earnings release kit. 
On Slide 5, we are initiating second quarter 2020 operating earnings guidance with a range of $0.75 to $0.85 per share. We are also affirming our annual guidance range of $4.25 to $4.60 per share. As usual, these ranges assume normal weather, variations from which could cause results to be toward the top or the bottom of these ranges. The second quarter and full year guidance ranges also reflect our preliminary expectations for the impacts of COVID on our financial results. 
Before I walk through each of our operating segments, let me address potential questions around our expectations for the shape and pace of the economic recovery. In affirming our annual guidance today, we have assumed that the economy begins to ramp up through late summer, though, as you will see momentarily, demand in Virginia, thus far, is positive relative to recent years despite the pandemic. Of course, variations in the duration and the severity of the economic recovery may ultimately impact our financial results more or less than our current forecast. The future is difficult to predict, which is why we are reiterating the demand related earnings sensitivities for our 2 electric utilities. We hope this is useful for our analysts and investors to synthesize their models to reflect their own perspectives on the shape of the economic recovery. 
In any case, just as we have since early March, we plan to provide periodic public updates on the various aspects of the crisis impact on our business. Including updates on load as we make our way through the economic reopening process, which will occur gradually, which began yesterday in South Carolina and is expected to begin in Virginia in 10 days. 
Now I'll address our businesses, starting with our largest segment, Dominion Energy Virginia. On Slide 6, we present updated load related data. This graph represents daily weather-normalized load in the PJM DOM Zone as compared to a 2-year historic weather-normalized average. As you can see, the impact of COVID on zonal demand has not changed materially since our prior disclosures, and Virginia load is continuing to prove extremely resilient. We attribute this to 4 factors, illustrated on Slide 7. First, residential usage, which typically accounts for around 45% of segment revenue. Last month, we saw year-over-year weather normal residential load increased by about 3%. As you can see, residential customers contribute more to revenue per unit of usage than our larger volume classes. Second, the proliferation of data centers in our service territory. Despite a statewide state home order, April weather-normalized commercial load decreased by only 3% as a result of COVID, mostly due to the stabilizing effect of data center demand growth. Third, limited industrial exposure, while we saw industrial demand decrease by around 3% in April, only 6% of DEV's revenue is attributable to industrial usage. And finally, government military and other demand, which accounts for 16% of revenue, which was up almost 4% year-over-year last month. 
Let me also point out a few aspects of our regulatory framework, which are important to consider as they relate to the financial impact of the COVID crisis. Around 40% of DEV's rate base is in rider form that allows for an annual true-up for changes in sales volumes. In addition, fuel pass-through related revenue is also adjusted annually to account for, among other factors, over or under recovery due to usage. While not observable in the load data we have shared, these 2 mitigants taken together account for half of DEVs operating revenue and represent effective decoupling from changes in load. We continue to monitor the situation closely. Based on observable data, we are not at present forecasting major COVID-driven revenue impacts associated with reduced load at Dominion Energy Virginia during the remainder of 2020. Of course, the situation is dynamic, and so we are reiterating 4-year reference of previously published rules of thumb for load variations by class. Accounting for nearly 45% of our operating earnings, DEV represents our largest state-regulated utility exposure to COVID-related demand fluctuations by far. 
Let me now turn to Slide 8 to walk through the same data for Dominion Energy South Carolina's electric operations. From the time the executive order took effect on March 31, we've seen a noticeable decline in weather normal demand as compared to the 2-year historic average. Specifically, April's electric demand was off almost 10% on a relative basis. While we expect increases in residential demand, our South Carolina operations when compared to Virginia, do not benefit from the same data center load stability and as demonstrated on Slide 9, are more exposed to industrial load. 10 of DESCs top 30 industrial manufacturing customers have temporarily idled at least some production. However, all the 2 of those 10 have communicated plans to restart production in the coming weeks. 
In Virginia, there are some structural mitigants to the load impact like in Virginia, there's some structural mitigants to the load impact on revenue in South Carolina. First, around 25% of DESC's total rate base is in rider form with monthly true-ups. Almost another 10% of rate base is attributable to South Carolina gas distribution operations that operate under regulation that shoes up annually. 
Finally, fuel pass-through related revenue for both electric and gas operations are adjusted annually to account for, among other factors, over or under recovery due to usage. While not observable in the load data we've shared, these 3 mitigants taken together account for nearly 50% of of DESC's operating revenues and represent effective decoupling from changes in load. 
Further, the impact of COVID on our South Carolina financial performance stands to be relatively less impactful financially, given Dominion Energy South Carolina's overall earnings contribution is approximately 10% of Dominion's forecasted operating earnings. The future is difficult to predict, but we currently expect that load trends will gradually rebound through the late summer. However, the situation is dynamic, and therefore, we are also reiterating our rules of thumb for variations in load class and load by class for DESC's electric operations. Please note that these sensitivities assume a full year 1% change in load. April alone represents only a small percentage of annualized load, given, first, it's typically the lowest sales level of any month. And of course, it's only 1 of 12 months of the year. I'll also note here that we voluntarily requested a 60-day delay to our upcoming South Carolina electric base rate proceeding. Per the merger agreement, this was originally expected to commence later this quarter and conclude with new rates effective January 2021. We feel strongly that this is the prudent approach to take. 
Let me turn to Slide 10 now to address our remaining segments, which I'll be able to cover more quickly. First, gas distribution, which accounts for around 15% of operating earnings. Over 80% of segment operating margin is protected through decoupling or fixed charges, including riders and gas pass-through mechanisms. These constructive rate structures significantly reduce the impact we expect to see from COVID-related demand fluctuations. I should also point out that we are entering a multi-month period of off-peak and shoulder demand seasons for gas distribution. 
Next, gas transmission and storage, which accounts for nearly 1/4 of operating earnings. A few points here. First, the typical contract structure is long-term and take-or-pay. With reservation or capacity charges, which are largely independent of utilization. Average remaining contract life is 6 to 7 years for existing pipelines in storage and much longer for Cove Point liquefaction and ACP. Second, this is a demand pull dominated segment. As we shared at Investor Day, approximately 80% of the revenues attributable to segment assets are derived from demand-driven counterparties, such as utilities. Third, counterparty credit quality is high, given the regulated utility SKU of the customer base, where shippers do not meet our stringent internal credit standards, we typically require higher than industry average protections, including collateral in the form of cash or letter of credit that often covers multiple years of exposure. 
And finally, Cove Point liquefaction contracts are take-or-pay and allow the shippers to deliver cargoes anywhere in the world not prohibited by U.S. policy. So customers are obligated to pay regardless of usage, I would note that through today, customers continue to nominate volumes that are at the plant's design capacity. And finally, contracted generation operates primarily under long-term PPA or hedge arrangements, which are unlikely to be materially impacted by the effects of COVID. Taking a step back now, we are also watching payment arrears data carefully across all of our segments. To date, we've seen modest increases, which are consistent with our expectations. That said, we will work carefully with our customers over the coming months to provide options and tools to maintain service and assist them in returning accounts to current. We do not expect bad debt expense in excess of budgeted amounts to be a material driver for the year, though not directly comparable. During the financial crisis, we saw annual bad debt expense at DEV, for instance, increased by around just $20 million. At our electric business, like most of our peers, bad debt is addressed during periodic base rate case proceedings. At nearly all of our gas utilities, we have full or partial ability to recover bad debt expense under real-time rate mechanisms, such as dedicated trackers or fuel pass-through adjustment clauses. While the impact of COVID on our financial results during the first quarter was muted, we are not assuming that this -- that, that will continue indefinitely. That is why we are redoubling our efforts to identify opportunities to reduce costs generally across our businesses as we look to be prepared to achieve our affirmed annual guidance range. While I'm not in a position today to quantify a total amount, a few straightforward examples would include reductions in business travel, office supply and operational fuel expenses. As well as the impact of implementing a hiring freeze. We will continue to monitor these and other O&M reduction options. 
Turning now to liquidity. As shown on Slide 11. As volatility in capital markets increased significantly in March, we moved quickly and opportunistically to enhance our liquidity position out of an abundance of caution. Over a period of around 15 days, we added nearly $5 billion of available or funded debt capital. 
On Slide 12, we update our annual financing plan for our year-to-date issuance. I'll note for the avoidance of doubt that as of today, there is no change to our long-term debt financing amounts, our external equity need of $300 million under our DRIP program or our CapEx guidance for the year. We have and we'll continue to look for -- at the potential to defer small amounts of capital investment where safety and reliability will not be compromised, but any such deferral would be relatively small and short-lived. We have not observed any major disruptions to any of our key supply chains. 
And finally, a few comments regarding our pension on Slide 13. We entered the year with a 92% funded status, up meaningfully from the previous year. While it's way too early to tell where we will land at year-end 2020 when we remeasure assets and liabilities, a few factors to consider. 
First, discount rates, which are based on long-term all-in corporate bond yields are around the same level as observed at the end of last year despite lower treasury rates. And second, at the end of January this year, we decided to hedge the equity exposure in our plant assets using the futures market. As public equities fell in March, we took advantage to monetize most of our hedge position at 25% and 30% in the money levels. We are beginning to reinvest those cash proceeds back into equity exposure. As a result, through April, planned assets are close to flat for the year, which compares favorably to the significant declines that may be expected for typical pension portfolios. I'll reiterate, there's a long way to go before the next expected remeasurement date of December 31. But regardless of where we end up for the year on funded status, we do not expect to need any pension plan contributions this year or next. 
Turning now to Slide 14 and in summary, we reported our 17th consecutive quarter of weather normal results at or above the midpoint of guidance. And our 17th consecutive quarter results within our guidance range. We feel that our businesses are well positioned with regard to COVID-related demand impacts, but we are monitoring the situation carefully. We affirmed our annual operating EPS range of $4.25 to $4.60 per share. And we are also affirming our post-2020 guidance of 5-plus percent annual operating EPS growth as well as our dividend per share growth of 2.5% per annum, subject as is customary to board approval. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Tom."

Amidst the turmoil of the global pandemic, our employees have been singularly focused on maintaining reliable and safe operations for the individuals and families.

Amidst the turmoil of the global pandemic, our employees have been singularly focused on maintaining reliable and safe operations for the individuals and families. Businesses, industries and government agencies that we are fortunate to count as customers. We are in the public service business, and our work directly impacts the lives of our customers and communities. Let me share 3 specific examples that occurred over just the last 6 weeks on the opposite sides of the country and shown on Slide 15. On the morning of March 18, the Salt Lake City Valley experienced largest earthquake to occur in that region in 30 years. The 5.7 magnitude event generated nearly 1,800 service calls and 1,400 gas distribution work orders, which were both over 20x normal. Our crews went to work immediately to address any potential safety issues to ensure reliable service to homes and businesses in the middle of the winter season. As a testament to the quality of our infrastructure, and as a result of the significant investments in integrity and pipeline replacement programs authorized by our regulators, we have found 0 material gas lakes across our system as a result of the earthquake. Less than 4 weeks later, on April 13, 21 tornadoes touched down in South Carolina. 4 of which were classified as EF3 strength which wents up to 165 miles per hour and 1 of which was classified as an E4 tornado with winds up to 200 miles per hour. It was the most prolific day of tornado activity in South Carolina in the last 35 years. Within 24 hours, our crews had restored 96% of the 117,000 of our customers at lost service during the storm. During the next 2 days, our people worked very long hours in devastated areas to finish restoring service and along the way, helping those communities find a measure of normalcy. In the aftermath of the storm, the South Carolina office of regulatory staff issued a press release commending the dedication and effort of the state's electrical personnel, men and women who worked tirelessly to ensure power systems were restored, even in the midst of a global pandemic. That same day, 300 miles Northeast, heavy rains and winds gusting to 70 miles per hour across Virginia and North Carolina, interrupted service to nearly 200,000 of our customers. Within 24 hours. 95% of customers have been restored by our crews with the final 5% reconnected over the following 12 hours. I'm proud, though not surprised, at the way in which our Dominion energy team members have responded on behalf of our customers throughout this trying time. 
Turning to safety, which is our first core value. Our first quarter safety results rank us #1 among our southeastern peer group and puts us on track for another year of record performance. Through the end of March, our OSHA recordable rate is approximately 1/2 that of the first quarter of last year. Also, 2 weeks ago, 7 of our gas infrastructure operating companies received awards from the AGA for superior safety performance. With the remainder of my prepared remarks, I will address the results of the Virginia General Assembly session and the status of the Atlantic Coast pipeline. The Virginia legislative session formally concluded last month. On April 11, Governor Northam signed in the law, the Virginia Clean Economy Act, or  VCEA, which complements the existing grid transformation and security Act adopted in 2018. That law established a comprehensive framework for utility regulation and investment in Virginia. 
As shown on Slide 16, the VCEA sets our company on a path of achieving the most significant legislatively mandated clean energy investment program in the United States. As a result, Virginia is poised to become a nationwide leader in 0 carbon deployment over the next 3 decades. This mandate will create thousands of jobs, support localities, bolster the Virginia economy, attractive businesses and families, improve the environment and serve as an example for other states seeking to achieve similarly ambitious sustainable energy goals. The plan also supports our enterprise-wide net 0 methane and carbon emissions targets by 2050. The the BCEA calls for and fines in the public interest, the development of renewable generation and energy storage resources as follows: 5,200 megawatts of offshore wind. 100% of which may be utility owned. 16,100 megawatts of solar or onshore wind, 65% of which may be utility out and 2,700 megawatts of energy storage, 65% of which may be utility owned. These targets are to be met over the next 15 years with additional goals by 2045. 
In addition to establishing a public interest determination for these programs, the law outlines specific regulatory approval criteria and affirms rider eligibility for each of those programs. I'll discuss them in turn. 
Regarding our previously announced 2,600-megawatt Coastal Virginia offshore wind project. The commission is required to presume costs are reasonable and prudent if the project meets 3 key tests, as shown on Slide 17. First, competitive procurement and solicitation standards for components are met. We have met this standard on our Virginia projects for many years. We have always sought to drive down costs while also balancing performance and reliability to optimize value for our customers. Second, the projected levelized cost of energy or LCOE is reasonable relative to a specific EIA benchmark. Our early estimates for project LCOE are of $80 to $90 per megawatt hour compared very favorably to this benchmark. This range does not include the benefit of any available federal tax incentives, which are working to preserve for the benefit of customers. And third, the project's construction commences prior to 2024 and or has a plan to enter service by 2028. 
Our project satisfies both milestones. We are pleased with the progress to date on both our pilot and full-scale deployments. Despite the pandemic, the primary pilot project components have arrived from Europe, as shown on the cover slide. And we expect installation to begin this quarter with commercial in service by year-end. We have also initiated the subsea survey work that will support the submission of our full-scale offshore construction and operation plan to bomb by the end of the year. We have joined in this work with the Virginia fishing industry. We continue to work with equipment manufacturers and service providers to encourage making Virginia the hub for the U.S. offshore wind industry. And we are leading a consortium of industry experts and participants. In the development of a fully Jones Act compliant installation vessel that will be equipped to handle all current turbine technologies as well as the next-generation turbine sizes of 12 megawatts and larger. These mega turbines result in fewer foundations and reduced construction and maintenance costs, thereby lowering the levelized cost of energy. 
The vessel, which will be funded by consortium participants, including Dominion Energy, we'll enter service in 2023 and operate continuously for several years under contracts with multiple major U.S. offshore wind developers. Based on our current estimates for fully installed costs, which we expect will reduce over time. Offshore wind, as directed by the VCEA represents between $8 billion and $17 billion of capital investment over the next 15 years. This range is consistent at the low end with our previously announced cost estimate for our 2,600 megawatt project. The high end represents an incremental opportunity associated with the laws direction to put an additional 2,600 megawatts into service by 2035. Accordingly, we are updating our 5-year growth capital estimate for this program by 1 year. The new outlook now totals $3.5 billion and reflects the ramp-up on our full-scale deployment in 2024. Our previously plan included only $1.1 billion. We plan to make an initial rider filing in 2022.
Next, solar and onshore wind, as shown on Slide 18. Given Virginia's relatively onshore wind resource, we expect that the vast majority of the laws mandate in this area will be met through a very significant expansion of the state's solar capacity. As I mentioned previously, the law calls for over 16,000 megawatts by 2036, 10,000 of which can be utility owned. In other words, Dominion will install, on average, nearly 700 megawatts of solar every year for each of the next 15 years. Today, we have achieved more than 70% of our previous commitment of at least 3,000 megawatts by 2022. In the first quarter, we had our third Solar Rider application approved by the Virginia Commission. Meeting the ambitious targets set by the VCEA will require a redoubling of effort in this area, and we have already begun to significantly increase our activities. In granting approval for solar and onshore wind as well as energy storage, the law directs the commission to give due consideration to quote the promotion of new renewable generation and associated economic development, projected fuel savings and the RPS standards of the law. Assuming 65% utility ownership is provided in the law, solar generation represents approximately $19 billion of capital investment over the next 15 years. 
Our roll forward 5-year growth capital forecast now totals $5.5 billion as we seek to accelerate investments to meet the laws milestones. Our prior estimate was $3.7 billion. 
Next, energy storage, which includes our existing efforts to develop a pumped storage facility in Southwestern Virginia. The commission recently approved 4 battery technology pilot projects totaling around $30 million in about 16 megawatts. In order to achieve the 2,700 megawatt target established by the law, we will be focused on a very aggressive effort in years to come. Assuming 65% utility ownership is provided in the law, energy storage represents approximately $7 billion of capital investment over the next 15 years. Our existing 5-year growth capital plan, which we are arising only modestly as we roll forward by 1 year, already included around $1 billion related to pump storage. 
On Slide 20, we show the impact of updating our 5-year growth capital estimates for just these 3 programs, which shows a $4 billion and over 70% increase. We are not updating existing 5-year CapEx figures for other programs or segments today. But we do not expect any material changes from our most recent guidance. We will look for an opportunity in the future to provide a comprehensive update across all segments. 
Looking longer-term on Slide 21. These 3 legislative priorities of wind, solar and energy storage, taken together, represent based on current cost estimates, somewhere between $34 billion and $43 billion of growth capital over the next 15 years, subject to regulatory approval. This is additive to the existing rider eligible investments, we will make this decade for electric transmission, nuclear relicensing, strategic undergrounding, grid modernization, and renewable enabling quick start generation. Together, these projects represent nearly $16 billion of growth capital, also subject to regulatory approval. To give these figures some context, Dominion Energy, Virginia's 2019 year-end rate base was around $24 billion. 
Turning to Slide 22. As reported in our recent integrated resource plan, we expect typical residential customer bills from 2019 through 2030, including authorized pass-throughs related to Virginia joining the regional greenhouse gas initiative to keep pace with average historic inflation. We expect fuel savings from increased dispatch of renewable generation to be a key customer benefit. Of course, we always work to maintain competitive and affordable rates, and we have a track record of success. As demonstrated by our current rates, which are below the state, regional and national averages. 
I would also note that our current typical customer bill is almost 40% lower than the average of Reggie participating states. We expect that our future rates will stay lower by a very wide margin compared to those states. Further, the VCEA expands on existing programs that are designed to direct funds to assist lower income customers. 
The proliferation of renewable but intermittent resources across our system will also require the continuation of our extensive investment in transmission infrastructure as solar generation sites emerge throughout the state. It will also require an increasingly modern grid, which is why the recent commission decision to reject certain, although certainly not all, aspects of our most recent grid transformation filing was disappointing for our company and particularly for our customers. We will continue to see comprehensive deployment of smart meters and other enhancements across our system, which will greatly improve the way we interact with customers as well as our ability to manage our increasingly 2-way energy delivery system. The VCEA and associated legislation will dramatically change our generation fuel mix over the years to come. What will not change is our obligation to customers to provide 24/7 energy with the least possible disruption. That is a message that has been clearly reinforced during the COVID pandemic. 
Technological, operational and economic constraints around the multi-day baseload dischargeability of existing battery technology, combined with the fact that sometimes in Virginia, at least the wind does not blow and the sun does not shine for extended durations, meaning days, not hours, ensures that natural gas-fired generation will continue to play a critical, low-emission role in our system for years and years to come. Those why our policymakers wisely included language in the VCEA in multiple places that provides Express consent to consider system reliability and energy security holistically before ruling out any low emitting fuel such as natural gas. This aligns with our unwavering commitment to be net 0 by 2050. What is clear, however, is that less efficient and higher emitting sources of electric generation such as coal and oil, will phase out of our system. To that end, we have taken steps since early 2019, including during this first quarter to retire more than 3,300 megawatts of mostly coal and oil fired power stations. Given recent changes in law, the commission is no longer mandated by statute to approve period expense treatment for these retirements. Period expensing is the best choice for customers and dictated by many years of existing commission precedent. 
During the triennial review under the framework established by the GTSA, if the commission determines that we have excess earnings, either because they determined to overrule existing precedent and amortized plant retirement charges over a longer period of time or because our financial performance otherwise warrants such determination, we will offset those excess earnings using dollar-for-dollar customer credit reinvestment offsets or CCROs, including our $300 million offshore wind pilot project investment. Only if we are unable to fully offset excess earnings with CCROs, would the commission be authorized to order a onetime customer refund and reduced rates by no more than $50 million through the following Triennial review, which will conclude in late 2024. 
Now to the Atlantic Coast pipeline and supply header. On Slide 23, we summarize the status of select project permits. First, the Appalachian Trail crossing. On February 24, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments on the case. We expect the court to rule in ACP's favor in the coming weeks. Such a ruling would restore the authorization of the project to proceed along the existing route. Despite the pandemic, the court continues to meet telephonically and release orders on cases heard earlier in the term. Next, the biological opinion. Progress continues despite COVID as we provide information that is responsive to requests from both FERC and the fish and wildlife service. We expect the authorization to be reissued by the end of this quarter. That period would mark nearly a 12 -- a full 12 months since the court invalidated the prior version in July 2019. Demonstrating the rigor with which the permitting agencies are approaching resolution of the concerns identified by the court. In the case of the air permit for Buckingham Compressor Station, we have already begun to submit additional data and analysis to the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, which we believe provides ample justification for the original air board decision to approve the strictest minor Source air permit in donation and addresses all of the concerns voiced by the court. We expect the permit to be reissued by year-end. 
Finally, with regard to the nationwide Permit 12, which is issued for the project by the United States Army of engineers, we had expected the permits to be reissued shortly after the issuance of the biological opinion as the core in recent months has taken steps that address the 4 circuits concerns. The recent decision related to the Keystone pipeline by the District court in Montana has potential implications for nearly all critical infrastructure investment and associated employment across the country. This includes the provision of drinking water. Electricity and fuel, Internet, radio, television, telephone and other communications and stands to impact service to the public, governments, defense installations, hospitals, schools and other businesses and industry. Since the nationwide Permit 12 program, which renewed in March of 2017, it has been used more than 38,000 times. And the court estimates that it has over 5,000 additional notifications awaiting action. The Department of Justice has sought and been granted expedited consideration for their motion for partial stay, pending appeal. With all replies due by this Friday. We expect a focused effort across the industry, commerce and labor groups as well as the Department of Justice to clarify and resolve the issue in a timely manner. With regard to ACP, we believe it is too early to tell what, if any, impact this ruling will have on the existing and timing and cost of the project, which are otherwise affirming today. So many issues revolved in a timely manner, we can maintain the existing schedule and cost estimates, so long as we can take advantage of the November 2020 through March 2021 tree filling season. 
We will continue to monitor and provide communication to investors as appropriate. Based on these expectations, we remain confident in the successful completion of the project and note that there are no changes to the financial contribution estimates for 2020 and beyond that Jim provided on our fourth quarter earnings call. Customers need this infrastructure now more than ever to ensure the reliability of energy supply. 
Accordingly, we have recently finalized negotiations with the major customers to provide a fair rate of return for the project owners and appropriately balanced project costs among the parties. Further, we remain confident in Virginia regulatory approval, the prudency of capacity contracts as part of Dominion Energy's fuel filing cases as the project Nears operation. Legislation that passed during the recent Virginia General assembly session established a fuel case review criteria that recognize the importance of energy reliability and largely mirrors the standard for prudency already employed by the commission. With that, I will summarize today's call as follows: our safety performance is on track to set a new company record for the lowest OSHA recordable rate. We achieved weather-normalized operating earnings that exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range for the 17th consecutive quarter. We affirmed our 2020 earnings guidance. We confirmed our EPS growth expectations apply plus percent post 2020. We are excited about the opportunities under recently enacted legislation in Virginia to increase the sustainability of our generation fleet, which will also be supportive of our corporate-wide net 0 carbon and methane emissions by 2050 commitment. And we are making significant progress across all of our capital investment programs to the benefit of our customers. We will now be happy to answer your questions."

So like, I guess, the takeaway and correct me if I'm wrong, if the plan is becoming much more sustainable, much more -- you'll be able to fine-tune that 5-plus percent growth rate in time. 
Yes. Keeping in mind, when we set the 5% plus growth rate, when we announced that last March, we had in our minds that this kind of spending program is going to continue or maybe even increase in Virginia and elsewhere. But that's right. We'll come back and address something more holistically when we're not kind of in the midst of a global pandemic. We didn't think this is the right time. 
Got it. Got it. Agreed there, by the way. So just a real quick last question on ACP. You kind of stated timely resolution to the nationwide 12 permit, right? Is there any more color you can provide on this? I mean, when would you start to reevaluate the timing of the resolution was pushed to a later part of the year. And then, Tom, can you just maybe elaborate a little bit more on your latest contract negotiations with customers. What's been sort of the debate? Is it -- or what's been sort of the push pull? Or is it more of a focus on COVID, and that's been a bit of a slowdown. So just maybe a little bit more elaboration on the negotiations, and I'll jump back in the queue."

We need 10 weeks or so of tree cutting period, 10, 12 weeks to complete what we need to -- you need to keep in mind. We already have 250 miles of trees cut on this 600-mile pipeline, and not every single mile has on it. Actually hundreds of miles do not. So that's the real key for us is getting into that tree cutting season. So we'll see what happens. A lot of people were quite surprised by the judge's decision. And there's a lot of -- I think you should expect to see a lot of a mickey briefs being filed. Pointing out is -- I mean, what he talked about was all forms of utility infrastructure, not just an oil pipeline in Montana. It was every single utility infrastructure program in the country. So it seems like maybe a strong action by the judge, maybe not completely justified by the case before. So we'll have to just have to see how that goes. Of course, you can go to the night circuit after that, things -- but we'll judge that as it goes along. On the second part of your question, I'll turn it over to Diane Leopold."

I would note, though, for the avoidance of doubt that for these programs, we've talked about under the VCEA, all the financing will be at DEV, so legal entity.

We're always off here for our state legislature, both in the Senate and the house of delegates. And for the first time, it's either 20 or 30 years, I don't remember which -- how many decades. You had democratic party in charge of both houses plus the executive branch. And there was a lot of interest among the new members of the House and Senate. To advance a number of policies on many fronts, not just in energy. There was all sorts of legislation around gun rights, for example, and a variety of other things, minimum wage, et cetera. And there had been an effort -- we had worked for years with a number of groups to -- on solar in particular, and how to make sure that, that came into Virginia in an efficient, cost-effective way. And we worked with a wide variety of the policymakers to ensure that these goals are achievable and still affordable. For our customers. And you can see from our IRP that was filed last week, that we expect, even with this spending plan, our plan B under the IRP is the most likely plan, at least we think it is, the most likely plan. Others will weigh in, of course, we'll run at a little bit -- right around traditional rates of inflation. And we've joined Regi in our rates. Well, when you now compare our rates to the regi states sates, we're 40% lower than the average regi state, where half of the highest regi state. And so there's a lot of room in there for us to stay extremely competitive. So Steve, I think overall, from a big picture, view.

So this financing cost for the year is something we're watching pretty closely. And I don't have a specific number for you, but a little bit of color. Obviously, we raised $5 billion earlier than we otherwise would have some of that short-term debt. But some of that just replaces what already would have been in our plan commercial paper. And as 1 example, 1 of those short-term financings, 1 year financings that come to mind that we did in that period was at LIBOR plus 50 with no fees. So kind of not too far off where CP would have been anyway. So not a big driver. And now as you look forward from here, the markets have recovered in dramatic fashion, as you know, the fixed income market. And the issuance rates from here on out for the next 3 quarters the way it looks right now is they're even lower all-in than they were in January.

So while there is in the Nationwide 12, you do not need to have that for hand selling of trees. It is not a regulated activity under the Army core Nationwide 12 Permit. So subject to FERC approval, we may be able to begin hand felling trees through the season. We would look to have to have that for full ramping up of linear construction."

I would like to start by expressing our gratitude for the health care and other frontline professionals who are engaged in a heroic effort to assist those who have been most acutely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We salute their efforts with deep appreciation and express our sympathy to all those who have lost loved ones to the disease. I also want to thank our own field personnel who are performing a vital public service by literally keeping the lights on and critical energy flowing. These frontline employees are supported by thousands and thousands of others who provide equally important service to our customers. As everyone who follows Dominion knows, the safety of our employees is paramount. As the pandemic began to emerge, we acted quickly to ensure that our employees were equipped to handle the impact of the virus.  
We have utilized our frequently drilled crisis response plans now continually supplemented by the most up-to-date health service and government recommendations. Our efforts include implementing appropriate social distancing policies and activating our remote connection infrastructure, which has enabled more than half of our workforce to operate remotely. We have followed best practices in the distribution and use of PPE. And we are extending health and paid time off benefits as well as establishing a financial assistance program for employees that provides grants up to $2,000 to employees in need. We've also donated $1 million to the American Red Cross and local nonprofits to assist directly with coronavirus relief. This is in addition to the millions of dollars we provide each year to customer assistance programs and charitable causes throughout our communities. This is the core value of one Dominion Energy in practice. While even a single case of COVID-19 is a serious concern, we have been fortunate that across more than 19,000 employees in 20 states of operation, we have had very few tests positive. The majority of which are either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and most of whom have already returned to work. We are keeping those employees in our thoughts, and we'll continue to be focused on the health and well-being of our entire workforce, while not losing sight of our essential duty to provide reliable and affordable energy.  
Our thoughts are also with our customers. We are mindful of the hardships many are enduring. That is why, for example, we voluntarily suspended nonpayment service disconnections and waived late fees across all our utility service territories. We will also offer our customers tools designed to assist them overcome the financial challenges they may be facing. As our state and regional economies gradually begin to reopen, we are taking preventative steps to ensure that our workplaces are safe, and that our customers receive the best possible customer service.  
I'll now turn the call over to Jim to review our quarterly results as well as our thoughts on COVID-related impacts."
267105,662598356,1970880,"Dominion Energy, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 05, 2020",2020-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tom. I'll first turn to Slide 4 to report that our quarterly operating earnings per share, when adjusted for normal weather met or exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range for the 17th consecutive quarter. Our first quarter 2020 operating ea",2401,"Thank you, Tom. I'll first turn to Slide 4 to report that our quarterly operating earnings per share, when adjusted for normal weather met or exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range for the 17th consecutive quarter. Our first quarter 2020 operating earnings were $1.09 per share, which included a $0.09 hurt from significantly worse than normal weather. This was the third warmest first quarter in Virginia on record. Weather-normalized results of $1.18 per share exceeded the guidance range midpoint. Recall that weather in the first quarter of last year was a $0.06 hurt. But during the following 3 quarters, we more than overcame that and finished the year with a total weather help of $0.02. Even without adjusting for weather, this was the 17th consecutive quarter of results within our guidance range.  
GAAP earnings for the quarter were negative $0.34 per share. This result is driven in part by a noncash charge related to the planned early retirement of certain coal and oil-fired generating units in Virginia, consistent with the requirements of the recently enacted Virginia Clean Economy Act. The retirement of these units has been contemplated in previous versions of our integrated resource plan and was formally announced in late March. We also had a noncash impact attributable to unrealized losses on our nuclear decommissioning trust funds. And as a reminder, we report such unrealized gains and losses on these funds as nonoperating. A summary of adjustments between operating and reported results is included in Schedule 2 of the earnings release kit.  
On Slide 5, we are initiating second quarter 2020 operating earnings guidance with a range of $0.75 to $0.85 per share. We are also affirming our annual guidance range of $4.25 to $4.60 per share. As usual, these ranges assume normal weather, variations from which could cause results to be toward the top or the bottom of these ranges. The second quarter and full year guidance ranges also reflect our preliminary expectations for the impacts of COVID on our financial results.  
Before I walk through each of our operating segments, let me address potential questions around our expectations for the shape and pace of the economic recovery. In affirming our annual guidance today, we have assumed that the economy begins to ramp up through late summer, though, as you will see momentarily, demand in Virginia, thus far, is positive relative to recent years despite the pandemic. Of course, variations in the duration and the severity of the economic recovery may ultimately impact our financial results more or less than our current forecast. The future is difficult to predict, which is why we are reiterating the demand related earnings sensitivities for our 2 electric utilities. We hope this is useful for our analysts and investors to sensitize their models to reflect their own perspectives on the shape of the economic recovery.  
In any case, just as we have since early March, we plan to provide periodic public updates on the various aspects of the crisis impact on our business, including updates on load as we make our way through the economic reopening process, which will occur gradually -- which began yesterday in South Carolina and is expected to begin in Virginia in 10 days.  
Now I'll address our businesses, starting with our largest segment, Dominion Energy Virginia. 
On Slide 6, we present updated load related data. This graph represents daily weather-normalized load in the PJM DOM Zone as compared to a 2-year historic weather-normalized average. As you can see, the impact of COVID on zonal demand has not changed materially since our prior disclosures, and Virginia load is continuing to prove extremely resilient. 
We attribute this to 4 factors, illustrated on Slide 7. First, residential usage, which typically accounts for around 45% of segment revenue. Last month, we saw year-over-year weather normal residential load increase by about 3%. As you can see, residential customers contribute more to revenue per unit of usage than our larger volume classes. Second, the proliferation of data centers in our service territory. Despite a statewide stay-at-home order, April weather-normalized commercial load decreased by only 3% as a result of COVID, mostly due to the stabilizing effect of data center demand growth. Third, limited industrial exposure, while we saw industrial demand decrease by around 3% in April, only 6% of DEV's revenue is attributable to industrial usage. And finally, government, military and other demand, which accounts for 16% of revenue and -- which was up almost 4% year-over-year last month.  
Let me also point out a few aspects of our regulatory framework, which are important to consider as they relate to the financial impact of the COVID crisis. Around 40% of DEV's rate base is in rider form that allows for an annual true-up for changes in sales volumes. In addition, fuel pass-through related revenue is also adjusted annually to account for, among other factors, over or under recovery due to usage. While not observable in the load data we have shared, these 2 mitigants taken together account for half of DEVs operating revenue and represent effective decoupling from changes in load. We continue to monitor the situation closely. Based on observable data, we are not at present forecasting major COVID-driven revenue impacts associated with reduced load at Dominion Energy Virginia during the remainder of 2020. Of course, the situation is dynamic, and so we are reiterating 4-year reference of previously published rules of thumb for load variations by class. Accounting for nearly 45% of our operating earnings, DEV represents our largest state-regulated utility exposure to COVID-related demand fluctuations by far.  
Let me now turn to Slide 8 to walk through the same data for Dominion Energy South Carolina's electric operations. From the time the executive order took effect on March 31, we've seen a noticeable decline in weather normal demand as compared to the 2-year historic average. Specifically, April's electric demand was off almost 10% on a relative basis. While we expect increases in residential demand, our South Carolina operations when compared to Virginia, do not benefit from the same data center load stability and as demonstrated on Slide 9, are more exposed to industrial load. 10 of DESCs top 30 industrial manufacturing customers have temporarily idled at least some production. However, all but 2 of those 10 have communicated plans to restart production in the coming weeks.  
In Virginia, there are some structural mitigants to the load impact -- like in Virginia, there's some structural mitigants to the load impact on revenue in South Carolina. First, around 25% of DESC's total rate base is in rider form with monthly true-ups. Almost another 10% of rate base is attributable to South Carolina gas distribution operations that operate under regulation that shoes up annually.  
Finally, fuel pass-through related revenue for both electric and gas operations are adjusted annually to account for, among other factors, over or under recovery due to usage. While not observable in the load data we've shared, these 3 mitigants taken together account for nearly 50% of DESC's operating revenues and represent effective decoupling from changes in load.  
Further, the impact of COVID on our South Carolina financial performance stands to be relatively less impactful financially, given Dominion Energy South Carolina's overall earnings contribution is approximately 10% of Dominion's forecasted operating earnings. The future is difficult to predict, but we currently expect that load trends will gradually rebound through the late summer. However, the situation is dynamic, and therefore, we are also reiterating our rules of thumb for variations in load class and load by class for DESC's electric operations. Please note that these sensitivities assume a full year 1% change in load. April alone represents only a small percentage of annualized load, given, first, it's typically the lowest sales level of any month. And of course, it's only 1 of 12 months of the year. I'll also note here that we voluntarily requested a 60-day delay to our upcoming South Carolina electric base rate proceeding. Per the merger agreement, this was originally expected to commence later this quarter and conclude with new rates effective January 2021. We feel strongly that this is the prudent approach to take.  
Let me turn to Slide 10 now to address our remaining segments, which I'll be able to cover more quickly. First, gas distribution, which accounts for around 15% of operating earnings. Over 80% of segment operating margin is protected through decoupling or fixed charges, including riders and gas pass-through mechanisms. These constructive rate structures significantly reduce the impact we expect to see from COVID-related demand fluctuations. I should also point out that we are entering a multi-month period of off-peak and shoulder demand seasons for gas distribution.  
Next, gas transmission and storage, which accounts for nearly 1/4 of operating earnings. A few points here. First, the typical contract structure is long-term and take-or-pay. With reservation or capacity charges, which are largely independent of utilization. Average remaining contract life is 6 to 7 years for existing pipelines in storage and much longer for Cove Point Liquefaction and ACP. Second, this is a demand pull dominated segment. As we shared at Investor Day, approximately 80% of the revenues attributable to segment assets are derived from demand-driven counterparties, such as utilities. Third, counterparty credit quality is high, given the regulated utility SKU of the customer base, where shippers do not meet our stringent internal credit standards, we typically require higher than industry average protections, including collateral in the form of cash or letter of credit that often covers multiple years of exposure.  
And finally, Cove Point Liquefaction contracts are take-or-pay and allow the shippers to deliver cargoes anywhere in the world not prohibited by U.S. policy. So customers are obligated to pay regardless of usage, I would note that through today, customers continue to nominate volumes that are at the plant's design capacity. And finally, contracted generation operates primarily under long-term PPA or hedge arrangements, which are unlikely to be materially impacted by the effects of COVID. Taking a step back now, we are also watching payment arrears data carefully across all of our segments. To date, we've seen modest increases, which are consistent with our expectations. That said, we will work carefully with our customers over the coming months to provide options and tools to maintain service and assist them in returning accounts to current. 
We do not expect bad debt expense in excess of budgeted amounts to be a material driver for the year, though not directly comparable. During the financial crisis, we saw annual bad debt expense at DEV, for instance, increase by around just $20 million. At our electric business, like most of our peers, bad debt is addressed during periodic base rate case proceedings. At nearly all of our gas utilities, we have full or partial ability to recover bad debt expense under real-time rate mechanisms, such as dedicated trackers or fuel pass-through adjustment clauses. While the impact of COVID on our financial results during the first quarter was muted, we are not assuming that this -- that, that will continue indefinitely. That is why we are redoubling our efforts to identify opportunities to reduce costs generally across our businesses as we look to be prepared to achieve our affirmed annual guidance range. While I'm not in a position today to quantify a total amount, a few straightforward examples would include reductions in business travel, office supply and operational fuel expenses. As well as the impact of implementing a hiring freeze. We will continue to monitor these and other O&M reduction options.  
Turning now to liquidity as shown on Slide 11. As volatility in capital markets increased significantly in March, we moved quickly and opportunistically to enhance our liquidity position out of an abundance of caution. Over a period of around 15 days, we added nearly $5 billion of available or funded debt capital.  
On Slide 12, we update our annual financing plan for our year-to-date issuance. I'll note for the avoidance of doubt that as of today, there is no change to our long-term debt financing amounts, our external equity need of $300 million under our DRIP program or our CapEx guidance for the year. We have and we'll continue to look for -- at the potential to defer small amounts of capital investment where safety and reliability will not be compromised, but any such deferral would be relatively small and short-lived. We have not observed any major disruptions to any of our key supply chains.  
And finally, a few comments regarding our pension on Slide 13. We entered the year with a 92% funded status, up meaningfully from the previous year. While it's way too early to tell where we will land at year-end 2020 when we remeasure assets and liabilities, a few factors to consider.  
First, discount rates, which are based on long-term all-in corporate bond yields are around the same levels observed at the end of last year despite lower treasury rates. And second, at the end of January this year, we decided to hedge the equity exposure in our plan assets using the futures market. As public equities fell in March, we took advantage to monetize most of our hedge position at 25% and 30% in the money levels. We are beginning to reinvest those cash proceeds back into equity exposure. As a result, through April, plan assets are close to flat for the year, which compares favorably to the significant declines that may be expected for typical pension portfolios. I'll reiterate, there's a long way to go before the next expected remeasurement date of December 31. But regardless of where we end up for the year on funded status, we do not expect to need any pension plan contributions this year or next.  
Turning now to Slide 14 and in summary, we reported our 17th consecutive quarter of weather normal results at or above the midpoint of guidance. And our 17th consecutive quarter results within our guidance range. We feel that our businesses are well positioned with regard to COVID-related demand impacts, but we are monitoring the situation carefully. We affirmed our annual operating EPS range of $4.25 to $4.60 per share. And we are also affirming our post-2020 guidance of 5-plus percent annual operating EPS growth as well as our dividend per share growth of 2.5% per annum, subject as is customary to board approval.  
I'll now turn the call back over to Tom."

Amidst the turmoil of the global pandemic, our employees have been singularly focused on maintaining reliable and safe operations for the individuals and families, businesses, industries and government agencies that we are fortunate to count",3224,"Thanks, Jim. Amidst the turmoil of the global pandemic, our employees have been singularly focused on maintaining reliable and safe operations for the individuals and families, businesses, industries and government agencies that we are fortunate to count as customers. We are in the public service business, and our work directly impacts the lives of our customers and communities. Let me share 3 specific examples that occurred over just the last 6 weeks on the opposite sides of the country and shown on Slide 15. On the morning of March 18, the Salt Lake City Valley experienced largest earthquake to occur in that region in 30 years. The 5.7 magnitude event generated nearly 1,800 service calls and 1,400 gas distribution work orders, which were both over 20x normal. Our crews went to work immediately to address any potential safety issues to ensure reliable service to homes and businesses in the middle of the winter season. As a testament to the quality of our infrastructure, and as a result of the significant investments in integrity and pipeline replacement programs authorized by our regulators, we have found 0 material gas lakes across our system as a result of the earthquake. 
Less than 4 weeks later, on April 13, 21 tornadoes touched down in South Carolina. 4 of which were classified as EF3 strength which winds up to 165 miles per hour and 1 of which was classified as an E4 tornado with winds up to 200 miles per hour. It was the most prolific day of tornado activity in South Carolina in the last 35 years. Within 24 hours, our crews had restored 96% of the 117,000 of our customers that lost service during the storm. During the next 2 days, our people worked very long hours in devastated areas to finish restoring service and along the way, helping those communities find a measure of normalcy. In the aftermath of the storm, the South Carolina office of regulatory staff issued a press release commending the dedication and effort of the state's electrical personnel, men and women who worked tirelessly to ensure power systems were restored, even in the midst of a global pandemic. 
That same day, 300 miles Northeast, heavy rains and winds gusting to 70 miles per hour across Virginia and North Carolina, interrupted service to nearly 200,000 of our customers. Within 24 hours, 95% of customers have been restored by our crews with the final 5% reconnected over the following 12 hours. I'm proud, though not surprised, at the way in which our Dominion energy team members have responded on behalf of our customers throughout this trying time.  
Turning to safety, which is our first core value. Our first quarter safety results rank us #1 among our southeastern peer group and puts us on track for another year of record performance. Through the end of March, our OSHA recordable rate is approximately 1/2 that of the first quarter of last year. Also, 2 weeks ago, 7 of our gas infrastructure operating companies received awards from the AGA for superior safety performance. 
For the remainder of my prepared remarks, I will address the results of the Virginia general assembly session and the status of the Atlantic Coast pipeline. The Virginia legislative session formally concluded last month. On April 11, Governor, Northam signed in the law, the Virginia Clean Economy Act or VCEA, which complements the existing Grid Transformation and Security Act adopted in 2018. That law established a comprehensive framework for utility regulation and investment in Virginia.  
As shown on Slide 16, the VCEA sets our company on a path of achieving the most significant legislatively mandated clean energy investment program in the United States. As a result, Virginia is poised to become a nationwide leader in 0 carbon deployment over the next 3 decades. This mandate will create thousands of jobs, support localities, bolster the Virginia economy, attract businesses and families, improve the environment and serve as an example for other states seeking to achieve similarly ambitious sustainable energy goals. The plan also supports our enterprise-wide net 0 methane and carbon emissions targets by 2050. The VCEA calls for and finds in the public interest, the development of renewable generation and energy storage resources as follows: 5,200 megawatts of offshore wind, 100% of which may be utility owned. 16,100 megawatts of solar or onshore wind, 65% of which may be utility owned and 2,700 megawatts of energy storage, 65% of which may be utility owned. These targets are to be met over the next 15 years with additional goals by 2045.  
In addition to establishing a public interest determination for these programs, the law outlines specific regulatory approval criteria and affirms rider eligibility for each of those programs. I'll discuss them in turn.  
Regarding our previously announced 2,600-megawatt Coastal Virginia offshore wind project. The commission is required to presume costs are reasonable and prudent if the project meets 3 key tests, as shown on Slide 17. First, competitive procurement and solicitation standards for components are met. We have met this standard on our Virginia projects for many years. We have always sought to drive down costs while also balancing performance and reliability to optimize value for our customers. Second, the projected Levelized Cost of Energy or LCOE is reasonable relative to a specific EIA benchmark. Our early estimates for project LCOE are of $80 to $90 per megawatt hour compared very favorably to this benchmark. This range does not include the benefit of any available federal tax incentives, which are working to preserve for the benefit of customers. And third, the project's construction commences prior to 2024 and or has a plan to enter service by 2028.  Our project satisfies both milestones. 
We are pleased with the progress to date on both our pilot and full-scale deployments. Despite the pandemic, the primary pilot project components have arrived from Europe, as shown on the cover slide. And we expect installation to begin this quarter with commercial in service by year-end. We have also initiated the subsea survey work that will support the submission of our full-scale offshore construction and operation plan to bomb by the end of the year. We are joined in this work with the Virginia fishing industry. We continue to work with equipment manufacturers and service providers to encourage making Virginia the hub for the U.S. offshore wind industry. And we are leading a consortium of industry experts and participants in the development of a fully Jones Act compliant installation vessel that will be equipped to handle all current turbine technologies as well as the next-generation turbine sizes of 12 megawatts and larger. These mega turbines result in fewer foundations and reduced construction and maintenance costs, thereby lowering the Levelized Cost of Energy.  
The vessel, which will be funded by consortium participants, including Dominion Energy will enter service in 2023 and operate continuously for several years under contracts with multiple major U.S. offshore wind developers. Based on our current estimates for fully installed costs, which we expect will reduce over time. Offshore wind, as directed by the VCEA represents between $8 billion and $17 billion of capital investment over the next 15 years. This range is consistent at the low end with our previously announced cost estimate for our 2,600 megawatt project. The high end represents an incremental opportunity associated with the laws direction to put an additional 2,600 megawatts into service by 2035. Accordingly, we are updating our 5-year growth capital estimate for this program by 1 year. The new outlook now totals $3.5 billion and reflects the ramp-up on our full-scale deployment in 2024.  Our previously plan included only $1.1 billion. We plan to make an initial rider filing in 2022.
Next, solar and onshore wind, as shown on Slide 18. Given Virginia's relatively onshore wind resource, we expect that the vast majority of the laws mandate in this area will be met through a very significant expansion of the state's solar capacity. As I mentioned previously, the law calls for over 16,000 megawatts by 2036, 10,000 of which can be utility owned. In other words, Dominion will install, on average, nearly 700 megawatts of solar every year for each of the next 15 years. To-date, we have achieved more than 70% of our previous commitment of at least 3,000 megawatts by 2022. In the first quarter, we had our third solar rider application approved by the Virginia Commission. Meeting the ambitious targets set by the VCEA will require a redoubling of effort in this area, and we have already begun to significantly increase our activities. In granting approval for solar and onshore wind as well as energy storage, the law directs the commission to give due consideration to quote the promotion of new renewable generation and associated economic development, projected fuel savings and the RPS standards of the law. Assuming 65% utility ownership is provided in the law, solar generation represents approximately $19 billion of capital investment over the next 15 years. Our roll forward 5-year growth capital forecast now totals $5.5 billion as we seek to accelerate investments to meet the laws milestones. Our prior estimate was $3.7 billion. 
Next, energy storage, which includes our existing efforts to develop a pumped storage facility in Southwestern Virginia. The commission recently approved 4 battery technology pilot projects totaling around $30 million and about 16 megawatts. In order to achieve the 2,700 megawatt target established by the law, we will be focused on a very aggressive effort in years to come. Assuming 65% utility ownership is provided in the law, energy storage represents approximately $7 billion of capital investment over the next 15 years. Our existing 5-year growth capital plan, which we are arising only modestly as we roll forward by 1 year, already included around $1 billion related to pumped storage. 
On Slide 20, we show the impact of updating our 5-year growth capital estimates for just these 3 programs, which shows a $4 billion and over 70% increase. We are not updating existing 5-year CapEx figures for other programs or segments today. But we do not expect any material changes from our most recent guidance. We will look for an opportunity in the future to provide a comprehensive update across all segments. 
Looking longer-term on Slide 21. These 3 legislative priorities of wind, solar and energy storage, taken together, represent based on current cost estimates, somewhere between $34 billion and $43 billion of growth capital over the next 15 years, subject to regulatory approval. This is additive to the existing rider eligible investments, we will make this decade for electric transmission, nuclear relicensing, strategic undergrounding, grid modernization, and renewable enabling quick start generation. Together, these projects represent nearly $16 billion of growth capital, also subject to regulatory approval. To give these figures some context, Dominion Energy, Virginia's 2019 year-end rate base was around $24 billion. 
Turning to Slide 22. As reported in our recent integrated resource plan, we expect typical residential customer bills from 2019 through 2030, including authorized pass-throughs related to Virginia joining the regional greenhouse gas initiative to keep pace with average historic inflation. We expect fuel savings from increased dispatch of renewable generation to be a key customer benefit. Of course, we always work to maintain competitive and affordable rates, and we have a track record of success. As demonstrated by our current rates, which are below the state, regional and national averages. 
I would also note that our current typical customer bill is almost 40% lower than the average of RGGI participating states. We expect that our future rates will stay lower by a very wide margin compared to those states. Further, the VCEA expands on existing programs that are designed to direct funds to assist lower income customers. 
The proliferation of renewable but intermittent resources across our system will also require the continuation of our extensive investment in transmission infrastructure as solar generation sites emerge throughout the state. It will also require an increasingly modern grid, which is why the recent commission decision to reject certain, although certainly not all, aspects of our most recent grid transformation filing was disappointing for our company and particularly for our customers. We will continue to see comprehensive deployment of smart meters and other enhancements across our system, which will greatly improve the way we interact with customers as well as our ability to manage our increasingly 2-way energy delivery system. The VCEA and associated legislation will dramatically change our generation fuel mix over the years to come. What will not change is our obligation to customers to provide 24/7 energy with the least possible disruption. That is a message that has been clearly reinforced during the COVID pandemic. 
Technological, operational and economic constraints around the multi-day baseload dischargeability of existing battery technology, combined with the fact that sometimes in Virginia, at least the wind does not blow and the sun does not shine for extended durations, meaning days, not hours, ensures that natural gas-fired generation will continue to play a critical, low-emission role in our system for years and years to come. That's why our policymakers wisely included language in the VCEA in multiple places that provides express consent to consider system reliability and energy security holistically before ruling out any low emitting fuel such as natural gas. This aligns with our unwavering commitment to be net 0 by 2050. What is clear, however, is that less efficient and higher emitting sources of electric generation such as coal and oil, will phase out of our system. To that end, we have taken steps since early 2019, including during this first quarter to retire more than 3,300 megawatts of mostly coal and oil fired power stations. Given recent changes in law, the commission is no longer mandated by statute to approve period expense treatment for these retirements. Period expensing is the best choice for customers and dictated by many years of existing commission precedent. 
During the triennial review under the framework established by the GTSA, if the commission determines that we have excess earnings, either because they determine to overrule existing precedent and amortized plant retirement charges over a longer period of time or because our financial performance otherwise warrants such determination, we will offset those excess earnings using dollar-for-dollar customer credit reinvestment offsets or CCROs, including our $300 million offshore wind pilot project investment. Only if we are unable to fully offset excess earnings with CCROs, would the commission be authorized to order a onetime customer refund and reduce rates by no more than $50 million through the following triennial review, which will conclude in late 2024. 
Now to the Atlantic Coast pipeline and supply header. On Slide 23, we summarize the status of select project permits. First, the Appalachian Trail crossing. On February 24, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments on the case. We expect the court to rule in ACP's favor in the coming weeks. Such a ruling would restore the authorization of the project to proceed along the existing route. Despite the pandemic, the court continues to meet telephonically and release orders on cases heard earlier in the term. 
Next, the biological opinion. Progress continues despite COVID as we provide information that is responsive to requests from both FERC and the fish and wildlife service. We expect the authorization to be reissued by the end of this quarter. That period would mark nearly a 12 -- a full 12 months since the court invalidated the prior version in July 2019. Demonstrating the rigor with which the permitting agencies are approaching resolution of the concerns identified by the court. 
In the case of the air permit for Buckingham Compressor Station, we have already begun to submit additional data and analysis to the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, which we believe provides ample justification for the original Air Board decision to approve the strictest minor source air permit in the nation and addresses all of the concerns voiced by the court. We expect the permit to be reissued by year-end. 
Finally, with regard to the Nationwide Permit 12, which is issued for the project by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, we had expected the permits to be reissued shortly after the issuance of the biological opinion as the core in recent months has taken steps that address the 4 circuits concerns. The recent decision related to the Keystone Pipeline by the district court in Montana has potential implications for nearly all critical infrastructure investment and associated employment across the country. This includes the provision of drinking water, electricity and fuel, Internet, radio, television, telephone and other communications and stands to impact service to the public, governments, defense installations, hospitals, schools and other businesses and industry. Since the Nationwide Permit 12 program was renewed in March of 2017, it has been used more than 38,000 times. And the court estimates that it has over 5,000 additional notifications awaiting action. The Department of Justice has sought and been granted expedited consideration for their motion for partial stay, pending appeal with all replies due by this Friday. We expect a focused effort across the industry, commerce and labor groups as well as the Department of Justice to clarify and resolve the issue in a timely manner. With regard to ACP, we believe it is too early to tell what, if any, impact this ruling will have on the existing and timing and cost of the project, which are otherwise affirming today. So many issues resolved in a timely manner, we can maintain the existing schedule and cost estimates, so long as we can take advantage of the November 2020 through March 2021 tree felling season. 
We will continue to monitor and provide communication to investors as appropriate. Based on these expectations, we remain confident in the successful completion of the project and note that there are no changes to the financial contribution estimates for 2020 and beyond that Jim provided on our fourth quarter earnings call. Customers need this infrastructure now more than ever to ensure the reliability of energy supply. 
Accordingly, we have recently finalized negotiations with the major customers to provide a fair rate of return for the project owners and appropriately balanced project costs among the parties. Further, we remain confident in Virginia regulatory approval, the prudency of capacity contracts as part of Dominion Energy's fuel filing cases as the project nears operation. Legislation that passed during the recent Virginia general assembly session established a fuel case review criteria that recognize the importance of energy reliability and largely mirrors the standard for prudency already employed by the commission. 
With that, I will summarize today's call as follows: our safety performance is on track to set a new company record for the lowest OSHA recordable rate. We achieved weather-normalized operating earnings that exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range for the 17th consecutive quarter. We affirmed our 2020 earnings guidance. We confirmed our EPS growth expectations apply plus percent post 2020. We are excited about the opportunities under recently enacted legislation in Virginia to increase the sustainability of our generation fleet, which will also be supportive of our corporate-wide net 0 carbon and methane emissions by 2050 commitment. And we are making significant progress across all of our capital investment programs to the benefit of our customers. We will now be happy to answer your questions."

You had democratic party in charge of both houses plus the executive branch. And there was a lot of interest among the new members of the House and Senate to advance a number of policies on many fronts, not just in energy. There was all sorts of legislation around gun rights, for example, and a variety of other things, minimum wage, et cetera. And there had been an effort -- we had worked for years with a number of groups to -- on solar in particular, and how to make sure that, that came into Virginia in an efficient, cost-effective way. And we worked with a wide variety of the policymakers to ensure that these goals are achievable and still affordable for our customers. 
And you can see from our IRP that was filed last week, that we expect, even with this spending plan, our plan B under the IRP is the most likely plan, at least we think it is, the most likely plan. Others will weigh in, of course. We'll run at a little bit -- right around traditional inflated rates of inflation. And we've joined RGGI and our rates, well, when you now compare our rates to the RGGI sates, we're 40% lower than the average RGGI state, we're half of the highest RGGI state. And so there's a lot of room in there for us to stay extremely competitive. So Steve, I think overall, from a big picture, view.

So this financing cost for the year is something we're watching pretty closely. And I don't have a specific number for you, but a little bit of color. Obviously, we raised $5 billion earlier than we otherwise would have some of that short-term debt. But some of that just replaces what already would have been in our plan commercial paper. And as 1 example, 1 of those short-term financings, 1 year financings that come to mind that we did in that period was at LIBOR plus 50 with no fees. So kind of not too far off where CP would have been anyway. So not a big driver. And now as you look forward from here, the markets have recovered in dramatic fashion, as you know, the fixed income market. And the issuance rates from here on out for the next 3 quarters the way it looks right now is they're even lower all-in than they were in January. So we had a little bit of pressure from doing things earlier within our plan than we would have expected otherwise. But now we expect probably to make some of that up as rates have -- all-in rates have decreased."

I would like to start by expressing our gratitude for the health care and other frontline professionals who are engaged in a heroic effort to assist those who have been most acutely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We salute their efforts with deep appreciation and express our sympathy to all those who have lost loved ones to the disease. I also want to thank our own field personnel who are performing a vital public service by literally keeping the lights on and critical energy flowing. These frontline employees are supported by thousands and thousands of others who provide equally important service to our customers. As everyone who follows Dominion knows, the safety of our employees is paramount. As the pandemic began to emerge, we acted quickly to ensure that our employees were equipped to handle the impact of the virus. 
We have utilized our frequently drilled crisis response plans now continually supplemented by the most up-to-date health service and government recommendations. Our efforts include implementing appropriate social distancing policies and activating our remote connection infrastructure, which has enabled more than half of our workforce to operate remotely. We have followed best practices in the distribution and use of PPE. And we are extending health and paid time off benefits as well as establishing a financial assistance program for employees that provides grants up to $2,000 to employees in need. 
We've also donated $1 million to the American Red Cross and local nonprofits to assist directly with coronavirus relief. This is in addition to the millions of dollars we provide each year to customer assistance programs and charitable causes throughout our communities. This is the core value of One Dominion Energy in practice. While even a single case of COVID-19 is a serious concern, we have been fortunate that across more than 19,000 employees in 20 states of operation, we have had very few tests positive, the majority of which are either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and most of whom have already returned to work. 
We are keeping those employees in our thoughts, and we'll continue to be focused on the health and well-being of our entire workforce, while not losing sight of our essential duty to provide reliable and affordable energy. 
Our thoughts are also with our customers. We are mindful of the hardships many are enduring. That is why, for example, we voluntarily suspended nonpayment service disconnections and waived late fees across all our utility service territories. We will also offer our customers tools designed to assist them overcome the financial challenges they may be facing. As our state and regional economies gradually begin to reopen, we are taking preventative steps to ensure that our workplaces are safe, and that our customers receive the best possible customer service. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jim to review our quarterly results as well as our thoughts on COVID-related impacts."
267105,662598356,1994219,"Dominion Energy, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 05, 2020",2020-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tom. I'll first turn to Slide 4 to report that our quarterly operating earnings per share, when adjusted for normal weather met or exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range for the 17th consecutive quarter. Our first quarter 2020 operating ea",2396,"Thank you, Tom. I'll first turn to Slide 4 to report that our quarterly operating earnings per share, when adjusted for normal weather met or exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range for the 17th consecutive quarter. Our first quarter 2020 operating earnings were $1.09 per share, which included a $0.09 hurt from significantly worse than normal weather. This was the third warmest first quarter in Virginia on record. 
Weather-normalized results of $1.18 per share exceeded the guidance range midpoint. Recall that weather in the first quarter of last year was a $0.06 hurt. But during the following 3 quarters, we more than overcame that and finished the year with a total weather help of $0.02. Even without adjusting for weather, this was the 17th consecutive quarter of results within our guidance range. 
GAAP earnings for the quarter were negative $0.34 per share. This result is driven in part by a noncash charge related to the planned early retirement of certain coal and oil-fired generating units in Virginia, consistent with the requirements of the recently enacted Virginia Clean Economy Act. The retirement of these units has been contemplated in previous versions of our integrated resource plan and was formally announced in late March. We also had a noncash impact attributable to unrealized losses on our Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Funds and as a reminder, we report such unrealized gains and losses on these funds as nonoperating. A summary of adjustments between operating and reported results is included in Schedule 2 of the earnings release kit. 
On Slide 5, we are initiating second quarter 2020 operating earnings guidance with a range of $0.75 to $0.85 per share. We are also affirming our annual guidance range of $4.25 to $4.60 per share. As usual, these ranges assume normal weather, variations from which could cause results to be toward the top or the bottom of these ranges. The second quarter and full year guidance ranges also reflect our preliminary expectations for the impacts of COVID on our financial results. 
Before I walk through each of our operating segments, let me address potential questions around our expectations for the shape and pace of the economic recovery. In affirming our annual guidance today, we have assumed that the economy begins to ramp up through late summer, though, as you will see momentarily, demand in Virginia, thus far, is positive relative to recent years despite the pandemic.
Of course, variations in the duration and the severity of the economic recovery may ultimately impact our financial results more or less than our current forecasts. The future is difficult to predict, which is why we are reiterating the demand-related earnings sensitivities for our 2 electric utilities. We hope this is useful for our analysts and investors to synthesize their models to reflect their own perspectives on the shape of the economic recovery. 
In any case, just as we have since early March, we plan to provide periodic public updates on the various aspects of the crisis' impact on our business, including updates on load as we make our way through the economic reopening process, which will occur gradually -- which began yesterday in South Carolina and is expected to begin in Virginia in 10 days. 
Now I'll address our businesses, starting with our largest segment, Dominion Energy Virginia. 
On Slide 6, we present updated load related data. This graph represents daily weather-normalized load in the PJM DOM Zone as compared to a 2-year historic weather-normalized average. As you can see, the impact of COVID on zonal demand has not changed materially since our prior disclosures, and Virginia load is continuing to prove extremely resilient. 
We attribute this to 4 factors, illustrated on Slide 7. First, residential usage, which typically accounts for around 45% of segment revenue. Last month, we saw year-over-year weather normal residential load increase by about 3%. As you can see, residential customers contribute more to revenue per unit of usage than our larger volume classes. Second, the proliferation of data centers in our service territory. Despite a statewide stay-at-home order, April weather-normalized commercial load decreased by only 3% as a result of COVID, mostly due to the stabilizing effect of data center demand growth. Third, limited industrial exposure, while we saw industrial demand decrease by around 3% in April, only 6% of DEV's revenue is attributable to industrial usage. And finally, government, military and other demand, which accounts for 16% of revenue and -- which was up almost 4% year-over-year last month. 
Let me also point out a few aspects of our regulatory framework, which are important to consider as they relate to the financial impact of the COVID crisis. Around 40% of DEV's rate base is in rider form that allows for an annual true-up for changes in sales volumes. In addition, fuel pass-through related revenue is also adjusted annually to account for, among other factors, over or under recovery due to usage. While not observable in the load data we have shared, these 2 mitigants taken together account for half of DEVs operating revenue and represent effective decoupling from changes in load. 
We continue to monitor the situation closely. Based on observable data, we are not at present forecasting major COVID-driven revenue impacts associated with reduced load at Dominion Energy Virginia during the remainder of 2020. Of course, the situation is dynamic, and so we are reiterating for your reference a previously published rules of thumb for load variations by class. Accounting for nearly 45% of our operating earnings, DEV represents our largest state-regulated utility exposure to COVID-related demand fluctuations by far. 
Let me now turn to Slide 8 to walk through the same data for Dominion Energy South Carolina's electric operations. From the time the executive order took effect on March 31, we've seen a noticeable decline in weather normal demand as compared to the 2-year historic average. Specifically, April's electric demand was off almost 10% on a relative basis. While we expect increases in residential demand, our South Carolina operations when compared to Virginia, do not benefit from the same data center load stability and, as demonstrated on Slide 9, are more exposed to industrial load. 
10 of DESCs top 30 industrial manufacturing customers have temporarily idled at least some production. However, all but 2 of those 10 have communicated plans to restart production in the coming weeks. 
In Virginia, there are some structural mitigants to the load impact -- like in Virginia, there's some structural mitigants to the load impact on revenue in South Carolina. First, around 25% of DESC's total rate base is in rider form with monthly true-ups. Almost -- another 10% of rate base is attributable to South Carolina gas distribution operations that operate under regulation that trues up annually. 
Finally, fuel pass-through related revenue for both electric and gas operations are adjusted annually to account for, among other factors, over or under recovery due to usage. While not observable in the load data we've shared, these 3 mitigants taken together account for nearly 50% of DESC's operating revenues and represent effective decoupling from changes in load. 
Further, the impact of COVID on our South Carolina financial performance stands to be relatively less impactful financially, given Dominion Energy South Carolina's overall earnings contribution is approximately 10% of Dominion's forecasted operating earnings. 
The future is difficult to predict, but we currently expect that load trends will gradually rebound through the late summer. However, the situation is dynamic, and therefore, we are also reiterating our rules of thumb for variations in load class and load by class for DESC's electric operations. Please note that these sensitivities assume a full year 1% change in load. April alone represents only a small percentage of annualized load, given, first, it's typically the lowest sales level of any month. And of course, it's only 1 of 12 months of the year. I'll also note here that we voluntarily requested a 60-day delay to our upcoming South Carolina electric base rate proceeding. Per the merger agreement, this was originally expected to commence later this quarter and conclude with new rates effective January 2021. We feel strongly that this is the prudent approach to take. 
Let me turn to Slide 10 now to address our remaining segments, which I'll be able to cover more quickly. First, gas distribution, which accounts for around 15% of operating earnings. Over 80% of segment operating margin is protected through decoupling or fixed charges, including riders and gas pass-through mechanisms. These constructive rate structures significantly reduce the impact we expect to see from COVID-related demand fluctuations. I should also point out that we are entering a multi-month period of off-peak and shoulder demand seasons for gas distribution. 
Next, gas transmission and storage, which accounts for nearly 1/4 of operating earnings. A few points here. First, the typical contract structure is long-term and take-or-pay with reservation or capacity charges, which are largely independent of utilization. Average remaining contract life is 6 to 7 years for existing pipelines in storage and much longer for Cove Point Liquefaction and ACP. Second, this is a demand pull dominated segment. As we shared at Investor Day, approximately 80% of the revenues attributable to segment assets are derived from demand-driven counterparties, such as utilities. 
Third, counterparty credit quality is high, given the regulated utility skew of the customer base. Where shippers do not meet our stringent internal credit standards, we typically require higher-than-industry-average protections, including collateral in the form of cash or letter of credit that often covers multiple years of exposure. 
And finally, Cove Point Liquefaction contracts are take-or-pay and allow the shippers to deliver cargoes anywhere in the world not prohibited by U.S. policy. Though customers are obligated to pay regardless of usage, I would note that through today, customers continue to nominate volumes that are at the plant's design capacity. And finally, contracted generation operates primarily under long-term PPA or hedge arrangements, which are unlikely to be materially impacted by the effects of COVID. 
Taking a step back now, we are also watching payment arrears data carefully across all of our segments. To date, we've seen modest increases, which are consistent with our expectations. That said, we will work carefully with our customers over the coming months to provide options and tools to maintain service and assist them in returning accounts to current. 
We do not expect bad debt expense in excess of budgeted amounts to be a material driver for the year. Though not directly comparable, during the financial crisis, we saw annual bad debt expense at DEV, for instance, increase by around just $20 million. At our electric business, like most of our peers, bad debt is addressed during periodic base rate case proceedings. 
At nearly all of our gas utilities, we have full or partial ability to recover bad debt expense under real-time rate mechanisms, such as dedicated trackers or fuel pass-through adjustment clauses. While the impact of COVID on our financial results during the first quarter was muted, we are not assuming that this -- that, that will continue indefinitely. That is why we are redoubling our efforts to identify opportunities to reduce costs generally across our businesses as we look to be prepared to achieve our affirmed annual guidance range. 
While I'm not in a position today to quantify a total amount, a few straightforward examples would include reductions in business travel, office supply and operational fuel expenses. As well as the impact of implementing a hiring freeze. We will continue to monitor these and other O&M reduction options. 
Turning now to liquidity as shown on Slide 11. As volatility in capital markets increased significantly in March, we moved quickly and opportunistically to enhance our liquidity position out of an abundance of caution. Over a period of around 15 days, we added nearly $5 billion of available or funded debt capital. 
On Slide 12, we update our annual financing plan for our year-to-date issuance. I'll note for the avoidance of doubt that as of today, there is no change to our long-term debt financing amounts, our external equity need of $300 million under our DRIP program or our CapEx guidance for the year. We have and we'll continue to look for -- at the potential to defer small amounts of capital investment where safety and reliability will not be compromised, but any such deferral would be relatively small and short-lived. We have not observed any major disruptions to any of our key supply chains. 
And finally, a few comments regarding our pension on Slide 13. We entered the year with a 92% funded status, up meaningfully from the previous year. While it's way too early to tell where we will land at year-end 2020 when we remeasure assets and liabilities, a few factors to consider. 
First, discount rates, which are based on long-term all-in corporate bond yields are around the same levels observed at the end of last year despite lower treasury rates. And second, at the end of January this year, we decided to hedge the equity exposure in our plan assets using the futures market. As public equities fell in March, we took advantage to monetize most of our hedge position at 25% and 30% in-the-money levels. We are beginning to reinvest those cash proceeds back into equity exposure. As a result, through April, plan assets are close to flat for the year, which compares favorably to the significant declines that may be expected for typical pension portfolios. I'll reiterate, there's a long way to go before the next expected remeasurement date of December 31. But regardless of where we end up for the year on funded status, we do not expect to need any pension plan contributions this year or next. 
Turning now to Slide 14 and in summary, we reported our 17th consecutive quarter of weather-normal results at or above the midpoint of guidance. And our 17th consecutive quarter results within our guidance range. We feel that our businesses are well positioned with regard to COVID-related demand impacts, but we are monitoring the situation carefully. We affirmed our annual operating EPS range of $4.25 to $4.60 per share. And we are also affirming our post-2020 guidance of 5-plus percent annual operating EPS growth as well as our dividend per share growth of 2.5% per annum, subject as is customary to board approval. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Tom."

Amidst the turmoil of the global pandemic, our employees have been singularly focused on maintaining reliable and safe operations for the individuals and families, businesses, industries and government agencies that we are fortunate to count",3226,"Thanks, Jim. Amidst the turmoil of the global pandemic, our employees have been singularly focused on maintaining reliable and safe operations for the individuals and families, businesses, industries and government agencies that we are fortunate to count as customers. 
We are in the public service business, and our work directly impacts the lives of our customers and communities. Let me share 3 specific examples that occurred over just the last 6 weeks on the opposite sides of the country and shown on Slide 15. On the morning of March 18, the Salt Lake City Valley experienced largest earthquake to occur in that region in 30 years. The 5.7 magnitude event generated nearly 1,800 service calls and 1,400 gas distribution work orders, which were both over 20x normal. Our crews went to work immediately to address any potential safety issues to ensure reliable service to homes and businesses in the middle of the winter season. 
As a testament to the quality of our infrastructure, and as a result of the significant investments in integrity and pipeline replacement programs authorized by our regulators, we have found 0 material gas lakes across our system as a result of the earthquake. 
Less than 4 weeks later, on April 13, 21 tornadoes touched down in South Carolina 4 of which were classified as EF3 strength with winds up to 165 miles per hour and 1 of which was classified as an E4 tornado with winds up to 200 miles per hour. It was the most prolific day of tornado activity in South Carolina in the last 35 years. 
Within 24 hours, our crews had restored 96% of the 117,000 of our customers that lost service during the storm. During the next 2 days, our people worked very long hours in devastated areas to finish restoring service and along the way, helping those communities find a measure of normalcy. In the aftermath of the storm, the South Carolina office of regulatory staff issued a press release commending the dedication and effort of the state's electrical personnel, men and women who worked tirelessly to ensure power systems were restored, even in the midst of a global pandemic. 
That same day, 300 miles Northeast, heavy rains and winds gusting to 70 miles per hour across Virginia and North Carolina, interrupted service to nearly 200,000 of our customers. Within 24 hours, 95% of customers have been restored by our crews with the final 5% reconnected over the following 12 hours. I'm proud, though not surprised, at the way in which our Dominion Energy team members have responded on behalf of our customers throughout this trying time. 
Turning to safety, which is our first core value. Our first quarter safety results rank us #1 among our southeastern peer group and puts us on track for another year of record performance. Through the end of March, our OSHA recordable rate is approximately 1/2 that of the first quarter of last year. Also, 2 weeks ago, 7 of our gas infrastructure operating companies received awards from the AGA for superior safety performance. 
For the remainder of my prepared remarks, I will address the results of the Virginia general assembly session and the status of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. The Virginia legislative session formally concluded last month. On April 11, Governor, Northam signed in the law, the Virginia Clean Economy Act or VCEA, which complements the existing Grid Transformation & Security Act adopted in 2018. That law established a comprehensive framework for utility regulation and investment in Virginia. 
As shown on Slide 16, the VCEA sets our company on a path of achieving the most significant legislatively mandated clean energy investment program in the United States. As a result, Virginia is poised to become a nationwide leader in 0 carbon deployment over the next 3 decades. This mandate will create thousands of jobs, support localities, bolster the Virginia economy, attract businesses and families, improve the environment and serve as an example for other states seeking to achieve similarly ambitious sustainable energy goals. 
The plan also supports our enterprise-wide net 0 methane and carbon emissions targets by 2050. The VCEA calls for and finds in the public interest, the development of renewable generation and energy storage resources as follows: 5,200 megawatts of offshore wind, 100% of which may be utility owned; 16,100 megawatts of solar or onshore wind, 65% of which may be utility owned and 2,700 megawatts of energy storage, 65% of which may be utility owned. These targets are to be met over the next 15 years with additional goals by 2045. 
In addition to establishing a public interest determination for these programs, the law outlines specific regulatory approval criteria and affirms rider eligibility for each of those programs. I'll discuss them in turn. 
Regarding our previously announced 2,600-megawatt Coastal Virginia offshore wind project. The commission is required to presume costs are reasonable and prudent if the project meets 3 key tests, as shown on Slide 17. First, competitive procurement and solicitation standards for components are met. We have met this standard on our Virginia projects for many years. We have always sought to drive down costs while also balancing performance and reliability to optimize value for our customers. 
Second, the projected Levelized Cost of Energy or LCOE is reasonable relative to a specific EIA benchmark. Our early estimates for project LCOE are of $80 to $90 per megawatt hour compared very favorably to this benchmark. This range does not include the benefit of any available federal tax incentives, which are working to preserve for the benefit of customers. And third, the project's construction commences prior to 2024 and or has a plan to enter service by 2028. Our project satisfies both milestones. 
We are pleased with the progress to date on both our pilot and full-scale deployments. Despite the pandemic, the primary pilot project components have arrived from Europe, as shown on the cover slide. And we expect installation to begin this quarter with commercial in service by year-end. 
We have also initiated the subsea survey work that will support the submission of our full-scale offshore construction and operation plan to BOEM by the end of the year. We are joined in this work with the Virginia fishing industry. We continue to work with equipment manufacturers and service providers to encourage making Virginia the hub for the U.S. offshore wind industry. And we are leading a consortium of industry experts and participants in the development of a fully Jones Act compliant installation vessel that will be equipped to handle all current turbine technologies as well as the next-generation turbine sizes of 12 megawatts and larger. These mega turbines result in fewer foundations and reduced construction and maintenance costs, thereby lowering the Levelized Cost of Energy. 
The vessel, which will be funded by consortium participants, including Dominion Energy will enter service in 2023 and operate continuously for several years under contracts with multiple major U.S. offshore wind developers. Based on our current estimates for fully installed costs, which we expect will reduce over time. Offshore wind, as directed by the VCEA represents between $8 billion and $17 billion of capital investment over the next 15 years. This range is consistent at the low end with our previously announced cost estimate for our 2,600 megawatt project. The high end represents an incremental opportunity associated with the law's direction to put an additional 2,600 megawatts into service by 2035. Accordingly, we are updating our 5-year growth capital estimate for this program by 1 year. The new outlook now totals $3.5 billion and reflects the ramp-up on our full-scale deployment in 2024. Our previously (sic) [previous] plan included only $1.1 billion. We plan to make an initial rider filing in 2022.
Next, solar and onshore wind, as shown on Slide 18. Given Virginia's relatively onshore wind resource, we expect that the vast majority of the law's mandate in this area will be met through a very significant expansion of the state's solar capacity. As I mentioned previously, the law calls for over 16,000 megawatts by 2036, 10,000 of which can be utility owned. In other words, Dominion will install, on average, nearly 700 megawatts of solar every year for each of the next 15 years. 
To-date, we have achieved more than 70% of our previous commitment of at least 3,000 megawatts by 2022. In the first quarter, we had our third solar rider application approved by the Virginia Commission. Meeting the ambitious targets set by the VCEA will require a redoubling of effort in this area, and we have already begun to significantly increase our activities. 
In granting approval for solar and onshore wind as well as energy storage, the law directs the commission to give due consideration to quote the promotion of new renewable generation and associated economic development, projected fuel savings and the RPS standards of the law. Assuming 65% utility ownership is provided in the law, solar generation represents approximately $19 billion of capital investment over the next 15 years. Our roll forward 5-year growth capital forecast now totals $5.5 billion as we seek to accelerate investments to meet the law's milestones. Our prior estimate was $3.7 billion. 
Next, energy storage, which includes our existing efforts to develop a pumped storage facility in Southwestern Virginia. The commission recently approved 4 battery technology pilot projects totaling around $30 million and about 16 megawatts. In order to achieve the 2,700 megawatt target established by the law, we will be focused on a very aggressive effort in years to come. Assuming 65% utility ownership is provided in the law, energy storage represents approximately $7 billion of capital investment over the next 15 years. Our existing 5-year growth capital plan, which we are rising only modestly as we roll forward by 1 year, already included around $1 billion related to pumped storage. 
On Slide 20, we show the impact of updating our 5-year growth capital estimates for just these 3 programs, which shows a $4 billion and over 70% increase. We are not updating existing 5-year CapEx figures for other programs or segments today. But we do not expect any material changes from our most recent guidance. We will look for an opportunity in the future to provide a comprehensive update across all segments. 
Looking longer-term on Slide 21. These 3 legislative priorities of wind, solar and energy storage, taken together, represent, based on current cost estimates, somewhere between $34 billion and $43 billion of growth capital over the next 15 years, subject to regulatory approval. This is additive to the existing rider eligible investments, we will make this decade for electric transmission, nuclear relicensing, strategic undergrounding, grid modernization, and renewable enabling quick start generation. 
Together, these projects represent nearly $16 billion of growth capital, also subject to regulatory approval. To give these figures some context, Dominion Energy, Virginia's 2019 year-end rate base was around $24 billion. 
Turning to Slide 22. As reported in our recent integrated resource plan, we expect typical residential customer bills from 2019 through 2030, including authorized pass-throughs related to Virginia joining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative to keep pace with average historic inflation. We expect fuel savings from increased dispatch of renewable generation to be a key customer benefit. Of course, we always work to maintain competitive and affordable rates, and we have a track record of success as demonstrated by our current rates, which are below the state, regional and national averages. 
I would also note that our current typical customer bill is almost 40% lower than the average of RGGI participating states. We expect that our future rates will stay lower by a very wide margin compared to those states. Further, the VCEA expands on existing programs that are designed to direct funds to assist lower income customers. 
The proliferation of renewable but intermittent resources across our system will also require the continuation of our extensive investment in transmission infrastructure as solar generation sites emerge throughout the state. It will also require an increasingly modern grid, which is why the recent commission decision to reject certain, although certainly not all, aspects of our most recent grid transformation filing was disappointing for our company and particularly for our customers. 
We will continue to seek comprehensive deployment of smart meters and other enhancements across our system, which will greatly improve the way we interact with customers as well as our ability to manage our increasingly 2-way energy delivery system. The VCEA and associated legislation will dramatically change our generation fuel mix over the years to come. What will not change is our obligation to customers to provide 24/7 energy with the least possible disruption. That is a message that has been clearly reinforced during the COVID pandemic. 
Technological, operational and economic constraints around the multi-day baseload dischargeability of existing battery technology, combined with the fact that sometimes in Virginia, at least the wind does not blow and the sun does not shine for extended durations, meaning days, not hours, ensures that natural gas-fired generation will continue to play a critical, low-emission role in our system for years and years to come. 
That's why our policymakers wisely included language in the VCEA in multiple places that provides expressed consent to consider system reliability and energy security holistically before ruling out any low emitting fuel such as natural gas. This aligns with our unwavering commitment to be net 0 by 2050. 
What is clear, however, is that less efficient and higher emitting sources of electric generation such as coal and oil, will phase out of our system. To that end, we have taken steps since early 2019, including during this first quarter to retire more than 3,300 megawatts of mostly coal and oil-fired power stations. Given recent changes in law, the commission is no longer mandated by statute to approve period expense treatment for these retirements. Period expensing is the best choice for customers and dictated by many years of existing commission precedent. 
During the triennial review under the framework established by the GTSA, if the commission determines that we have excess earnings, either because they determine to overrule existing precedent and amortize plant retirement charges over a longer period of time or because our financial performance otherwise warrants such determination, we will offset those excess earnings using dollar-for-dollar customer credit reinvestment offsets or CCROs, including our $300 million offshore wind pilot project investment. Only if we are unable to fully offset excess earnings with CCROs would the commission be authorized to order a onetime customer refund and reduce rates by no more than $50 million through the following triennial review, which will conclude in late 2024. 
Now to the Atlantic Coast pipeline and supply header. On Slide 23, we summarize the status of select project permits. First, the Appalachian Trail crossing. On February 24, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments on the case. We expect the court to rule in ACP's favor in the coming weeks. Such a ruling would restore the authorization of the project to proceed along the existing route. Despite the pandemic, the court continues to meet telephonically and release orders on cases heard earlier in the term. 
Next, the biological opinion. Progress continues despite COVID as we provide information that is responsive to requests from both FERC and the fish and wildlife service. We expect the authorization to be reissued by the end of this quarter. That period would mark nearly a 12 -- a full 12 months since the court invalidated the prior version in July 2019, demonstrating the rigor with which the permitting agencies are approaching resolution of the concerns identified by the court. 
In the case of the air permit for Buckingham Compressor Station, we have already begun to submit additional data and analysis to the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, which we believe provides ample justification for the original Air Board decision to approve the strictest minor source air permit in the nation and addresses all of the concerns voiced by the court. We expect the permit to be reissued by year-end. 
Finally, with regard to the Nationwide Permit 12, which is issued for the project by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, we had expected the permits to be reissued shortly after the issuance of the biological opinion as the Corp in recent months has taken steps that address the 4 circuits' concerns. The recent decision related to the Keystone Pipeline by the district court in Montana has potential implications for nearly all critical infrastructure investment and associated employment across the country. This includes the provision of drinking water, electricity and fuel, Internet, radio, television, telephone and other communications and stands to impact service to the public, governments, defense installations, hospitals, schools and other businesses and industry. 
Since the Nationwide Permit 12 program was renewed in March of 2017, it has been used more than 38,000 times. And the court estimates that it has over 5,000 additional notifications awaiting action. The Department of Justice has sought and been granted expedited consideration for their motion for partial stay, pending appeal with all replies due by this Friday. We expect a focused effort across the industry, commerce and labor groups as well as the Department of Justice to clarify and resolve the issue in a timely manner. 
With regard to ACP, we believe it is too early to tell what, if any, impact this ruling will have on the existing and timing and cost of the project, which are otherwise affirming today. So many issues resolved in a timely manner, we can maintain the existing schedule and cost estimates, so long as we can take advantage of the November 2020 through March 2021 tree felling season. 
We will continue to monitor and provide communication to investors as appropriate. Based on these expectations, we remain confident in the successful completion of the project and note that there are no changes to the financial contribution estimates for 2020 and beyond that Jim provided on our fourth quarter earnings call. Customers need this infrastructure now more than ever to ensure the reliability of energy supply. 
Accordingly, we have recently finalized negotiations with the major customers to provide a fair rate of return for the project owners and appropriately balanced project costs among the parties. Further, we remain confident in Virginia regulatory approval, of the prudency of capacity contracts as part of Dominion Energy's fuel filing cases as the project nears operation. Legislation that passed during the recent Virginia general assembly session established a fuel case review criteria that recognize the importance of energy reliability and largely mirrors the standard for prudency already employed by the commission. 
With that, I will summarize today's call as follows: our safety performance is on track to set a new company record for the lowest OSHA recordable rate. We achieved weather-normalized operating earnings that exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range for the 17th consecutive quarter. We affirmed our 2020 earnings guidance. We confirmed our EPS growth expectations of 5-plus percent post 2020. 
We are excited about the opportunities under recently enacted legislation in Virginia to increase the sustainability of our generation fleet, which will also be supportive of our corporate-wide net 0 carbon and methane emissions by 2050 commitment. And we are making significant progress across all of our capital investment programs to the benefit of our customers. We will now be happy to answer your questions."

Certainly no change this year, but we'll revisit what the financing mix will be kind of across the board as we do a more holistic update. 
I would note, though, for the avoidance of doubt that for these programs, we've talked about under the VCEA, all the financing will be at DEV, so VEPCO legal entity. So we're not considering project financings or other things like that. It will be a mix of regular way of financing at VEPCO. But more to come when we provide more holistic updates."

So the -- just to refresh everybody on the state of Virginia politics, for the first time, and I think it's 30 years in this session of the general assembly, we had elections last year. We're always off here for our state legislature, both in the Senate and the house of delegates in for the first time, it's in either 20 or 30 years, I don't remember which -- how many decades. You had democratic party in charge of both houses plus the executive branch. 
And there was a lot of interest among the new members of the House and Senate to advance a number of policies on many fronts, not just in energy. There was all sorts of legislation around gun rights, for example, and a variety of other things, minimum wage, et cetera. And there had been an effort -- we had worked for years with a number of groups to -- on solar in particular, and how to make sure that, that came into Virginia in an efficient, cost-effective way. And we worked with a wide variety of the policymakers to ensure that these goals are achievable and still affordable for our customers. 
And you can see from our IRP that was filed last week, that we expect, even with this spending plan, our plan B under the IRP is the most likely plan, at least we think it is, the most likely plan. Others will weigh in, of course. We'll run at a little bit -- right around traditional inflated rates of inflation. And we've joined RGGI and our rates, well, when you now compare our rates to the RGGI states, we're 40% lower than the average RGGI state, we're half of the highest RGGI state. And so there's a lot of room in there for us to stay extremely competitive. So Steve, I think overall, from a big picture, view. It was part of an overall effort across many different parts of policymaking to have a more progressive outlook as those policymakers would call it a more progressive outlook on a variety of factors.

So when it comes to our guidance, we've obviously reaffirmed the annual guidance and long term. But there are a couple of gives and takes there. So one is weather, not to your question, but we had $0.09 of weather hurt. So the rest of the year, like last year, we expect to make up some of the ground we lost in the first quarter on weather.

So this financing cost for the year is something we're watching pretty closely. And I don't have a specific number for you, but a little bit of color. Obviously, we raised $5 billion earlier than we otherwise would have. Some of that's short-term debt. But some of that just replaces what already would have been in our plan, commercial paper. And as one example, one of those short-term financings, 1-year financings that come to mind that we did in that period was at LIBOR plus 50 with no fees. So kind of not too far off where CP would have been anyway. So not a big driver. 
And now as you look forward from here, the markets have recovered in dramatic fashion, as you know, the fixed income market. And the issuance rates from here on out for the next 3 quarters the way it looks right now is they're even lower all-in than they were in January.

I would like to start by expressing our gratitude for the health care and other frontline professionals who are engaged in a heroic effort to assist those who have been most acutely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We salute their efforts with deep appreciation and express our sympathy to all those who have lost loved ones to the disease. I also want to thank our own field personnel who are performing a vital public service by literally keeping the lights on and critical energy flowing. These frontline employees are supported by thousands and thousands of others who provide equally important service to our customers. As everyone who follows Dominion knows, the safety of our employees is paramount. As the pandemic began to emerge, we acted quickly to ensure that our employees were equipped to handle the impact of the virus. 
We have utilized our frequently drilled crisis response plans now continually supplemented by the most up-to-date health service and government recommendations. Our efforts include implementing appropriate social distancing policies and activating our remote connection infrastructure, which has enabled more than half of our workforce to operate remotely. We have followed best practices in the distribution and use of PPE. And we are extending health and paid time off benefits as well as establishing a financial assistance program for employees that provides grants up to $2,000 to employees in need. 
We've also donated $1 million to the American Red Cross and local nonprofits to assist directly with coronavirus relief. This is in addition to the millions of dollars we provide each year to customer assistance programs and charitable causes throughout our communities. This is the core value of One Dominion Energy in practice. While even a single case of COVID-19 is a serious concern, we have been fortunate that across more than 19,000 employees in 20 states of operation, we have had very few tests positive, the majority of which are either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and most of whom have already returned to work. 
We are keeping those employees in our thoughts, and we'll continue to be focused on the health and well-being of our entire workforce, while not losing sight of our essential duty to provide reliable and affordable energy. 
Our thoughts are also with our customers. We are mindful of the hardships many are enduring. That is why, for example, we voluntarily suspended nonpayment service disconnections and waived late fees across all our utility service territories. We will also offer our customers tools designed to assist them overcome the financial challenges they may be facing. As our state and regional economies gradually begin to reopen, we are taking preventative steps to ensure that our workplaces are safe and that our customers receive the best possible customer service. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jim to review our quarterly results as well as our thoughts on COVID-related impacts."
267105,662598356,2006752,"Dominion Energy, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 05, 2020",2020-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tom. I'll first turn to Slide 4 to report that our quarterly operating earnings per share, when adjusted for normal weather met or exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range for the 17th consecutive quarter. Our first quarter 2020 operating ea",2393,"Thank you, Tom. I'll first turn to Slide 4 to report that our quarterly operating earnings per share, when adjusted for normal weather met or exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range for the 17th consecutive quarter. Our first quarter 2020 operating earnings were $1.09 per share, which included a $0.09 hurt from significantly worse than normal weather. This was the third warmest first quarter in Virginia on record. 
Weather-normalized results of $1.18 per share exceeded the guidance range midpoint. Recall that weather in the first quarter of last year was a $0.06 hurt. But during the following 3 quarters, we more than overcame that and finished the year with a total weather help of $0.02. Even without adjusting for weather, this was the 17th consecutive quarter of results within our guidance range. 
GAAP earnings for the quarter were negative $0.34 per share. This result is driven in part by a noncash charge related to the planned early retirement of certain coal and oil-fired generating units in Virginia, consistent with the requirements of the recently enacted Virginia Clean Economy Act. The retirement of these units has been contemplated in previous versions of our integrated resource plan and was formally announced in late March. We also had a noncash impact attributable to unrealized losses on our Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Funds and as a reminder, we report such unrealized gains and losses on these funds as nonoperating. A summary of adjustments between operating and reported results is included in Schedule 2 of the earnings release kit. 
On Slide 5, we are initiating second quarter 2020 operating earnings guidance with a range of $0.75 to $0.85 per share. We are also affirming our annual guidance range of $4.25 to $4.60 per share. As usual, these ranges assume normal weather, variations from which could cause results to be toward the top or the bottom of these ranges. The second quarter and full year guidance ranges also reflect our preliminary expectations for the impacts of COVID on our financial results. 
Before I walk through each of our operating segments, let me address potential questions around our expectations for the shape and pace of the economic recovery. In affirming our annual guidance today, we have assumed that the economy begins to ramp up through late summer, though, as you will see momentarily, demand in Virginia, thus far, is positive relative to recent years despite the pandemic.
Of course, variations in the duration and the severity of the economic recovery may ultimately impact our financial results more or less than our current forecasts. The future is difficult to predict, which is why we are reiterating the demand-related earnings sensitivities for our 2 electric utilities. We hope this is useful for our analysts and investors to synthesize their models to reflect their own perspectives on the shape of the economic recovery. 
In any case, just as we have since early March, we plan to provide periodic public updates on the various aspects of the crisis' impact on our business, including updates on load as we make our way through the economic reopening process, which will occur gradually -- which began yesterday in South Carolina and is expected to begin in Virginia in 10 days. 
Now I'll address our businesses, starting with our largest segment, Dominion Energy Virginia. 
On Slide 6, we present updated load related data. This graph represents daily weather-normalized load in the PJM DOM Zone as compared to a 2-year historic weather-normalized average. As you can see, the impact of COVID on zonal demand has not changed materially since our prior disclosures, and Virginia load is continuing to prove extremely resilient. 
We attribute this to 4 factors, illustrated on Slide 7. First, residential usage, which typically accounts for around 45% of segment revenue. Last month, we saw year-over-year weather normal residential load increase by about 3%. As you can see, residential customers contribute more to revenue per unit of usage than our larger volume classes. Second, the proliferation of data centers in our service territory. Despite a statewide stay-at-home order, April weather-normalized commercial load decreased by only 3% as a result of COVID, mostly due to the stabilizing effect of data center demand growth. Third, limited industrial exposure, while we saw industrial demand decrease by around 3% in April, only 6% of DEV's revenue is attributable to industrial usage. And finally, government, military and other demand, which accounts for 16% of revenue and -- which was up almost 4% year-over-year last month. 
Let me also point out a few aspects of our regulatory framework, which are important to consider as they relate to the financial impact of the COVID crisis. Around 40% of DEV's rate base is in rider form that allows for an annual true-up for changes in sales volumes. In addition, fuel pass-through related revenue is also adjusted annually to account for, among other factors, over- or under-recovery due to usage. While not observable in the load data we have shared, these 2 mitigants taken together account for half of DEVs operating revenue and represent effective decoupling from changes in load. 
We continue to monitor the situation closely. Based on observable data, we are not at present forecasting major COVID-driven revenue impacts associated with reduced load at Dominion Energy Virginia during the remainder of 2020. Of course, the situation is dynamic, and so we are reiterating for your reference a previously published rules of thumb for load variations by class. Accounting for nearly 45% of our operating earnings, DEV represents our largest state-regulated utility exposure to COVID-related demand fluctuations by far. 
Let me now turn to Slide 8 to walk through the same data for Dominion Energy South Carolina's electric operations. From the time the executive order took effect on March 31, we've seen a noticeable decline in weather normal demand as compared to the 2-year historic average. Specifically, April's electric demand was off almost 10% on a relative basis. While we expect increases in residential demand, our South Carolina operations when compared to Virginia, do not benefit from the same data center load stability and, as demonstrated on Slide 9, are more exposed to industrial load. 
10 of DESCs top 30 industrial manufacturing customers have temporarily idled at least some production. However, all but 2 of those 10 have communicated plans to restart production in the coming weeks. 
In Virginia, there are some structural mitigants to the load impact -- like in Virginia, there's some structural mitigants to the load impact on revenue in South Carolina. First, around 25% of DESC's total rate base is in rider form with monthly true-ups. Almost -- another 10% of rate base is attributable to South Carolina gas distribution operations that operate under regulation that trues up annually. 
Finally, fuel pass-through related revenue for both electric and gas operations are adjusted annually to account for, among other factors, over- or under-recovery due to usage. While not observable in the load data we've shared, these 3 mitigants taken together account for nearly 50% of DESC's operating revenues and represent effective decoupling from changes in load. 
Further, the impact of COVID on our South Carolina financial performance stands to be relatively less impactful financially, given Dominion Energy South Carolina's overall earnings contribution is approximately 10% of Dominion's forecasted operating earnings. 
The future is difficult to predict, but we currently expect that load trends will gradually rebound through the late summer. However, the situation is dynamic, and therefore, we are also reiterating our rules of thumb for variations in load class and load by class for DESC's electric operations. Please note that these sensitivities assume a full year 1% change in load. April alone represents only a small percentage of annualized load, given, first, it's typically the lowest sales level of any month. And of course, it's only 1 of 12 months of the year. I'll also note here that we voluntarily requested a 60-day delay to our upcoming South Carolina electric base rate proceeding. Per the merger agreement, this was originally expected to commence later this quarter and conclude with new rates effective January 2021. We feel strongly that this is the prudent approach to take. 
Let me turn to Slide 10 now to address our remaining segments, which I'll be able to cover more quickly. First, gas distribution, which accounts for around 15% of operating earnings. Over 80% of segment operating margin is protected through decoupling or fixed charges, including riders and gas pass-through mechanisms. These constructive rate structures significantly reduce the impact we expect to see from COVID-related demand fluctuations. I should also point out that we are entering a multi-month period of off-peak and shoulder demand seasons for gas distribution. 
Next, gas transmission and storage, which accounts for nearly 1/4 of operating earnings. A few points here. First, the typical contract structure is long-term and take-or-pay with reservation or capacity charges, which are largely independent of utilization. Average remaining contract life is 6 to 7 years for existing pipelines in storage and much longer for Cove Point Liquefaction and ACP. Second, this is a demand/pull dominated segment. As we shared at Investor Day, approximately 80% of the revenues attributable to segment assets are derived from demand-driven counterparties, such as utilities. 
Third, counterparty credit quality is high, given the regulated utility skew of the customer base. Where shippers do not meet our stringent internal credit standards, we typically require higher-than-industry-average protections, including collateral in the form of cash or letter of credit that often covers multiple years of exposure. 
And finally, Cove Point Liquefaction contracts are take-or-pay and allow the shippers to deliver cargoes anywhere in the world not prohibited by U.S. policy. Though customers are obligated to pay regardless of usage, I would note that through today, customers continue to nominate volumes that are at the plant's design capacity. And finally, contracted generation operates primarily under long-term PPA or hedge arrangements, which are unlikely to be materially impacted by the effects of COVID. 
Taking a step back now, we are also watching payment arrears data carefully across all of our segments. To date, we've seen modest increases, which are consistent with our expectations. That said, we will work carefully with our customers over the coming months to provide options and tools to maintain service and assist them in returning accounts to current. 
We do not expect bad debt expense in excess of budgeted amounts to be a material driver for the year. Though not directly comparable, during the financial crisis, we saw annual bad debt expense at DEV, for instance, increase by around just $20 million. At our electric business, like most of our peers, bad debt is addressed during periodic base rate case proceedings. 
At nearly all of our gas utilities, we have full or partial ability to recover bad debt expense under real-time rate mechanisms, such as dedicated trackers or fuel pass-through adjustment clauses. While the impact of COVID on our financial results during the first quarter was muted, we are not assuming that this -- that, that will continue indefinitely. That is why we are redoubling our efforts to identify opportunities to reduce costs generally across our businesses as we look to be prepared to achieve our affirmed annual guidance range. 
While I'm not in a position today to quantify a total amount, a few straightforward examples would include reductions in business travel, office supply and operational fuel expenses. As well as the impact of implementing a hiring freeze. We will continue to monitor these and other O&M reduction options. 
Turning now to liquidity as shown on Slide 11. As volatility in capital markets increased significantly in March, we moved quickly and opportunistically to enhance our liquidity position out of an abundance of caution. Over a period of around 15 days, we added nearly $5 billion of available or funded debt capital. 
On Slide 12, we update our annual financing plan for our year-to-date issuance. I'll note for the avoidance of doubt that as of today, there is no change to our long-term debt financing amounts, our external equity need of $300 million under our DRIP program or our CapEx guidance for the year. We have and we'll continue to look for -- at the potential to defer small amounts of capital investment where safety and reliability will not be compromised, but any such deferral would be relatively small and short-lived. We have not observed any major disruptions to any of our key supply chains. 
And finally, a few comments regarding our pension on Slide 13. We entered the year with a 92% funded status, up meaningfully from the previous year. While it's way too early to tell where we will land at year-end 2020 when we remeasure assets and liabilities, a few factors to consider. 
First, discount rates, which are based on long-term all-in corporate bond yields are around the same levels observed at the end of last year despite lower treasury rates. And second, at the end of January this year, we decided to hedge the equity exposure in our plan assets using the futures market. As public equities fell in March, we took advantage to monetize most of our hedge position at 25% and 30% in-the-money levels. We are beginning to reinvest those cash proceeds back into equity exposure. As a result, through April, plan assets are close to flat for the year, which compares favorably to the significant declines that may be expected for typical pension portfolios. I'll reiterate, there's a long way to go before the next expected remeasurement date of December 31. But regardless of where we end up for the year on funded status, we do not expect to need any pension plan contributions this year or next. 
Turning now to Slide 14 and in summary, we reported our 17th consecutive quarter of weather-normal results at or above the midpoint of guidance. And our 17th consecutive quarter results within our guidance range. We feel that our businesses are well positioned with regard to COVID-related demand impacts, but we are monitoring the situation carefully. We affirmed our annual operating EPS range of $4.25 to $4.60 per share. And we are also affirming our post-2020 guidance of 5-plus percent annual operating EPS growth as well as our dividend per share growth of 2.5% per annum, subject as is customary to board approval. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Tom."

Amidst the turmoil of the global pandemic, our employees have been singularly focused on maintaining reliable and safe operations for the individuals and families, businesses, industries and government agencies that we are fortunate to count as customers. 
We are in the public service business, and our work directly impacts the lives of our customers and communities. Let me share 3 specific examples that occurred over just the last 6 weeks on the opposite sides of the country and shown on Slide 15. On the morning of March 18, the Salt Lake City Valley experienced largest earthquake to occur in that region in 30 years. The 5.7 magnitude event generated nearly 1,800 service calls and 1,400 gas distribution work orders, which were both over 20x normal. Our crews went to work immediately to address any potential safety issues to ensure reliable service to homes and businesses in the middle of the winter season. 
As a testament to the quality of our infrastructure, and as a result of the significant investments in integrity and pipeline replacement programs authorized by our regulators, we have found 0 material gas lakes across our system as a result of the earthquake. 
Less than 4 weeks later, on April 13, 21 tornadoes touched down in South Carolina 4 of which were classified as EF3 strength with winds up to 165 miles per hour and 1 of which was classified as an E4 tornado with winds up to 200 miles per hour. It was the most prolific day of tornado activity in South Carolina in the last 35 years. 
Within 24 hours, our crews had restored 96% of the 117,000 of our customers that lost service during the storm. During the next 2 days, our people worked very long hours in devastated areas to finish restoring service and along the way, helping those communities find a measure of normalcy. In the aftermath of the storm, the South Carolina office of regulatory staff issued a press release commending the dedication and effort of the state's electrical personnel, men and women who worked tirelessly to ensure power systems were restored, even in the midst of a global pandemic. 
That same day, 300 miles Northeast, heavy rains and winds gusting to 70 miles per hour across Virginia and North Carolina, interrupted service to nearly 200,000 of our customers. Within 24 hours, 95% of customers have been restored by our crews with the final 5% reconnected over the following 12 hours. I'm proud, though not surprised, at the way in which our Dominion Energy team members have responded on behalf of our customers throughout this trying time. 
Turning to safety, which is our first core value. Our first quarter safety results rank us #1 among our southeastern peer group and puts us on track for another year of record performance. Through the end of March, our OSHA recordable rate is approximately 1/2 that of the first quarter of last year. Also, 2 weeks ago, 7 of our gas infrastructure operating companies received awards from the AGA for superior safety performance. 
For the remainder of my prepared remarks, I will address the results of the Virginia general assembly session and the status of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. The Virginia legislative session formally concluded last month. On April 11, Governor, Northam signed in the law, the Virginia Clean Economy Act or VCEA, which complements the existing Grid Transformation & Security Act adopted in 2018. That law established a comprehensive framework for utility regulation and investment in Virginia. 
As shown on Slide 16, the VCEA sets our company on a path of achieving the most significant legislatively mandated clean energy investment program in the United States. As a result, Virginia is poised to become a nationwide leader in 0 carbon deployment over the next 3 decades. This mandate will create thousands of jobs, support localities, bolster the Virginia economy, attract businesses and families, improve the environment and serve as an example for other states seeking to achieve similarly ambitious sustainable energy goals. 
The plan also supports our enterprise-wide net 0 methane and carbon emissions targets by 2050. The VCEA calls for and finds in the public interest, the development of renewable generation and energy storage resources as follows: 5,200 megawatts of offshore wind, 100% of which may be utility owned; 16,100 megawatts of solar or onshore wind, 65% of which may be utility owned and 2,700 megawatts of energy storage, 65% of which may be utility owned. These targets are to be met over the next 15 years with additional goals by 2045. 
In addition to establishing a public interest determination for these programs, the law outlines specific regulatory approval criteria and affirms rider eligibility for each of those programs. I'll discuss them in turn. 
Regarding our previously announced 2,600-megawatt Coastal Virginia offshore wind project. The commission is required to presume costs are reasonable and prudent if the project meets 3 key tests, as shown on Slide 17. First, competitive procurement and solicitation standards for components are met. We have met this standard on our Virginia projects for many years. We have always sought to drive down costs while also balancing performance and reliability to optimize value for our customers. 
Second, the projected Levelized Cost of Energy or LCOE is reasonable relative to a specific EIA benchmark. Our early estimates for project LCOE are of $80 to $90 per megawatt hour compared very favorably to this benchmark. This range does not include the benefit of any available federal tax incentives, which are working to preserve for the benefit of customers. And third, the project's construction commences prior to 2024 and or has a plan to enter service by 2028. Our project satisfies both milestones. 
We are pleased with the progress to date on both our pilot and full-scale deployments. Despite the pandemic, the primary pilot project components have arrived from Europe, as shown on the cover slide. And we expect installation to begin this quarter with commercial in service by year-end. 
We have also initiated the subsea survey work that will support the submission of our full-scale offshore construction and operation plan to BOEM by the end of the year. We are joined in this work with the Virginia fishing industry. We continue to work with equipment manufacturers and service providers to encourage making Virginia the hub for the U.S. offshore wind industry. And we are leading a consortium of industry experts and participants in the development of a fully Jones Act compliant installation vessel that will be equipped to handle all current turbine technologies as well as the next-generation turbine sizes of 12 megawatts and larger. These mega turbines result in fewer foundations and reduced construction and maintenance costs, thereby lowering the Levelized Cost of Energy. 
The vessel, which will be funded by consortium participants, including Dominion Energy will enter service in 2023 and operate continuously for several years under contracts with multiple major U.S. offshore wind developers. Based on our current estimates for fully installed costs, which we expect will reduce over time. Offshore wind, as directed by the VCEA represents between $8 billion and $17 billion of capital investment over the next 15 years. This range is consistent at the low end with our previously announced cost estimate for our 2,600 megawatt project. The high end represents an incremental opportunity associated with the law's direction to put an additional 2,600 megawatts into service by 2035. Accordingly, we are updating our 5-year growth capital estimate for this program by 1 year. The new outlook now totals $3.5 billion and reflects the ramp-up on our full-scale deployment in 2024. Our previously (sic) [ previous ] plan included only $1.1 billion. We plan to make an initial rider filing in 2022.
Next, solar and onshore wind, as shown on Slide 18. Given Virginia's relatively onshore wind resource, we expect that the vast majority of the law's mandate in this area will be met through a very significant expansion of the state's solar capacity. As I mentioned previously, the law calls for over 16,000 megawatts by 2036, 10,000 of which can be utility owned. In other words, Dominion will install, on average, nearly 700 megawatts of solar every year for each of the next 15 years. 
To-date, we have achieved more than 70% of our previous commitment of at least 3,000 megawatts by 2022. In the first quarter, we had our third solar rider application approved by the Virginia Commission. Meeting the ambitious targets set by the VCEA will require a redoubling of effort in this area, and we have already begun to significantly increase our activities. 
In granting approval for solar and onshore wind as well as energy storage, the law directs the commission to give due consideration to quote the promotion of new renewable generation and associated economic development, projected fuel savings and the RPS standards of the law. Assuming 65% utility ownership is provided in the law, solar generation represents approximately $19 billion of capital investment over the next 15 years. Our roll forward 5-year growth capital forecast now totals $5.5 billion as we seek to accelerate investments to meet the law's milestones. Our prior estimate was $3.7 billion. 
Next, energy storage, which includes our existing efforts to develop a pumped storage facility in Southwestern Virginia. The commission recently approved 4 battery technology pilot projects totaling around $30 million and about 16 megawatts. In order to achieve the 2,700 megawatt target established by the law, we will be focused on a very aggressive effort in years to come. Assuming 65% utility ownership is provided in the law, energy storage represents approximately $7 billion of capital investment over the next 15 years. Our existing 5-year growth capital plan, which we are rising only modestly as we roll forward by 1 year, already included around $1 billion related to pumped storage. 
On Slide 20, we show the impact of updating our 5-year growth capital estimates for just these 3 programs, which shows a $4 billion and over 70% increase. We are not updating existing 5-year CapEx figures for other programs or segments today. But we do not expect any material changes from our most recent guidance. We will look for an opportunity in the future to provide a comprehensive update across all segments. 
Looking longer-term on Slide 21. These 3 legislative priorities of wind, solar and energy storage, taken together, represent, based on current cost estimates, somewhere between $34 billion and $43 billion of growth capital over the next 15 years, subject to regulatory approval. This is additive to the existing rider eligible investments, we will make this decade for electric transmission, nuclear relicensing, strategic undergrounding, grid modernization, and renewable enabling quick start generation. 
Together, these projects represent nearly $16 billion of growth capital, also subject to regulatory approval. To give these figures some context, Dominion Energy, Virginia's 2019 year-end rate base was around $24 billion. 
Turning to Slide 22. As reported in our recent integrated resource plan, we expect typical residential customer bills from 2019 through 2030, including authorized pass-throughs related to Virginia joining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative to keep pace with average historic inflation. We expect fuel savings from increased dispatch of renewable generation to be a key customer benefit. Of course, we always work to maintain competitive and affordable rates, and we have a track record of success as demonstrated by our current rates, which are below the state, regional and national averages. 
I would also note that our current typical customer bill is almost 40% lower than the average of RGGI participating states. We expect that our future rates will stay lower by a very wide margin compared to those states. Further, the VCEA expands on existing programs that are designed to direct funds to assist lower-income customers. 
The proliferation of renewable but intermittent resources across our system will also require the continuation of our extensive investment in transmission infrastructure as solar generation sites emerge throughout the state. It will also require an increasingly modern grid, which is why the recent commission decision to reject certain, although certainly not all, aspects of our most recent grid transformation filing was disappointing for our company and particularly for our customers. 
We will continue to seek comprehensive deployment of smart meters and other enhancements across our system, which will greatly improve the way we interact with customers as well as our ability to manage our increasingly 2-way energy delivery system. The VCEA and associated legislation will dramatically change our generation fuel mix over the years to come. What will not change is our obligation to customers to provide 24/7 energy with the least possible disruption. That is a message that has been clearly reinforced during the COVID pandemic. 
Technological, operational and economic constraints around the multi-day baseload dischargeability of existing battery technology, combined with the fact that sometimes in Virginia, at least the wind does not blow and the sun does not shine for extended durations, meaning days, not hours, ensures that natural gas-fired generation will continue to play a critical, low-emission role in our system for years and years to come. 
That's why our policymakers wisely included language in the VCEA in multiple places that provides expressed consent to consider system reliability and energy security holistically before ruling out any low emitting fuel such as natural gas. This aligns with our unwavering commitment to be net 0 by 2050. 
What is clear, however, is that less efficient and higher emitting sources of electric generation such as coal and oil, will phase out of our system. To that end, we have taken steps since early 2019, including during this first quarter to retire more than 3,300 megawatts of mostly coal and oil-fired power stations. Given recent changes in law, the commission is no longer mandated by statute to approve period expense treatment for these retirements. Period expensing is the best choice for customers and dictated by many years of existing commission precedent. 
During the triennial review under the framework established by the GTSA, if the commission determines that we have excess earnings, either because they determine to overrule existing precedent and amortize plant retirement charges over a longer period of time or because our financial performance otherwise warrants such determination, we will offset those excess earnings using dollar-for-dollar customer credit reinvestment offsets or CCROs, including our $300 million offshore wind pilot project investment. Only if we are unable to fully offset excess earnings with CCROs would the commission be authorized to order a onetime customer refund and reduce rates by no more than $50 million through the following triennial review, which will conclude in late 2024. 
Now to the Atlantic Coast pipeline and supply header. On Slide 23, we summarize the status of select project permits. First, the Appalachian Trail crossing. On February 24, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments on the case. We expect the court to rule in ACP's favor in the coming weeks. Such a ruling would restore the authorization of the project to proceed along the existing route. Despite the pandemic, the court continues to meet telephonically and release orders on cases heard earlier in the term. 
Next, the biological opinion. Progress continues despite COVID as we provide information that is responsive to requests from both FERC and the fish and wildlife service. We expect the authorization to be reissued by the end of this quarter. That period would mark nearly a 12 -- a full 12 months since the court invalidated the prior version in July 2019, demonstrating the rigor with which the permitting agencies are approaching resolution of the concerns identified by the court. 
In the case of the air permit for Buckingham Compressor Station, we have already begun to submit additional data and analysis to the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, which we believe provides ample justification for the original Air Board decision to approve the strictest minor source air permit in the nation and addresses all of the concerns voiced by the court. We expect the permit to be reissued by year-end. 
Finally, with regard to the Nationwide Permit 12, which is issued for the project by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, we had expected the permits to be reissued shortly after the issuance of the biological opinion as the Corp in recent months has taken steps that address the 4 circuits' concerns. The recent decision related to the Keystone Pipeline by the district court in Montana has potential implications for nearly all critical infrastructure investment and associated employment across the country. This includes the provision of drinking water, electricity and fuel, Internet, radio, television, telephone and other communications and stands to impact service to the public, governments, defense installations, hospitals, schools and other businesses and industry. 
Since the Nationwide Permit 12 program was renewed in March of 2017, it has been used more than 38,000 times. And the court estimates that it has over 5,000 additional notifications awaiting action. The Department of Justice has sought and been granted expedited consideration for their motion for partial stay, pending appeal with all replies due by this Friday. We expect a focused effort across the industry, commerce and labor groups as well as the Department of Justice to clarify and resolve the issue in a timely manner. 
With regard to ACP, we believe it is too early to tell what, if any, impact this ruling will have on the existing and timing and cost of the project, which are otherwise affirming today. So many issues resolved in a timely manner, we can maintain the existing schedule and cost estimates, so long as we can take advantage of the November 2020 through March 2021 tree felling season. 
We will continue to monitor and provide communication to investors as appropriate. Based on these expectations, we remain confident in the successful completion of the project and note that there are no changes to the financial contribution estimates for 2020 and beyond that Jim provided on our fourth quarter earnings call. Customers need this infrastructure now more than ever to ensure the reliability of energy supply. 
Accordingly, we have recently finalized negotiations with the major customers to provide a fair rate of return for the project owners and appropriately balanced project costs among the parties. Further, we remain confident in Virginia regulatory approval, of the prudency of capacity contracts as part of Dominion Energy's fuel filing cases as the project nears operation. Legislation that passed during the recent Virginia general assembly session established a fuel case review criteria that recognize the importance of energy reliability and largely mirrors the standard for prudency already employed by the commission. 
With that, I will summarize today's call as follows: our safety performance is on track to set a new company record for the lowest OSHA recordable rate. We achieved weather-normalized operating earnings that exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range for the 17th consecutive quarter. We affirmed our 2020 earnings guidance. We confirmed our EPS growth expectations of 5-plus percent post 2020. 
We are excited about the opportunities under recently enacted legislation in Virginia to increase the sustainability of our generation fleet, which will also be supportive of our corporate-wide net 0 carbon and methane emissions by 2050 commitment. And we are making significant progress across all of our capital investment programs to the benefit of our customers. We will now be happy to answer your questions."

You had democratic party in charge of both houses plus the executive branch. 
And there was a lot of interest among the new members of the House and Senate to advance a number of policies on many fronts, not just in energy. There was all sorts of legislation around gun rights, for example, and a variety of other things, minimum wage, et cetera. And there had been an effort -- we had worked for years with a number of groups to -- on solar in particular, and how to make sure that, that came into Virginia in an efficient, cost-effective way. And we worked with a wide variety of the policymakers to ensure that these goals are achievable and still affordable for our customers. 
And you can see from our IRP that was filed last week, that we expect, even with this spending plan, our plan B under the IRP is the most likely plan, at least we think it is, the most likely plan. Others will weigh in, of course. We'll run at a little bit -- right around traditional inflated rates of inflation. And we've joined RGGI and our rates, well, when you now compare our rates to the RGGI states, we're 40% lower than the average RGGI state, we're half of the highest RGGI state. And so there's a lot of room in there for us to stay extremely competitive. So Steve, I think overall, from a big picture, view.

We're expecting that, that will slowly recover through late summer. 
So when it comes to our guidance, we've obviously reaffirmed the annual guidance and long term. But there are a couple of gives and takes there. So one is weather, not to your question, but we had $0.09 of weather hurt. So the rest of the year, like last year, we expect to make up some of the ground we lost in the first quarter on weather.

So this financing cost for the year is something we're watching pretty closely. And I don't have a specific number for you, but a little bit of color. Obviously, we raised $5 billion earlier than we otherwise would have. Some of that's short-term debt. But some of that just replaces what already would have been in our plan, commercial paper. And as one example, one of those short-term financings, 1-year financings that come to mind that we did in that period was at LIBOR plus 50 with no fees. So kind of not too far off where CP would have been anyway. So not a big driver. 
And now as you look forward from here, the markets have recovered in dramatic fashion, as you know, the fixed income market. And the issuance rates from here on out for the next 3 quarters the way it looks right now is they're even lower all-in than they were in January. So we had a little bit of pressure from doing things earlier within our plan than we would have expected otherwise. But now we expect probably to make some of that up as rates have -- all-in rates have decreased."

Our second quarter 2020 operating earnings were $0.82 per share, which included a $0.03 hurt from worse than normal weather in our utility service territories.Weather normalized results of $0.85 per share were at the to",1318,"Thanks, Steven, and good morning. Our second quarter 2020 operating earnings were $0.82 per share, which included a $0.03 hurt from worse than normal weather in our utility service territories.
Weather normalized results of $0.85 per share were at the top of our guidance range and for the 18th consecutive quarter, we're at or above the quarterly guidance midpoint.
We expect a full year financial impact of weather to the more balanced than during the first 2 quarters of the year.
Preliminary data indicate that July was around $0.04 better than normal and early predictions for August suggest potential for additional weather helps.
Note that our second quarter GAAP and operating earnings are not adjusted to account for discontinued operations, given the timing of our recent announcement, but will be reflected beginning with our third quarter of disclosures.
GAAP earnings for the quarter were negative $1.41 per share. This result was driven primarily by impairment-related charges associated with the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header projects.
We also had a positive impact attributable to net gains on our nuclear decommissioning trust funds.
As a reminder, we report such gains and losses on these funds as nonoperating.
A summary of adjustments between operating and reported results is included in Schedule 2 of the earnings release kit.
On Slide 4, we're initiating the third quarter 2020 operating earnings guidance with a range of $0.85 to $1.05 per share. As mentioned, this range reflects the impact of recasting operating earnings to exclude discontinued operations.
We're also affirming that 2020 annual guidance range provided on our July 6 investor call.
As usual, these ranges assume normal [indiscernible], durations of which could cause results to be towards the top or the bottom of these ranges.
Typically, we provide year ago actual results [indiscernible] guidance. 
Given the need to adjust historic results for discontinued operations to provide a useful point of comparison, we plan to provide these figures when we report third quarter and full year results, respectively.
I would like to note that our 2020 10-K will include 3 full years of historic results that have been adjusted to reflect the impact of discontinued operations. 
Finally, we are also affirming the long-term annual growth guidance we gave earlier this month for earnings and dividends per share. I'll now turn to discuss our observations on the financial impacts of COVID-19. The graph on Slide 5. Represents daily and 7-day average weather-normalized load in the PGM dom zone as compared to the 2-year historic weather normal average. Strong residential and data center demand continues to support overall load levels that modestly exceed the historic average. This is a continuation of the theme we've seen since the pandemic began. And looking forward, we expect this trend to continue. We provide corresponding data for Dominion Energy South Carolina on the next slide. Recall the story here diverged from DEV and that we did experience weather normal load degradation earlier this year. 
On the first quarter call, we suggested that April could represent a bottoming out with gradual improvements through the summer. Fortunately, at least so far, that has been the case with July demand only 1% off weather normal historic averages. I would also point out that the higher volumes sold in the summer months, like July, tend to have a larger impact on our annual sales revenues than the lower volume shoulder months. We currently expect this general recovery trend to continue in South Carolina through the remainder of the year. We estimate that through the end of June, lower than budgeted sales associated with the impacts of COVID-19 across our electric utility operation has impacted operating income by approximately $0.04 per share which thus far has been largely offset with corporate initiatives. The future remains difficult to predict, so we are reiterating the demand-related earnings sensitivities that we provided on the first quarter call and which can be found in the appendix of today's presentation. 
Consistent with our expectations, customer arrears have increased modestly to date. We continue to work carefully with our customers to provide options and tools to assist them in returning their accounts to current. Our GAAP results for the quarter reflect the recognition of a COVID-related reserve of around $20 million, representing our current expectation for incremental expense associated with future uncollectible accounts. 
Turning on to a financing update, as shown on Slide 7, we provide detailed guidance on our equity capital raising plans. First, we are ceasing the issuance of new shares under the DRIP program with immediate effect. Resulting in a total of about $160 million of new share issuance under the program in 2020, roughly half of our estimate. In 2021 and beyond, we'll return to our historic norm of around $300 million of new share issuance per year. Second, starting in 2022. We expect to see our at the market program begin to ramp up such that by 2024, our first big year offshore wind investment. We're back to the $300 million to $500 million per year range that we previously articulated at Investor Day. And third, we continue to target year-end completion of the share repurchase we announced earlier this month. Recall that the Board's authorization for the announced $3 billion buyback was with immediate effect. We currently expect that there may be some modest upward bias to this figure based on additional refinement of our overall tax analysis. We'll provide additional details around share repurchases next quarter, but would note, that we have not yet repurchased any shares. We have an exciting opportunity to deploy significant amounts of capital directed at sustainable energy and related project. These projected modest equity financing activities will support these EPS accretive, capital investments. 
Turning to fixed income. We've included in slide in the appendix detailing our very modest remaining issuance for the year. Overall, we view the debt capital markets as healthy and liquid across the spectrum of term and we currently have nearly $7 billion in available liquidity. Our credit rating agencies responded positively to the announcements we made earlier this month. S&P revised their outlook to positive while Moody's and Fitch affirmed creating. In all cases, the agency's remarked on the credit positive aspects of our strategic repositioning. We expect that successful execution of our financial plan will further demonstrate the clear and positive reduction of our overall business risk profile. 
Finally, before I summarize my remarks, let me give some insight into our Investor Relations strategy over the next several months, as shown on Slide 8. We are increasing our proactive outreach using virtual tools to interact with both existing and prospective shareholders throughout the world, including geographies where ESG-related factors are playing an increasingly prominent role in investment decisions. We are ramping up our investor targeting efforts to identify prospective shareholders for which are compelling, clean energy, operating and financial profile will resonate. We plan to use our fourth quarter earnings call to provide something of an Investor Day style refresh with supplementary appendix disclosures aimed at providing projected CapEx, rate base, and other inputs, which we hope will assist investors in their financial evaluation of our company. It's our responsibility to get our repositioned story into the market. We, therefore, look forward to connecting with many of you for discussions on these topics during the next several months. So to summarize my remarks, we remain focused on extending our track record of delivering financial results that meet or exceed our public commitments. We feel that our businesses are well positioned with regard to COVID related demand impacts, but we are monitoring that situation carefully. We are affirming our updated 2020 operating earnings guidance as well as the long-term operating earnings and dividend growth outlooks provided earlier this month. And finally, we look forward to increasing engagement with existing and prospective investors in the months to come. I'll now turn the call over to Tom."

I would like to start by again expressing our gratitude for the medical and other frontline health care professionals who are engaged in a courageous effort to assist those will be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We salute their efforts. Just as we salute the efforts of our employees who continue to perform a vital public service by literally keeping the lights on and critical energy flowing. We continue to evolve our COVID response to incorporate the most up-to-date guidance from the medical and public health community. Social distancing. Proper PPE and where practical remote work have become the expectation for all employees. We are also mindful of our customers and the difficult time this has been for them. We have worked closely with regulators to take steps, including the voluntary suspension of non payment service disconnections and the offering of flexible payment plans to assist our customers in addressing the financial challenges they may be facing. 
Turning to safety, which is our first core value on Slide 9. Our year-to-date results put us on track to make 2020 the safest year of operation in the company to use more than 100 year history. As an organization with nearly 20,000 employees and 7 million customers, our safety performance matters to thousands of families and communities, which is why it matters so much to us. The ability to impact lives on a broader scale is also why when we see an issue that deeply impacts our employees, customers and communities, we get involved. Recent social unrest, partly caused by the murder in Minneapolis, has led us to question more we can do to assist in the cause of social justice and racial equality. Early last month, we publicly committed $5 million in social justice and community rebuilding efforts. The funds will support nonprofit organizations, advocating for social justice and equality. Grants will also be designated to help minority-owned and small businesses recover from recent disruptions to their businesses. Words can evoke sympathy, empathy, compassion and understanding. But at Dominion energy, we believe that actions speak louder. So we're investing in recovery and reconciliation. And in the vital work of overcoming years of debilitating actions, attitudes and abuses of authority that have traumatized our country. This month, we followed up on that commitment with an additional pledge of $35 million that will support 11 historically black colleges and universities, representing 35,000 students across Virginia, Ohio, North and South Carolina, as well as the Scholarship fund focused on African-American and underrepresented majority students across all of our service territories. These institutions have been foundational in the struggle to improve the lives of African-Americans and in the fight for social justice. We are pleased and humbled to build on our company's nearly 40-year history of supporting historically black colleges and universities. These initiatives are a recognition of the importance of education as an equalizer in society. Across our company, we are engaging these issues like never before, listening and being heard. We are committed in taking major steps to increase the diversity of our workforce. And in recent years, we have meaningfully improved our supplier diversity. Embracing diversity inclusion is not only the right thing to do. It is imperative to our long-term success as a company. And we are changing the way that long-term success will look operationally and financially. 
Slide 11 summarizes the highlights of our strategic repositioning, which include a narrowed focus to our premier state-regulated utility operations, which will account for approximately 85% to 90% of our operating earnings, an industry-leading clean energy profile. Best-in-class long-term earnings and dividend per share growth and a low-risk business profile and healthy balance sheet. We have a vision for the future. And we are preparing our company to be at the vanguard of the energy transition that is accelerating across our country. We are investing billions of dollars in a transition that will make 0 and low emitting resources accountable for around 95% of our company-wide electric generation by the end of 2035. As shown on Slide 12, we have a plan described in our integrated resource plan filings to grow our renewable energy capacity. On average, over 15% per year for the next 15 years. We have successfully achieved our 3,000 megawatt target for renewable generation in service or under development in the State of Virginia, 1.5 years ahead of schedule. And we are now the third largest owner of solar capacity among utility companies in the country. Our pilot offshore wind project, depicted on the cover of these materials, is the only project to have successfully completed the bome permitting process and will begin to generate electricity this quarter. Our $8 billion 2.6 gigawatt full-scale offshore wind deployment continues on schedule. Recent permitting recommendations for Northeast wind projects are not expected to alter materially our project plans and will be accounted for when we submit our construction and operation plan later this year. 
Finally, earlier this month, the Virginia State Corporation Commission approved our renewable energy tariff which enables us to offer an exciting 100% renewable energy product to our customers. We are equally focused on emission reductions in our gas distribution utilities. Pipeline and other aging infrastructure replacement, extensive leak detection and repair efforts and modified operational procedures designed to capture gas that used to be vented during maintenance. We'll reduce the methane emissions of our natural gas utility operations, 65% by the end of this decade and 80% by the end of the next. We are also finding innovative ways to help our customers improve their sustainability. As one of the country's largest investors in renewable natural gas, we are at the forefront of the intersection of agricultural emission reductions and offering natural gas customers a green option that is actually carbon negative. Meaning that it takes more greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere than it creates when it is used by the customer. In coming months, we will share additional insights into our expanding vision for a sustainable energy future for our company and the country. 
Next, let me address the upcoming Dominion Energy South Carolina rate case. Earlier this month, we made a preliminary filing that formally signaled our intent to file a general rate case proceeding next month. The first for the base electric business in South Carolina since 2012. We expect new rates based on a typical procedural schedule to be effective in March of 2021. Since the last rate case 8 years ago, Dominion Energy South Carolina has connected over 80,000 new electric customers, representing a 12% increase and invested over $2 billion net of retirements in electric generation transmission and distribution systems that serve customers every day. Despite prudent cost management, the resulting earned return does not measure up to the cost of capital we must employ to maintain excellent reliability and service that our customers rely on. We estimate that our filing will imply a single-digit percentage rate increase, which will be significantly lower than the compounded rate of inflation of nearly 14% since the end of the last test year of 2011. 
Customers count on us to keep the lights on and to deliver affordable and increasingly sustainable electricity. We are as committed to that ideal in South Carolina today as we were when we closed the merger. With that, I will summarize today's call as follows: our safety performance is on track to set a new company record. We are making important financial commitments to address social justice and support African-American and other representative minority students. We achieved weather-normalized operating earnings that exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range for the 18th consecutive quarter. We affirmed our enhanced long-term earnings and dividends per share growth guidance. Our transaction with Berkshire Hathway is on schedule for our fourth quarter closing. And we are aggressively pursuing our vision to be the most sustainable energy company in the country. 
Before we turn to your questions, I want to discuss our announcement this morning about my change and role from President and CEO to Executive Chairman of Dominion, effective at the end of this quarter. I'm in my 25th year at the company, 15th year as CEO and turned 65 last December. 3 years ago, the Board began to consider various alternatives to my eventual retirement. We have undertaken a series of steps over these years. Last September, we took an important step in that process by creating the co-chief Operating Officer role. Today's announcement is another step in a long designed succession process. I'm pleased to say that Bob Blue will become President and CEO on October 1, reporting to me as Executive Chair. Diane Leopold is being promoted to Chief Operating Officer. Reporting to Blue and will be responsible for all of the company's operations across our multistate footprint. Jim Chapman, our CFO, will report to Blue as well Carter Reid, President of our services company, Carlos Brown, our General Counsel; Bill Murray, our Head of Corporate Affairs and public policy: Our Head of Regulation and Customer Experience; and Tannya Ross, our Chief Auditor; Carter Reid will also report to me in her role as Chief of Staff of Dominion. 
I provide you with this detail to underscore that the team we have assembled at Dominion over the past 15 years, will be the same team that carries us into the future. It is this group that has taken dominion to the top ranks among American utilities in safety, operational excellence and compliance. It is also this team that has supported and expanded our steadfast commitment to sustainability, diversity and community engagement. These individuals, of course, did not achieve these results on their own. They were supported by thousands of others at our company who share and live our company's values. As you know, over the years, we have made significant and in some cases, transformative changes to Dominion, like our succession process, we have taken a deliberate strategic approach to repositioning Dominion for the future. We are now largely state-regulated multi-utility company with a growth profile for both earnings per share and dividends among the highest in our industry. We also have one of the strongest ESG stories in the sector. From exiting oil and gas production and merchant fossil generation emerging with Questar and Scana to embracing solar power, advanced storage and grid modernization to relicensing our nuclear fleet. As well as the development of the largest offshore wind farm in the Americas, it has been this team of individuals leading the way. With our most recent strategic alignment in selling our gas storage and pipeline segment and embracing a clear path to net 0 by 2050, the Board and I thought it would be an appropriate time to take the next step in our management transition at the end of this quarter. There is no established time frame for my role as Executive Chair, and I look forward to continuing to serve the company on behalf of our shareholders, customers and communities. The primary goal of our succession planning process has been to ensure continuity of our strategy, public policy, corporate values and operational excellence. This change is a step in carrying out that goal. I will also continue to serve as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the company. As Executive Chair, I will continue to represent the company engaging with key stakeholders, industry groups and others. I will be particularly focused on continuing to develop our strategic plan and Dominion's leadership in the new clean energy economy. 
And with that, we will be happy to answer your questions."

And our disclosure is ranked among the highest in the country. Certainly among the highest in utilities for its transparency. And like I said, we've disclosed all of them. And over the last 5 years, I think our contributions have been under $500,000, 70% of which went to an organization that associated with American Petroleum Institute supporting pipeline projects. So we are fully disclosed everything. It's not a -- it's a very small part of what we do, under $500,000 over 5 years. And we have no intention of changing our practices because they are perfectly appropriate completely compliant with every state in federal law, by wide margins.

And I don't want to take time to go through all the history. But I think as you know, we've made just a ton of progress in that area over the last several years. And it's even better pro forma for the sale of the T&S business. So that sale, almost $6 billion of the $10 billion transaction value is really our perspective, debt retirement. So I think the agencies have recognized that also in their commentary, as I just talked about positive outlook from S&P, et cetera. So given that, the status of our balance sheet and the related improvements from this transaction. We feel pretty good about our plan to provide the net proceeds back to our shareholders in this buyback, which we're, as I mentioned, we're targeting for completion by the end of the year. But that said, we do have a sizable clean energy and related capital spend program. Just talked about that with James. And it's only increasing as we go through the year slowly. So therefore, we do, even though we're doing the buyback and we're giving the net proceeds back to our shareholders, we think it's prudent. With that strong balance sheet position we're in. We do plan to recommence some equity issuance, even if it's just in this form of DRIP in 2021 and beyond. But I think the perspective is important. I mean, for spending programs of the size of what we're doing, to be starting out with DRIP, less than 0.5 percentage point of our market cap a year in a pretty efficient program like DRIP and later, just with other efficient programs, all in our ATM, we think it's overall pretty modest, and we think it's the best way to go."

But we haven't bought any yet. And we retain kind of full flexibility. We can do that with open market purchases. We could do it with accelerated share repurchases, tender, Dutch auction, so more guidance to come on that through the fall as we go. We do expect still to complete that by the end of the year, even if we start sooner. We're not guiding to any different closing time line than the kind of early fourth quarter, although that all remains on track. But then as it relates to the amount, the quantum yes, we mentioned there's upward bias. Where is that coming from, and we'll provide more detail on that too as we go. But that comes from -- first of all, just a conservative first cut on what the tax -- cash taxes would be on this sale. We indicated about $700 million. So there's interplay there between the tax aspect of the sale and the tax aspect of the Atlantic cost pipeline abandonment, an impairment of supply header. And the interplay of our sizable tax credit position. So as we continue to do more work on that, we see probably, if anything, a downward bias and the taxes payable from $700 million, and therefore, an upper bias in the size of the buyback. And it's not huge. I mean, again, we'll come to that guidance is somewhere between 0 and $200 million kind of that magnitude. And we'll provide more guidance. But again, conservative first cut, probably improving from there modestly, and we'll provide more detail on all of that as we go through the fall."

So I really don't see anything there as well as the continued growth projects to meet the increasing demand in these high-growth areas. So really no change on the LDC side. With respect to hydrogen, we do see that there will be an increase in hydrogen utilization in the energy mix over the next several decades. And we've certainly spent a lot of time studying it. At the moment, at least our knowledge, no Continental U.S. LDC is blending hydrogen into its supply mix today. We committed a couple of years ago to making sure our LDC system is ready to accept up to 5% hydrogen by 2030. So just in the next decade, and our initial pilot is in advanced planning stages in Utah. So high level, we think there's going to be a lot of activity in this area. But for the most part, it's still in that study and preparatory planning stage, but expect it to be ramping up and look forward to sharing updates."

Our second quarter 2020 operating earnings were $0.82 per share, which included a $0.03 hurt from worse than normal weather in our utility service territories.Weather-normalized results of $0.85 per share were at the",1313,"Thank you, Steven, and good morning. Our second quarter 2020 operating earnings were $0.82 per share, which included a $0.03 hurt from worse than normal weather in our utility service territories.
Weather-normalized results of $0.85 per share were at the top of our guidance range. And for the 18th consecutive quarter, we're at or above the quarterly guidance midpoint.
We expect a full year financial impact of weather to be more balanced than during the first 2 quarters of the year.
Preliminary data indicate that July was around $0.04 better than normal, and early predictions for August suggest potential for additional weather helps.
Note that our second quarter GAAP and operating earnings are not adjusted to account for discontinued operations, given the timing of our recent announcement, but will be reflected beginning with our third quarter disclosures.
GAAP earnings for the quarter were negative $1.41 per share. This result was driven primarily by impairment-related charges associated with the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header projects.
We also had a positive impact attributable to net gains on our nuclear decommissioning trust funds. As a reminder, we report such gains and losses on these funds as nonoperating.
A summary of adjustments between operating and reported results is included in Schedule 2 of the earnings release kit.
On Slide 4, we're initiating the third quarter 2020 operating earnings guidance with a range of $0.85 to $1.05 per share. As mentioned, this range reflects the impact of recasting operating earnings to exclude discontinued operations.
We're also affirming that 2020 annual guidance range provided on our July 6 investor call. As usual, these ranges assume normal weather, variations from which could cause results to be towards the top or the bottom of these ranges.
Typically, we provide year ago actual results alongside our guidance. 
Given the need to adjust historic results for discontinued operations to provide a useful point of comparison, we plan to provide these figures when we report third quarter and full year results, respectively.
I would also note that our 2020 10-K will include 3 full years of historic results that have been adjusted to reflect the impact of discontinued operations.
Finally, we are also affirming the long-term annual growth guidance we gave earlier this month for earnings and dividends per share.
I'll now turn to discuss our observations on the financial impacts of COVID-19. The graph on Slide 5 represents daily and 7-day average weather-normalized load in the PJM dom zone as compared to the 2-year historic weather-normal average.
Strong residential and data center demand continues to support overall load levels that modestly exceed the historic average. This is a continuation of the theme we've seen since the pandemic began. And looking forward, we expect this trend to continue.
We provide corresponding data for Dominion Energy South Carolina on the next slide. Recall the story here diverged from DEV and that we did experience weather-normal load degradation earlier this year.
On the first quarter call, we suggested that April could represent a bottoming out with gradual improvements through the summer. Fortunately, at least so far, that has been the case with July demand only 1% off weather-normal historic averages.
I would also point out that the higher volumes sold in the summer months, like July, tend to have a larger impact on our annual sales revenues than the lower volume shoulder months. We currently expect this general recovery trend to continue in South Carolina through the remainder of the year.
We estimate that through the end of June, lower than budgeted sales associated with the impacts of COVID-19 across our electric utility operation has impacted operating income by approximately $0.04 per share, which thus far has been largely offset with corporate initiatives.
The future remains difficult to predict, so we are reiterating the demand-related earnings sensitivities that we provided on the first quarter call and which can be found in the appendix of today's presentation.
Consistent with our expectations, customer arrears have increased modestly to date. We continue to work carefully with our customers to provide options and tools to assist them in returning their accounts to current. Our GAAP results for the quarter reflect the recognition of a COVID-related reserve of around $20 million, representing our current expectation for incremental expense associated with future uncollectible accounts.
Turning now to a financing update, as shown on Slide 7, we provide detailed guidance on our equity capital raising plans. First, we are ceasing the issuance of new shares under the DRIP program with immediate effect, resulting in a total of about $160 million of new share issuance under the program in 2020, roughly half of our prior estimate.
In 2021 and beyond, we'll return to our historic norm of around $300 million of new share issuance per year.
Second, starting in 2022, we expect to see our at-the-market program begin to ramp up such that by 2024, our first big year of offshore wind investment, we're back to the $300 million to $500 million per year range that we previously articulated at Investor Day.
And third, we continue to target year-end completion of the share repurchase we announced earlier this month.
Recall that the Board's authorization for the announced $3 billion buyback was with immediate effect. We currently expect that there may be some modest upward bias to this figure based on additional refinement of our overall tax analysis.
We'll provide additional details around share repurchases next quarter, but would note that we have not yet repurchased any shares.
We have an exciting opportunity to deploy significant amounts of capital directed at sustainable energy and related projects. These projected modest equity financing activities will support these EPS-accretive capital investments.
Turning to fixed income, we've included in slide in the appendix detailing our very modest remaining issuance for the year. Overall, we view the debt capital markets as healthy and liquid across the spectrum of term, and we currently have nearly $7 billion in available liquidity.
Our credit rating agencies responded positively to the announcements we made earlier this month. S&P revised their outlook to positive while Moody's and Fitch affirmed our ratings. In all cases, the agencies remarked on the credit positive aspects of our strategic repositioning. We expect that successful execution of our financial plan will further demonstrate the clear and positive reduction of our overall business risk profile.
Finally, before I summarize my remarks, let me give some insight into our Investor Relations strategy over the next several months, as shown on Slide 8. We are increasing our proactive outreach using virtual tools to interact with both existing and prospective shareholders throughout the world, including geographies where ESG-related factors are playing an increasingly prominent role in investment decisions. We are ramping up our investor targeting efforts to identify prospective shareholders for which our compelling, clean energy, operating and financial profile will resonate.
We plan to use our fourth quarter earnings call to provide something of an Investor Day style refresh with supplementary appendix disclosures aimed at providing projected CapEx, rate base, and other inputs, which we hope will assist investors in their financial evaluation of our company. It's our responsibility to get our repositioning story into the market. We, therefore, look forward to connecting with many of you for discussions on these topics during the next several months.
So to summarize my remarks, we remain focused on extending our track record of delivering financial results that meet or exceed our public commitments. We feel that our businesses are well positioned with regard to COVID-related demand impacts, but we are monitoring that situation carefully.
We are affirming our updated 2020 operating earnings guidance as well as the long-term operating earnings and dividend growth outlooks provided earlier this month. And finally, we look forward to increasing engagement with existing and prospective investors in the months to come.
I'll now turn the call over to Tom."

I would like to start by again expressing our gratitude for the medical and other frontline health care professionals who are engaged in a courageous effort to assist those who have been impacted by the COVID-19",1939,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I would like to start by again expressing our gratitude for the medical and other frontline health care professionals who are engaged in a courageous effort to assist those who have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We salute their efforts, just as we salute the efforts of our employees who continue to perform a vital public service by literally keeping the lights on and critical energy flowing.
We continue to evolve our COVID response to incorporate the most up-to-date guidance from the medical and public health community, social distancing, proper PPE and where practical remote work have become the expectation for all employees.
We're also mindful of our customers and the difficult time this has been for them. We have worked closely with regulators to take steps, including the voluntary suspension of nonpayment service disconnections and the offering of flexible payment plans to assist our customers in addressing the financial challenges they may be facing.
Turning to safety, which is our first core value on Slide 9. Our year-to-date results put us on track to make 2020 the safest year of operation in the company's more than 100-year history.
As an organization with nearly 20,000 employees and 7 million customers, our safety performance matters to thousands of families and communities, which is why it matters so much to us. The ability to impact lives on a broader scale is also why when we see an issue that deeply impacts our employees, customers and communities we get involved.
Recent social unrest, partly caused by the murder in Minneapolis, has led us to question what more we can do to assist in the cause of social justice and racial equality. Early last month, we publicly committed $5 million to social justice and community rebuilding efforts. The funds will support nonprofit organizations advocating for social justice and equality. Grants will also be designated to help minority-owned and small businesses recover from recent disruptions to their businesses.
Words can evoke sympathy, empathy, compassion and understanding. But at Dominion Energy, we believe that actions speak louder. So we're investing in recovery and reconciliation and in the vital work of overcoming years of debilitating actions, attitudes and abuses of authority that have traumatized our country. This month, we followed up on that commitment with an additional pledge of $35 million that will support 11 historically black colleges and universities, representing 35,000 students across Virginia, Ohio, North and South Carolina as well as the scholarship fund focused on African-American and underrepresented minority students across all of our service territories. These institutions have been foundational in the struggle to improve the lives of African-Americans and in the fight for social justice.
We are pleased and humbled to build on our company's nearly 40-year history of supporting historically black colleges and universities. These initiatives are a recognition of the importance of education as an equalizer in society. Across our company, we are engaging these issues like never before, listening and being heard. We are committed in taking major steps to increase the diversity of our workforce. And in recent years, we have meaningfully improved our supplier diversity.
Embracing diversity inclusion is not only the right thing to do. It is imperative to our long-term success as a company. And we are changing the way that long-term success will look, operationally and financially.
Slide 11 summarizes the highlights of our strategic repositioning, which include a narrowed focus to our premier state-regulated utility operations, which will account for approximately 85% to 90% of our operating earnings, an industry-leading clean energy profile, best-in-class long-term earnings and dividend per share growth and a low-risk business profile and healthy balance sheet. We have a vision for the future. And we are preparing our company to be at the vanguard of the energy transition that is accelerating across our country. We are investing billions of dollars in a transition that will make 0 and low-emitting resources accountable for around 95% of our company-wide electric generation by the end of 2035.
As shown on Slide 12, we have a plan described in our integrated resource plan filings to grow our renewable energy capacity on average over 15% per year for the next 15 years.
We have successfully achieved our 3,000 megawatt target for renewable generation in service or under-development in the State of Virginia, 1.5 years ahead of schedule. And we are now the third largest owner of solar capacity among utility companies in the country.
Our pilot offshore wind project, depicted on the cover of these materials, is the only project to have successfully completed the BOEM permitting process and will begin to generate electricity this quarter. Our $8 billion, 2.6 gigawatt full-scale offshore wind deployment continues on schedule. Recent permitting recommendations for Northeast wind projects are not expected to alter materially our project plans and will be accounted for when we submit our construction and operation plan later this year.
Finally, earlier this month, Virginia State Corporation Commission approved our renewable energy tariff, which enables us to offer an exciting 100% renewable energy product to our customers.
We are equally focused on emission reductions at our Gas Distribution utilities. Pipeline and other aging infrastructure replacement, extensive leak detection and repair efforts and modified operational procedures designed to capture gas that used to be ventilated -- vented during maintenance. We'll reduce the methane emissions of our natural gas utility operations 65% by the end of this decade and 80% by the end of the next.
We are also finding innovative ways to help our customers improve their sustainability. As one of the country's largest investors in renewable natural gas, we are at the forefront of the intersection of agricultural emission reductions and offering natural gas customers a green option that is actually carbon negative. Meaning that it takes more greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere than it creates when it is used by the customer. In coming months, we will share additional insights into our expanding vision for a sustainable energy future for our company and the country.
Next, let me address the upcoming Dominion Energy South Carolina rate case. Earlier this month, we made a preliminary filing that formally signaled our intent to file a general rate case proceeding next month, the first for the base electric business in South Carolina since 2012. We expect new rates based on a typical procedural schedule to be effective in March of 2021.
Since the last rate case 8 years ago, Dominion Energy South Carolina has connected over 80,000 new electric customers, representing a 12% increase and invested over $2 billion net of retirements in electric generation, transmission and distribution systems that serve customers every day.
Despite prudent cost management, the resulting earned return does not measure up to the cost of capital we must employ to maintain excellent reliability and service that our customers rely on. We estimate that our filing will imply a single-digit percentage rate increase, which will be significantly lower than the compounded rate of inflation of nearly 14% since the end of the last test year of 2011.
Customers count on us to keep the lights on and to deliver affordable and increasingly sustainable electricity. We are as committed to that ideal in South Carolina today as we were when we closed the merger.
With that, I will summarize today's call as follows: our safety performance is on track to set a new company record. We are making important financial commitments to address social justice and support African-American and other representative minority students. We achieved weather-normalized operating earnings that exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range for the 18th consecutive quarter. We affirmed our enhanced long-term earnings and dividends per share growth guidance. Our transaction with Berkshire Hathaway is on schedule for our fourth quarter closing. And we are aggressively pursuing our vision to be the most sustainable energy company in the country.
Before we turn to your questions, I want to discuss our announcement this morning about my change in role from President and CEO to Executive Chairman of Dominion, effective at the end of this quarter. I'm in my 25th year at the company, 15th year as CEO and turned 65 last December.
Three years ago, the Board began to consider various alternatives to my eventual retirement. We have undertaken a series of steps over these years. Last September, we took an important step in that process by creating the Co-Chief Operating Officer role. Today's announcement is another step in a long designed succession process.
I'm pleased to say that Bob Blue will become President and CEO on October 1, reporting to me as Executive Chair. And Diane Leopold is being promoted to Chief Operating Officer, reporting to Blue and will be responsible for all of the company's operations across our multistate footprint.
Jim Chapman, our CFO, will report to Blue as will Carter Reid, President of our Services Company; Carlos Brown, our General Counsel; Bill Murray, our Head of Corporate Affairs and Public Policy; Corynne Arnett, our Head of Regulation and Customer Experience; and Tanya Ross, our Chief Auditor. Carter Reid will also report to me in her role as Chief of Staff of Dominion.
I provide you with this detail to underscore that the team we have assembled at Dominion over the past 15 years will be the same team that carries us into the future. It is this group that has taken Dominion to the top ranks among American utilities in safety, operational excellence and compliance. It is also this team that has supported and expanded our steadfast commitment to sustainability, diversity and community engagement. These individuals, of course, did not achieve these results on their own. They were supported by thousands of others at our company who share and live our company's values. As you know, over the years, we have made significant and, in some cases, transformative changes to Dominion, like our succession process, we have taken a deliberate strategic approach to repositioning Dominion for the future.
We are now largely state-regulated, multi-utility company with a growth profile for both earnings per share and dividends among the highest in our industry. We also have one of the strongest ESG stories in this sector. From exiting oil and gas production and merchant fossil generation to emerging with Questar and SCANA, to embracing solar power, advanced storage and grid modernization, to relicensing our nuclear fleet as well as the development of the largest offshore wind farm in the Americas, it has been this team of individuals leading the way.
With our most recent strategic alignment in selling our gas storage and pipeline segment and embracing a clear path to net 0 by 2050, the Board and I thought it would be an appropriate time to take the next step in our management transition at the end of this quarter. There is no established time frame for my role as Executive Chair, and I look forward to continue to serve the company on behalf of our shareholders, customers and communities. The primary goal of our succession planning process has been to ensure continuity of our strategy, public policy, corporate values and operational excellence. This change is a step in carrying out that goal.
I will also continue to serve as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the company. As Executive Chair, I will continue to represent the company engaging with key stakeholders, industry groups and others. I will be particularly focused on continuing to develop our strategic plan and Dominion's leadership in the new clean energy economy.
And with that, we will be happy to answer your questions."

And I don't want to take time to go through all the history. But I think as you know, we've made just a ton of progress in that area over the last several years. And it's even better pro forma for the sale of the T&S business. So in that sale, almost $6 billion of the $10 billion transaction value is really, from our perspective, debt retirement. So I think the agencies have recognized that also in their commentary, as I just talked about positive outlook from S&P, et cetera.
So given that, the status of our balance sheet and the related improvements from this transaction, we feel pretty good about our plan to provide the net proceeds back to our shareholders in this buyback, which we're -- as I mentioned, we're targeting for completion by the end of the year. But that said, we do have a sizable clean energy and related capital spend program, just talked about that with James. And it's only increasing as we go through the year slowly. So therefore, we do -- even though we're doing the buyback and we're giving the net proceeds back to our shareholders, we think it's prudent. With that strong balance sheet position we're in, we do plan to recommence some equity issuance, even if it's just in this form of DRIP in 2021 and beyond. But I think the perspective is important, I mean, for spending programs of the size what we're doing, to be starting out with DRIP, less than 0.5 percentage point of our market cap a year in a pretty efficient program like DRIP. And later just with other efficient programs, all in our ATM, we think it's overall pretty modest, and we think it's the best way to go."

But we haven't bought any yet. And we retain kind of full flexibility. We can do that with open market purchases. We can do it with accelerated share repurchases, tender, Dutch auction, so more guidance to come on that through the fall as we go. We do expect still to complete that by the end of the year, even if we start sooner.
We're not guiding to any different closing time line than the kind of early fourth quarter, although that all remains on track. But then as it relates to the amount, the quantum, yes, we mentioned there's upward bias. Where is that coming from? And we'll provide more detail on that too as we go. But that comes from -- first of all, just a conservative first cut on what the tax -- cash taxes would be on this sale? We indicated about $700 million. So there's interplay there between the tax aspect of the sale and the tax aspect of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline abandonment, an impairment of Supply Header, and the interplay of our sizable tax credit position. So as we continue to do more work on that, we see probably, if anything, a downward bias in the taxes payable from $700 million and, therefore, an upper bias in the size of the buyback. And it's not huge. I mean, again, we'll come to that guidance. Is it somewhere between 0 and $200 million kind of that magnitude? And we'll provide more guidance. But again, conservative first cut, probably improving from there modestly, and we'll provide more detail on all of that as we go through the fall."

And we did get quite a bit of feedback from across the spectrum, different types of investors. And we took it all to heart. We sat around and considered a lot of that pretty carefully, including, notably, the feedback from retail investors who are very focused on the dividend and income fund investors. So we get that and took that to heart. But the feedback from, I guess, maybe longer-term investors, institutional investors and those investors, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that or North America or elsewhere, that increasingly are thinking about their investment decisions through the lens of ESG topics. That feedback was pretty positive on the long-term prospects of this transaction, repositioning the company in this way, strengthening the balance sheet, increasing the growth rate, highlighting all the -- already underway, ESG, spending programs, clean energy and related. So that feedback has been pretty good.
But it is a change -- a material change for Dominion. So we have been already and we highlighted here that we're going to spend a lot of time in the next few months just reconnecting with people, existing investors, prospective investors, or walking through that story, making sure everyone gets it, not only what we've done, but exactly what we're doing under the spending programs and the size and scale and cadence and the financing. So there's a lot to talk about. And one thing that's been consistent in all of our interactions with investors, existing perspectives in the last 3 weeks is everyone really wants to spend more time to make sure they get it and they're understanding all the dynamics. But overall, it's been pretty positive."

The pipeline was over 90% subscribed for 15 years by utility companies that we're going to use it to serve gas distribution customers and convert coal plants through natural gas facilities over the years to come.

So I really don't see anything there as well as the continued growth projects to meet the increasing demand in these high-growth areas. So really no change on the LDC side.
With respect to hydrogen, we do see that there will be an increase in hydrogen utilization in the energy mix over the next several decades. And we've certainly spent a lot of time studying it. At the moment, at least to our knowledge, no continental U.S. LDC is blending hydrogen into its supply mix today. We committed a couple of years ago to making sure our LDC system is ready to accept up to 5% hydrogen by 2030, so just in the next decade. And our initial pilot is in advanced planning stages in Utah. So high level, we think there's going to be a lot of activity in this area. But for the most part, it's still in that study and preparatory planning stage. But expect it to be ramping up and look forward to sharing updates."

Our second quarter 2020 operating earnings were $0.82 per share, which included a $0.03 hurt from worse than normal weather in our utility service territories.Weather-normalized results of $0.85 per share were at the",1310,"Thank you, Steven, and good morning. Our second quarter 2020 operating earnings were $0.82 per share, which included a $0.03 hurt from worse than normal weather in our utility service territories.
Weather-normalized results of $0.85 per share were at the top of our guidance range. And for the 18th consecutive quarter, we're at or above the quarterly guidance midpoint.
We expect a full year financial impact of weather to be more balanced than during the first 2 quarters of the year.
Preliminary data indicate that July was around $0.04 better than normal, and early predictions for August suggest potential for additional weather help.
Note that our second quarter GAAP and operating earnings are not adjusted to account for discontinued operations, given the timing of our recent announcement, but will be reflected beginning with our third quarter disclosures.
GAAP earnings for the quarter were negative $1.41 per share. This result was driven primarily by impairment-related charges associated with the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header projects. We also had a positive impact attributable to net gains on our nuclear decommissioning trust funds. As a reminder, we report such gains and losses on these funds as nonoperating. A summary of adjustments between operating and reported results is included in Schedule 2 of the earnings release kit.
On Slide 4, we're initiating the third quarter 2020 operating earnings guidance with a range of $0.85 to $1.05 per share. As mentioned, this range reflects the impact of recasting operating earnings to exclude discontinued operations. We're also affirming the 2020 annual guidance range provided on our July 6 investor call. As usual, these ranges assume normal weather. Variations from which could cause results to be towards the top or the bottom of these ranges. Typically, we provide year ago actual results alongside our guidance. Given the need to adjust historic results for discontinued operations to provide a useful point of comparison, we plan to provide these figures when we report third quarter and full year results, respectively. 
I would also note that our 2020 10-K will include 3 full years of historic results that have been adjusted to reflect the impact of discontinued operations. Finally, we are also affirming the long-term annual growth guidance we gave earlier this month for earnings and dividends per share.
I'll now turn to discuss our observations on the financial impacts of COVID-19. The graph on Slide 5 represents daily and 7-day average weather-normalized load in the PJM dom zone as compared to the 2-year historic weather-normal average. Strong residential and data center demand continues to support overall load levels that modestly exceed the historic average. This is a continuation of the theme we've seen since the pandemic began. And looking forward, we expect this trend to continue. 
We provide corresponding data for Dominion Energy South Carolina on the next slide. Recall the story here diverged from DEV and that we did experience weather-normal load degradation earlier this year. On the first quarter call, we suggested that April could represent a bottoming out with gradual improvements through the summer. Fortunately, at least so far, that has been the case with July demand only 1% off weather-normal historic averages. I would also point out that the higher volumes sold in the summer months, like July, tend to have a larger impact on our annual sales revenues than the lower volume shoulder months. We currently expect this general recovery trend to continue in South Carolina through the remainder of the year.
We estimate that through the end of June, lower-than-budgeted sales associated with the impacts of COVID-19 across our electric utility operation has impacted operating income by approximately $0.04 per share, which thus far has been largely offset with corporate initiatives. The future remains difficult to predict, so we are reiterating the demand-related earnings sensitivities that we provided on the first quarter call and which can be found in the appendix of today's presentation.
Consistent with our expectations, customer arrears have increased modestly to date. We continue to work carefully with our customers to provide options and tools to assist them in returning their accounts to current. Our GAAP results for the quarter reflect the recognition of a COVID-related reserve of around $20 million, representing our current expectation for incremental expense associated with future uncollectible accounts.
Turning now to a financing update, as shown on Slide 7, we provide detailed guidance on our equity capital raising plans. First, we are ceasing the issuance of new shares under the DRIP program with immediate effect, resulting in a total of about $160 million of new share issuance under the program in 2020, roughly half of our prior estimate. In 2021 and beyond, we'll return to our historic norm of around $300 million of new share issuance per year. Second, starting in 2022, we expect to see our at-the-market program begin to ramp up such that by 2024, our first big year of offshore wind investment were back to the $300 million to $500 million per year range that we previously articulated at Investor Day. And third, we continue to target year-end completion of the share repurchase we announced earlier this month.
Recall that the Board's authorization for the announced $3 billion buyback was with immediate effect. We currently expect that there may be some modest upward bias to this figure based on additional refinement of our overall tax analysis. We'll provide additional details around share repurchases next quarter, but would note that we have not yet repurchased any shares.
We have an exciting opportunity to deploy significant amounts of capital directed at sustainable energy and related projects. These projected modest equity financing activities will support these EPS-accretive capital investments.
Turning to fixed income, we've included in slide in the appendix detailing our very modest remaining issuance for the year. Overall, we view the debt capital markets as healthy and liquid across the spectrum of term, and we currently have nearly $7 billion in available liquidity. Our credit rating agencies responded positively to the announcements we made earlier this month. S&P revised their outlook to positive while Moody's and Fitch affirmed our ratings. In all cases, the agencies remarked on the credit positive aspects of our strategic repositioning. We expect that successful execution of our financial plan will further demonstrate the clear and positive reduction of our overall business risk profile.
Finally, before I summarize my remarks, let me give some insight into our Investor Relations strategy over the next several months, as shown on Slide 8. We are increasing our proactive outreach using virtual tools to interact with both existing and prospective shareholders throughout the world, including geographies where ESG-related factors are playing an increasingly prominent role in investment decisions. We are ramping up our investor targeting efforts to identify prospective shareholders for which our compelling, clean energy, operating and financial profile will resonate.
We plan to use our fourth quarter earnings call to provide something of an Investor Day-style refresh with supplementary appendix disclosures aimed at providing projected CapEx, rate base, and other inputs, which we hope will assist investors in their financial evaluation of our company. It's our responsibility to get our repositioning story into the market. We, therefore, look forward to connecting with many of you for discussions on these topics during the next several months.
So to summarize my remarks, we remain focused on extending our track record of delivering financial results that meet or exceed our public commitments. We feel that our businesses are well positioned with regard to COVID-related demand impacts, but we are monitoring that situation carefully. We are affirming our updated 2020 operating earnings guidance as well as the long-term operating earnings and dividend growth outlooks provided earlier this month. And finally, we look forward to increasing engagement with existing and prospective investors in the months to come.
I'll now turn the call over to Tom."

I would like to start by again expressing our gratitude for the medical and other frontline health care professionals who are engaged in a courageous effort to assist those who have been impacted by the COVID-19",1939,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I would like to start by again expressing our gratitude for the medical and other frontline health care professionals who are engaged in a courageous effort to assist those who have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We salute their efforts, just as we salute the efforts of our employees who continue to perform a vital public service by literally keeping the lights on and critical energy flowing.
We continue to evolve our COVID response to incorporate the most up-to-date guidance from the medical and public health community, social distancing, proper PPE and where practical, remote work have become the expectation for all employees.
We're also mindful of our customers and the difficult time this has been for them. We have worked closely with regulators to take steps, including the voluntary suspension of nonpayment service disconnections and the offering of flexible payment plans to assist our customers in addressing the financial challenges they may be facing.
Turning to safety, which is our first core value on Slide 9. Our year-to-date results put us on track to make 2020 the safest year of operation in the company's more than 100-year history. As an organization with nearly 20,000 employees and 7 million customers, our safety performance matters to thousands of families and communities, which is why it matters so much to us. 
The ability to impact lives on a broader scale is also why when we see an issue that deeply impacts our employees, customers and communities, we get involved. Recent social unrest, partly caused by the murder in Minneapolis, has led us to question what more we can do to assist in the cause of social justice and racial equality. Early last month, we publicly committed $5 million to social justice and community rebuilding efforts. The funds will support nonprofit organizations advocating for social justice and equality. Grants will also be designated to help minority-owned and small businesses recover from recent disruptions to their businesses.
Words can evoke sympathy, empathy, compassion and understanding. But at Dominion Energy, we believe that actions speak louder. So we're investing in recovery and reconciliation and in the vital work of overcoming years of debilitating actions, attitudes and abuses of authority that have traumatized our country. This month, we followed up on that commitment with an additional pledge of $35 million that will support 11 historically black colleges and universities, representing 35,000 students across Virginia, Ohio, North and South Carolina as well as a scholarship fund focused on African-American and underrepresented minority students across all of our service territories. These institutions have been foundational in the struggle to improve the lives of African-Americans and in the fight for social justice.
We are pleased and humbled to build on our company's nearly 40-year history of supporting historically black colleges and universities. These initiatives are a recognition of the importance of education as an equalizer in society. Across our company, we are engaged in these issues like never before, listening and being heard. We are committed in taking major steps to increase the diversity of our workforce. And in recent years, we have meaningfully improved our supplier diversity. Embracing diversity inclusion is not only the right thing to do. It is imperative to our long-term success as a company and we are changing the way that long-term success will look, operationally and financially.
Slide 11 summarizes the highlights of our strategic repositioning, which include a narrowed focus to our premier state-regulated utility operations, which will account for approximately 85% to 90% of our operating earnings, an industry-leading clean energy profile, best-in-class long-term earnings and dividend per share growth and a low-risk business profile and healthy balance sheet. We have a vision for the future and we are preparing our company to be at the vanguard of the energy transition that is accelerating across our country. We are investing billions of dollars in a transition that will make zero- and low-emitting resources accountable for around 95% of our company-wide electric generation by the end of 2035.
As shown on Slide 12, we have a plan described in our integrated resource plan filings to grow our renewable energy capacity on average over 15% per year for the next 15 years. We have successfully achieved our 3,000 megawatt target for renewable generation in service or under-development in the State of Virginia, 1.5 years ahead of schedule. And we are now the third largest owner of solar capacity among utility companies in the country.
Our pilot offshore wind project, depicted on the cover of these materials, is the only project to have successfully completed the BOEM permitting process and will begin to generate electricity this quarter. Our $8 billion, 2.6 gigawatt full-scale offshore wind deployment continues on schedule. Recent permitting recommendations for Northeast wind projects are not expected to alter materially our project plans and will be accounted for when we submit our construction and operation plan later this year. Finally, earlier this month, Virginia State Corporation Commission approved our renewable energy tariff, which enables us to offer an exciting 100% renewable energy product to our customers.
We are equally focused on emission reductions at our Gas Distribution utilities. Pipeline and other aging infrastructure replacement, extensive leak detection and repair efforts and modified operational procedures designed to capture gas that used to be ventilated -- vented during maintenance will reduce the methane emissions of our natural gas utility operations 65% by the end of this decade and 80% by the end of the next.
We are also finding innovative ways to help our customers improve their sustainability. As one of the country's largest investors in renewable natural gas, we are at the forefront of the intersection of agricultural emission reductions in offering natural gas customers a green option that is actually carbon negative, meaning that it takes lower greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere than it creates when it is used by the customer. In coming months, we will share additional insights into our expanding vision for a sustainable energy future for our company and the country.
Next, let me address the upcoming Dominion Energy South Carolina rate case. Earlier this month, we made a preliminary filing that formally signaled our intent to file a general rate case proceeding next month, the first for the base electric business in South Carolina since 2012. We expect new rates based on a typical procedural schedule to be effective in March of 2021.
Since the last rate case 8 years ago, Dominion Energy South Carolina has connected over 80,000 new electric customers, representing a 12% increase and invested over $2 billion net of retirements in electric generation, transmission and distribution systems that serve customers every day.
Despite prudent cost management, the resulting earned return does not measure up to the cost of capital we must employ to maintain excellent reliability and service that our customers rely on. We estimate that our filing will imply a single-digit percentage rate increase, which will be significantly lower than the compounded rate of inflation of nearly 14% since the end of the last test year of 2011. Customers count on us to keep the lights on and to deliver affordable and increasingly sustainable electricity. We are as committed to that ideal in South Carolina today as we were when we closed the merger.
With that, I will summarize today's call as follows: our safety performance is on track to set a new company record; we are making important financial commitments to address social justice and support African-American and underrepresented minority students; we achieved weather-normalized operating earnings that exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range for the 18th consecutive quarter; we affirmed our enhanced long-term earnings and dividends per share growth guidance; our transaction with Berkshire Hathaway is on schedule for our fourth quarter closing; and we are aggressively pursuing our vision to be the most sustainable energy company in the country.
Before we turn to your questions, I want to discuss our announcement this morning about my change of role from President and CEO to Executive Chairman of Dominion, effective at the end of this quarter. I'm in my 25th year at the company, 15th year as CEO and turned 65 last December. Three years ago, the Board began to consider various alternatives to my eventual retirement. We have undertaken a series of steps over these years. Last September, we took an important step in that process by creating the Co-Chief Operating Officer role. Today's announcement is another step in a long designed succession process.
I'm pleased to say that Bob Blue will become President and CEO on October 1, reporting to me as Executive Chair. And Diane Leopold is being promoted to Chief Operating Officer, reporting to Blue and will be responsible for all of the company's operations across our multistate footprint. Jim Chapman, our CFO, will report to Blue; as will Carter Reid, President of our Services Company; Carlos Brown, our General Counsel; Bill Murray, our Head of Corporate Affairs and Public Policy; Corynne Arnett, our Head of Regulation and Customer Experience; and Tanya Ross, our Chief Auditor. Carter Reid will also report to me in her role as Chief of Staff of Dominion.
I provide you with this detail to underscore that the team we have assembled at Dominion over the past 15 years will be the same team that carries us into the future. It is this group that has taken Dominion to the top ranks among American utilities in safety, operational excellence and compliance. It is also this team that has supported and expanded our steadfast commitment to sustainability, diversity and community engagement. These individuals, of course, did not achieve these results on their own. They were supported by thousands of others at our company who share and live our company's values. As you know, over the years, we have made significant and, in some cases, transformative changes to Dominion, like our succession process, we have taken a deliberate strategic approach to reposition Dominion for the future.
We are now largely state-regulated, multi-utility company with a growth profile for both earnings per share and dividends among the highest in our industry. We also have one of the strongest ESG stories in this sector. From exiting oil and gas production and merchant fossil generation to emerging with Questar and SCANA, to embracing solar power, advanced storage and grid modernization, to relicensing our nuclear fleet as well as the development of the largest offshore wind farm in the Americas, it has been this team of individuals leading the way.
With our most recent strategic alignment in selling our gas storage and pipeline segment and embracing a clear path to net zero by 2050, the Board and I thought it would be an appropriate time to take the next step in our management transition at the end of this quarter. There is no established time frame for my role as Executive Chair, and I look forward to continue to serve the company on behalf of our shareholders, customers and communities. The primary goal of our succession planning process has been to ensure continuity of our strategy, public policy, corporate values and operational excellence. This change is a step in carrying out that goal.
I will also continue to serve as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the company. As Executive Chair, I will continue to represent the company engaging with key stakeholders, industry groups and others.

And",311,"Yes, Shar, let me start there. So look, our balance sheet is already in the right place. And I don't want to take time to go through all the history but I think, as you know, we've made just a ton of progress in that area over the last several years. And it's even better pro forma for the sale of the T&S business. So that sale, almost $6 billion of the $10 billion transaction value is really, from our perspective, debt retirement. So I think the agencies have recognized that also in their commentary, as I just talked about positive outlook from S&P, et cetera.
So given that, the status of our balance sheet and the related improvements from this transaction, we feel pretty good about our plan to provide the net proceeds back to our shareholders in this buyback, which we're -- as I mentioned, we're targeting for completion by the end of the year. But that said, we do have a sizable clean energy and related capital spend program, just talked about that with James. And it's only increasing as we go through the year slowly. So therefore, we do -- even though we're doing the buyback and we're giving the net proceeds back to our shareholders, we think it's prudent with that strong balance sheet position we're in. 
We do plan to recommence some equity issuance, even if it's just in this form of DRIP in 2021 and beyond. But I think the perspective is important, I mean, for spending programs of the size what we're doing, to be starting out with DRIP, less than 0.5 percentage point of our market cap a year in a pretty efficient program like DRIP. And later just with other efficient programs, all in our ATM, we think it's overall pretty modest, and we think it's the best way to go."

But we haven't bought any yet. And we retain kind of full flexibility. We can do that with open market purchases. We can do it with accelerated share repurchases, tender, Dutch auction, so more guidance to come on that through the fall as we go. We do expect still to complete that by the end of the year, even if we start sooner.
We're not guiding to any different closing time line than the kind of early fourth quarter, although that all remains on track. But then as it relates to the amount, the quantum, yes, we mentioned there's upward bias. Where is that coming from? We'll provide more detail on that too as we go. But that comes from -- first of all, just a conservative first cut on what the tax -- cash taxes would be on this sale. We indicated about $700 million. So there's interplay there between the tax aspect of the sale and the tax aspect of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline abandonment, an impairment of Supply Header, and the interplay of our sizable tax credit position. 
So as we continue to do more work on that, we see probably, if anything, a downward bias in the taxes payable from $700 million and, therefore, an upper bias in the size of the buyback. And it's not huge. I mean, again, we'll come to that guidance. It sits somewhere between 0 and $200 million kind of that magnitude. And we'll provide more guidance. But again, conservative first cut, probably improving from there modestly, and we'll provide more detail on all of that as we go through the fall."

We sat around and considered a lot of that pretty carefully, including, notably, the feedback from retail investors who are very focused on the dividend and income fund investors. So we get that and took that to heart. But the feedback from, I guess, maybe longer-term investors, institutional investors and those investors, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that or North America or elsewhere, that increasingly are thinking about their investment decisions through the lens of ESG topics. That feedback was pretty positive on the long-term prospects of this transaction, repositioning the company in this way, strengthening the balance sheet, increasing the growth rate, highlighting all the -- already underway, ESG spending programs, clean energy and related. So that feedback has been pretty good.
But it is a change -- a material change for Dominion. So we have been already and we highlighted here that we're going to spend a lot of time in the next few months just reconnecting with people, existing investors, prospective investors. We're walking through that story, making sure everyone gets it, not only what we've done, but exactly what we're doing under the spending programs and the size and scale and cadence and the financing. So there's a lot to talk about. And one thing that's been consistent in all of our interactions with investors, existing perspectives in the last 3 weeks is everyone really wants to spend more time to make sure they get it and they're understanding all the dynamics. But overall, it's been pretty positive."

We have pipeline replacement programs in essentially all of those areas that are significant, and our commissions recognize the long-term nature of those programs and the need to have that infrastructure replacement for safety, reliability and sustainability. So I really don't see anything there as well as the continued growth projects to meet the increasing demand in these high-growth areas. So really no change on the LDC side.
With respect to hydrogen, we do see that there will be an increase in hydrogen utilization in the energy mix over the next several decades. And we've certainly spent a lot of time studying it. At the moment, at least to our knowledge, no continental U.S. LDC is blending hydrogen into its supply mix today. We committed a couple of years ago to making sure our LDC system is ready to accept up to 5% hydrogen by 2030, so just in the next decade. And our initial pilot is in advanced planning stages in Utah. So high level, we think there's going to be a lot of activity in this area. But for the most part, it's still in that study and preparatory planning stage. But expect it to be ramping up and look forward to sharing updates."

Our second quarter 2020 operating earnings were $0.82 per share, which included a $0.03 hurt from worse than normal weather in our utility service territories.Weather-normalized results of $0.85 per share were at the",1310,"Thank you, Steven, and good morning. Our second quarter 2020 operating earnings were $0.82 per share, which included a $0.03 hurt from worse than normal weather in our utility service territories.
Weather-normalized results of $0.85 per share were at the top of our guidance range. And for the 18th consecutive quarter, we're at or above the quarterly guidance midpoint.
We expect a full year financial impact of weather to be more balanced than during the first 2 quarters of the year.
Preliminary data indicate that July was around $0.04 better than normal, and early predictions for August suggest potential for additional weather help.
Note that our second quarter GAAP and operating earnings are not adjusted to account for discontinued operations, given the timing of our recent announcement, but will be reflected beginning with our third quarter disclosures.
GAAP earnings for the quarter were negative $1.41 per share. This result was driven primarily by impairment-related charges associated with the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header projects. We also had a positive impact attributable to net gains on our nuclear decommissioning trust funds. As a reminder, we report such gains and losses on these funds as nonoperating. A summary of adjustments between operating and reported results is included in Schedule 2 of the earnings release kit.
On Slide 4, we're initiating the third quarter 2020 operating earnings guidance with a range of $0.85 to $1.05 per share. As mentioned, this range reflects the impact of recasting operating earnings to exclude discontinued operations. We're also affirming the 2020 annual guidance range provided on our July 6 investor call. As usual, these ranges assume normal weather. Variations from which could cause results to be towards the top or the bottom of these ranges. Typically, we provide year ago actual results alongside our guidance. Given the need to adjust historic results for discontinued operations to provide a useful point of comparison, we plan to provide these figures when we report third quarter and full year results, respectively. 
I would also note that our 2020 10-K will include 3 full years of historic results that have been adjusted to reflect the impact of discontinued operations. Finally, we are also affirming the long-term annual growth guidance we gave earlier this month for earnings and dividends per share.
I'll now turn to discuss our observations on the financial impacts of COVID-19. The graph on Slide 5 represents daily and 7-day average weather-normalized load in the PJM DOM zone as compared to the 2-year historic weather-normal average. Strong residential and data center demand continues to support overall load levels that modestly exceed the historic average. This is a continuation of the theme we've seen since the pandemic began. And looking forward, we expect this trend to continue. 
We provide corresponding data for Dominion Energy South Carolina on the next slide. Recall the story here diverged from DEV and that we did experience weather-normal load degradation earlier this year. On the first quarter call, we suggested that April could represent a bottoming out with gradual improvements through the summer. Fortunately, at least so far, that has been the case with July demand only 1% off weather-normal historic averages. I would also point out that the higher volumes sold in the summer months, like July, tend to have a larger impact on our annual sales revenues than the lower volume shoulder months. We currently expect this general recovery trend to continue in South Carolina through the remainder of the year.
We estimate that through the end of June, lower-than-budgeted sales associated with the impacts of COVID-19 across our electric utility operation has impacted operating income by approximately $0.04 per share, which thus far has been largely offset with corporate initiatives. The future remains difficult to predict, so we are reiterating the demand-related earnings sensitivities that we provided on the first quarter call and which can be found in the appendix of today's presentation.
Consistent with our expectations, customer arrears have increased modestly to date. We continue to work carefully with our customers to provide options and tools to assist them in returning their accounts to current. Our GAAP results for the quarter reflect the recognition of a COVID-related reserve of around $20 million, representing our current expectation for incremental expense associated with future uncollectible accounts.
Turning now to a financing update, as shown on Slide 7, we provide detailed guidance on our equity capital raising plans. First, we are ceasing the issuance of new shares under the DRIP program with immediate effect, resulting in a total of about $160 million of new share issuance under the program in 2020, roughly half of our prior estimate. In 2021 and beyond, we'll return to our historic norm of around $300 million of new share issuance per year. Second, starting in 2022, we expect to see our at-the-market program begin to ramp up such that by 2024, our first big year of offshore wind investment were back to the $300 million to $500 million per year range that we previously articulated at Investor Day. And third, we continue to target year-end completion of the share repurchase we announced earlier this month.
Recall that the Board's authorization for the announced $3 billion buyback was with immediate effect. We currently expect that there may be some modest upward bias to this figure based on additional refinement of our overall tax analysis. We'll provide additional details around share repurchases next quarter, but would note that we have not yet repurchased any shares.
We have an exciting opportunity to deploy significant amounts of capital directed at sustainable energy and related projects. These projected modest equity financing activities will support these EPS-accretive capital investments.
Turning to fixed income, we've included in slide in the appendix detailing our very modest remaining issuance for the year. Overall, we view the debt capital markets as healthy and liquid across the spectrum of term, and we currently have nearly $7 billion in available liquidity. Our credit rating agencies responded positively to the announcements we made earlier this month. S&P revised their outlook to positive while Moody's and Fitch affirmed our ratings. In all cases, the agencies remarked on the credit positive aspects of our strategic repositioning. We expect that successful execution of our financial plan will further demonstrate the clear and positive reduction of our overall business risk profile.
Finally, before I summarize my remarks, let me give some insight into our Investor Relations strategy over the next several months, as shown on Slide 8. We are increasing our proactive outreach using virtual tools to interact with both existing and prospective shareholders throughout the world, including geographies where ESG-related factors are playing an increasingly prominent role in investment decisions. We are ramping up our investor targeting efforts to identify prospective shareholders for which our compelling, clean energy, operating and financial profile will resonate.
We plan to use our fourth quarter earnings call to provide something of an Investor Day-style refresh with supplementary appendix disclosures aimed at providing projected CapEx, rate base, and other inputs, which we hope will assist investors in their financial evaluation of our company. It's our responsibility to get our repositioning story into the market. We, therefore, look forward to connecting with many of you for discussions on these topics during the next several months.
So to summarize my remarks, we remain focused on extending our track record of delivering financial results that meet or exceed our public commitments. We feel that our businesses are well positioned with regard to COVID-related demand impacts, but we are monitoring that situation carefully. We are affirming our updated 2020 operating earnings guidance as well as the long-term operating earnings and dividend growth outlooks provided earlier this month. And finally, we look forward to increasing engagement with existing and prospective investors in the months to come.
I'll now turn the call over to Tom."

I would like to start by again expressing our gratitude for the medical and other frontline health care professionals who are engaged in a courageous effort to assist those who have been impacted by the COVID-19",1939,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I would like to start by again expressing our gratitude for the medical and other frontline health care professionals who are engaged in a courageous effort to assist those who have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We salute their efforts, just as we salute the efforts of our employees who continue to perform a vital public service by literally keeping the lights on and critical energy flowing.
We continue to evolve our COVID response to incorporate the most up-to-date guidance from the medical and public health community, social distancing, proper PPE and where practical, remote work have become the expectation for all employees.
We're also mindful of our customers and the difficult time this has been for them. We have worked closely with regulators to take steps, including the voluntary suspension of nonpayment service disconnections and the offering of flexible payment plans to assist our customers in addressing the financial challenges they may be facing.
Turning to safety, which is our first core value on Slide 9. Our year-to-date results put us on track to make 2020 the safest year of operation in the company's more than 100-year history. As an organization with nearly 20,000 employees and 7 million customers, our safety performance matters to thousands of families and communities, which is why it matters so much to us. 
The ability to impact lives on a broader scale is also why when we see an issue that deeply impacts our employees, customers and communities, we get involved. Recent social unrest, partly caused by the murder in Minneapolis, has led us to question what more we can do to assist in the cause of social justice and racial equality. Early last month, we publicly committed $5 million to social justice and community rebuilding efforts. The funds will support nonprofit organizations advocating for social justice and equality. Grants will also be designated to help minority-owned and small businesses recover from recent disruptions to their businesses.
Words can evoke sympathy, empathy, compassion and understanding. But at Dominion Energy, we believe that actions speak louder. So we're investing in recovery and reconciliation and in the vital work of overcoming years of debilitating actions, attitudes and abuses of authority that have traumatized our country. This month, we followed up on that commitment with an additional pledge of $35 million that will support 11 historically black colleges and universities, representing 35,000 students across Virginia, Ohio, North and South Carolina as well as a scholarship fund focused on African-American and underrepresented minority students across all of our service territories. These institutions have been foundational in the struggle to improve the lives of African-Americans and in the fight for social justice.
We are pleased and humbled to build on our company's nearly 40-year history of supporting historically black colleges and universities. These initiatives are a recognition of the importance of education as an equalizer in society. Across our company, we are engaged in these issues like never before, listening and being heard. We are committed in taking major steps to increase the diversity of our workforce. And in recent years, we have meaningfully improved our supplier diversity. Embracing diversity inclusion is not only the right thing to do. It is imperative to our long-term success as a company and we are changing the way that long-term success will look, operationally and financially.
Slide 11 summarizes the highlights of our strategic repositioning, which include a narrowed focus to our premier state-regulated utility operations, which will account for approximately 85% to 90% of our operating earnings, an industry-leading clean energy profile, best-in-class long-term earnings and dividend per share growth and a low-risk business profile and healthy balance sheet. We have a vision for the future and we are preparing our company to be at the vanguard of the energy transition that is accelerating across our country. We are investing billions of dollars in a transition that will make zero- and low-emitting resources accountable for around 95% of our company-wide electric generation by the end of 2035.
As shown on Slide 12, we have a plan described in our integrated resource plan filings to grow our renewable energy capacity on average over 15% per year for the next 15 years. We have successfully achieved our 3,000 megawatt target for renewable generation in service or under-development in the State of Virginia, 1.5 years ahead of schedule. And we are now the third largest owner of solar capacity among utility companies in the country.
Our pilot offshore wind project, depicted on the cover of these materials, is the only project to have successfully completed the BOEM permitting process and will begin to generate electricity this quarter. Our $8 billion, 2.6 gigawatt full-scale offshore wind deployment continues on schedule. Recent permitting recommendations for Northeast wind projects are not expected to alter materially our project plans and will be accounted for when we submit our construction and operation plan later this year. Finally, earlier this month, Virginia State Corporation Commission approved our renewable energy tariff, which enables us to offer an exciting 100% renewable energy product to our customers.
We are equally focused on emission reductions at our Gas Distribution utilities. Pipeline and other aging infrastructure replacement, extensive leak detection and repair efforts and modified operational procedures designed to capture gas that used to be ventilated -- vented during maintenance will reduce the methane emissions of our natural gas utility operations 65% by the end of this decade and 80% by the end of the next.
We are also finding innovative ways to help our customers improve their sustainability. As one of the country's largest investors in renewable natural gas, we are at the forefront of the intersection of agricultural emission reductions in offering natural gas customers a green option that is actually carbon negative, meaning that it takes lower greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere than it creates when it is used by the customer. In coming months, we will share additional insights into our expanding vision for a sustainable energy future for our company and the country.
Next, let me address the upcoming Dominion Energy South Carolina rate case. Earlier this month, we made a preliminary filing that formally signaled our intent to file a general rate case proceeding next month, the first for the base electric business in South Carolina since 2012. We expect new rates based on a typical procedural schedule to be effective in March of 2021.
Since the last rate case 8 years ago, Dominion Energy South Carolina has connected over 80,000 new electric customers, representing a 12% increase and invested over $2 billion net of retirements in electric generation, transmission and distribution systems that serve customers every day.
Despite prudent cost management, the resulting earned return does not measure up to the cost of capital we must employ to maintain excellent reliability and service that our customers rely on. We estimate that our filing will imply a single-digit percentage rate increase, which will be significantly lower than the compounded rate of inflation of nearly 14% since the end of the last test year of 2011. Customers count on us to keep the lights on and to deliver affordable and increasingly sustainable electricity. We are as committed to that ideal in South Carolina today as we were when we closed the merger.
With that, I will summarize today's call as follows: our safety performance is on track to set a new company record; we are making important financial commitments to address social justice and support African-American and underrepresented minority students; we achieved weather-normalized operating earnings that exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range for the 18th consecutive quarter; we affirmed our enhanced long-term earnings and dividends per share growth guidance; our transaction with Berkshire Hathaway is on schedule for our fourth quarter closing; and we are aggressively pursuing our vision to be the most sustainable energy company in the country.
Before we turn to your questions, I want to discuss our announcement this morning about my change of role from President and CEO to Executive Chairman of Dominion, effective at the end of this quarter. I'm in my 25th year at the company, 15th year as CEO and turned 65 last December. Three years ago, the Board began to consider various alternatives to my eventual retirement. We have undertaken a series of steps over these years. Last September, we took an important step in that process by creating the Co-Chief Operating Officer role. Today's announcement is another step in a long designed succession process.
I'm pleased to say that Bob Blue will become President and CEO on October 1, reporting to me as Executive Chair. And Diane Leopold is being promoted to Chief Operating Officer, reporting to Blue and will be responsible for all of the company's operations across our multistate footprint. Jim Chapman, our CFO, will report to Blue; as will Carter Reid, President of our Services Company; Carlos Brown, our General Counsel; Bill Murray, our Head of Corporate Affairs and Public Policy; Corynne Arnett, our Head of Regulation and Customer Experience; and Tanya Ross, our Chief Auditor. Carter Reid will also report to me in her role as Chief of Staff of Dominion.
I provide you with this detail to underscore that the team we have assembled at Dominion over the past 15 years will be the same team that carries us into the future. It is this group that has taken Dominion to the top ranks among American utilities in safety, operational excellence and compliance. It is also this team that has supported and expanded our steadfast commitment to sustainability, diversity and community engagement. These individuals, of course, did not achieve these results on their own. They were supported by thousands of others at our company who share and live our company's values. As you know, over the years, we have made significant and, in some cases, transformative changes to Dominion, like our succession process, we have taken a deliberate strategic approach to reposition Dominion for the future.
We are now largely state-regulated, multi-utility company with a growth profile for both earnings per share and dividends among the highest in our industry. We also have one of the strongest ESG stories in this sector. From exiting oil and gas production and merchant fossil generation to emerging with Questar and SCANA, to embracing solar power, advanced storage and grid modernization, to relicensing our nuclear fleet as well as the development of the largest offshore wind farm in the Americas, it has been this team of individuals leading the way.
With our most recent strategic alignment in selling our gas storage and pipeline segment and embracing a clear path to net zero by 2050, the Board and I thought it would be an appropriate time to take the next step in our management transition at the end of this quarter. There is no established time frame for my role as Executive Chair, and I look forward to continue to serve the company on behalf of our shareholders, customers and communities. The primary goal of our succession planning process has been to ensure continuity of our strategy, public policy, corporate values and operational excellence. This change is a step in carrying out that goal.
I will also continue to serve as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the company. As Executive Chair, I will continue to represent the company engaging with key stakeholders, industry groups and others. I will be particularly focused on continuing to develop our strategic plan and Dominion's leadership in the new clean energy economy.
And with that, we will be happy to answer your questions."

And",311,"Yes, Shar, let me start there. So look, our balance sheet is already in the right place. And I don't want to take time to go through all the history but I think, as you know, we've made just a ton of progress in that area over the last several years. And it's even better pro forma for the sale of the T&S business. So that sale, almost $6 billion of the $10 billion transaction value is really, from our perspective, debt retirement. So I think the agencies have recognized that also in their commentary, as I just talked about positive outlook from S&P, et cetera.
So given that, the status of our balance sheet and the related improvements from this transaction, we feel pretty good about our plan to provide the net proceeds back to our shareholders in this buyback, which we're -- as I mentioned, we're targeting for completion by the end of the year. But that said, we do have a sizable clean energy and related capital spend program, just talked about that with James. And it's only increasing as we go through the year slowly. So therefore, we do -- even though we're doing the buyback and we're giving the net proceeds back to our shareholders, we think it's prudent with that strong balance sheet position we're in. 
We do plan to recommence some equity issuance, even if it's just in this form of DRIP in 2021 and beyond. But I think the perspective is important, I mean, for spending programs of the size what we're doing, to be starting out with DRIP, less than 0.5 percentage point of our market cap a year in a pretty efficient program like DRIP. And later just with other efficient programs, all in our ATM, we think it's overall pretty modest, and we think it's the best way to go."

But we haven't bought any yet. And we retain kind of full flexibility. We can do that with open market purchases. We can do it with accelerated share repurchases, tender, Dutch auction, so more guidance to come on that through the fall as we go. We do expect still to complete that by the end of the year, even if we start sooner.
We're not guiding to any different closing time line than the kind of early fourth quarter, although that all remains on track. But then as it relates to the amount, the quantum, yes, we mentioned there's upward bias. Where is that coming from? We'll provide more detail on that too as we go. But that comes from -- first of all, just a conservative first cut on what the tax -- cash taxes would be on this sale. We indicated about $700 million. So there's interplay there between the tax aspect of the sale and the tax aspect of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline abandonment, an impairment of Supply Header, and the interplay of our sizable tax credit position. 
So as we continue to do more work on that, we see probably, if anything, a downward bias in the taxes payable from $700 million and, therefore, an upper bias in the size of the buyback. And it's not huge. I mean, again, we'll come to that guidance. It sits somewhere between 0 and $200 million kind of that magnitude. And we'll provide more guidance. But again, conservative first cut, probably improving from there modestly, and we'll provide more detail on all of that as we go through the fall."

We sat around and considered a lot of that pretty carefully, including, notably, the feedback from retail investors who are very focused on the dividend and income fund investors. So we get that and took that to heart. But the feedback from, I guess, maybe longer-term investors, institutional investors and those investors, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that or North America or elsewhere, that increasingly are thinking about their investment decisions through the lens of ESG topics. That feedback was pretty positive on the long-term prospects of this transaction, repositioning the company in this way, strengthening the balance sheet, increasing the growth rate, highlighting all the -- already underway, ESG spending programs, clean energy and related. So that feedback has been pretty good.
But it is a change -- a material change for Dominion. So we have been already and we highlighted here that we're going to spend a lot of time in the next few months just reconnecting with people, existing investors, prospective investors. We're walking through that story, making sure everyone gets it, not only what we've done, but exactly what we're doing under the spending programs and the size and scale and cadence and the financing. So there's a lot to talk about. And one thing that's been consistent in all of our interactions with investors, existing perspectives in the last 3 weeks is everyone really wants to spend more time to make sure they get it and they're understanding all the dynamics. But overall, it's been pretty positive."

We have pipeline replacement programs in essentially all of those areas that are significant, and our commissions recognize the long-term nature of those programs and the need to have that infrastructure replacement for safety, reliability and sustainability. So I really don't see anything there as well as the continued growth projects to meet the increasing demand in these high-growth areas. So really no change on the LDC side.
With respect to hydrogen, we do see that there will be an increase in hydrogen utilization in the energy mix over the next several decades. And we've certainly spent a lot of time studying it. At the moment, at least to our knowledge, no continental U.S. LDC is blending hydrogen into its supply mix today. We committed a couple of years ago to making sure our LDC system is ready to accept up to 5% hydrogen by 2030, so just in the next decade. And our initial pilot is in advanced planning stages in Utah. So high level, we think there's going to be a lot of activity in this area. But for the most part, it's still in that study and preparatory planning stage. But expect it to be ramping up and look forward to sharing updates."

Earlier this week, we completed the sale of the majority of our gas transmission and storage assets to Berkshire We expect the remaining around 20% of the transaction to close early next year. This is a major milestone in",798,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning. Earlier this week, we completed the sale of the majority of our gas transmission and storage assets to Berkshire We expect the remaining around 20% of the transaction to close early next year. This is a major milestone in the strategic repositioning of our company, and I wish to thank the nearly 1,900 employees who served our company with great distinction in the safe and reliable operation of these best-in-class assets. I have no doubt that these men and women will continue to serve their customers, which includes Dominion Energy, and their communities with the same level of dedication and professionalism. 
I also wish to thank the team at Berkshire Hathaway who have been excellent partners throughout the process and have demonstrated a strong commitment to their newly acquired employees and customers. Jim will touch on the financial details of the transaction in his prepared remarks. 
We believe that the investment proposition created through Dominion Energy's strategic repositioning is compelling. We are a pure-play state-regulated utility company, operating in some of the nation's most attractive states. We offer an industry-leading clean energy profile. In presentations in our IP filings, we have highlighted regulated and long-term contracted capital investment of up to $55 billion over the next 15 years in projects that directly reduce our emissions footprint, including offshore wind, solar, energy storage, nuclear life extension, renewable natural gas and gas delivery system modernization. That is in addition to many billions of dollars we will also invest over the next decade in complementary programs such as electric transmission, electric grid modernization, strategic undergrounding and renewable enabling quick start generation. 
Our earnings and dividend growth rates, 6.5% and 6%, respectively, are competitive with the highest valued companies in our sector. We have a strong balance sheet a significantly improved business risk profile. And we are focused on transparency and consistency and believe that our shareholders will benefit greatly from the continued execution of our business strategy. 
Turning to Virginia. Pending gubernatorial review this week, the Virginia General Assembly special session incorporated financial relief for our customers that have fallen behind on our utility service payments. In addition to extending the service disconnection moratorium and strengthening flexible repayment plan options, the budget calls for the forgiveness of customer balances that are more than 30 days in arrears as of September 30. That forgiveness, which represents around $125 million, will be appropriately accounted for during the 2021 triennial review process. Bob will provide additional commentary on the impact of COVID in our service territories in a few minutes. But suffice to say, electric demand levels continue to prove resilient, reflecting the economic strength of our premier regulated jurisdictions. 
Turning to the election for a moment. We, like everyone else, continue to monitor results. We want to see exactly how future policy reflects the final result. But in any case, we are on an unwavering and industry-leading path to net zero emissions, consistent with state level policy priorities. A more sustainable energy future is what our shareholders, customers, communities and employees want, and we intend to deliver. 
Finally, we're announcing today several important changes to our Board of Directors. First, following more than 20 years of distinguished service on our Board, including 6 years as a director, John Harris has chosen to retire from the Board effective today. John has been a critical element of our company's success over the years, sharing his diverse experiences as a business community and board leader to our organization and to me personally as a trusted adviser. 
I thank him for the outstanding leadership and strategic perspective he has provided during his service and also for his commitment as he delayed his expected retirement date through much of this year as we navigated some transformational events, including the sale of our gas transmission and storage business and also the transition to our new CEO. He will absolutely be missed. 
The Board has chosen as its new lead director, Rob Spilman, who will succeed John effective today. Rob has served as Chairman, President and CEO of Basset Furniture Industries, joined the Board in 2009 and has served as Chair of our Audit Committee since 2014. Like John Harris, Rob is a proven and experienced business leader, community leader and valued and trusted member of our Board. We look forward to working with him in his new capacity. 
I'm also pleased to announce that Bob Blue, who recently succeeded me in the role of present CEO, obviously, will be joining our Board also effective today, taking the seat vacated by John as a part of our transition plan. We look forward to having his perspective in the boardroom as both CEO and fellow Board member. 
I will now turn the call over to Jim."
267105,690968148,2130509,"Dominion Energy, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2020",2020-11-05,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tom. Our third quarter 2020 operating earnings, shown on Slide 4, were $1.08 per share, which included a $0.04 help from better-than-normal weather in our utility service territories. Weather-normalized results of $1.04 per share were at the to",778,"Thank you, Tom. Our third quarter 2020 operating earnings, shown on Slide 4, were $1.08 per share, which included a $0.04 help from better-than-normal weather in our utility service territories. Weather-normalized results of $1.04 per share were at the top of our guidance range. And for the 19th consecutive quarter, we're at or above the quarterly guidance midpoint. 
Note that our third quarter and year-to-date GAAP and operating earnings, together with comparative periods, are adjusted to account for discontinued operations associated with the sale of assets to Berkshire Hathaway Energy. 
GAAP earnings for the quarter were $0.41 per share, which includes the impact of a customer credit reinvestment offset for the benefit of customers in Virginia as well as charges associated with our long-term contracted renewable portfolio outside of our core service territories. We also had a positive impact attributable to net gains on our nuclear decommissioning trust funds. 
As a reminder, we consistently report such gains and losses on those funds as nonoperating. A summary of adjustments between operating and reporting reported results is included in Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit. 
Turning to our earnings outlook on Slide 5. As usual, our guidance ranges assume normal weather, variations from which could cause results to be toward the top or the bottom of these ranges. We are initiating fourth quarter 2020 operating earnings guidance with a range of $0.73 to $0.87 per share. As mentioned, this range reflects the impact of recasting operating earnings to exclude discontinued operations. 
Consistent with our press release in late September, we now expect our annual weather normal operating EPS to be above the midpoint, so in the top half of our annual guidance range. This strong anticipated result is partly a function of lower-than-assumed COVID-related headwinds and partly a function of continued focus on managing controllable costs carefully. 
We estimate that through the end of September, lower-than-budgeted sales associated with the impacts of COVID-19 across our electric utility operations have reduced operating income by approximately $0.05 per share, which is lower than our original expectations and thus far has been largely offset with corporate initiatives. 
Sixth, we will, as usual, provide 2021 guidance on our fourth quarter call early in the new year, but we continue to expect the midpoint of our 2021 guidance range to be between 10% and 11% higher than the midpoint of our 2020 guidance range. We are affirming our long-term annual earnings growth guidance of 6.5% off a 2021 base as well as annual dividend growth guidance of 6% post 2021. Our focus is on executing our financial plan and extending our track record of meeting or exceeding the midpoint of our guidance. 
Turning to Slide 7. Let me briefly touch on the status of the gas transmission and storage sale. As Tom mentioned, we closed on the first phase, representing over 80% of the transaction value earlier this week. We also took receipt of approximately $1.3 billion of cash in anticipation of the sale of the Questar pipeline assets, which we expect to complete early next year following HSR clearance. At that time, we will transfer control and the remaining $430 million of Questar pipeline-related indebtedness to Berkshire, bringing the total amount of debt reduction for the transaction to nearly $6 billion. 
We've now completed almost $900 million of the share repurchases in addition to the previously communicated $1.5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreements that will support ongoing stock repurchases into December. With Phase II equity proceeds now in hand, we expect to augment our repurchase activity between now and the end of the year, bringing our total share repurchases to around $3.1 billion, an increase from prior guidance of about $100 million. There are no changes to our existing equity or fixed income issuance guidance, which are replicated from previous materials in the appendix. 
Finally, just a reminder that we plan to use our fourth quarter earnings call to provide something of a mini-Investor Day style refresh, with supplementary appendix disclosures aimed at providing projected CapEx, rate base and other inputs, which we hope will assist investors in their financial evaluation of our company. 
So to summarize my remarks, we remain focused on extending our track record of delivering financial results that meet or exceed our public commitment. We aim to complete share repurchases of approximately $3.1 billion by year-end. We expect our weather normal operating earnings per share to be above the midpoint of the range for 2020. And we affirm our long-term earnings and dividend growth guidance. And we look forward to engaging with many of you at next week's EEI Financial Conference. 
I'll now turn the call over to Bob."
267105,690968148,2130509,"Dominion Energy, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2020",2020-11-05,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Let me begin with an update on the company's safety performance. As shown on Slide 8, the record-setting performance from the first half of the year continued during the third quarter, and we remain on track to deliver th",942,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Let me begin with an update on the company's safety performance. As shown on Slide 8, the record-setting performance from the first half of the year continued during the third quarter, and we remain on track to deliver the safest year of operations in the company's history. At the current pace, our annual OSHA recordable rate would be around 40% lower than last year and represent a 79% improvement since 2006. 
Turning to the pandemic. I'd like to express our gratitude to the frontline workers who continue to help people affected by COVID-19 as well as all those who are engaged in developing vaccines and new therapies. I'm also grateful for our employees who perform a vital public service by keeping homes, hospitals and businesses energized. We continue to reflect the latest public health guidance in our COVID-19 policies to keep our employees, customers and communities as safe as possible. 
The graphs on Slide 9 depict weather-normalized electric demand since the emergence of COVID-19 relative to the 2-year historic weather normal average. On the left side, demand in the PJM dom zone continues to be very resilient despite the pandemic, largely due to robust residential and data center demand. 
As shown on the right side, electric demand in South Carolina has not been quite as resilient, though we saw significant improvement from April lows through the high-volume third quarter summer months. As a reminder, impacts from COVID on our gas distribution operations are much more muted, partly as a result of decoupling and other regulatory mechanisms. 
Turning to Slide 10. We also benefit from operating in states that have proven economically resilient. During the third quarter, we saw continued improvement of utility fundamentals across our largest states. In Virginia, we continue to see strong growth in new customer connections and very strong data center demand growth. Customer growth is up 1.4% year-over-year, and year-to-date data center sales were up 19%. 
In South Carolina, year-over-year customer growth is 2.1% for electric operations and gas customer growth is 3.8%. Gas distribution utilities recorded customer growth of between 1.5% and 3.8% across Ohio, Utah and North Carolina. Unemployment levels in several of our primary states are well below the national average and have all shown dramatic improvement. 
That said, we're mindful of our customers and the difficult time this has been for many of them. As Tom discussed, we have worked to assist our customers in addressing the financial challenges they may be facing. COVID impacts remain difficult to predict. So we're reiterating the demand-related earnings sensitivities that we provided on the first quarter call, and which can be found in the appendix of today's presentation. 
Beyond our day-to-day performance, we're engaged in an enterprise-wide effort consistent with state policies to increase the sustainability of our products and services. Highlights include an updated Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Report published last month; the submission of our first renewable portfolio standard filing, which describes our plans to comply with the objectives of the Virginia Clean accounts jet; our most recent solar generation filing in Virginia, representing 9 solar facilities totaling nearly 500 megawatts; and the beginning of renewable natural gas production, which is significantly carbon negative from our first Smithfield Foods partnership facility. 
Perhaps our most notable efforts are around offshore wind. In 2013, we acquired a 112,000-acre lease 26 miles off the coast of Virginia. We were the first company to successfully complete the federal permitting process coordinated by Boom for a wind project in federal waters. That permit covered our 12-megawatt test project, which was successfully energized just weeks ago and is depicted on the cover of today's presentation materials. 
We continue to be on track to submit our permit application for our 2.6 gigawatt, $8 billion full-scale deployment at year-end. And just as a reminder, our existing leasehold acreage will fully support that project. We expect home permitting to take around 2 years, with capital investment to start to ramp-up in 2023 and full-scale construction commencing in 2024. We  do not expect that recent pronouncements regarding the future federal offshore leasing will have any impact on our plans. 
Lastly, let me address the Dominion Energy South Carolina electric rate case. We've been participating in discovery and initial testimony processes. Hearings are scheduled to begin early next year with the decision in February. We believe our proposal, which equates to less than 1% per year bill increase since the last general rate case, fairly reflects the substantial investments we've made in the last 8 years or so to connect over 80,000 new customers and achieve the reliable and responsive service that our customers deserve. We look forward to a constructive outcome for all stakeholders. 
As you heard Tom describe, we've positioned our company strategically in a way that we believe will provide the greatest long-term value to shareholders, employees and communities. Our focus now is on execution. We are well positioned across our pure-play electric and gas utilities to make investments that grow our company and deliver value for customers and investors. 
With that, I'll summarize today's call as shown on Slide 12. Our safety performance is on track to set a new company record. We achieved weather-normalized operating earnings that exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range for the 19th consecutive quarter. We affirmed our current and long-term earnings and dividend per share growth guidance. We believe we offer a compelling investment opportunity. And we're focused on executing our robust organic growth plan, and we are aggressively pursuing our vision to become the most sustainable energy company in the country. 
With that, we're ready to take your questions."

Look forward to the process with BOEM and getting that project under construction."

Obviously, as Tom mentioned, we're all watching developments, and it's pretty hypothetical at this stage, the election and any follow-on tax reform result. But yes, we're watching and we're doing some math. Really, it's pretty early. It's too early to tell. So if that happens, tax reform, we, first of all, we expect that to be addressed across our utility properties in every state in different ways like it did last time. Some of it just to rider true-ups like in Virginia and some of our larger and some of it through regulatory proceedings on that topic. But we are a cash taxpayer currently. It's heavily shielded from -- based on our tax credit position. So we currently pay, on a cash basis, 5% or so on cash taxes. So if the rate went from 21% to 28%, as is proposed, that cash tax rate would go from around 5 to around 7. So not a quantum leap. So there would be, we assume, some credit metric help there for the forecast period. We don't know enough yet to understand the quantum of that help. So it's a positive. Now is it enough to impact equity financing plan, which is part of your question, we're not there yet to say that. I would say that in light of our spending program, our investment capital program, our equity financing plan is already pretty modest. And all of that is anticipated through our existing program. So we're not quite there. We think the tax reform, if it happens, will be a positive. But we don't have the exact math yet to see how positive it would be. 
On the customer bill, the other part of your question, also hypothetical, we've done some rough math, some details. But we're seeing -- there are some differences state to state, but it probably would be kind of in the range of a 1% to 2% kind of customer bill increase.

Earlier this week, we completed the sale of the majority of our gas transmission and storage assets to Berkshire Halfway. We expect the remaining around 20% of the transaction to close early next year. 
This is a major milestone in the strategic repositioning of our company, and I wish to thank the nearly 1,900 employees who served our company with great distinction in the safe and reliable operation of these best-in-class assets. I have no doubt that these men and women will continue to serve their customers, which includes Dominion Energy, and their communities with the same level of dedication and professionalism.  
I also wish to thank the team at Berkshire Hathaway who have been excellent partners throughout the process and have demonstrated a strong commitment to their newly acquired employees and customers. Jim will touch on the financial details of the transaction in his prepared remarks.  
We believe that the investment proposition created through Dominion Energy's strategic repositioning is compelling. We are a pure-play, state-regulated utility company, operating in some of the nation's most attractive states. We offer an industry-leading clean energy profile. In presentations in our IP filings, we have highlighted regulated and long-term contracted capital investment of up to $55 billion over the next 15 years in projects that directly reduce our emissions footprint, including offshore wind, solar, energy storage, nuclear life extension, renewable natural gas and gas delivery system modernization. 
That is in addition to many billions of dollars we will also invest over the next decade in complementary programs such as electric transmission, electric grid modernization, strategic undergrounding and renewable enabling quick start generation.  
Our earnings and dividend growth rates, 6.5% and 6%, respectively, are competitive with the highest valued companies in our sector. We have a strong balance sheet a significantly improved business risk profile. And we are focused on transparency and consistency and believe that our shareholders will benefit greatly from the continued execution of our business strategy.  
Turning to Virginia. Pending gubernatorial review this week, the Virginia General Assembly special session incorporated financial relief for our customers that have fallen behind on our utility service payments. 
In addition to extending the service disconnection moratorium and strengthening flexible repayment plan options, the budget calls for the forgiveness of customer balances that are more than 30 days in arrears as of September 30. That forgiveness, which represents around $125 million, will be appropriately accounted for during the 2021 triennial review process. 
Bob will provide additional commentary on the impact of COVID in our service territories in a few minutes. But suffice to say, electric demand levels continue to prove resilient, reflecting the economic strength of our premier regulated jurisdictions.  
Turning to the election for a moment. We, like everyone else, continue to monitor results. We want to see exactly how future policy reflects the final result. But in any case, we are on an unwavering and industry-leading path to net zero emissions, consistent with state level policy priorities. A more sustainable energy future is what our shareholders, customers, communities and employees want, and we intend to deliver.  
Finally, we're announcing today several important changes to our Board of Directors. First, following more than 20 years of distinguished service on our Board, including 6 years as a director, John Harris has chosen to retire from the Board effective today. John has been a critical element of our company's success over the years, sharing his diverse experiences as a business community and board leader to our organization and to me personally as a trusted adviser. 
I thank him for the outstanding leadership and strategic perspective he has provided during his service and also for his commitment as he delayed his expected retirement date through much of this year as we navigated some transformational events, including the sale of our Gas Transmission & Storage business and also the transition to our new CEO. He will absolutely be missed.  
The Board has chosen as its new lead director, Rob Spilman, who will succeed John effective today. Rob has served as Chairman, President and CEO of Basset Furniture Industries, joined the Board in 2009 and has served as Chair of our Audit Committee since 2014. Like John Harris, Rob is a proven and experienced business leader, community leader and valued and trusted member of our Board. We look forward to working with him in his new capacity.  
I'm also pleased to announce that Bob Blue, who recently succeeded me in the role of present CEO, obviously, will be joining our Board also effective today, taking the seat vacated by John as a part of our transition plan. We look forward to having his perspective in the Boardroom as both CEO and fellow Board member.  
I will now turn the call over to Jim."
267105,690968148,2130603,"Dominion Energy, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2020",2020-11-05,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tom. Our third quarter 2020 operating earnings, shown on Slide 4, were $1.08 per share, which included a $0.04 help from better-than-normal weather in our utility service territories. Weather-normalized results of $1.04 per share were at the to",781,"Thank you, Tom. Our third quarter 2020 operating earnings, shown on Slide 4, were $1.08 per share, which included a $0.04 help from better-than-normal weather in our utility service territories. Weather-normalized results of $1.04 per share were at the top of our guidance range. And for the 19th consecutive quarter, we're at or above the quarterly guidance midpoint.  
Note that our third quarter and year-to-date GAAP and operating earnings, together with comparative periods, are adjusted to account for discontinued operations associated with the sale of assets to Berkshire Hathaway Energy.  
GAAP earnings for the quarter were $0.41 per share, which includes the impact of a customer credit reinvestment offset for the benefit of customers in Virginia as well as charges associated with our long-term contracted renewable portfolio outside of our core service territories. We also had a positive impact attributable to net gains on our nuclear decommissioning trust funds.  
As a reminder, we consistently report such gains and losses on those funds as nonoperating. A summary of adjustments between operating and reporting -- reported results is included in Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit.  
Turning to our earnings outlook on Slide 5. As usual, our guidance ranges assume normal weather, variations from which could cause results to be toward the top or the bottom of these ranges. We are initiating fourth quarter 2020 operating earnings guidance with a range of $0.73 to $0.87 per share. As mentioned, this range reflects the impact of recasting operating earnings to exclude discontinued operations.  
Consistent with our press release in late September, we now expect our annual weather-normal operating EPS to be above the midpoint, so in the top half of our annual guidance range. This strong anticipated result is partly a function of lower-than-assumed COVID-related headwinds and partly a function of continued focus on managing controllable costs carefully.  
We estimate that through the end of September, lower-than-budgeted sales associated with the impacts of COVID-19 across our electric utility operations have reduced operating income by approximately $0.05 per share, which is lower than our original expectations and thus far, has been largely offset with corporate initiatives.  
Turning now to Slide 6. We will, as usual, provide 2021 guidance on our fourth quarter call early in the new year, but we continue to expect the midpoint of our 2021 guidance range to be between 10% and 11% higher than the midpoint of our 2020 guidance range. We are affirming our long-term annual earnings growth guidance of 6.5% off a 2021 base as well as annual dividend growth guidance of 6% post 2021.  
Our focus is on executing our financial plan and extending our track record of meeting or exceeding the midpoint of our guidance. 
Turning to Slide 7. Let me briefly touch on the status of the Gas Transmission & Storage sale. As Tom mentioned, we closed on the first phase, representing over 80% of the transaction value earlier this week. We also took receipt of approximately $1.3 billion of cash in anticipation of the sale of the Questar pipeline assets, which we expect to complete early next year following HSR clearance. At that time, we will transfer control and the remaining $430 million of Questar pipeline-related indebtedness to Berkshire, bringing the total amount of debt reduction for the transaction to nearly $6 billion.  
We've now completed almost $900 million of the share repurchases in addition to the previously communicated $1.5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreements that will support ongoing stock repurchases into December. With Phase II equity proceeds now in hand, we expect to augment our repurchase activity between now and the end of the year, bringing our total share repurchases to around $3.1 billion, an increase from prior guidance of about $100 million. There are no changes to our existing equity or fixed income issuance guidance, which are replicated from previous materials in the appendix.  
Finally, just a reminder that we plan to use our fourth quarter earnings call to provide something of a mini-Investor Day style refresh, with supplementary appendix disclosures aimed at providing projected CapEx, rate base and other inputs, which we hope will assist investors in their financial evaluation of our company.  
So to summarize my remarks, we remain focused on extending our track record of delivering financial results that meet or exceed our public commitment. We aim to complete share repurchases of approximately $3.1 billion by year-end. We expect our weather-normal operating earnings per share to be above the midpoint of the range for 2020. And we affirm our long-term earnings and dividend growth guidance. And we look forward to engaging with many of you at next week's EEI Financial Conference.  
I'll now turn the call over to Bob."

Let me begin with an update on the company's safety performance. As shown on Slide 8, the record-setting performance from the first half of the year continued during the third quarter, and we remain on track to deliver the safest year of operations in the company's history. At the current pace, our annual OSHA recordable rate would be around 40% lower than last year and represent a 79% improvement since 2006.  
Turning to the pandemic. I'd like to express our gratitude to the frontline workers who continue to help people affected by COVID-19, as well as all those who are engaged in developing vaccines and new therapies. I'm also grateful for our employees who perform a vital public service by keeping homes, hospitals and businesses energized. We continue to reflect the latest public health guidance in our COVID-19 policies to keep our employees, customers and communities as safe as possible.  
The graphs on Slide 9 depict weather-normalized electric demand since the emergence of COVID-19 relative to the 2-year historic weather normal average. On the left side, demand in the PJM DOM zone continues to be very resilient despite the pandemic, largely due to robust residential and data center demand. As shown on the right side, electric demand in South Carolina has not been quite as resilient, though we saw significant improvement from April lows through the high-volume third quarter summer months. As a reminder, impacts from COVID on our Gas Distribution operations are much more muted, partly as a result of decoupling and other regulatory mechanisms.  
Turning to Slide 10. We also benefit from operating in states that have proven economically resilient. During the third quarter, we saw continued improvement of utility fundamentals across our largest states. In Virginia, we continue to see strong growth in new customer connections and very strong data center demand growth. Customer growth is up 1.4% year-over-year, and year-to-date data center sales were up 19%.  
In South Carolina, year-over-year customer growth is 2.1% for electric operations and gas customer growth is 3.8%. Gas Distribution utilities recorded customer growth of between 1.5% and 3.8% across Ohio, Utah and North Carolina. Unemployment levels in several of our primary states are well below the national average and have all shown dramatic improvement. That said, we're mindful of our customers and the difficult time this has been for many of them. As Tom discussed, we have worked to assist our customers in addressing the financial challenges they may be facing.  
COVID impacts remain difficult to predict. So we're reiterating the demand-related earnings sensitivities that we provided on the first quarter call, and which can be found in the appendix of today's presentation. 
Beyond our day-to-day performance, we're engaged in an enterprise-wide effort consistent with state policies to increase the sustainability of our products and services. Highlights include an updated Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Report published last month; the submission of our first renewable portfolio standard filing, which describes our plans to comply with the objectives of the Virginia Clean accounts jet; our most recent solar generation filing in Virginia, representing 9 solar facilities totaling nearly 500 megawatts; and the beginning of renewable natural gas production, which is significantly carbon negative from our first Smithfield Foods partnership facility. 
Perhaps our most notable efforts are around offshore wind. In 2013, we acquired a 112,000-acre lease 26 miles off the coast of Virginia. We were the first company to successfully complete the federal permitting process coordinated by BOEM for a wind project in federal waters. That permit covered our 12-megawatt test project, which was successfully energized just weeks ago and is depicted on the cover of today's presentation materials. 
We continue to be on track to submit our permit application for our 2.6 gigawatt, $8 billion full-scale deployment at year-end. And just as a reminder, our existing leasehold acreage will fully support that project. We expect BOEM permitting to take around 2 years, with capital investment to start to ramp-up in 2023 and full-scale construction commencing in 2024. We do not expect that recent pronouncements regarding the future federal offshore leasing will have any impact on our plans. 
Lastly, let me address the Dominion Energy South Carolina electric rate case. We've been participating in discovery and initial testimony processes. Hearings are scheduled to begin early next year with the decision in February. We believe our proposal, which equates to less than 1% per year bill increase since the last general rate case, fairly reflects the substantial investments we've made in the last 8 years or so to connect over 80,000 new customers and achieve the reliable and responsive service that our customers deserve. We look forward to a constructive outcome for all stakeholders. 
As you heard Tom describe, we've positioned our company strategically in a way that we believe will provide the greatest long-term value to shareholders, employees and communities. Our focus now is on execution. We are well positioned across our pure-play electric and gas utilities to make investments that grow our company and deliver value for customers and investors. 
With that, I'll summarize today's call as shown on Slide 12. Our safety performance is on track to set a new company record. We achieved weather-normalized operating earnings that exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range for the 19th consecutive quarter. We affirmed our current and long-term earnings and dividend per share growth guidance. We believe we offer a compelling investment opportunity. And we're focused on executing our robust organic growth plan, and we are aggressively pursuing our vision to become the most sustainable energy company in the country. 
With that, we're ready to take your questions."

Obviously, as Tom mentioned, we're all watching developments, and it's pretty hypothetical at this stage, the election and any follow-on tax reform result. But yes, we're watching and we're doing some math. Really, it's pretty early. It's too early to tell. So if that happens, tax reform, we, first of all, we expect that to be addressed across our utility properties in every state in different ways like it did last time. Some of it just to rider true-ups like in Virginia and some of our larger LDCs, some of it through regulatory proceedings on that topic. 
But we are a cash taxpayer currently. It's heavily shielded from -- based on our tax credit position. So we currently pay, on a cash basis, 5% or so on cash taxes. So if the rate went from 21% to 28%, as is proposed, that cash tax rate would go from around 5 to around 7. So not a quantum leap. So there would be, we assume, some credit metric help there for the forecast period. We don't know enough yet to understand the quantum of that help. So it's a positive. Now is it enough to impact equity financing plan, which is part of your question, we're not there yet to say that. I would say that in light of our spending program, our investment capital program, our equity financing plan is already pretty modest. And all of us anticipated through our existing program. 
So we're not quite there. We think the tax reform, if it happens, will be a positive. But we don't have the exact math yet to see how positive it would be. 
On the customer bill, the other part of your question, also hypothetical, just some rough math, the devil is in the detail. But we're seeing -- there are some differences state to state, but it probably would be kind of in the range of a 1% to 2% kind of customer bill increase. And it currently did not happen, but it's in that kind of modest range."

So we've learned a great deal about that, and we've learned a great deal about the other parties in the industry. It's not an enormous industry.

Earlier this week, we completed the sale of the majority of our Gas Transmission & Storage assets to Berkshire Hathaway. We expect the remaining around 20% of the transaction to close early next year. 
This is a major milestone in the strategic repositioning of our company, and I wish to thank the nearly 1,900 employees who served our company with great distinction in the safe and reliable operation of these best-in-class assets. I have no doubt that these men and women will continue to serve their customers, which includes Dominion Energy, and their communities with the same level of dedication and professionalism.  
I also wish to thank the team at Berkshire Hathaway who have been excellent partners throughout the process and have demonstrated a strong commitment to their newly acquired employees and customers. Jim will touch on the financial details of the transaction in his prepared remarks.  
We believe that the investment proposition created through Dominion Energy's strategic repositioning is compelling. We are a pure-play, state-regulated utility company, operating in some of the nation's most attractive states. We offer an industry-leading clean energy profile. In presentations in our IP filings, we have highlighted regulated and long-term contracted capital investment of up to $55 billion over the next 15 years in projects that directly reduce our emissions footprint, including offshore wind, solar, energy storage, nuclear life extension, renewable natural gas and gas delivery system modernization. 
That is in addition to many billions of dollars we will also invest over the next decade in complementary programs such as electric transmission, electric grid modernization, strategic undergrounding and renewable enabling quick start generation.  
Our earnings and dividend growth rates, 6.5% and 6%, respectively, are competitive with the highest valued companies in our sector. We have a strong balance sheet and a significantly improved business risk profile. And we are focused on transparency and consistency, and believe that our shareholders will benefit greatly from the continued execution of our business strategy.  
Turning to Virginia. Pending gubernatorial review this week, the Virginia General Assembly special session incorporated financial relief for our customers that have fallen behind on our utility service payments. 
In addition to extending the service disconnection moratorium and strengthening flexible repayment plan options, the budget calls for the forgiveness of customer balances that are more than 30 days in arrears as of September 30. That forgiveness, which represents around $125 million, will be appropriately accounted for during the 2021 triennial review process. 
Bob will provide additional commentary on the impact of COVID in our service territories in a few minutes. But suffice to say, electric demand levels continue to prove resilient, reflecting the economic strength of our premier regulated jurisdictions.  
Turning to the election for a moment. We, like everyone else, continue to monitor results. We want to see exactly how future policy reflects the final result. But in any case, we are on an unwavering and industry-leading path to net zero emissions, consistent with state level policy priorities. A more sustainable energy future is what our shareholders, customers, communities and employees want, and we intend to deliver.  
Finally, we're announcing today several important changes to our Board of Directors. First, following more than 20 years of distinguished service on our Board, including 6 years as lead director, John Harris has chosen to retire from the Board effective today. John has been a critical element of our company's success over the years, sharing his diverse experiences as a business community and board leader to our organization and to me personally as a trusted adviser. 
I thank him for the outstanding leadership and strategic perspective he has provided during his service and also for his commitment as he delayed his expected retirement date through much of this year as we navigated some transformational events, including the sale of our Gas Transmission & Storage business and also the transition to our new CEO. He will absolutely be missed.  
The Board has chosen as its new lead director, Rob Spilman, who will succeed John effective today. Rob, who served as Chairman, President and CEO of Bassett Furniture Industries, joined the Board in 2009 and has served as Chair of our Audit Committee since 2014. Like John Harris, Rob is a proven and experienced business leader, community leader and valued and trusted member of our Board. We look forward to working with him in his new capacity.  
I'm also pleased to announce that Bob Blue, who recently succeeded me in the role of President and CEO, obviously, will be joining our Board also effective today, taking the seat vacated by John as a part of our transition plan. We look forward to having his perspective in the boardroom as both CEO and fellow Board member.  
I will now turn the call over to Jim."

Note that our third quarter and year-to-date GAAP and operating earnings, together with comparative periods, are adjusted to account for discontinued operations associated with the sale of assets to Berkshire Hathaway Energy.  
GAAP earnings for the quarter were $0.41 per share, which includes the impact of a customer credit reinvestment offset for the benefit of customers in Virginia as well as charges associated with our long-term contracted renewable portfolio outside of our core service territories. We also had a positive impact attributable to net gains on our Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund.  
As a reminder, we consistently report such gains and losses on those funds as nonoperating. A summary of adjustments between operating and reporting -- reported results is included in Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit.  
Turning to our earnings outlook on Slide 5. As usual, our guidance ranges assume normal weather, variations from which could cause results to be toward the top or the bottom of these ranges. We are initiating fourth quarter 2020 operating earnings guidance with a range of $0.73 to $0.87 per share. As mentioned, this range reflects the impact of recasting operating earnings to exclude discontinued operations.  
Consistent with our press release in late September, we now expect our annual weather-normal operating EPS to be above the midpoint, so in the top half of our annual guidance range. This strong anticipated result is partly a function of lower-than-assumed COVID-related headwinds and partly a function of continued focus on managing controllable costs carefully.  
We estimate that through the end of September, lower-than-budgeted sales associated with the impacts of COVID-19 across our electric utility operations have reduced operating income by approximately $0.05 per share, which is lower than our original expectations and thus far, has been largely offset with corporate initiatives.  
Turning now to Slide 6. We will, as usual, provide 2021 guidance on our fourth quarter call early in the new year, but we continue to expect the midpoint of our 2021 guidance range to be between 10% and 11% higher than the midpoint of our 2020 guidance range. We are affirming our long-term annual earnings growth guidance of 6.5% off a 2021 base as well as annual dividend growth guidance of 6% post 2021.  
Our focus is on executing our financial plan and extending our track record of meeting or exceeding the midpoint of our guidance. 
Turning to Slide 7. Let me briefly touch on the status of the Gas Transmission & Storage sale. As Tom mentioned, we closed on the first phase, representing over 80% of the transaction value earlier this week. We also took receipt of approximately $1.3 billion of cash in anticipation of the sale of the Questar pipeline assets, which we expect to complete early next year following HSR clearance. At that time, we will transfer control and the remaining $430 million of Questar pipeline-related indebtedness to Berkshire, bringing the total amount of debt reduction for the transaction to nearly $6 billion.  
We've now completed almost $900 million of direct share repurchases in addition to the previously communicated $1.5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreements that will support ongoing stock repurchases into December. With phase 2 equity proceeds now in hand, we expect to augment our repurchase activity between now and the end of the year, bringing our total share repurchases to around $3.1 billion, an increase from prior guidance of about $100 million. There are no changes to our existing equity or fixed income issuance guidance, which are replicated from previous materials in the appendix.  
Finally, just a reminder that we plan to use our fourth quarter earnings call to provide something of a mini-Investor Day style refresh, with supplementary appendix disclosures aimed at providing projected CapEx, rate base and other inputs, which we hope will assist investors in their financial evaluation of our company.  
So to summarize my remarks, we remain focused on extending our track record of delivering financial results that meet or exceed our public commitment. We aim to complete share repurchases of approximately $3.1 billion by year-end. We expect our weather-normal operating earnings per share to be above the midpoint of the range for 2020. And we affirm our long-term earnings and dividend growth guidance. And we look forward to engaging with many of you at next week's EEI Financial Conference.  
I'll now turn the call over to Bob."

Let me begin with an update on the company's safety performance. As shown on Slide 8, the record-setting performance from the first half of the year continued during the third quarter, and we remain on track to deliver th",942,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Let me begin with an update on the company's safety performance. As shown on Slide 8, the record-setting performance from the first half of the year continued during the third quarter, and we remain on track to deliver the safest year of operations in the company's history. At the current pace, our annual OSHA recordable rate would be around 40% lower than last year and represent a 79% improvement since 2006.  
Turning to the pandemic. I'd like to express our gratitude to the frontline workers who continue to help people affected by COVID-19 as well as all those who are engaged in developing vaccines and new therapies. I'm also grateful for our employees who perform a vital public service by keeping homes, hospitals and businesses energized. We continue to reflect the latest public health guidance in our COVID-19 policies to keep our employees, customers and communities as safe as possible.  
The graphs on Slide 9 depict weather-normalized electric demand since the emergence of COVID-19 relative to the 2-year historic weather normal average. On the left side, demand in the PJM DOM zone continues to be very resilient despite the pandemic, largely due to robust residential and data center demand. As shown on the right side, electric demand in South Carolina has not been quite as resilient, though we saw significant improvement from April lows through the high-volume third quarter summer months. As a reminder, impacts from COVID on our Gas Distribution operations are much more muted, partly as a result of decoupling and other regulatory mechanisms.  
Turning to Slide 10. We also benefit from operating in states that have proven economically resilient. During the third quarter, we saw continued improvement of utility fundamentals across our largest states. In Virginia, we continue to see strong growth in new customer connections and very strong data center demand growth. Customer growth is up 1.4% year-over-year, and year-to-date data center sales were up 19%.  
In South Carolina, year-over-year customer growth is 2.1% for electric operations and gas customer growth is 3.8%. Gas Distribution utilities recorded customer growth of between 1.5% and 3.8% across Ohio, Utah and North Carolina. Unemployment levels in several of our primary states are well below the national average and have all shown dramatic improvement. That said, we're mindful of our customers and the difficult time this has been for many of them. As Tom discussed, we have worked to assist our customers in addressing the financial challenges they may be facing.  
COVID impacts remain difficult to predict. So we're reiterating the demand-related earnings sensitivities that we provided on the first quarter call, and which can be found in the appendix of today's presentation. 
Beyond our day-to-day performance, we're engaged in an enterprise-wide effort consistent with state policies to increase the sustainability of our products and services. Highlights include an updated Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Report published last month; the submission of our first Renewable Portfolio Standard filing, which describes our plans to comply with the objectives of the Virginia Clean Economy Act; our most recent solar generation filing in Virginia, representing 9 solar facilities totaling nearly 500 megawatts; and the beginning of renewable natural gas production, which is significantly carbon negative from our first Smithfield Foods partnership facility. 
Perhaps our most notable efforts are around offshore wind. In 2013, we acquired a 112,000-acre lease 26 miles off the coast of Virginia. We were the first company to successfully complete the federal permitting process coordinated by BOEM for a wind project in federal waters. That permit covered our 12-megawatt test project, which was successfully energized just weeks ago and is depicted on the cover of today's presentation materials. 
We continue to be on track to submit our permit application for our 2.6 gigawatt, $8 billion full-scale deployment at year-end. And just as a reminder, our existing leasehold acreage will fully support that project. We expect BOEM permitting to take around 2 years, with capital investment to start to ramp-up in 2023 and full-scale construction commencing in 2024. We do not expect that recent pronouncements regarding the future federal offshore leasing will have any impact on our plans. 
Lastly, let me address the Dominion Energy South Carolina electric rate case. We've been participating in discovery and initial testimony processes. Hearings are scheduled to begin early next year with the decision in February. We believe our proposal, which equates to less than 1% per year bill increase since the last general rate case, fairly reflects the substantial investments we've made in the last 8 years or so to connect over 80,000 new customers and achieve the reliable and responsive service that our customers deserve. We look forward to a constructive outcome for all stakeholders. 
As you heard Tom describe, we've positioned our company strategically in a way that we believe will provide the greatest long-term value to shareholders, employees and communities. Our focus now is on execution. We are well positioned across our pure-play electric and gas utilities to make investments that grow our company and deliver value for customers and investors. 
With that, I'll summarize today's call as shown on Slide 12. Our safety performance is on track to set a new company record. We achieved weather-normalized operating earnings that exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range for the 19th consecutive quarter. We affirmed our current and long-term earnings and dividend per share growth guidance. We believe we offer a compelling investment opportunity. And we're focused on executing our robust organic growth plan, and we are aggressively pursuing our vision to become the most sustainable energy company in the country. 
With that, we're ready to take your questions."

Obviously, as Tom mentioned, we're all watching developments, and it's pretty hypothetical at this stage, the election and any follow-on tax reform result. But yes, we're watching and we're doing some math. Really, it's pretty early. It's too early to tell. So if that happens, tax reform, we, first of all, we expect that to be addressed across our utility properties in every state in different ways like it did last time. Some of it just through rider true-ups like in Virginia and some of our larger LDCs, some of it through regulatory proceedings on that topic. 
But we are a cash taxpayer currently. It's heavily shielded from -- based on our tax credit position. So we currently pay, on a cash basis, 5% or so on cash taxes. So if the rate went from 21% to 28%, as is proposed, that cash tax rate would go from around 5% to around 7%. So not a quantum leap. So there would be, we assume, some credit metric help there for the forecast period. We don't know enough yet to understand the quantum of that help. So it's a positive. Now is it enough to impact equity financing plan, which is part of your question, we're not there yet to say that. I would say that in light of our spending program, our investment capital program, our equity financing plan is already pretty modest. And all of it's anticipated through our existing program. 
So we're not quite there. We think the tax reform, if it happens, will be a positive. But we don't have the exact math yet to see how positive it would be. 
On the customer bill, the other part of your question, also hypothetical, just some rough math, the devil is in the detail. But we're seeing -- there are some differences state to state, but it probably would be kind of in the range of a 1% to 2% kind of customer bill increase. And it currently did not happen, but it's in that kind of modest range."

Things have to be done sequentially. 
So we've learned a great deal about that, and we've learned a great deal about the other parties in the industry. It's not an enormous industry. And so we've had an opportunity to get to know a lot of folks that way. Those kind of relationships are going to be really valuable to us as we move forward with construction of this project.
