It was an excellent third quarter for Electronic Arts, with new games like the outstanding Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order as well as our dynamic live services for FIFA, Madden NFL, Apex Legends and The SIMS 4, we delivered unmatched depth and breadth to plays over the holiday season. As a result, our revenue and earnings for Q3 were above our guidance growing significantly year-over-year for the quarter. We're raising our full year guidance for the second time this fiscal year, and we are on track to post a very strong year against our original projections for FY '20.
What we delivered to players in Q3 reflects the breadth and strength of our business, our focus on quality experiences and a deep commitment to execution. We're growing our IP portfolio with more great new games, our live services are among the most popular and highest performing in the industry and we're expanding to more distribution channels so we can connect more players to the games they love. As a result, players are deeply engaged in our top games, sentiment scores are strong and we are building momentum in the growth areas of our business. I'll touch on a few highlights here.
Our portfolio of Star Wars games across all platforms has never been stronger. Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order was the action adventure game that fans were looking for this holiday season. Respawn delivered an expertly crafted, high-quality experience with outstanding gameplay that thrilled players made many of the game of the year lists and sold beyond our projections for the quarter. In addition to Jedi: Fallen Order, the quality of the Star Wars Battlefront II experience is shining through as well. Two years and dozens of content updates later spanning all 3 trilogies and more, critics have rereviewed the game to high scores, player sentiment is exceptional and the celebration edition helped to drive performance at Battlefront II that was significantly above our Q3 expectations. Our communities in both Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes and Star Wars: The Old Republic are thriving as well. The power of the Star Wars franchise continues to endure and grow across generations and geographies, and we look forward to continuing our momentum with Disney and Lucasfilms.
It's nearly 1 year since we took the industry by storm with Apex Legends, and the strength and opportunity of this IP and live service continued to grow. Apex is an outstanding example of the innovation across our portfolio. Seasons of new content are coming at a regular cadence for the growing global community. Season 3 was bigger than season 2 with higher peaks in daily active users. Within those seasons, in-game events are engaging players with content and challenges that show the imagination and creativity that we are continually pouring into the experience. We're also expanding the Apex universe with more ways to play and watch. We have plans to reach more platforms in FY '21, and there's a lot of excitement in the esports community for the Apex Legends global series that is now underway. We're pleased to have Lenovo as an official sponsor for Apex competitive gaming joining Gillette, Snickers, Pizza Hut and other major brands and broadcast networks partnering with us on our esports portfolio.
It's been a great year for EA SPORTS around the world. Madden NFL 20 and FIFA 20 are both demonstrating how exciting and fresh our sports games can be for new and established fans alike. Madden NFL 20 is our most successful game ever in the franchise, setting multiple records for player engagement and the highest net bookings through a holiday quarter. Our FIFA franchise also grew year-over-year in Q3. VOLTA FOOTBALL brought all new dimension to FIFA 20, and the updates to FIFA Ultimate Team have been deeply engaging for fans with fight matches up nearly 40% year-over-year from launch through Q3.
FIFA 20 is also the #1 most engaged title in our subscription services. We're now getting ready to launch 2 major additions to the FIFA 20 experience with a prestigious South American club tournaments, CONMEBOL Libertadores and CONMEBOL Sud Americano as well as the Y Libertadores, a new expansion to our FIFA 20 global series esports competitions. In addition to South America, Asia is another growth market for our FIFA franchise with FIFA online up significantly year-over-year in Q3.
In other dimensions of our portfolio, we now have more than 20 million unique players worldwide in The Sims 4 life-to-date. Our eighth expansion pack for the game, Discover University, continue to demonstrate the creative ways we can add to this experience for our amazing Sims community. As did the surprise addition of the child from the Mandalorian series on Disney+ just before the holidays. Meanwhile, PvZ Battle for Neighborville and Need for Speed Heat both brought fun and new experiences to fans around the world.
Our people are our greatest resource at Electronic Arts, and this year has been a demonstration of how the creativity and technical expertise of our teams working together around the world allows us to deliver an unmatched breadth of entertainment to players. From FIFA to Star Wars, Apex and Madden, to Sims to Need for Speed and more, we have the titles that fans around the world recognize and love to play. The addition of great new games and experiences is also vital to growth, and we're excited to do that in the year ahead through more of our own IP, with partner in indie content and some more surprises to come.
Live services are delivering value for players and continuing growth for our business. Our teams are among the best in the industry, it is constantly building on feedback to expand and enhance the experience for players. The content updates and in-game events in Ultimate Team, creative and original new seasons in Apex Legends that expand the game and its characters, new content in The Sims 4 that continues to add player choice and more content across our top mobile titles around the world, live services will continue to be a key focus and growth driver for us in Q4 and the year ahead. 
With the strength of our IP and live services, we're well positioned for growth as the audience expands and diversifies into new forms of content. We are bringing our games and IP to new regions, including continued [Audio Gap] mobile growth in Asia and plans to launch Apex Legends in China. With our subscription services now available on 3 major platforms and coming to Steam in FY '21, we're expanding our leadership in high-value, low-friction subscriptions for more players. 
And with FIFA and Madden continuing to grow as leading esports properties, we're bringing Apex Legends competition to the global stage, and we have exciting plans for new content in esports as we move into the next fiscal year. We're looking forward to finishing this year strong, delivering for players and continuing our growth into FY '21.
Now I'll hand the call over to Blake."

That brings the total for calendar 2019 to 8. Launching 8 major games at quality",1181,"Thanks, Andrew. EA successfully launched 3 games last quarter: Need for Speed Heat; Plants vs. Zombies Battle for Neighborville; and, of course, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. That brings the total for calendar 2019 to 8. Launching 8 major games at quality in a year is a substantial undertaking, but that number only tells part of the story. For example, Battlefield V, we launched a whole new theater of war with maps, vehicles, weapons and more driving a major shift in engagement. For Star Wars Battlefront II, we introduced game-changing heroes, fan favorite reinforcements, exotic planets and epic new ways to play across 3 cinematic eras. For Apex Legends, we launched 3 seasons of content, including 3 new legends, 5 in-game events, 3 town takeovers and a whole new map of 6 new game modes. Delivering quality entertainment at this level testifies to how well the teams are aligned across the company and the way in which we unite to achieve our goals. And it works, we had another great quarter, with record net bookings and live services as a whole and in FIFA and Madden Ultimate Teams in particular. Apex Legends is having a fantastic season, and we delivered a new hit with the launch of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. As a result, we generated record operating cash flow over the last 12 months.
EA's net revenue was $1.593 billion and operating expenses were $724 million. GAAP operating income was $361 million and resulted in earnings per share of $1.18, $0.26 better than our guidance. The year-on-year increase in OpEx was largely driven by variable compensation, which flexes up and down depending on company performance against plan. Remember that the true-up in Q3 last year was negative that, combined with a positive true-up this year creates a $58 million swing year-on-year. There was also underlying growth in R&D as we continue to invest in-game development.
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $1.104 billion, up $150 million last year. Operating cash flow for the trailing 12 months was a record at $1.898 billion. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $28 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $1.076 billion. See our earnings slides for further details on this information.
During the quarter, we repurchased 3.1 million shares at a cost of $305 million. We've now returned to shareholders over $2 billion of the $2.4 billion in our 2-year buyback program that we began in May 2018. We will announce our future plans on our May earnings call. 
Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $5.6 billion. Total net bookings for the quarter were $1.978 billion, up 23% on the prior year despite a $39 million FX headwind. Sales of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order significantly beat our expectations. We had forecast 6 million to 8 million units for the fiscal year, but to hit the high end of that in the third quarter, and now we anticipate selling around 10 million units in the fiscal year, a very strong result for a single-player action game.
Madden NFL 20 is delivering the best performance in Madden's more than 30-year history. Average selling prices were strong across the portfolio with discounts smaller and applied later in the year. 
Diving into digital net bookings. Digital net bookings were $1.444 billion, up 20% on [ the year ago period ]. Digital net bookings now represent 77% of our business on a trailing 12-month basis. This compares to 74% in the prior year. Live service net bookings were up 27% to $993 million. Nothing illustrates the changing nature of our business model like the growth of our live services, and $993 million is an all-time high. Growth was led by Apex Legends but closely followed by double-digit growth in FIFA and Madden Ultimate Teams. Growth in FIFA online in Asia was also extremely strong. 
Mobile delivered net bookings of $134 million, down 6% year-over-year but above our expectations, driven by titles across the breadth of our portfolio, particularly in Asia. Including our IP-licensed deals, such as the one for Command & Conquer: Red Alert in China, mobile is up year-on-year at constant currency. With many promising titles in incubation at EA, we are excited about the opportunities ahead for us in the mobile market. 
Full game PC and console downloads generated net bookings of $317 million, 16% higher than last year. Growth was driven by increased game sales plus the ongoing shift to digital. Overall, 49% of our units sold through were digital rather than physical, measured on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 over the last 12 months. This compares to 47% a year ago. We continue to model underlying annual growth of around 5 percentage points for digital. 
Turning to guidance, we expect full year GAAP net revenue to be $5.475 billion and for diluted earnings per share to be $9.90. We expect operating cash flow of about $1.725 billion. We continue to anticipate capital expenditures of around $140 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.585 billion, $135 million above where our expectations were at the start of the year. We now anticipate fiscal 2020 net bookings of $5.15 billion, up $25 million over our prior guidance and up $50 million from where we started the year. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect net revenue of $1.325 billion, cost of revenue to be $257 million and operating expenses of $724 million. OpEx is down year-on-year, reflecting the 2 new IPs we launched last year. This results in a diluted earnings per share of $1.05 for the fourth quarter, using the diluted share count of 293 million shares. 
We anticipate net bookings for the quarter to be $1.152 billion. This is slightly down year-on-year, with broad-based strength this year offset by the massive launch quarter for Apex Legends and Anthem last year.
Looking forward to fiscal 2021, our goal is to continue to grow net bookings and underlying profitability even as we invest in new platforms. We anticipate live services to be the primary growth driver, followed by the launch of new content across a broad range of genres. We're launching 4 sports titles, including new games in our blockbuster FIFA and Madden franchises, 4 other titles that draw from the breadth of our IP and we'll also publish 4 titles globally from smaller developers. Finally, we expect 2 new mobile titles to make it into soft launch.
We expect growth to accelerate in fiscal 2022 as we leveraged the growing base of next-generation consoles with the launch of a new Battlefield. This is on top of the launches of FIFA 22 and Madden NFL 22, plus new and ongoing live services and other titles. We create long-term value by growing strong live services, launching new content and expanding our reach. This broad-based model reduces our dependency on individual titles, decreases risks and enables us to deliver financial results for our shareholders through a constant stream of high-quality entertainment for our players. 
Now I'll hand the call back to Andrew to offer some final thoughts."

We're looking forward to delivering more amazing games from our top franchises new IP, new partner indie titles and some other surprises in FY '21 and beyond. 
Live services extend and enhance the experience for players in their favorite games and enables strong ongoing growth for our business. We design experiences for longevity, creating communities where our players love to connect, share and compete with friends for months and years to come. Our live services for Apex Legends, EA SPORTS Ultimate Team, The Sims 4, Star Wars and more continue to grow in player engagement, and will bring more great creative content and in-game events to those communities throughout the year ahead. 
Great games and strength in live services also position us well in additional growth areas. New consoles are coming, and we'll be ready to leave with some of our top titles. Our esports portfolio will expand to 4 franchises this year with content designed for a wide audience and a growing range of sponsors.
We continue to add to the value of our subscription offerings, reaching more play through more distribution channels and expanding to audiences in more geographies with IP that they can't wait to play. It's an exciting time of growth in the interactive entertainment industry, and a great time to be making amazing games and bringing them to more players around the world.

And part of the reason why we have this breadth and depth in our portfolio is because as the player base continues to grow, so do their motivations. As we think about making games, we think about the motivations of why people want to play: inspiration, escape, social connection, creation, self-improvement, all these types of things. And as we start to look at the broader player base, and we think about each of the cohorts within that, we're looking to build experiences that satisfy their needs and motivations. And what we've come to understand, particularly with Star Wars is it's a really, really big fan base. And while social interaction, competition and multiplayer is really important for a large part of that fan base, what we have seen through the last quarter is it also is that inspiration and escape model, that living the Jedi journey, the Jedi story. As we think about this on a go-forward basis, you should imagine that we will continue with the breadth and depth across the IP in order to meet the needs and motivations of that broad player base."

And so we feel really good about that number. The other thing that's important to understand is, this also has a layering effect. So as we launch games that have live services that last 1, 2, 3, and in some cases, 4 and 5 years, the build that we get over time and the predictability and longevity and our revenue stream is really, really strong. And so I think 8's probably a pretty good number. Some years, there might be a few more of that. Some it might be a few less than that, but we feel really good. The other thing that we're starting to see is that with the reach and the network power that we have, with subscriptions and our ability to reach players in this high-value, low-friction business model, we now have a lot of other third parties and indies coming to speak with us about distribution of their content.

I would tell you our studio leadership team has brought some really, really high-powered compelling leaders from the broader mobile industry into the company. They are coming in and working with our teams, and just changing a philosophy around how we think about the creation of really compelling content and the monetization of that content. And we're starting to see that pay out.

They've taken some great learning from feedback they've received from the community, and we'll continue to build on that in the years to come. And while we don't have any announcements yet on monetization, a lot of player feedback is that they would also like to see the opportunity to extend and enhance that VOLTA experience in a way they do with other live services.

The thing you need to remember on Ultimate Team is we continue to refine and improve the weekly or monthly events that we're running on Ultimate Team that bring people into play. People won't play Ultimate Team if they're not having fun. And so the key is how do you build an event that they're going to have fun competing and interacting. It's a social network, and it's all about the design of events. And I think the team continues to get better and better every year, either refining existing events or adding new events, and that's what really drives the overall monetization in Ultimate Team across all of our sports. And it's the thing that people sometimes don't understand when it comes to live services, that it's not about the monetization. It's about how do you create fun for people to be able to come in and enjoy social connection and that competition with others. And that's what really drives that across all of our live services."

I don't think we have any new news on guidance for anything else. Obviously, we've tried to give people some sense of what next year looks like. As I said in my prepared remarks, we would like to -- our goal is to drive both top line and bottom line guidance, and we think we've set up a slate of properties for next year to do that.

The team has done an amazing job of continuing to innovate and add content and also leverage an incredibly engaged audience to try to feed them and give them things that they wanted to continue to play in the game and excitement and surprise. We will continue that journey, no different than we've done with live services. You -- people sometimes forget, Ultimate Team was like an $8 million business 12 years ago. And our goal is to always be innovating and improving over time to try to grow the business, and that's how we're thinking about Apex. And we've continued to bolster the team with new talent, new live service talent, but also make sure that the existing team is very focused on how they're building out the business and rewarded for their great efforts there. I mean, it's just an incredible job they've done. It's hard for us to predict. If you would have asked us a month ago, 6 months ago, we probably wouldn't have known. And we still don't know, but our goal is to continue to grow that business and to maintain. But when we come to our May guidance, we'll try to give some people some sense of it. What we are -- we're going to stop talking about monthly or weekly or daily active users because I'm not sure what anyone can do with that information. And if anyone questions that I they go back 7.5 years ago to my very first quarter at the company, where I said, ""we will take away metrics that don't make sense for investors."" And we're not necessarily trying to hold back any information. We're not signaling anything. We just realized that we want to make sure you're not doing something with numbers that don't make sense.

So it's hard to understand if people came in and then went out because they're still playing the game. We have not seen big changes in churn. It's  been a big question for us because we don't have titles coming in every single month from our portfolio. So you're always going to wonder about churn. But it's -- we're continuing to grow the subscription business on origin as well as on our partners. And we think any time we've added new content that drives people in. Even -- we believe when we put Jedi in regular subscription, which will be still months from now, we're sure that, that will also bring people in. 
And the most important part is -- what we found out is people actually come in for certain titles. We know this because we watch the data before they joined the subscription and after. And we find out they play titles that they've never played before and then start playing them a lot. So we've reduced the barrier of trial. They don't have to go and buy the game, they actually get a chance to just try it inside the subscription.

More and more people come in each season and start to gain excitement around what they're seeing and build around the social network.
No more color yet on the forward looking. Obviously, you can assume that the base set of sports games will be in every year.

And that Maxis team and the teams that have been part of Maxis over the years, continue to deliver unbelievably innovative and create content for a constantly growing Sims community globally. As we think about The Sims, again, I referenced the motivations of why we play games earlier, inspiration, escape, social interaction, creation, self-improvement, competition. Typically, what the Sims has done is really focused on fulfilling the motivations of inspiration, escape, creation, self-improvement, these type, and not necessarily focused as much on social interaction and competition. But a few things are, in fact, true over the years. One is that The Sims community has continued to grow. And with the broader social platforms continue to connect with each other and share what they do in and around the game they play. And we've seen that manifest in games like Sims Freeplay which was a more social experience for us. And we're also seeing that the competition nature of The Sims is also rising up. And we're seeing people compare and contrast not competition in the traditional sports sense but how they create and what they create and how they use their imaginations and what they're able to build inside of their Sims universes. And so as Maxis continues to think about the Sims for a new generation across platforms in a cloud-enabled world. You should imagine that while we will always stay true to our inspiration, escape, creation, self improvement motivations that this notion, social interaction and competition, like the kind of things that were actually present in assumes free play -- sorry, in the Sims online many, many years ago, that they will start to become part of the ongoing Sims experience in the years to come. We're very excited. This is a game that it really doesn't have any competition in its category for delivering and fulfilling these motivations for players and we think it's a tremendous growth opportunity for us for many, many years to come."

So in a relatively small title, so that wasn't a big driver. And then Need for Speed's kind of as we expected. We did, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks that, this year, we had stronger pricing than we have in the past, and we did discounts later in the season than we did in the past.

You might recall that we announced that Vince was leading a creative council for the organization. What this creative council does, it kind of operates like a brain trust like was happening at Pixar and really brings creative leaders across the company together to review and comment, be constructive and help and provide insight across the broad set of creative initiatives that we have going on. And Vince is very proactive in that and very involved in that, and that's having a tremendous impact across the company and helping us drive this kind of aligned, focused push against both quality and execution. 
With him taking on DICE LA, traditionally, DICE LA have been supporting DICE Stockholm, but they have a great creative team there and great creative leadership and have also been incubating some other things, and we're very excited about those things, and Vince will be deeply involved in those as he takes on leadership of that. And then with the leadership change that we made in Stockholm, we've got really strong traction against the next Battlefield game. I'm really -- I talked about this last call.

So we're very excited about he and the whole team as to how they've integrated into the company. It's never easy to be a small company and get acquired by a big company. And I think what the Respawn team, hopefully has found out is that we're actually not bad guys, and we're pretty fun to work with. Bad people, sorry, didn't mean to say bad guys because Laura's a really good lady. But I just want people to know. I mean, we try to leverage -- and it's not just Vince, it's people across our entire portfolio. We try to leverage our best sports experts, our best, our best managers wherever they are.

It was an excellent third quarter for Electronic Arts. With new games like the outstanding Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order as well as our dynamic live services for FIFA, Madden NFL, Apex Legends and The SIMS 4, we delivered unmatched depth and breadth to players over the holiday season. As a result, our revenue and earnings for Q3 were above our guidance, growing significantly year-over-year for the quarter. We're raising our full year guidance for the second time this fiscal year, and we are on track to post a very strong year against our original projections for FY '20.
What we delivered to players in Q3 reflects the breadth and strength of our business, our focus on quality experiences and a deep commitment to execution. We're growing our IP portfolio with more great new games. Our live services are among the most popular and highest performing in the industry, and we're expanding to more distribution channels so we can connect more players to the games they love. As a result, players are deeply engaged in our top games, sentiment scores are strong, and we are building momentum in the growth areas of our business. I'll touch on a few highlights here.
Our portfolio of Star Wars games across all platforms has never been stronger. Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order was the action adventure game that fans were looking for this holiday season. Respawn delivered an expertly crafted, high-quality experience with outstanding gameplay that thrilled players made many of the game of the year lists and sold beyond our projections for the quarter. In addition to Jedi: Fallen Order, the quality of the Star Wars Battlefront II experience is shining through as well. Two years and dozens of content updates later spanning all 3 trilogies and more, critics have rereviewed the game to high scores, player sentiment is exceptional, and the Celebration edition helped to drive performance of Battlefront II that was significantly above our Q3 expectations. Our communities in both Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes and Star Wars: The Old Republic are thriving as well. The power of the Star Wars franchise continues to endure and grow across generations and geographies, and we look forward to continuing our momentum with Disney and Lucasfilms.
It's nearly 1 year since we took the industry by storm with Apex Legends, and the strength and opportunity of this IP and live service continued to grow. Apex is an outstanding example of the innovation across our portfolio. Seasons of new content are coming at a regular cadence for the growing global community. Season 3 was bigger than Season 2 with higher peaks in daily active users. Within those seasons, in-game events are engaging players with content and challenges that show the imagination and creativity that we are continually pouring into the experience. We're also expanding the Apex universe with more ways to play and watch. We have plans to reach more platforms in FY '21, and there's a lot of excitement in the esports community for the Apex Legends Global Series that is now underway. We're pleased to have Lenovo as an official sponsor for Apex competitive gaming, joining Gillette, Snickers, Pizza Hut and other major brands and broadcast networks partnering with us on our esports portfolio.
It's been a great year for EA SPORTS around the world. Madden NFL 20 and FIFA 20 are both demonstrating how exciting and fresh our sports games can be for new and established fans alike. Madden NFL 20 is our most successful game ever in the franchise, setting multiple records for player engagement and the highest net bookings through a holiday quarter. Our FIFA franchise also grew year-over-year in Q3. VOLTA FOOTBALL brought all new dimension to FIFA 20, and the updates to FIFA Ultimate Team have been deeply engaging for fans with fight matches up nearly 40% year-over-year from launch through Q3.
FIFA 20 is also the #1 most engaged title in our subscription services. We're now getting ready to launch 2 major additions to the FIFA 20 experience with the prestigious South American club tournaments, CONMEBOL Libertadores and CONMEBOL Sudamericano as well as the eLibertadores, a new expansion to our FIFA 20 Global Series esports competitions. In addition to South America, Asia is another growth market for our FIFA franchise, with FIFA online up significantly year-over-year in Q3.
In other dimensions of our portfolio, we now have more than 20 million unique players worldwide in The Sims 4 life-to-date. Our eighth expansion pack for the game, Discover University, continue to demonstrate the creative ways we can add to this experience for our amazing Sims community, as did the surprise addition of The Child from The Mandalorian series on Disney Plus just before the holidays. Meanwhile, PvZ: Battle for Neighborville and Need for Speed Heat both brought fun and new experiences to fans around the world.
Our people are our greatest resource at Electronic Arts, and this year has been a demonstration of how the creativity and technical expertise of our teams working together around the world allows us to deliver an unmatched breadth of entertainment to players. From FIFA to Star Wars, Apex to Madden, The Sims to Need for Speed and more, we have the titles that fans around the world recognize and love to play. The addition of great new games and experiences is also vital to growth, and we're excited to do that in the year ahead through more of our own IP with partner and indie content and some more surprises to come.
Live services are delivering value for players and continuing growth for our business. Our teams are among the best in the industry. It is constantly building on feedback to expand and enhance the experience for players. The content updates and in-game events in Ultimate Team, creative and original new seasons in Apex Legends that expand the game and its characters, new content in The Sims 4 that continues to add player choice and more content across our top mobile titles around the world, live services will continue to be a key focus and growth driver for us in Q4 and the year ahead. 
With the strength of our IP and live services, we're well positioned for growth as the audience expands and diversifies into new forms of content. We are bringing our games and IP to new regions, including continued mobile growth in Asia and plans to launch Apex Legends in China. With our subscription services now available on 3 major platforms and coming to Steam in FY '21, we're expanding our leadership in high-value, low-friction subscriptions for more players. 
And with FIFA and Madden continuing to grow as leading esports properties, we're bringing Apex Legends competition to the global stage, and we have exciting plans for new content in esports as we move into the next fiscal year. We're looking forward to finishing this year strong, delivering for players and continuing our growth into FY '21.
Now I'll hand the call over to Blake."

EA successfully launched 3 games last quarter: Need for Speed Heat; Plants vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville; and, of course, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. That brings the total for calendar 2019 to 8. Launching 8 major games at quality in a year is a substantial undertaking, but that number only tells part of the story. For example, Battlefield V, we launched a whole new theater of war with maps, vehicles, weapons and more driving a major shift in engagement. For Star Wars Battlefront II, we introduced game-changing heroes, fan-favorite reinforcements, exotic plants -- planets and epic new ways to play across 3 cinematic eras. For Apex Legends, we launched 3 seasons of content, including 3 new legends, 5 in-game events, 3 town takeovers and a whole new map of 6 new game modes. Delivering quality entertainment at this level testifies to how well the teams are aligned across the company in a way in which we unite to achieve our goals. And it works. We had another great quarter, with record net bookings and live services as a whole and in FIFA and Madden Ultimate Teams in particular. Apex Legends is having a fantastic season, and we delivered a new hit with the launch of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. As a result, we generated record operating cash flow over the last 12 months.
EA's net revenue was $1.593 billion and operating expenses were $724 million. GAAP operating income was $361 million and resulted in earnings per share of $1.18, $0.26 better than our guidance. The year-on-year increase in OpEx was largely driven by variable compensation, which flexes up and down depending on company performance against plan. Remember that the true-up in Q3 last year was negative that, combined with a positive true-up this year, creates a $58 million swing year-on-year. There was also underlying growth in R&D as we continue to invest in game development.
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $1.104 billion, up $150 million last year. Operating cash flow for the trailing 12 months was a record at $1.898 billion. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $28 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $1.076 billion. See our earnings slides for further details on this information.
During the quarter, we repurchased 3.1 million shares at a cost of $300 million -- $305 million. We've now returned to shareholders over $2 billion of the $2.4 billion in our 2-year buyback program that we began in May 2018. We will announce our future plans on our May earnings call. 
Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $5.6 billion. Total net bookings for the quarter were $1.978 billion, up 23% on the prior year despite a $39 million FX headwind. Sales of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order significantly beat our expectations. We had forecast 6 million to 8 million units for the fiscal year, but to hit the high end of that in the third quarter, and now we anticipate selling around 10 million units in the fiscal year, a very strong result for a single-player action game.
Madden NFL 20 is delivering the best performance in Madden's more than 30-year history. Average selling prices were strong across the portfolio with discounts smaller and applied later in the year. 
Diving into digital net bookings. Digital net bookings were $1.444 billion, up 20% on a year ago period. Digital net bookings now represent 77% of our business on a trailing 12-month basis. This compares to 74% in the prior year. Live service net bookings were up 27% to $993 million. Nothing illustrates the changing nature of our business model like the growth of our live services, and $993 million is an all-time high. Growth was led by Apex Legends but closely followed by double-digit growth in FIFA and Madden Ultimate Teams. Growth in FIFA Online in Asia was also extremely strong. 
Mobile delivered net bookings of $134 million, down 6% year-over-year but above our expectations, driven by titles across the breadth of our portfolio, particularly in Asia. Including our IP-licensed deals, such as the one for Command & Conquer: Red Alert in China, Mobile is up year-on-year at constant currency. With many promising titles in incubation at EA, we are excited about the opportunities ahead for us in the mobile market. 
Full game PC and console downloads generated net bookings of $317 million, 16% higher than last year. Growth was driven by increased game sales plus the ongoing shift to digital. Overall, 49% of our units sold through were digital rather than physical, measured on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 over the last 12 months. This compares to 47% a year ago. We continue to model underlying annual growth of around 5 percentage points for digital. 
Turning to guidance. We expect full year GAAP net revenue to be $5.475 billion and for diluted earnings per share to be $9.90. We expect operating cash flow of about $1.725 billion. We continue to anticipate capital expenditures of around $140 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.585 billion, $135 million above where our expectations were at the start of the year. We now anticipate fiscal 2020 net bookings of $5.15 billion, up $25 million over our prior guidance and up $50 million from where we started the year. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect net revenue of $1.325 billion, cost of revenue to be $257 million and operating expenses of $724 million. OpEx is down year-on-year, reflecting the 2 new IPs we launched last year. This results in a diluted earnings per share of $1.05 for the fourth quarter, using the diluted share count of 293 million shares. 
We anticipate net bookings for the quarter to be $1.152 billion. This is slightly down year-on-year, with broad-based strength this year offset by the massive launch quarter for Apex Legends and Anthem last year.
Looking forward to fiscal 2021, our goal is to continue to grow net bookings and underlying profitability even as we invest in new platforms. We anticipate live services to be the primary growth driver, followed by the launch of new content across a broad range of genres. We're launching 4 sports titles, including new games in our blockbuster FIFA and Madden franchises, 4 other titles that draw from the breadth of our IP, and we'll also publish 4 titles globally from smaller developers. Finally, we expect 2 new mobile titles to make it into soft launch.
We expect growth to accelerate in fiscal 2022 as we leverage the growing base of next-generation consoles with the launch of a new Battlefield. This is on top of the launches of FIFA 22 and Madden NFL 22, plus new and ongoing live services and other titles. We create long-term value by growing strong live services, launching new content and expanding our reach. This broad-based model reduces our dependency on individual titles, decreases risks and enables us to deliver financial results for our shareholders through a constant stream of high-quality entertainment for our players. 
Now I'll hand the call back to Andrew to offer some final thoughts."

Live services extend and enhance the experience for players in their favorite games and enables strong ongoing growth for our business. We design experiences for longevity, creating communities where our players love to connect, share and compete with friends for months and years to come. Our live services for Apex Legends, EA SPORTS Ultimate Team, The Sims 4, Star Wars and more continue to grow in player engagement and will bring more great creative content and in-game events to those communities throughout the year ahead. 
Great games and strength in live services also position us well in additional growth areas. New consoles are coming, and we'll be ready to leave with some of our top titles. Our esports portfolio will expand to 4 franchises this year with content designed for a wide audience and a growing range of sponsors.
We continue to add to the value of our subscription offerings, reaching more play through more distribution channels and expanding to audiences in more geographies with IP that they can't wait to play. It's an exciting time of growth in the interactive entertainment industry, and a great time to be making amazing games and bringing them to more players around the world. 
Now Blake and I are here for your questions."

And part of the reason why we have this breadth and depth in our portfolio is because as the player base continues to grow, so do their motivations. As we think about making games, we think about the motivations of why people want to play: inspiration, escape, social connection, creation, self-improvement, all these types of things. And as we start to look at the broader player base, and we think about each of the cohorts within that, we're looking to build experiences that satisfy their needs and motivations. And what we've come to understand, particularly with Star Wars, is it's a really, really big fan base. And while social interaction, competition and multiplayer is really important for a large portion of that fan base, what we have seen through the last quarter is that also is that inspiration and escape model, that living the Jedi journey, the Jedi story. As we think about this on a go-forward basis, you should imagine that we will continue with the breadth and depth across the IP in order to meet the needs and motivations of that broad player base."

If you think about the various game launches across the industry, there are not many companies that can come together and launch that kind of breadth at that kind of quality with that strength of execution. And so we feel really good about that number. The other thing that's important to understand is, this also has a layering effect. So as we launch games that have live services that last 1, 2, 3, and in some cases, 4 and 5 years, the build that we get over time and the predictability and longevity in our revenue stream is really, really strong. And so I think 8's probably a pretty good number. Some years, there might be a few more of that. Some it might be a few less than that, but we feel really good. 
The other thing that we're starting to see is that with the reach and the network power that we have, with subscriptions and our ability to reach players in this high-value, low-friction business model, we now have a lot of other third parties and indies coming to speak with us about distribution of their content. And so while I feel really good about our capacity to continue to execute and deliver great, high-quality content and potentially more than many others in the industry, we're also going to have the opportunity to reach our player base with these very new and interesting titles from third-party and indie developers."

We've talked in previous calls about kind of a 3-pronged strategy around mobile the first pillar being an underlying belief that we were not monetizing our mobile games at a level that maybe some of the best-of-breed inside the industry had and that we were going to have a real focus on that. I would tell you our studio leadership team has brought some really, really high-powered compelling leaders from the broader mobile industry into the company. They are coming in and working with our teams, and just changing a philosophy around how we think about the creation of really compelling content and the monetization of that content. And we're starting to see that pay out. And you should expect that we'll continue to focus in that area and get more out of the existing mobile titles that actually performed really well in the marketplace and we maybe haven't been as focused on.
The second pillar has been -- we are a game development company. We have spectacular IP that has mobile appeal and mobile application. And we have a number of mobile titles in development that I'm actually very excited about. Two of which, as we said in the prepared remarks, will go into soft launch in the next year or so, and there might be some others that get in a little earlier as well. 
And then, third, we continue to look at opportunities for partnership and acquisition. There's not a lot of those out there as it turns out, but we're trying to make sure that we're in every conversation. So we do -- mobile continues to be a focus for us, and we do believe there's a growth opportunity ahead."

But it's -- we're continuing to grow the subscription business on Origin as well as on our partners. And we think any time we've added new content, that drives people in. Even -- we believe when we put Jedi in the regular subscription, which will be still months from now, we're sure that, that will also bring people in. 
And the most important part is -- what we found out is people actually come in for certain titles. We know this because we watch the data before they join the subscription and after. And we find out they play titles that they've never played before and then start playing them a lot. So we've reduced the barrier of trial. They don't have to go and buy the game, they actually get a chance to just try it inside the subscription.

I would say they're definitely reasonable franchise -- points for those franchises, and both are doing -- continue to do well. The Sims added an expansion pack in the fall that has done extremely well. And it is just an amazing business that continues to grow as more and more people come in. And then those people go backwards by expansion packs from history as well as by the new expansion packs, and it just builds on that social network that we've effectively created inside The Sims. And we'll see similar behavior with Apex, even though it's not expansion packs. More and more people come in each season and start to gain excitement around what they're seeing and build around the social network.
No more color yet on the forward looking. Obviously, you can assume that the base set of sports games will be in every year. Obviously, next year, we're going to -- we've said we'd most likely add at least 1 new sports game. And we have some third-party games we will have in for next year. And a couple of things that we haven't yet announced. But as we said earlier, we're very focused on growing both top line and bottom line, both next year and the following year as well as future years. But I just want to give people a sense that we've got a fairly extensive set of titles that people should get pretty comfortable on going forward.
And obviously, we're also working on a lot of our famous franchises that will come in the future, plus some continued new franchises that we'll continue to add and live services associated with all those."

So as we think about Maxis and BioWare and Motive and DICE LA and Respawn and our EA SPORTS studios, there are titles in various stages of development across all of those studios and more. I also talked about a number of mobile titles, a couple of which will come in to soft launch next year. But I would tell you, I'm more excited now about our mobile pipeline than I have been for a number of years. And again, I would say also that mobile is an unpredictable marketplace and it's very challenging. And all companies have discovered that. But I feel better about what I'm seeing coming out of our mobile studios now than I have for a number of years. And so we feel very good about the long-term trajectory of where our studios are going and the amount of games and new and creative IP that we have in the pipeline."

As new consoles come out -- I don't want to get ahead of our great partners, Microsoft and Sony, but you should assume that the power of those consoles are going to be a lot better than the power of the existing consoles, which means a really simple thing, we can do a lot more. And so you will start to see things over the next couple of years that we're doing with games that will blow people's minds. And that's the fun part of this business because we are going to see so much innovation not just with us but across the whole industry. And that's why you've seen growth across the software business as part of this overall video game business in every single console cycle over the last, what, 20-plus years. And so that's where people sometimes get hung up. They get too focused on the short term and not think about what's transpired historically. And the power of the new consoles is going to be substantially greater than the existing consoles, which means we can just do a lot more. And it's going to be fun and great to see how our existing games will evolve like a FIFA or a Madden, but also see how new games will evolve or be developed under that much higher power."

We're very conscious about not trying to get people to spend beyond what their spend levels are. And so the best way to get people is to get people to spend in that is to engage in better and more events that they're excited in. And so as I said earlier, the team has been very good at trying to design new events, add new events and keep people really excited about playing versus trying to get more money out of on any single event. And I think that's been our biggest single driver, plus growing the overall base of FIFA over time and the number of people that are into Ultimate Team. I mean we're -- more and more people play Ultimate Team. And we think that's very engaging for them. But it's not all that different than what you see in traditional sports where people are highly engaged with the underlying sport.

So any kind of live service or additional content would be different than what we would see in an Ultimate Team or an Apex Legends what -- that this team who is working on this is one of the most creative teams in our company and certainly in the industry who are thinking about where to take this journey next for players that love this style of play. We're excited by what we're going to come up with.

And then secondly, on The Sims, the success of Sims 4 is very intriguing to me since the industry is filled with multiplayer experiences.

A little known fact, I guess, for many, the Sims will be 20 next week. And that Maxis team and the teams that have been part of Maxis over the years continue to deliver unbelievably innovative and creative content for a constantly growing Sims community globally. As we think about The Sims, again, I referenced the motivations of why we play games earlier: inspiration, escape, social interaction, creation, self-improvement, competition. Typically, what the Sims has done is really focused on fulfilling the motivations of inspiration, escape, creation, self-improvement, these stuff, and not necessarily focused as much on social interaction and competition. But a few things are, in fact, true over the years. One is that The Sims community has continued to grow, and with the broader social platforms, continue to connect with each other and share what they do in and around the game they play. And we've seen that manifest in games like Sims FreePlay, which was a more social experience for us. And we're also seeing that the competition nature of The Sims is also rising up. And we're seeing people compare and contrast not competition in the traditional sports sense, but how they create and what they create and how they use their imaginations and what they're able to build inside of their Sims universes. And so as Maxis continues to think about The Sims for a new generation across platforms in a cloud-enabled world, you should imagine that while we will always stay true to our inspiration, escape, creation, self-improvement motivation that this notion of social interaction and competition like the kind of things that were actually present in The Sims FreePlay -- sorry, in The Sims online many, many years ago, that they will start to become part of the ongoing Sims experience in the years to come. We're very excited. This is a game that it really doesn't have any competition in its category for delivering and fulfilling these motivations for players, and we think it's a tremendous growth opportunity for us for many, many years to come."

It was an excellent third quarter for Electronic Arts. With new games like the outstanding Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order as well as our dynamic live services for FIFA, Madden NFL, Apex Legends and The SIMS 4, we delivered unmatched depth and breadth to players over the holiday season. As a result, our revenue and earnings for Q3 were above our guidance, growing significantly year-over-year for the quarter. We're raising our full year guidance for the second time this fiscal year, and we are on track to post a very strong year against our original projections for FY '20.
What we delivered to players in Q3 reflects the breadth and strength of our business, our focus on quality experiences and a deep commitment to execution. We're growing our IP portfolio with more great, new games. Our live services are among the most popular and highest performing in the industry, and we're expanding to more distribution channels so we can connect more players to the games they love. As a result, players are deeply engaged in our top games, sentiment scores are strong, and we are building momentum in the growth areas of our business. I'll touch on a few highlights here.
Our portfolio of Star Wars games across all platforms has never been stronger. Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order was the action adventure game that fans were looking for this holiday season. Respawn delivered an expertly crafted, high-quality experience with outstanding gameplay that thrilled players made many of the game of the year lists and sold beyond our projections for the quarter. In addition to Jedi: Fallen Order, the quality of the Star Wars Battlefront II experience is shining through as well. Two years and dozens of content updates later spanning all 3 trilogies and more, critics have rereviewed the game to high scores, player sentiment is exceptional, and the Celebration edition helped to drive performance of Battlefront II that was significantly above our Q3 expectations. Our communities in both Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes and Star Wars: The Old Republic are thriving as well. The power of the Star Wars franchise continues to endure and grow across generations and geographies, and we look forward to continuing our momentum with Disney and Lucasfilms.
It's nearly 1 year since we took the industry by storm with Apex Legends, and the strength and opportunity of this IP and live service continued to grow. Apex is an outstanding example of the innovation across our portfolio. Seasons of new content are coming at a regular cadence for the growing global community. Season 3 was bigger than Season 2 with higher peaks in daily active users. Within those seasons, in-game events are engaging players with content and challenges that show the imagination and creativity that we are continually pouring into the experience. We're also expanding the Apex universe with more ways to play and watch. We have plans to reach more platforms in FY '21, and there's a lot of excitement in the esports community for the Apex Legends Global Series that is now underway. We're pleased to have Lenovo as an official sponsor for Apex competitive gaming, joining Gillette, Snickers, Pizza Hut and other major brands and broadcast networks partnering with us on our esports portfolio.
It's been a great year for EA SPORTS around the world. Madden NFL 20 and FIFA 20 are both demonstrating how exciting and fresh our sports games can be for new and established fans alike. Madden NFL 20 is our most successful game ever in the franchise, setting multiple records for player engagement and the highest net bookings through a holiday quarter. Our FIFA franchise also grew year-over-year in Q3. VOLTA FOOTBALL brought all new dimension to FIFA 20, and the updates to FIFA Ultimate Team have been deeply engaging for fans with fight matches up nearly 40% year-over-year from launch through Q3.
FIFA 20 is also the #1 most engaged title in our subscription services. We're now getting ready to launch 2 major additions to the FIFA 20 experience with the prestigious South American club tournaments, CONMEBOL Libertadores and CONMEBOL Sudamericano as well as the eLibertadores, a new expansion to our FIFA 20 Global Series esports competitions. In addition to South America, Asia is another growth market for our FIFA franchise, with FIFA online up significantly year-over-year in Q3.
In other dimensions of our portfolio, we now have more than 20 million unique players worldwide in The Sims 4 life-to-date. Our eighth expansion pack for the game, Discover University, continue to demonstrate the creative ways we can add to this experience for our amazing Sims community, as did the surprise addition of The Child from The Mandalorian series on Disney Plus just before the holidays. Meanwhile, PvZ: Battle for Neighborville and Need for Speed Heat both brought fun and new experiences to fans around the world.
Our people are our greatest resource at Electronic Arts, and this year has been a demonstration of how the creativity and technical expertise of our teams working together around the world allows us to deliver an unmatched breadth of entertainment to players. From FIFA to Star Wars, Apex to Madden, The Sims to Need for Speed and more, we have the titles that fans around the world recognize and love to play. The addition of great new games and experiences is also vital to growth, and we're excited to do that in the year ahead through more of our own IP with partner and indie content and some more surprises to come.
Live services are delivering value for players and continuing growth for our business. Our teams are among the best in the industry. It is constantly building on feedback to expand and enhance the experience for players. The content updates and in-game events in Ultimate Team, creative and original new seasons in Apex Legends that expand the game and its characters, new content in The Sims 4 that continues to add player choice and more content across our top mobile titles around the world, live services will continue to be a key focus and growth driver for us in Q4 and the year ahead. 
With the strength of our IP and live services, we're well positioned for growth as the audience expands and diversifies into new forms of content. We are bringing our games and IP to new regions, including continued mobile growth in Asia and plans to launch Apex Legends in China. With our subscription services now available on 3 major platforms and coming to Steam in FY '21, we're expanding our leadership in high-value, low-friction subscriptions for more players. 
And with FIFA and Madden continuing to grow as leading esports properties, we're bringing Apex Legends competition to the global stage, and we have exciting plans for new content in esports as we move into the next fiscal year. We're looking forward to finishing this year strong, delivering for players and continuing our growth into FY '21.
Now I'll hand the call over to Blake."

EA successfully launched 3 games last quarter: Need for Speed Heat; Plants vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville; and, of course, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. That brings the total for calendar 2019 to 8. Launching 8 major games at quality in a year is a substantial undertaking, but that number only tells part of the story. For example, Battlefield V, we launched a whole new theater of war with maps, vehicles, weapons and more, driving a major shift in engagement. For Star Wars Battlefront II, we introduced game-changing heroes, fan-favorite reinforcements, exotic plants -- planets and epic new ways to play across 3 cinematic eras. For Apex Legends, we launched 3 seasons of content, including 3 new legends, 5 in-game events, 3 town takeovers and a whole new map of 6 new game modes. Delivering quality entertainment at this level testifies to how well the teams are aligned across the company in a way in which we unite to achieve our goals. And it works. We had another great quarter, with record net bookings and live services as a whole and in FIFA and Madden Ultimate Teams in particular. Apex Legends is having a fantastic season, and we delivered a new hit with the launch of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. As a result, we generated record operating cash flow over the last 12 months.
EA's net revenue was $1.593 billion and operating expenses were $724 million. GAAP operating income was $361 million and resulted in earnings per share of $1.18, $0.26 better than our guidance. The year-on-year increase in OpEx was largely driven by variable compensation, which flexes up and down depending on company performance against plan. Remember that the true-up in Q3 last year was negative that, combined with a positive true-up this year, creates a $58 million swing year-on-year. There was also underlying growth in R&D as we continue to invest in game development.
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $1.104 billion, up $150 million last year. Operating cash flow for the trailing 12 months was a record at $1.898 billion. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $28 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $1.076 billion. See our earnings slides for further details on this information.
During the quarter, we repurchased 3.1 million shares at a cost of $300 million -- $305 million. We've now returned to shareholders over $2 billion of the $2.4 billion in our 2-year buyback program that we began in May 2018. We will announce our future plans on our May earnings call. 
Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $5.6 billion. Total net bookings for the quarter were $1.978 billion, up 23% on the prior year despite a $39 million FX headwind. Sales of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order significantly beat our expectations. We had forecast 6 million to 8 million units for the fiscal year, but to hit the high end of that in the third quarter, and now we anticipate selling around 10 million units in the fiscal year, a very strong result for a single-player action game.
Madden NFL 20 is delivering the best performance in Madden's more than 30-year history. Average selling prices were strong across the portfolio with discounts smaller and applied later in the year. 
Diving into digital net bookings. Digital net bookings were $1.444 billion, up 20% on a year ago period. Digital net bookings now represent 77% of our business on a trailing 12-month basis. This compares to 74% in the prior year. Live service net bookings were up 27% to $993 million. Nothing illustrates the changing nature of our business model like the growth of our live services, and $993 million is an all-time high. Growth was led by Apex Legends but closely followed by double-digit growth in FIFA and Madden Ultimate Teams. Growth in FIFA Online in Asia was also extremely strong. 
Mobile book delivered net bookings of $134 million, down 6% year-over-year but above our expectations, driven by titles across the breadth of our portfolio, particularly in Asia. Including our IP-licensed deals, such as the one for Command & Conquer: Red Alert in China, Mobile is up year-on-year at constant currency. With many promising titles in incubation at EA, we are excited about the opportunities ahead for us in the mobile market. 
Full game PC and console downloads generated net bookings of $317 million, 16% higher than last year. Growth was driven by increased game sales plus the ongoing shift to digital. Overall, 49% of our units sold through were digital rather than physical, measured on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 over the last 12 months. This compares to 47% a year ago. We continue to model underlying annual growth of around 5 percentage points for digital. 
Turning to guidance. We expect full year GAAP net revenue to be $5.475 billion and for diluted earnings per share to be $9.90. We expect operating cash flow of about $1.725 billion. We continue to anticipate capital expenditures of around $140 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.585 billion, $135 million above where our expectations were at the start of the year. We now anticipate fiscal 2020 net bookings of $5.15 billion, up $25 million over our prior guidance and up $50 million from where we started the year. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect net revenue of $1.325 billion, cost of revenue to be $257 million and operating expenses of $724 million. OpEx is down year-on-year, reflecting the 2 new IPs we launched last year. This results in a diluted earnings per share of $1.05 for the fourth quarter, using the diluted share count of 293 million shares. 
We anticipate net bookings for the quarter to be $1.152 billion. This is slightly down year-on-year, with broad-based strength this year offset by the massive launch quarter for Apex Legends and Anthem last year.
Looking forward to fiscal 2021, our goal is to continue to grow net bookings and underlying profitability even as we invest in new platforms. We anticipate live services to be the primary growth driver, followed by the launch of new content across a broad range of genres. We're launching 4 sports titles, including new games in our blockbuster FIFA and Madden franchises, 4 other titles that draw from the breadth of our IP, and we'll also publish 4 titles globally from smaller developers. Finally, we expect 2 new mobile titles to make it into soft launch.
We expect growth to accelerate in fiscal 2022 as we leverage the growing base of next-generation consoles with the launch of a new Battlefield. This is on top of the launches of FIFA 22 and Madden NFL 22, plus new and ongoing live services and other titles. We create long-term value by growing strong live services, launching new content and expanding our reach. This broad-based model reduces our dependency on individual titles, decreases risks and enables us to deliver financial results for our shareholders through a constant stream of high-quality entertainment for our players. 
Now I'll hand the call back to Andrew to offer some final thoughts."

We're looking forward to delivering more amazing games from our top franchises, new IP, new partner and indie titles and some other surprises in FY '21 and beyond. 
Live services extend and enhance the experience for players in their favorite games and enables strong ongoing growth for our business. We design experiences for longevity, creating communities where our players love to connect, share and compete with friends for months and years to come. Our live services for Apex Legends, EA SPORTS Ultimate Team, The Sims 4, Star Wars and more continue to grow in player engagement and will bring more great creative content and in-game events to those communities throughout the year ahead. 
Great games and strength in live services also position us well in additional growth areas. New consoles are coming, and we'll be ready to leave with some of our top titles. Our esports portfolio will expand to 4 franchises this year with content designed for a wide audience and a growing range of sponsors.
We're continuing to add to the value of our subscription offerings, reaching more play through more distribution channels and expanding to audiences in more geographies with IP that they can't wait to play. It's an exciting time of growth in the interactive entertainment industry, and a great time to be making amazing games and bringing them to more players around the world.

And part of the reason why we have this breadth and depth in our portfolio is because as the player base continues to grow, so do their motivations. As we think about making games, we think about the motivations of why people want to play: inspiration, escape, social connection, creation, self-improvement, all these types of things.
And as we start to look at the broader player base, and we think about each of the cohorts within that, we're looking to build experiences that satisfy their needs and motivations. And what we've come to understand, particularly with Star Wars, is it's a really, really big fan base. And while social interaction, competition and multiplayer is really important for a large portion of that fan base, what we have seen through the last quarter is that also is that inspiration and escape model, that living the Jedi journey, the Jedi story. As we think about this on a go-forward basis, you should imagine that we will continue with the breadth and depth across the IP in order to meet the needs and motivations of that broad player base."

I would tell you our studio leadership team has brought some really, really high-powered, compelling leaders from the broader mobile industry into the company. They are coming in and working with our teams, and just changing a philosophy around how we think about the creation of really compelling content and the monetization of that content. And we're starting to see that pay out. And you should expect that we'll continue to focus in that area and get more out of the existing mobile titles that actually performed really well in the marketplace and we, maybe, haven't been as focused on.
The second pillar has been -- we are a game development company. We have spectacular IP that has mobile appeal and mobile application. And we have a number of mobile titles in development that I'm actually very excited about. Two of which, as we said in the prepared remarks, will go into soft launch in the next year or so, and there might be some others that get in a little earlier as well.

People won't play Ultimate Team if they're not having fun. And so the key is how do you build an event that they're going to have fun competing and interacting. It's a social network, and it's all about the design of events. And I think the team continues to get better and better every year, either refining existing events or adding new events. And that's what really drives the overall monetization in Ultimate Team across all of our sports. And it's the thing that people sometimes don't understand when it comes to live services, that it's not about the monetization. It's about how do you create fun for people to be able to come in and enjoy social connection and that competition with others. And that's what really drives that across all of our live services."

I don't think we have any new news on guidance for anything else. Obviously, we've tried to give people some sense of what next year looks like. As I said in my prepared remarks, we would like to -- our goal is to drive both top line and bottom line guidance, and we think we've set up a slate of properties for next year to do that. And we've also provided people the knowledge that Battlefield's coming the year after that, which should also drive growth the following year.

I mean, as I think Andrew said, we're just getting into our 1-year anniversary in the game, which is fantastic. We've been very pleased with where the game is. The team has done an amazing job of continuing to innovate and add content and also leverage an incredibly engaged audience to try to feed them and give them things that they wanted to continue to play in the game and excitement and surprise. We will continue that journey no different than we've done with live services. You -- people sometimes forget, Ultimate Team was like an $8 million business 12 years ago.
And our goal is to always be innovating and improving over time to try to grow the business, and that's how we're thinking about Apex. And we've continued to bolster the team with new talent, new live service talent, but also make sure that the existing team is very focused on how they're building out the business and rewarded for their great efforts there. I mean it's just an incredible job they've done. It's hard for us to predict. If you would have asked us a month ago, 6 months ago, we probably wouldn't have known. And we still don't know, but our goal is to continue to grow that business and to maintain.
But when we come to our May guidance, we'll try to give some people some sense of it. What we are -- we're going to stop talking about monthly or weekly or daily active users because I'm not sure what anyone can do with that information. And if anyone questions that, I -- they go back 7.5 years ago to my very first quarter at the company where I said, ""We will take away metrics that don't make sense for investors."" And we're not necessarily trying to hold back any information. We're not signaling anything. We just realized that we want to make sure you're not doing something with numbers that don't make sense. We'll try to give you as best guidance as we can. We want to grow the business.

Obviously, it added to it, but it's early days. So it's hard to understand if people came in and then went out because they're still playing the game. We have not seen big changes in churn. It's been a big question for us because we don't have titles coming in every single month from our portfolio. So you're always going to wonder about churn. But it's -- we're continuing to grow the subscription business on Origin as well as on our partners. And we think any time we've added new content, that drives people in. Even -- we believe when we put Jedi in the regular subscription, which will be still months from now, we're sure that, that will also bring people in. 
And the most important part is -- what we found out is people actually come in for certain titles. We know this because we watch the data before they join the subscription and after. And we find out they play titles that they've never played before and then start playing them a lot. So we've reduced the barrier of trial. They don't have to go and buy the game, they actually get a chance to just try it inside the subscription.

And we'll see similar behavior with Apex, even though it's not expansion packs. More and more people come in each season and start to gain excitement around what they're seeing and build around the social network.
No more color yet on the forward looking. Obviously, you can assume that the base set of sports games will be in every year.

A little known fact, I guess, for many, the Sims will be 20 next week. And that Maxis team and the teams that have been part of Maxis over the years continue to deliver unbelievably innovative and creative content for a constantly growing Sims community globally.
As we think about The Sims, again, I referenced the motivations of why we play games earlier: inspiration, escape, social interaction, creation, self-improvement, competition. Typically, what the Sims has done is really focused on fulfilling the motivations of inspiration, escape, creation, self-improvement, these stuff, and not necessarily focused as much on social interaction and competition.
But a few things are, in fact, true over the years. One is that The Sims community has continued to grow, and with the broader social platforms, continue to connect with each other and share what they do in and around the game they play. And we've seen that manifest in games like Sims FreePlay, which was a more social experience for us. And we're also seeing that the competition nature of The Sims is also rising up. And we're seeing people compare and contrast not competition in the traditional sports sense, but how they create and what they create and how they use their imaginations and what they're able to build inside of their Sims universes.
And so as Maxis continues to think about The Sims for a new generation across platforms in a cloud-enabled world, you should imagine that while we will always stay true to our inspiration, escape, creation, self-improvement, motivations, that this notion of social interaction and competition like the kind of things that were actually present in The Sims FreePlay -- sorry, in The Sims online many, many years ago, that they will start to become part of the ongoing Sims experience in the years to come. We're very excited. This is a game that it really doesn't have any competition in its category for delivering and fulfilling these motivations for players, and we think it's a tremendous growth opportunity for us for many, many years to come."

I would -- I'd say, remember, Star Wars tends to skew a little lower digitally than our average titles just because a lot of the gifting that goes on at holidays. And live services, obviously, was a big driver. But if you thought -- if you think about sort of our expectations, as we mentioned, we overdelivered on Star Wars, we probably underdelivered slightly on Plants vs. Zombies, but that's one that will sell well over a long period of time, so -- in a relatively small title, so that wasn't a big driver. And then Need for Speed's kind of as we expected. We did, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks that, this year, we had stronger pricing than we have in the past, and we did discounts later in the season than we did in the past. And that was part of our strategy, but it also helped across the board as we're -- as you look at overall revenue."

But we're conscious that we don't want to disrupt the consumer there. And right now, both Online 4 and Online 3 are doing well in that marketplace.

You might recall that we announced that Vince was leading a creative council for the organization. What this creative council does, it kind of operates like a brain's trust like what's happening at Pixar and really brings creative leaders across the company together to review and comment, be constructive and help and provide insight across the broad set of creative initiatives that we have going on. And Vince is very proactive in that and very involved in that, and that's having a tremendous impact across the company and helping us drive this, kind of, aligned, focused push against both quality and execution. 
With him taking on DICE LA, traditionally, DICE LA have been supporting DICE Stockholm, but they have a great creative team there and great creative leadership and have also been incubating some other things, and we're very excited about those things, and Vince will be deeply involved in those as he takes on leadership of that.
And then with the leadership change that we made in Stockholm, we've got really strong traction against the next Battlefield game. I'm really -- I talked about this last call. I'm really excited about what that team is doing.

You mentioned that perhaps he's inheriting some games in development there, predevelopment, preproduction. But curious if we can look forward to sort of a AAA game from Vince in the shooters genre emerging 2 to 3 years. And then, I guess, broadly speaking, in the new consoles, Blake, great to hear your excitement on new consoles coming to the market and what that means, I share that.

So there are probably -- I don't know how many new IP ideas we're incubating. So more to come on all of that. Everyone's pretty excited. But I don't want anyone to be mistaken that expanding Vince's remit means in any way that he's not overseeing Respawn. He's got a great team there. He's got a great management team there. We continue to bolster that team. But he is still very helpful every day at Respawn as well as helpful across our entire portfolio. 
So we're very excited about he and the whole team and as to how they've integrated into the company. It's never easy to be a small company and get acquired by a big company. And I think what the Respawn team, hopefully, has found out is that we're actually not bad guys and we're pretty fun to work with. Bad people, sorry, I didn't mean to say bad guys because Laura's a really good girl -- lady.
But I just want people to know. I mean we try to leverage -- and it's not just Vince, it's people across our entire portfolio. We try to leverage our best sports experts, our best managers wherever they are. And that we've got a collection of quite a few of those people, and that's why we can continue to produce the games that we produce every year.
You don't put out the best -- the biggest sports games in the world year-after-year on time and on budget if you don't have amazing people doing that. So -- and Chris is telling me I got to shut it off because we're out of time. But there was one last -- what was one part of your question, Mike, that we didn't get to? Oh, we lost you. All right.

It was an excellent third quarter for Electronic Arts. With new games like the outstanding Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order as well as our dynamic live services for FIFA, Madden NFL, Apex Legends and The SIMS 4, we delivered unmatched depth and breadth to players over the holiday season. As a result, our revenue and earnings for Q3 were above our guidance, growing significantly year-over-year for the quarter. We're raising our full year guidance for the second time this fiscal year, and we are on track to post a very strong year against our original projections for FY '20.
What we delivered to players in Q3 reflects the breadth and strength of our business, our focus on quality experiences and a deep commitment to execution. We're growing our IP portfolio with more great, new games. Our live services are among the most popular and highest performing in the industry, and we're expanding to more distribution channels so we can connect more players to the games they love. As a result, players are deeply engaged in our top games, sentiment scores are strong, and we are building momentum in the growth areas of our business. I'll touch on a few highlights here.
Our portfolio of Star Wars games across all platforms has never been stronger. Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order was the action-adventure game that fans were looking for this holiday season. Respawn delivered an expertly crafted, high-quality experience with outstanding gameplay that thrilled players made many of the game of the year lists and sold beyond our projections for the quarter. In addition to Jedi: Fallen Order, the quality of the Star Wars Battlefront II experience is shining through as well. Two years and dozens of content updates later spanning all 3 trilogies and more, critics have rereviewed the game to high scores, player sentiment is exceptional, and the Celebration edition helped to drive performance of Battlefront II that was significantly above our Q3 expectations. Our communities in both Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes and Star Wars: The Old Republic are thriving as well. The power of the Star Wars franchise continues to endure and grow across generations and geographies, and we look forward to continuing our momentum with Disney and Lucasfilms.
It's nearly 1 year since we took the industry by storm with Apex Legends, and the strength and opportunity of this IP and live service continued to grow. Apex is an outstanding example of the innovation across our portfolio. Seasons of new content are coming at a regular cadence for the growing global community. Season 3 was bigger than Season 2 with higher peaks in daily active users. Within those seasons, in-game events are engaging players with content and challenges that show the imagination and creativity that we are continually pouring into the experience. We're also expanding the Apex universe with more ways to play and watch. We have plans to reach more platforms in FY '21, and there's a lot of excitement in the esports community for the Apex Legends Global Series that is now underway. We're pleased to have Lenovo as an official sponsor for Apex competitive gaming, joining Gillette, Snickers, Pizza Hut and other major brands and broadcast networks partnering with us on our esports portfolio.
It's been a great year for EA SPORTS around the world. Madden NFL 20 and FIFA 20 are both demonstrating how exciting and fresh our sports games can be for new and established fans alike. Madden NFL 20 is our most successful game ever in the franchise, setting multiple records for player engagement and the highest net bookings through a holiday quarter. Our FIFA franchise also grew year-over-year in Q3. VOLTA FOOTBALL brought all new dimension to FIFA 20, and the updates to FIFA Ultimate Team have been deeply engaging for fans with fight matches up nearly 40% year-over-year from launch through Q3.
FIFA 20 is also the #1 most engaged title in our subscription services. We're now getting ready to launch 2 major additions to the FIFA 20 experience with the prestigious South American club tournaments, CONMEBOL Libertadores and CONMEBOL Sudamericano as well as the eLibertadores, a new expansion to our FIFA 20 Global Series esports competitions. In addition to South America, Asia is another growth market for our FIFA franchise, with FIFA online up significantly year-over-year in Q3.
In other dimensions of our portfolio, we now have more than 20 million unique players worldwide in The Sims 4 life-to-date. Our eighth expansion pack for the game, Discover University, continue to demonstrate the creative ways we can add to this experience for our amazing Sims community, as did the surprise addition of The Child from The Mandalorian series on Disney Plus just before the holidays. Meanwhile, PvZ: Battle for Neighborville and Need for Speed Heat both brought fun and new experiences to fans around the world.
Our people are our greatest resource at Electronic Arts, and this year has been a demonstration of how the creativity and technical expertise of our teams working together around the world allows us to deliver an unmatched breadth of entertainment to players. From FIFA to Star Wars, Apex to Madden, The Sims to Need for Speed and more, we have the titles that fans around the world recognize and love to play. The addition of great new games and experiences is also vital to growth, and we're excited to do that in the year ahead through more of our own IP with partner and indie content and some more surprises to come.
Live services are delivering value for players and continuing growth for our business. Our teams are among the best in the industry. It is constantly building on feedback to expand and enhance the experience for players. The content updates and in-game events in Ultimate Team, creative and original new seasons in Apex Legends that expand the game and its characters, new content in The Sims 4 that continues to add player choice and more content across our top mobile titles around the world, live services will continue to be a key focus and growth driver for us in Q4 and the year ahead.
With the strength of our IP and live services, we're well positioned for growth as the audience expands and diversifies into new forms of content. We are bringing our games and IP to new regions, including continued mobile growth in Asia and plans to launch Apex Legends in China. With our subscription services now available on 3 major platforms and coming to Steam in FY '21, we're expanding our leadership in high-value, low-friction subscriptions for more players.
And with FIFA and Madden continuing to grow as leading esports properties, we're bringing Apex Legends competition to the global stage, and we have exciting plans for new content in esports as we move into the next fiscal year. We're looking forward to finishing this year strong, delivering for players and continuing our growth into FY '21.
Now I'll hand the call over to Blake."

EA successfully launched 3 games last quarter: Need for Speed Heat; Plants vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville; and, of course, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. That brings the total for calendar 2019 to 8. Launching 8 major games at quality in a year is a substantial undertaking, but that number only tells part of the story. For example, Battlefield V, we launched a whole new theater of war with maps, vehicles, weapons and more, driving a major shift in engagement. For Star Wars Battlefront II, we introduced game-changing heroes, fan-favorite reinforcements, exotic plants -- planets and epic new ways to play across 3 cinematic eras. For Apex Legends, we launched 3 seasons of content, including 3 new legends, 5 in-game events, 3 town takeovers and a whole new map of 6 new game modes. Delivering quality entertainment at this level testifies to how well the teams are aligned across the company in a way in which we unite to achieve our goals. And it works. We had another great quarter, with record net bookings and live services as a whole and in FIFA and Madden Ultimate Teams in particular. Apex Legends is having a fantastic season, and we delivered a new hit with the launch of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. As a result, we generated record operating cash flow over the last 12 months.
EA's net revenue was $1.593 billion and operating expenses were $724 million. GAAP operating income was $361 million and resulted in earnings per share of $1.18, $0.26 better than our guidance. The year-on-year increase in OpEx was largely driven by variable compensation, which flexes up and down depending on company performance against plan. Remember that the true-up in Q3 last year was negative that, combined with a positive true-up this year, creates a $58 million swing year-on-year. There was also underlying growth in R&D as we continue to invest in game development.
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $1.104 billion, up $150 million last year. Operating cash flow for the trailing 12 months was a record at $1.898 billion. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $28 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $1.076 billion. See our earnings slides for further details on this information.
During the quarter, we repurchased 3.1 million shares at a cost of $300 million -- $305 million. We've now returned to shareholders over $2 billion of the $2.4 billion in our 2-year buyback program that we began in May 2018. We will announce our future plans on our May earnings call.
Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $5.6 billion. Total net bookings for the quarter were $1.978 billion, up 23% on the prior year despite a $39 million FX headwind. Sales of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order significantly beat our expectations. We had forecast 6 million to 8 million units for the fiscal year, but to hit the high end of that in the third quarter, and now we anticipate selling around 10 million units in the fiscal year, a very strong result for a single-player action game.
Madden NFL 20 is delivering the best performance in Madden's more than 30-year history. Average selling prices were strong across the portfolio with discounts smaller and applied later in the year.
Diving into digital net bookings. Digital net bookings were $1.444 billion, up 20% on a year ago period. Digital net bookings now represent 77% of our business on a trailing 12-month basis. This compares to 74% in the prior year. Live service net bookings were up 27% to $993 million. Nothing illustrates the changing nature of our business model like the growth of our live services, and $993 million is an all-time high. Growth was led by Apex Legends but closely followed by double-digit growth in FIFA and Madden Ultimate Teams. Growth in FIFA Online in Asia was also extremely strong.
Mobile book delivered net bookings of $134 million, down 6% year-over-year but above our expectations, driven by titles across the breadth of our portfolio, particularly in Asia. Including our IP-licensed deals, such as the one for Command & Conquer: Red Alert in China, Mobile is up year-on-year at constant currency. With many promising titles in incubation at EA, we are excited about the opportunities ahead for us in the mobile market.
Full game PC and console downloads generated net bookings of $317 million, 16% higher than last year. Growth was driven by increased game sales plus the ongoing shift to digital. Overall, 49% of our units sold through were digital rather than physical, measured on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 over the last 12 months. This compares to 47% a year ago. We continue to model underlying annual growth of around 5 percentage points for digital.
Turning to guidance. We expect full year GAAP net revenue to be $5.475 billion and for diluted earnings per share to be $9.90. We expect operating cash flow of about $1.725 billion. We continue to anticipate capital expenditures of around $140 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.585 billion, $135 million above where our expectations were at the start of the year. We now anticipate fiscal 2020 net bookings of $5.15 billion, up $25 million over our prior guidance and up $50 million from where we started the year.
For the fourth quarter, we expect net revenue of $1.325 billion, cost of revenue to be $257 million and operating expenses of $724 million. OpEx is down year-on-year, reflecting the 2 new IPs we launched last year. This results in a diluted earnings per share of $1.05 for the fourth quarter, using the diluted share count of 293 million shares.
We anticipate net bookings for the quarter to be $1.152 billion. This is slightly down year-on-year, with broad-based strength this year offset by the massive launch quarter for Apex Legends and Anthem last year.
Looking forward to fiscal 2021, our goal is to continue to grow net bookings and underlying profitability even as we invest in new platforms. We anticipate live services to be the primary growth driver, followed by the launch of new content across a broad range of genres. We're launching 4 sports titles, including new games in our blockbuster FIFA and Madden franchises, 4 other titles that draw from the breadth of our IP, and we'll also publish 4 titles globally from smaller developers. Finally, we expect 2 new mobile titles to make it into soft launch.
We expect growth to accelerate in fiscal 2022 as we leverage the growing base of next-generation consoles with the launch of a new Battlefield. This is on top of the launches of FIFA 22 and Madden NFL 22, plus new and ongoing live services and other titles. We create long-term value by growing strong live services, launching new content and expanding our reach. This broad-based model reduces our dependency on individual titles, decreases risks and enables us to deliver financial results for our shareholders through a constant stream of high-quality entertainment for our players.
Now I'll hand the call back to Andrew to offer some final thoughts."

Live services extend and enhance the experience for players in their favorite games and enables strong ongoing growth for our business.

Our live services for Apex Legends, EA SPORTS Ultimate Team, The Sims 4, Star Wars and more continue to grow in player engagement and will bring more great creative content and in-game events to those communities throughout the year ahead.
Great games and strength in live services also position us well in additional growth areas. New consoles are coming, and we'll be ready to leave with some of our top titles. Our esports portfolio will expand to 4 franchises this year with content designed for a wide audience and a growing range of sponsors.
We're continuing to add to the value of our subscription offerings, reaching more play through more distribution channels and expanding to audiences in more geographies with IP that they can't wait to play. It's an exciting time of growth in the interactive entertainment industry, and a great time to be making amazing games and bringing them to more players around the world.

And part of the reason why we have this breadth and depth in our portfolio is because as the player base continues to grow, so do their motivations. As we think about making games, we think about the motivations of why people want to play: inspiration, escape, social connection, creation, self-improvement, all these types of things.
And as we start to look at the broader player base, and we think about each of the cohorts within that, we're looking to build experiences that satisfy their needs and motivations. And what we've come to understand, particularly with Star Wars, is it's a really, really big fan base. And while social interaction, competition and multiplayer is really important for a large portion of that fan base, what we have seen through the last quarter is that also is that inspiration and escape model, that living the Jedi journey, the Jedi story. As we think about this on a go-forward basis, you should imagine that we will continue with the breadth and depth across the IP in order to meet the needs and motivations of that broad player base."

If you think about the various game launches across the industry, there are not many companies that can come together and launch that kind of breadth at that kind of quality with that strength of execution. And so we feel really good about that number. The other thing that's important to understand is, this also has a layering effect. So as we've launched games that have live services that last 1, 2, 3, and in some cases, 4 and 5 years, the build that we get over time and the predictability and longevity in our revenue stream is really, really strong. And so I think 8's probably a pretty good number. Some years, there might be a few more of that, some it might be a few less than that, but we feel really good.
The other thing that we're starting to see is that with the reach and the network power that we have, with subscriptions and our ability to reach players in this high-value, low-friction business model, we now have a lot of other third parties and indies coming to speak with us about distribution of their content. And so while I feel really good about our capacity to continue to execute and deliver great, high-quality content and potentially more than many others in the industry, we're also going to have the opportunity to reach our player base with these very new and interesting titles from third-party and indie developers."

We've talked in previous calls about kind of a 3-pronged strategy around mobile, the first pillar being an underlying belief that we were not monetizing our mobile games at a level that maybe some of the best-of-breed inside the industry had and that we were going to have a real focus on that. I would tell you our studio leadership team has brought some really, really high-powered, compelling leaders from the broader mobile industry into the company. They are coming in and working with our teams, and just changing a philosophy around how we think about the creation of really compelling content and the monetization of that content. And we're starting to see that pay out. And you should expect that we'll continue to focus in that area and get more out of the existing mobile titles that actually performed really well in the marketplace and we, maybe, haven't been as focused on.
The second pillar has been -- we are a game development company. We have spectacular IP that has mobile appeal and mobile application. And we have a number of mobile titles in development that I'm actually very excited about. Two of which, as we said in the prepared remarks, will go into soft launch in the next year or so, and there might be some others that get in a little earlier as well.
And then, third, we continue to look at opportunities for partnership and acquisition. There's not a lot of those out there as it turns out, but we're trying to make sure that we're in every conversation. So we do -- mobile continues to be a focus for us, and we do believe there's a growth opportunity ahead."

But it's -- we're continuing to grow the subscription business on Origin as well as on our partners. And we think any time we've added new content, that drives people in. Even -- we believe when we put Jedi in the regular subscription, which will be still months from now, we're sure that, that will also bring people in.
And the most important part is -- what we found out is people actually come in for certain titles. We know this because we watch the data before they join the subscription and after. And we find out they play titles that they've never played before and then start playing them a lot. So we've reduced the barrier of trial. They don't have to go and buy the game, they actually get a chance to just try it inside the subscription.

So as we think about Maxis and BioWare and Motive and DICE LA and Respawn and our EA SPORTS studios, there are titles in various stages of development across all of those studios and more. I also talked about a number of mobile titles, a couple of which will come in to soft launch next year. But I would tell you, I'm more excited now about our mobile pipeline than I have been for a number of years. And again, I would say also that mobile is an unpredictable marketplace and it's very challenging. And all companies have discovered that. But I feel better about what I'm seeing coming out of our mobile studios now than I have for a number of years. And so we feel very good about the long-term trajectory of where our studios are going and the amount of games and new and creative IP that we have in the pipeline."

And you guys kind of imagine, and you've seen this historically in console transitions. As new consoles come out -- I don't want to get ahead of our great partners, Microsoft and Sony, but you should assume that the power of those consoles are going to be a lot better than the power of the existing consoles, which means a really simple thing, we can do a lot more. And so you will start to see things over the next couple of years that we're doing with games that will blow people's minds. And that's the fun part of this business because we are going to see so much innovation not just with us but across the whole industry. And that's why you've seen growth across the software business as part of this overall video game business in every single console cycle over the last, what, 20-plus years. And so that's where people sometimes get hung up. They get too focused on the short term and not think about what's transpired historically. And the power of the new consoles is going to be substantially greater than the existing consoles, which means we can just do a lot more. And it's going to be fun and great to see how our existing games will evolve like a FIFA or a Madden, but also see how new games will evolve or be developed under that much higher power."

Ultimate Team really has benefited from more people and more engagement versus, once again, trying to change the ARPU in some fashion. We're very conscious about not trying to get people to spend beyond what their spend levels are. And so the best way to get people is to get people to spend in that is to engage in better and more events that they're excited in. And so as I said earlier, the team has been very good at trying to design new events, add new events and keep people really excited about playing versus trying to get more money out of on any single event. And I think that's been our biggest single driver, plus growing the overall base of FIFA over time and the number of people that are into Ultimate Team. I mean we're -- more and more people play Ultimate Team. And we think that's very engaging for them. But it's not all that different than what you see in traditional sports where people are highly engaged with the underlying sport. These are hard-core sports fans and this is what they want to do, and that's why they engage in Ultimate Team."

And then secondly, on The Sims, the success of Sims 4 is very intriguing to me since the industry is filled with multiplayer experiences.

A little known fact, I guess, for many, the Sims will be 20 next week. And that Maxis team and the teams that have been part of Maxis over the years continue to deliver unbelievably innovative and creative content for a constantly growing Sims community globally.
As we think about The Sims, again, I referenced the motivations of why we play games earlier: inspiration, escape, social interaction, creation, self-improvement, competition. Typically, what the Sims has done is really focused on fulfilling the motivations of inspiration, escape, creation, self-improvement, these stuff, and not necessarily focused as much on social interaction and competition.
But a few things are, in fact, true over the years. One is that The Sims community has continued to grow, and with the broader social platforms, continue to connect with each other and share what they do in and around the game they play. And we've seen that manifest in games like Sims FreePlay, which was a more social experience for us. And we're also seeing that the competition nature of The Sims is also rising up. And we're seeing people compare and contrast not competition in the traditional sports sense, but how they create and what they create and how they use their imaginations and what they're able to build inside of their Sims universes.
And so as Maxis continues to think about The Sims for a new generation across platforms in a cloud-enabled world, you should imagine that while we will always stay true to our inspiration, escape, creation, self-improvement, motivations, that this notion of social interaction and competition like the kind of things that were actually present in The Sims FreePlay -- sorry, in The Sims online many, many years ago, that they will start to become part of the ongoing Sims experience in the years to come. We're very excited. This is a game that it really doesn't have any competition in its category for delivering and fulfilling these motivations for players, and we think it's a tremendous growth opportunity for us for many, many years to come."

As global citizens, we are all enduring a period of great uncertainty and continuing to fight the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. We're here to report on our quarterly results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, and Blake and I will speak to those. However, our focus, first and foremost, has been on the health and well-being of our teams and their families during the COVID-19 situation. I'll start by sharing a little about our actions to support our employees around the world.
We have an internal COVID-19 task force that has been tracking and making decisions on a daily basis since January to keep our teams safe, including early decisions to restrict business travel, cancel events and close our Shanghai and -- facilities. By mid-March, we shifted nearly all of our global workforce to work from home in response to the growing threat of the pandemic. Through this transition, we've put a heavy focus on ensuring our people have ever they need to balance the challenges of work and home life during stay-at-home orders and physical distancing.
We continue to be in a work-at-home status for all of our locations outside of Shanghai. We have detailed protocols to evaluate our readiness to return in each of our offices when the time is right, accounting for guidance from health authorities and government, the comfort level of our employees and preparation of our facilities for continued physical distancing. We're planning for the return to take place over an extended period, and we -- as we make longer-term changes to our locations and practices in response to the pandemic. We will continue to do everything we need to support our teams as we go forward.
Moving to our results, we finished a strong year for Electronic Arts with fourth quarter and full year revenue and earnings above our previously raised guidance. The innovation that we are delivering to players across the breadth of our games and live services continues to drive strength in our business. I'll touch on a few examples from the year.
EA SPORTS is a pillar of our portfolio and continues to bring more players together. FIFA is one of the biggest and most engaging entertainment franchises in the world with approximately 100 million players engaging globally in our FIFA franchise, more than 25 million unique players have joined FIFA 20 so far with VOLTA opening up a highly new dimension of the game and FIFA Ultimate Team continue to grow as the most popular mode.
FIFA Online in Asia also continues its momentum, significantly outperforming our expectations. Madden NFL is a cultural icon in football, gaming and entertainment, and it just had its biggest year ever. We took a new approach to launching and rolling out new modes of play in Madden NFL 20, and the result was the highest engagement levels in franchise history.
Apex Legends was the most downloaded free-to-play game on PS4 in 2019, and continues to grow as an innovative long-term service for players. It's been continually recognized as one of the best multi-class experiences available. And with each new season of content, Respawn had been delivering more of what players love from law to new legends to in-game events.
Before COVID-19 stay-at-home orders began, season 4 was already outperforming each of the 2 prior seasons, and the old ways of -- has become the most successful ever for Apex. Our Apex esports tournaments have generated approximately 2x the average viewing audience of other top esports leagues. Respawn have added more teams in our development organization to work on great new content, and we continue to have a strong focus on the thriving Apex Legends community.
Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order was one of the breakout tiles of the last several years. More than 10 million unique players have joined the game since launch, a rare achievement for a first title in an entirely new franchise. It's a meticulously well-crafted game, and it continues to give fans a deeply engaging and original Star Wars experience. 
The Sims 4 inspires an entirely different gaming audience and one that continues to grow. It provides a completely unique experience from anything else in the market, and FY '20 was its biggest year since launch. In every quarter this year, monthly average players in The Sims 4 were higher than the previous year. Our Sims community is diverse and highly creative, and our success continues to be built on delivering a wide variety of content and ways to engage for players with very different interests.
With more people staying at home in the fourth quarter, we did see rising usage and engagement levels in many of our games. We're humbled to see people wanting to connect through our games during this time. In part has been made possible by the amazing work of our teams and our technology investments across the company. For more than 5 years, we've been investing in a single technology infrastructure architecture and digital platform as we accelerate into a digital world. That's enabled us to provide mobility for our employees in this environment and maintain strong productivity. But the real story is the people of Electronics Arts. We have such tremendously talented, dedicated and determined teams. They've come together in the strongest and most inspiring way through this pandemic response period in service of each other and in service of our players. And as a result, we have been able to adapt and scale in this changing environment where engagement in our games has reached new peaks and continues at elevated levels through the current quarter to date.
We've had a deep focus on our players through this time, our amazing studio teams have delivered great live service content while working from home, including FIFA Ultimate Team events, Madden Ultimate Team content the NFL Draft and new additions to Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes. We also launched our stay at home play together initiative to do some special things for our players as shelter-in-place orders began to take effect in March.
Thanks to the dedicated work of our teams and our partners, we've delivered dozens of stay and play programs to date from special community live streams and giveaways to athletes and celebrities playing our games with fans. Our sports teams launched a free cloud-based broadcasting platform allows us to produce high-quality esports content with competitors, hosts and production staff, all safely at home. We've -- conducted major online tournaments for Apex Legends, Madden NFL 20, FIFA Online 4 and FIFA 20, including the FIFA Stay and Play Cup, a $1 million charity tournament for COVID-19 release, that brought together top European clubs and footballs and aired in more than 100 countries. We've now executed or plan to execute in the coming months, more than 100 celebrity athlete community and charity online esports events.
The global crisis has also been hitting local communities very hard, and we've increased the funding in our charitable match program to support local organizations around the world. Our teams have also been doing extraordinary things to help in their communities from sourcing quantities of personal protective equipment to health care workers to food drives and much more, and we're supporting them in any way we can. I want to say a huge thanks again to the people of Electronic Arts in making all of this possible. Because of their fast and determined work, we've responded well to this global challenge, and we're in a good position to continue connecting more players through great games and content, and supporting our communities when and where they need it most.
Looking to FY '21, we are growing our portfolio of high-quality and innovative new games. We are planning to launch 40 new titles to play this fiscal year. That includes 4 new EA Sports titles FIFA, Madden, NHL and one more unannounced sports title, all of which deliver on the mix of creativity, authenticity and quality that sets EA SPORTS apart. EA SPORTS will also lead for us on the next-generation consoles this year, and we're excited to share more about the breakthroughs in those experiences soon. 
Our FY '21 plans also include 4 more games drawing on the breadth of our IP from Command & Conquer remastered to unannounced games for console and PC. We'll have more games from indie developers launching this year through EA partners and 2 new mobile titles leveraging top IP that will bring to players worldwide.
With our team's expertise in live services, we're also building some of the biggest ongoing experiences in the industry. We have a lot more for the growing Apex Legends community this year, starting next week with Season 5. Maxis will continue delivering Sims 4 content that empowers self-expression and fuels the creativity of our diverse player audience.
In addition, our new EA SPORTS games will continue delivering fans daily connection to sports through our live services even at the real-world leagues and teams aren't back in action yet. And we are also working to bring more content to FIFA Online and Apex Legend Asia that will excite our current players and welcome new ones.
This year, we plan to grow our communities across more platforms and list to play. Building on our announcement with Google Stadia last week, we plan to bring our games to more digital distribution channels. We'll take our subscription service to a fourth platform in Steam, and we're also planning to deliver for more Nintendo fans with multiple EA games set to launch on Nintendo Switch this year.
As we begin FY '21, our outlook for the year is strong. We also know there is uncertainty ahead as COVID-19 situation continues to unfold. Factors like macroeconomic challenges, the status of sports seasons, unknown impacts to our business partners and long-term impacts to our productivity in a global work-from-home environment are among the areas we'll be watching closely and could be both play behavior and our ability to deliver on our planned time lines.
We are thankful for the extraordinary people that we have Electronic Arts and for their dedication to each other, to our players, to our communities and our company. Now I'll turn the call over to Blake."
27963,628674198,1971489,"Electronic Arts Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, May 05, 2020",2020-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Electronic Arts Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Andrew. We had a strong year, but it is impossible for me to reflect on the past 12 months without acknowledging that we are all currently going through a very difficult time, and I hope that you and those close to you are healthy and safe.I'd l",1834,"Thanks, Andrew. We had a strong year, but it is impossible for me to reflect on the past 12 months without acknowledging that we are all currently going through a very difficult time, and I hope that you and those close to you are healthy and safe.
I'd like to focus on the impacts we're seeing in our business. First and foremost, we are concerned for the safety and well-being of our people. Andrew has given you a brief introduction to the measures we have taken and continue to take. Teams across the company have shown extraordinary innovation in meeting the challenges of delivering games from home. Developing a game from home inevitably carries risks, and we haven't yet solved all those problems. But for example, we just had a very successful FIFA ultimate team birthday event; apex Legends season 5 is about to launch; and we expect to see the next Sims expansion; and Command & Conquer remastered to both launch in June as scheduled. Learning from this period will forever change the way we work at EA.
Secondly, there is a question as to how this might affect how players behave. From Andrew, you've heard that people are playing our games a lot more, and we've seen a corresponding large rise in live service revenues that continues today. Our results this quarter proved the value of the live service path that we've been on now for a decade. The breadth and depth of our live services give us tremendous flexibility at times like this to meet player needs in a variety of ways.
The closure of physical retail has not yet affected the sales of full games with sales actually above where we would have expected them to be at this time of the year. This suggests that people who want game are finding a title in our catalog and downloading a digital copy or ordering a physical copy online. In addition, the shift to digital since the last recession reduces both the impact of store closures and of inventory risk. Physical game sales comprised 84% of our annual net bookings in fiscal 2009 compared to only 20% last year.
Turning to our results. I'll report them on a GAAP basis, then use our operational measure of net bookings to discuss the business dynamics. To compare results to historically reported non-GAAP measures, please refer to the relevant tabs in our downloadable financial model.
GAAP net revenue for the fiscal year was $5.54 billion; cost of revenue, $1.37 billion; operating income was $1.45 billion, delivering an EPS of $10.30, including onetime tax benefit of $5.97 that we previously discussed. These results enabled us to deliver free cash flow of $1.66 billion.
Total net bookings for the fiscal year were $5.21 billion, up 5.4% year-on-year. At constant currency, growth would have been over 7%. These were driven by strength across our business.
Moving on to the details of our fourth quarter: GAAP net revenues for the quarter were $1.39 billion, above our guidance by $62 million; operating expenses were $717 million, slightly less than what we guided; operating income was $401 million and resulted in earnings per share of $1.43, $0.38 better than our guidance; operating cash flow for the quarter was $498 million, down $101 million from last year, driven by increased royalties and cash taxes paid; capital expenditures for the quarter were $40 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $458 million. You can see this in our earnings slides for further cash flow information.
During the quarter, we repurchased 2.7 million shares at a cost of $291 million. Since quarter end, we have completed our 2-year $2.4 billion repurchase program. Due to the uncertainty of the markets and in the economy, management and the Board have chosen to postpone a review of our capital return plans until next quarter. Let me emphasize that this is a precaution. Our business today is extremely strong. 
Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $5.74 billion. Our balance sheet is very strong. With regards to debt, we have $1 billion in senior notes with $600 million maturing in March 2021 and $400 million due in 2026. Our debt equates to significantly less than the fiscal 2020 free cash flow.
Now I'd like to turn to the key drivers of our business in the quarter. Net bookings were $1.21 billion, well above our guidance of $1.15 billion, driven by our digital business. Digital net bookings were $1.12 billion with the beat versus expectations driven by The Sims 4 and Apex Legends. Digital net bookings represent 78% of our business on a trailing 12-month basis, a new record. This compares to 75% in the prior year. Live service net bookings were $789 million. The year-on-year decrease is driven by the massive launch of Apex Legends a year ago, offset by growth across the rest of our live services. Ultimate Team grew strongly throughout fiscal 2020.
Mobile delivered net bookings of $138 million, up 2% year-on-year driven by our sports titles in Asia. Full game PC and console downloads generated net bookings of $190 million, down 11% from last year driven by the launch of Anthem in the year ago quarter partially offset by the ongoing shift to digital. Overall, 49% of our units sold through were digital rather than physical, measured on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 over the last 12 months, and we continue to model underlying growth at 5 percentage points per year.
Looking ahead to the next 12 months, we are focused first and foremost on supporting our people, helping them cope with the world in which we find ourselves. Second, we are focused on enabling them to deliver the new content we're providing to our players through live services and the new games we have on our slate.
The market outlook is uncertain, but we're basing our modeling on the gaming software market growing in mid-single digits in calendar 2020, with mobile up 7%, console up 5% and PC up 5% in dollar terms. In addition, although our sports live services are continuing -- are currently performing extremely well, is not yet known when professional sports might resume nor what the impact on our business might be if that takes some time. In the meantime, our esports activities are providing to be popular competitive outlets for football, soccer and hockey fans.
There are also risks associated with our ability to deliver new games, and the guidance I'm about to provide is predicting -- are predicted on the title slate as outlined in the earnings presentation on our website. Note that this slide only identifies those titles that are already announced. As we have previously stated, our FY '21 revenue forecast includes additional titles from both EA and third-party studios which will be announced in the coming quarters. We're not seeing material impact on our FY '21 title slate but that could change, and the risk is higher for third-party titles where we have less control. Finally, with regard to potential impacts of a recession. The video game market has historically proven resilient as players have seen gains as a relatively inexpensive form of entertainment. Nevertheless, future economic indicators are extremely weak and may affect our business.
Before I get to the numbers, let me also discuss 3 changes we are making with regards to our reporting. First, we will present GAAP net revenue in the income statement as one item rather than as product and service; secondly, we will report mobile bookings gross of platform fees instead of net to align with industry practice; finally, we're updating the presentation of net bookings by composition to focus on full game and live service sales in line with the direction we continue to drive business. We've published more details on our IR website.
Guidance for fiscal 2021 is for GAAP net revenue of $5.525 billion; cost of revenue at $1.382 billion; and GAAP EPS of $3.35. As you compare with last year, remember, fiscal '20's GAAP EPS included a onetime tax benefit of $5.97 per share. We continue to forecast our management tax rate for the fiscal 2021 to be 18%.
With regards to cash flow for fiscal 2021, we expect operating cash flow to be approximately $1.575 billion. We anticipate capital expenditures of around $125 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.45 billion. Free cash flow is down slightly year-on-year with higher underlying profits more than offset by higher cash taxes and higher variable compensation and lower interest income.
Turning to business drivers. We anticipate net bookings for the year to be $5.55 billion, up 3.3% year-on-year on a like-for-like basis. Growth is primarily driven by live services plus strong sports launches and a broad portfolio of partner titles. Our projections assume a headwind from FX to net bookings of roughly $60 million. Although we note that exchange rates are likely to be more volatile in the near term as the result of market uncertainties induced by the pandemic. Both of these numbers are net of hedges. Our currency assumptions are disclosed in our earnings presentation on our website.
Drilling down further into the key drivers of our full year net bookings guidance, we expect live services and other to be $3.85 billion in fiscal 2021, up 7% compared to fiscal 2020. And full game net bookings to be $1.7 billion, down almost 5% year-on-year. Finally, with live services, we expect mobile to deliver net bookings of $721 million in fiscal 2001 (sic) [ 2021 ] up 1% on a like-for-like basis.
On a management reporting basis, operating expenses will grow 2% in fiscal 2021, reflecting tight expense controls in the face of macroeconomic uncertainties. We expect Q1 net bookings to be $1 billion. While we're seeing very strong engagement in net bookings growth to date, we're only a month into the quarter, and our current levels of engagement and monetization could subside as stay-at-home orders are eased and lifted. In addition, the swing factors discussed above in these unprecedented times are potentially huge, impossible to forecast and beyond our control. Thus, we're taking a more cautious view than normal. As usual, we have presented the quarterly phasing of our net bookings on our earnings presentation. Note that this year, the phasing includes the effect of revenue recognition from the games we are launching for the current generation of consoles that can also be upgraded free for the next generation. We've made a preliminary estimate of that impact in the phasing, but it should be noted that this will not affect net bookings for the full year nor cash flow, just the timing of recognition.
I'll finish by personally thanking everybody at the company for rising to the challenge. Every one of you have shown energy and ingenuity to enable us to deliver games and content at a time when players want them the most. Thank you.
With that, I'll hand it back to Andrew."

That's true every day, but it's especially true during his unprecedented situation. Our ability to fulfill important motivations to players, inspiration, escape, social connection, competition, creation and learning has brought more people to connect and spend time in our games in the recent weeks and months of COVID-19 stay-at-home orders. We've seen games be a source of joy for hundreds of millions of players. We will now look to be delivering to these players for a long time to come.
Our focus continues to be on delivering great games and content through the breadth and depth of our portfolio in our ongoing live services and by connecting more players through our games via more distribution channels and platforms.
With the incredible termination of our teams, we've been able to keep producing new experiences from our homes around the world. And as we continue to work through this global challenge, we plan to continue to bring a lot of new games, new experiences and exciting ways to play this year.
How we live, work and play will undoubtedly be changed by the COVID-19 pandemic. We're humble that games have been part of how people are coming together. We'll continue to serve our people, our players and our local communities by helping them in any way that we can.
To everyone listening into this call, please be safe and be well. Now Blake and I are here for your questions."

And again, in the context of a work-at-home environment, they have been truly inspirational and how they've continued to develop great entertainment in the context of our Battlefield universe. I'm excited for when it actually comes.
In terms of specific announcements around what might be coming in the out years, I would tell you that we don't have anything to announce today. But more broadly, you should imagine that we're going to continue to invest heavily in our EA SPORTS-branded properties, bringing some new properties back over the coming years. We've talked before about having new IP in development, both for console and PC and for mobile. We're excited about that. And I'd also say we've got a number of new incubation products that are starting to come together that are looking exciting for the future as well. So I don't think we've ever had as robust a pipeline of content ahead of us as we have right now. I don't think we've ever had the level of execution we're seeing around the development and launch of content and the management of ongoing live services that we have right now. And while there are always challenges and interesting hurdles that we face, delivering great interactive entertainment experiences, I would tell you, I'm very excited by what I see more so than I have been for our pipeline for a long time.
With respect to Apex, I think that falls into that category. I -- we don't have any specific to announce beyond what we've already talked about, other than to say, I just saw the results of our season 5 trailer for Apex today. So we dropped it. It has a 99% approval rate. And is the top trending video on YouTube games today. That, in conjunction with some gameplay we saw in our Apex mobile title, I feel very excited about that franchise overall."

And I'd echo what Andrew just said, if you check out the trailer on season 5, I think what you'll see is we continue to evolve this live service. And remember, this is a live service, that is why it's so exciting. And we're adding interesting, exciting new content. And then as you look at the trailer, remember, the team did a huge part of this game from home. And I think that's an important message that shouldn't be ignored because it is not easy. And what we've proven to ourselves, we didn't think it was possible, but it's proving that at least so far, we know there's risks going forward, but it's amazing what the teams have been able to do working apart from each other from home, and just check out the trailer."

I think as most people know, we -- our back half of this year, unlike last year, didn't have any new titles. We obviously benefited from follow-on sales for Jedi: Fallen Order, which were strong. But it was really a live service quarter for us. And as you can see from the numbers, it exceeded our expectations and our guidance substantially. The big drivers on that are Apex, the Ultimate Team businesses across the board and our catalog of great titles. And people always underestimate the power of 2 things inside of EA, the catalog and live services. And we continue to build more and more live services that engage people socially and bring people to -- or allow people to enjoy things that they love. In a world where there was no sports, we became sports for people. And if you look at our business across Madden, FIFA, hockey, it's incredible, the level of engagement we saw. And obviously, the level of revenue growth we saw during that time frame. Madden, on its own, was the biggest Madden year we have ever seen. And the biggest Madden Ultimate Team year we have ever seen. And much of that due to the amazing work the game teams did in building Madden with incredible new modes and components to it and a ton of fun and then pushing that into Ultimate Team as well. But I think people  always need to understand the stability of our business is driven by this incredible machine that we've built around live services and the underlying strength of our portfolio and our long and large catalog. Andrew, I'll let you jump in on the development."

One, are there any metrics that we could point to because you kind of speak to the level of elevation we've seen. I would tell you that FIFA hours watched in April were up 135% over last April and are up 115% from Madden. Our esports TV broadcast hours in the U.S. in April were up 250% over last year. And April alone was 30% bigger than all of calendar year 2019. So we're seeing tremendous engagement in the unbelievable creativity and innovation that our teams are delivering.
As we think about this on a go-forward basis, I think about it in 2 buckets. One is just how do we think about building games going forward. And how do we think players will engage as things start to return to normal. Again, I would take this opportunity to celebrate the creativity and ingenuity of our teams. They have been truly inspirational in how they have come together and how they work and build games and create games and deliver epic entertainment to our global audience of players. We had already, over the last 5 years, started to move towards a distributed development model. We utilize the best creative talent in a number of different regions around the world to come together and build spectacular entertainment for players. I think what we have learned through this process is that there are new areas of innovation and creativity that we can unlock in a distributed model and some of the foundations that our teams are building in the context of developing games, of developing motion capture, of developing commentary, of filing games are going to be really helpful for us on a go-forward basis.
I also spoke to, in the prepared remarks, about how our esports teams have built a fully cloud-based broadcast model. Again, we have a wonderful facility in our head office, and we'll use other people facilities to bring people together and broadcast esports events. But we've been able to deliver hundreds and hundreds of hours of esports content completely remotely with host, broadcasters, players and fans all safely at home. I believe this will accelerate our ability to develop and deliver amazing esports content to a global audience, and continue to fulfill the insatiable appetite that is absolutely there that we're seeing right now.
As it relates to gamers, again, I think it's too early to tell. But a few things we know are true. One is that games fulfill these core motivations that we have, the ones I talked about in the prepared remarks, like inspiration, and escape, and social connection, and competition and creation and learning, better than just about any other form of entertainment on the planet. And there are many, many new players who are coming in discovering just how wonderful games are and the joy of games and how spectacular they can bring people together. And our expectation is that people having invested this time and built relationships with friends through new games they're playing, will continue to drive engagement over the long term.

And what we're seeing through this period of time is as more people come to recognize the true joy of interactive entertainment, the true joy of gaming, even as I think linear media has also benefited through this time. I do believe that engagement will be more consistent in the interactive industry over time. I do believe we're seeing new players come in who maybe hadn't played before and who are experiencing the goodness that comes from connecting with friends in a truly interactive environment through games. We're excited about that. We're excited to deliver new and interesting and innovative and creative entertainment to fans.

We're obviously -- both Gamescom and E3 have been canceled. Many of the industry events that typically, we would bring people together or our own internal events where we would have brought people together, were canceled. So obviously, we'll see some savings there. We don't really have a full sense on what the future will bring a year from now. But I know we will think differently about how we operate, how many people we have in certain offices. What that looks like, that could actually change expenses in a negative way. I hope not. I don't think that's what we're focused on. We hope that we can actually have more people working from home that changes expenses to a positive. But it's early days to say. But I know at least in the near term, we will see some savings. And we've tried to reflect that in some of our guidance but we don't really have a sense of how long this will go. We're currently working on plans as to how we would bring people back into offices and what the pace would be. We're not going to bring everybody back on day 1. And I think most companies are going through the same thing.

And maybe that turns into something which helps us with M&A going forward. We're -- our model right now is just really simple, which is stay close to all the companies we know. It's harder because you can't go meet with them face-to-face, but stay close to them on the phone, on Zoom, wherever it is, and make sure you're supportive because we believe longer term, that helps us potentially become a deeper partnership with them.

I don't -- I think -- you should assume our costs won't change versus what they've been historically. The real question is going to be, do we benefit from slower hiring and less travel during the coming few quarters? And I think we will, and that's built into our guidance. But I don't have a sense of, does that last another year or more. So I think that will take some time for us to really better understand that. As both Andrew and I said on the call, our focus is on how do we hold together our team. We do not want to have to reduce what we believe is one of the greatest teams in the industry, and that's our #1 focus. And I think everybody aligns with that. And they understand, okay, we will do everything we can to not spend to make sure that, that happens.
In terms of the sports calendar, I mean, the biggest unknown for us right now is 2 things. The economy. What really happens to the economy over time. Today, we see our core audience spending because they're at home more, but does that change over time? And then the second challenge is, what's the impact if the sports calendar does not start up at some period of time. We know today, people are engaging with sports because that's what they love to do. If you're a sports fan, it doesn't stop. And so the only way they're getting their sports engagement is through our games, and that's a huge benefit for us. But we don't know because there's no precedent on this. What happens long term, if any of the sports seasons get delayed even further. But we do believe that everything we're seeing now, and everything we're seeing, particularly in e-sports, is we can be a huge factor in helping people socialize and do what they love around the sport they love. And don't forget the social part because remember, people don't sit and watch a sports game alone. They sit and watch a sports game and interact with all their friends that they know engage in that sport. And what we're doing is we're enabling that to happen through our games and through the watching of esports online. So we hope that, that bodes for a great season going forward, but we've never been at a time like this before. And so that's why you're hearing any caution from us."

I would tell you our relationship with NFL was very, very strong. We look forward to building NFL games for many years to come. And what you should expect from us over time is that we will continue to build out our NFL football offerings, both in the context of building on the Madden platform. Again, when you think about gamers the biggest -- one of the most important things to them, a sense of community and being part of such a big community like the Madden community, whether they're playing frontline sim, 11 or 11 simulation football, or are they playing the fast knockout mode that we launched this year, or whether they start to play some of the new modes that we plan to deliver in the future on console, on PC and on mobile.

And remember, we came out of the gate last -- or last February, excuse me, on fire, like you never would have believed, right? And so a massive business. And then we settled into a regular cadence, and we've been able to grow that each quarter through all the seasons that we've had, and we're feeling very good about that. The second piece is we -- as the sports calendar shut down, we made the decision to move the -- what is the -- it's called the FUT birthday, FIFA Ultimate Team birthday event from the end of March into the first 2 weeks of April. And it was really driven by trying to pace out sports content knowing that there was no sports content in the world. And so -- but it's one of the biggest events of the year. And so you can imagine that also impacted the year as we went from Q4 compared to previous year Q4. Those were the 2 biggest drivers.
On the positive side, Madden both live service -- Ultimate Team has been on fire, which in the February, March time frame is rare because it's post the Super Bowl but it's been very strong. FIFA Online 4 in Korea was very strong. Remember, we -- I think we said in the last earnings call, we shut off FIFA Online 3 in Korea. We're still running both FIFA Online 3 and FIFA Online 4 in China at this point. But as we shut off FIFA Online 3 in Korea, we saw massive growth in FIFA Online 4. And so that's kind of the puts and takes. And then on top of that, I would say, Sims 4 continues to be the title that just doesn't stop. And I think as Andrew mentioned in his previous comments, it has continued to grow quarter after quarter after quarter. It is an incredible team, an incredible product and amazing engagement. And so you can say -- put it all on the Apex last year, unbelievable benefit and then the FIFA move of the FUT birthday in the quarter. 
Mobile. The way we've approached mobile for the year in terms of our guidance is we basically have assumed that mobile titles will stay in soft launch much longer than they have historically. And so we have relatively little new mobile growth from new products in the year. Our hope is that we can exceed that, but that's how we've built our guidance because we know the mobile industry continues to get harder and harder. And that means people are keeping mobile tiles in soft launch for longer and longer to try to tune them. The good news is that we still have a strong set of mobile titles today that are highly profitable. You look at Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, for example, continues to perform extremely well. Things like Sim City continue to perform extremely well. And while we're not growing dramatically, we're still extremely profitable across those titles. And our hope is the new titles that we have in the mix will get out of soft launch faster than we anticipate and possibly help us generate something above what we forecast for the year."

Could you -- if you could give us some color on  -- sort of almost -- has the sports title seen any sort of deterioration at all relative to other titles through the month of April at all? Or how should we think about the guidance on a going-forward basis of how you're building sort of recession, no sports, lots of sports.

I would say the strength of Electronic Arts is built on our ability to be platform agnostic. We have been able -- throughout our history, we've been able to get to more platforms with more titles of higher quality than most everyone else in the industry. It is a position we're very proud of, and we continue to drive against that. 6 or 7 years ago, we anticipated that to be many more new platforms we would have to build on over time, and ultimately, the cloud would also emerge as its own platform across a number of different companies or portals. And part of the reason we moved the organization to a single digital platform, single ID, single commerce, single data, single infrastructure, single security, and we moved the organization to a single engine in Frostbite was in anticipation of this. So that as these new platforms come online, we're able to get to them more quickly and more efficiently and at higher quality than maybe our competitors can who are working on multiple platforms and multiple engines. And actually really use our scale to our advantage in our ability to do that. And what you're seeing from us now is our ability to get to console and new consoles and PC, and Steam, and Stadia and mobile, and you should expect that we have -- and Switch, and you should expect that we will continue to look to deliver great content on any and all new platforms that we think have the ability to reach critical mass of gamers.
In the context of overall time between games, I think it's different by game. What we know to be true is that games are getting bigger and more complex in development. But they're also entertaining significantly more players on each release basis, and holding onto those players for much, much longer through ongoing engagement in live services and social interaction. And so as we think about our broader portfolio, you'll continue to see us launch games on an annualized basis. Our sports games would be a good example there. You'll continue to see us launch games on a multiyear basis, things like Battlefield or some of our titles out of Dragon Age would be a good example of that. You'll continue to see us think about games on a 5- and 6-year time horizon. The Sims, which launched again over 5 years ago and continues to grow every year through extra content and live services, would be an example of that. And then you'll see us launch true platform games like Apex Legends, which we expect will have -- continue to grow over the next decade.
So again, I would come back to, I feel good about how we have moved the company on a technology basis. That puts us in a position to reach as many players as possible across geographies, across platforms, across business models, across genres as this global playing audience continues to expand."

And yet -- and we've cautioned everyone and we put caveats on everything. And I don't know what's going to transpire, but we were still willing to come out and put out guidance that we thought would grow both top line and bottom line year-over-year.
Look at Q1. The largest Q1 in the history of the company was $0.31 in EPS, and we just provided you guidance for $0.70 in EPS.

With regards to our calendar, our Q1 fiscal 2021 earnings call is scheduled for Thursday, July 30, 2020. Many of the usual opportunities we have to meet with investors, such as conferences, are unavailable at this time. We're building out a program of virtual tours to reach as many of you as possible over the coming weeks and months directly and through partnering with sell-side analysts.
This presentation and our comments include forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future financial performance of the company. Actual events and results may differ materially from our expectations. And note in particular that these forward-looking statements may be affected by risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We refer you to our most recent Form 10-Q and our earnings release for a discussion of risks, including those related to COVID-19, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. Electronic Arts makes these statements as of today, May 5, 2020, and disclaims any duty to update them.
During this call, the financial metrics, with the exception of free cash flow, will be presented on a GAAP basis. All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year unless otherwise stated.
And now I'll turn the call over to Andrew."

As global citizens, we are all enduring a period of great uncertainty and continuing to fight the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. We're here to report on our quarterly results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, and Blake and I will speak to those. However, our focus, first and foremost, has been on the health and well-being of our teams and their families during the COVID-19 situation. I'll start by sharing a little about our actions to support our employees around the world.
We have an internal COVID-19 task force that has been tracking and making decisions on a daily basis since January to keep our teams safe, including early decisions to restrict business travel, cancel events and close our Shanghai and Seoul facilities. By mid-March, we shifted nearly all of our global workforce to work from home in response to the growing threat of the pandemic. Through this transition, we've put a heavy focus on ensuring our people have everything they need to balance the challenges of work and home life during stay-at-home orders and physical distancing.
We continue to be in a work-from-home status for all of our locations outside of Shanghai. We have detailed protocols to evaluate our readiness to return in each of our offices when the time is right, accounting for guidance from health authorities and government, the comfort level of our employees and preparation of our facilities for continued physical distancing. We're planning for the return to take place over an extended period, and we make -- as we make longer-term changes to our locations and practices in response to the pandemic. We will continue to do everything we need to support our teams as we go forward.
Moving to our results. We finished a strong year for Electronic Arts with fourth quarter and full year revenue and earnings above our previously raised guidance. The innovation that we are delivering to players across the breadth of our games and live services continues to drive strength in our business. I'll touch on a few examples from the year.
EA SPORTS is a pillar of our portfolio and continues to bring more players together. FIFA is one of the biggest and most engaging entertainment franchises in the world. With approximately 100 million players engaging globally in our FIFA franchise, more than 25 million unique players have joined FIFA 20 so far with VOLTA opening up an entirely new dimension of the game and FIFA Ultimate Team continue to grow as the most popular mode. FIFA Online in Asia also continues its momentum, significantly outperforming our expectations.
Madden NFL is a cultural icon in football, gaming and entertainment, and it just had its biggest year ever. We took a new approach to launching and rolling out new modes of play in Madden NFL 20, and the result was the highest engagement levels in franchise history.
Apex Legends was the most downloaded free-to-play game on PS4 in 2019 and continues to grow as an innovative long-term service for players. It's been continually recognized as one of the best multi-player experiences available. And with each new season of content, Respawn had been delivering more of what players love from lore to new legends to in-game events.
Before COVID-19 stay-at-home orders began, season 4 was already outperforming each of the 2 prior seasons, and the Old Ways Event in April has become the most successful ever for Apex. Our Apex esports tournaments have generated approximately 2x the average viewing audience of other top esports leagues. Respawn have added more teams in our development organization to work on great new content, and we continue to have a strong focus on the thriving Apex Legends community.
Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is one of the breakout titles of the last several years. More than 10 million unique players have joined the game since launch, a rare achievement for a first title in an entirely new franchise. It's a meticulously well-crafted game, and it continues to give fans a deeply engaging and original Star Wars experience.
The Sims 4 inspires an entirely different gaming audience and one that continues to grow. It provides a completely unique experience from anything else in the market, and FY '20 was its biggest year since launch. In every quarter this year, monthly average players in the Sims 4 were higher than the previous year. Our Sims community is diverse and highly creative, and our success continues to be built on delivering a wide variety of content and ways to engage for players with very different interests.
With more people staying at home in the fourth quarter, we did see rising usage and engagement levels in many of our games. We're humbled to see people wanting to connect through our games during this time, in part, has been made possible by the amazing work of our teams and our technology investments across the company. For more than 5 years, we've been investing in a single technology infrastructure architecture and digital platform as we accelerate into a digital world. That's enabled us to provide mobility for our employees in this environment and maintain strong productivity.
But the real story is the people of Electronics Arts. We have such tremendously talented, dedicated and determined teams. They've come together in the strongest and most inspiring way through this pandemic response period in service of each other and in service of our players. And as a result, we have been able to adapt and scale in this changing environment where engagement in our games has reached new peaks and continues at elevated levels through the current quarter to date.
We've had a deep focus on our players through this time, our amazing studio teams have delivered great live service content while working from home, including FIFA Ultimate Team events, Madden Ultimate Team content for the NFL Draft and new additions to Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes. We also launched our stay-at-home play together initiative to do some special things for our players as shelter-in-place orders began to take effect in March.
Thanks to the dedicated work of our teams and our partners, we've delivered dozens of stay and play programs to date from special community live streams and giveaways to athletes and celebrities playing our games with fans. Our sports teams launched a fully cloud-based broadcasting platform that allows us to produce high-quality esports content with competitors, hosts and production staff all safely at home. We've since conducted major online tournaments for Apex Legends, Madden NFL 20, FIFA Online 4 and FIFA 20, including the FIFA Stay and Play Cup, a $1 million charity tournament for COVID-19 relief that brought together top European clubs and footballers and aired in more than 100 countries. We've now executed or plan to execute in the coming months more than 100 celebrity, athlete, community and charity online esports events.
The global crisis has also been hitting local communities very hard, and we've increased the funding in our charitable match program to support local organizations around the world. Our teams have also been doing extraordinary things to help in their communities from sourcing quantities of personal protective equipment for health care workers to food drives and much more, and we're supporting them in any way we can. I want to say a huge thanks again to the people of Electronic Arts in making all of this possible. Because of their fast and determined work, we've responded well to this global challenge, and we're in a good position to continue connecting more players through great games and content and supporting our communities when and where they need it most.
Looking to FY '21, we are growing our portfolio of high-quality and innovative new games. We are planning to launch 40 new titles to play this fiscal year. That includes 4 new EA SPORTS titles, FIFA, Madden, NHL and 1 more unannounced sports title, all of which deliver on the mix of creativity, authenticity and quality that sets EA SPORTS apart. EA SPORTS will also lead for us on the next-generation consoles this year, and we're excited to share more about the breakthroughs in those experiences soon.
Our FY '21 plans also include 4 more games drawing on the breadth of our IP from Command & Conquer Remastered to unannounced games for console and PC. We'll have more games from indie developers launching this year through EA partners and 2 new mobile titles leveraging top IP that will bring to players worldwide.
With our team's expertise in live services, we're also building some of the biggest ongoing experiences in the industry. We have a lot more for the growing Apex Legends community this year, starting next week with Season 5. Maxis will continue delivering Sims 4 content that empowers self-expression and fuels the creativity of our diverse player audience. 
In addition, our new EA SPORTS games will continue delivering fans daily connection to sports through our live services even at the real-world leagues and teams aren't back in action yet. And we are also working to bring more content to FIFA Online and Apex Legends in Asia that will excite our current players and welcome new ones.
This year, we plan to grow our communities across more platforms and ways to play. Building on our announcement with Google Stadia last week, we plan to bring our games to more digital distribution channels. We'll take our subscription service to a fourth platform in Steam, and we're also planning to deliver for more Nintendo fans with multiple EA games set to launch on Nintendo Switch this year.
As we begin FY '21, our outlook for the year is strong. We also know there is uncertainty ahead as COVID-19 situation continues to unfold. Factors like macroeconomic challenges, the status of sports seasons, unknown impacts to our business partners and long-term impacts to our productivity in a global work-from-home environment are among the areas we will be watching closely and could affect both player behavior and our ability to deliver on our planned time lines.
We are thankful for the extraordinary people that we have Electronic Arts and for their dedication to each other, to our players, to our communities and our company. Now I'll turn the call over to Blake."

We had a strong year, but it is impossible for me to reflect on the past 12 months without acknowledging that we are all currently going through a very difficult time, and I hope that you and those close to you are healthy and safe. I'd",1852,"Thanks, Andrew. We had a strong year, but it is impossible for me to reflect on the past 12 months without acknowledging that we are all currently going through a very difficult time, and I hope that you and those close to you are healthy and safe. 
I'd like to focus on the impacts we're seeing in our business. First and foremost, we are concerned for the safety and well-being of our people. Andrew has given you a brief introduction to the measures we have taken and continue to take. Teams across the company have shown extraordinary innovation in meeting the challenges of delivering games from home. Developing a game from home inevitably carries risks, and we haven't yet solved all those problems. But for example, we just had a very successful FIFA Ultimate Team Birthday event. Apex Legends Season 5 is about to launch, and we expect to see the next Sims expansion; and Command & Conquer Remastered to both launch in June as scheduled. Learning from this period will forever change the way we work at EA.
Secondly, there is a question as to how this might affect how players behave. From Andrew, you've heard that people are playing our games a lot more, and we've seen a corresponding large rise in live service revenues that continues today. Our results this quarter proved the value of the live service path that we've been on now for a decade. The breadth and depth of our live services give us tremendous flexibility at times like this to meet player needs in a variety of ways.
The closure of physical retail has not yet affected the sales of full games with sales actually above where we would have expected them to be at this time of the year. This suggests that people who want a game are finding a title in our catalog and downloading a digital copy or ordering a physical copy online. In addition, the shift to digital since the last recession reduces both the impact of store closures and of inventory risk. Physical game sales comprised 84% of our annual net bookings in fiscal 2009 compared to only 20% last year.
Turning to our results. I'll report them on a GAAP basis, then use our operational measures of net bookings to discuss the business dynamics. To compare results to historically reported non-GAAP measures, please refer to the relevant tabs in our downloadable financial model.
GAAP net revenue for the fiscal year was $5.54 billion; cost of revenue, $1.37 billion. Operating income was $1.45 billion, delivering an EPS of $10.30, including onetime tax benefit of $5.97 that we previously discussed. These results enabled us to deliver free cash flow of $1.66 billion.
Total net bookings for the fiscal year were $5.21 billion, up 5.4% year-on-year. At constant currency, growth would have been over 7%. Digital net bookings accounted for $4.05 billion of this. Live services net bookings were $2.78 billion, up 15% year-on-year driven by strength across our business.
Moving on to the details of our fourth quarter. GAAP net revenues for the quarter were $1.39 billion, above our guidance by $62 million. Operating expenses were $717 million, slightly less than what we guided. Operating income was $401 million and resulted in earnings per share of $1.43, $0.38 better than our guidance. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $498 million, down $101 million from last year, driven by increased royalties and cash taxes paid. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $40 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $458 million. You can see this in our earnings slide for further cash flow information.
During the quarter, we repurchased 2.7 million shares at a cost of $291 million. Since quarter end, we have completed our 2-year $2.4 billion repurchase program. Due to the uncertainty of the markets and in the economy, management and the Board have chosen to postpone a review of our capital return plans until next quarter. Let me emphasize that this is a precaution. Our business today is extremely strong.
Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $5.74 billion. Our balance sheet is very strong. With regards to debt, we have $1 billion in senior notes with $600 million maturing in March 2021 and $400 million due in 2026. Our debt equates to significantly less than the fiscal 2020 free cash flow.
Now I'd like to turn to the key drivers of our business in the quarter. Net bookings were $1.21 billion, well above our guidance of $1.15 billion, driven by our digital business. Digital net bookings were $1.12 billion with the beat versus expectations driven by The Sims 4 and Apex Legends. Digital net bookings represent 78% of our business on a trailing 12-month basis, a new record. This compares to 75% in the prior year. Live service net bookings were $789 million. The year-on-year decrease is driven by the massive launch of Apex Legends a year ago offset by growth across the rest of our live services. Ultimate Team grew strongly throughout fiscal 2020.
Mobile delivered net bookings of $138 million, up 2% year-on-year driven by our sports titles in Asia. Full game PC and console downloads generated net bookings of $190 million, down 11% from last year driven by the launch of Anthem in the year-ago quarter partially offset by the ongoing shift to digital. Overall, 49% of our units sold through were digital rather than physical, measured on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 over the last 12 months, and we continue to model underlying growth at 5 percentage points per year.
Looking ahead to the next 12 months. We are focused first and foremost on supporting our people, helping them cope with the world in which we find ourselves. Second, we are focused on enabling them to deliver the new content we're providing to our players through live services and the new games we have on our slate.
The market outlook is uncertain, but we're basing our modeling on the gaming software market growing in mid-single digits in calendar 2020 with mobile up 7%, console up 5% and PC up 5% in dollar terms. In addition, although our sports live services are continuing -- are currently performing extremely well, is not yet known when professional sports might resume nor what the impact on our business might be if that takes some time. In the meantime, our esports activities are providing to be popular competitive outlets for football, soccer and hockey fans.
There are also risks associated with our ability to deliver new games, and the guidance I'm about to provide is predicting -- are predicted on the title slate as outlined in the earnings presentation on our website. Note that this slide only identifies those titles that are already announced. As we have previously stated, our FY '21 revenue forecast includes additional titles from both EA and third-party studios, which will be announced in the coming quarters. We're not seeing material impact on our FY '21 title slate, but that could change, and the risk is higher for third-party titles where we have less control.
Finally, with regard to potential impacts of a recession. The video game market has historically proven resilient as players have seen games as a relatively inexpensive form of entertainment. Nevertheless, future economic indicators are extremely weak and may affect our business.
Before I get to the numbers, let me also discuss 3 changes we are making with regards to our reporting. First, we will present GAAP net revenue in the income statement as one item rather than as product and service. Secondly, we will report mobile bookings gross of platform fees instead of net to align with industry practice. Finally, we're updating the presentation of net bookings by composition to focus on full game and live service sales in line with the direction we continue to drive the business. We've published more details on our IR website.
Guidance for fiscal 2021 is for GAAP net revenue of $5.525 billion, cost of revenue at $1.382 billion and GAAP EPS of $3.35. As you compare with last year, remember, fiscal '20's GAAP EPS included a onetime tax benefit of $5.97 per share. We continue to forecast our management tax rate for the fiscal 2021 to be 18%.
With regards to cash flow for fiscal 2021, we expect operating cash flow to be approximately $1.575 billion. We anticipate capital expenditures of around $125 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.45 billion. Free cash flow is down slightly year-on-year with higher underlying profits more than offset by higher cash taxes and higher variable compensation and lower interest income.
Turning to business drivers. We anticipate net bookings for the year to be $5.55 billion, up 3.3% year-on-year on a like-for-like basis. Growth is primarily driven by live services plus strong sports launches and a broad portfolio of partner titles. Our projections assume a headwind from FX to net bookings of roughly $60 million, although we note that exchange rates are likely to be more volatile in the near term as the result of market uncertainties induced by the pandemic. Both of these numbers are net of hedges. Our currency assumptions are disclosed in our earnings presentation on our website.
Drilling down further into the key drivers of our full year net bookings guidance, we expect live services and other to be $3.85 billion in fiscal 2021, up 7% compared to fiscal 2020. And full game net bookings to be $1.7 billion, down almost 5% year-on-year. Finally, with live services, we expect mobile to deliver net bookings of $721 million in fiscal 2001 (sic) [ 2021 ], up 1% on a like-for-like basis.
On a management reporting basis, operating expenses will grow 2% in fiscal 2021, reflecting tight expense controls in the face of macroeconomic uncertainties. We expect Q1 net bookings to be $1 billion. While we're seeing very strong engagement in net bookings growth to date, we're only a month into the quarter, and our current levels of engagement and monetization could subside as stay-at-home orders are eased and lifted. In addition, the swing factors discussed above in these unprecedented times are potentially huge, impossible to forecast and beyond our control. Thus, we're taking a more cautious view than normal.
As usual, we have presented the quarterly phasing of our net bookings in our earnings presentation. Note that this year, the phasing includes the effect of revenue recognition from the games we are launching for the current generation of consoles that can also be upgraded free for the next generation. We've made a preliminary estimate of that impact in the phasing, but it should be noted that this will not affect net bookings for the full year nor cash flow, just the timing of recognition.
I'll finish by personally thanking everybody at the company for rising to the challenge. Every one of you have shown energy and ingenuity to enable us to deliver games and content at a time when players want them the most. Thank you.
With that, I'll hand it back to Andrew."

We feel very fortunate at Electronic Arts to have the opportunity to bring games and entertainment to people around the world. That's true every day, but it's especially true during his unprecedented situation. Our ability to fulfill important motivations to players, inspiration, escape, social connection, competition, creation and learning has brought more people to connect and spend time in our games in the recent weeks and months of COVID-19 stay-at-home orders. We've seen games be a source of joy for hundreds of millions of players. We will now look to be delivering for these players for a long time to come.
Our focus continues to be on delivering great games and content through the breadth and depth of our portfolio in our ongoing live services and by connecting more players through our games via more distribution channels and platforms.
With the incredible determination of our teams, we've been able to keep producing new experiences from our homes around the world. And as we continue to work through this global challenge, we plan to continue delivering a lot of new games, new experiences and exciting ways to play this year.
How we live, work and play will undoubtedly be changed by the COVID-19 pandemic. We're humbled that games have been part of how people are coming together. We'll continue to serve our people, our players and our local communities by helping them in any way that we can.
To everyone listening into this call, please be safe and be well. Now Blake and I are here for your questions."

And again, in the context of the work-at-home environment, they have been truly inspirational in how they've continued to develop great entertainment in the context of our Battlefield universe. I'm excited for when next year comes.
In terms of specific announcements around what might be coming in the out years, I would tell you that we don't have anything to announce today. But more broadly, you should imagine that we're going to continue to invest heavily in our EA SPORTS-branded properties, bringing some new properties back over the coming years. We've talked before about having new IP in development, both for console and PC and for mobile. We're excited about that. And I'd also say we've got a number of new incubation products that are starting to come together that are looking exciting for the future as well. So I don't think we've ever had as robust a pipeline of content ahead of us as we have right now. I don't think we've ever had the level of execution that we're seeing around the development and launch of content and the management of ongoing live services than we have right now. And while there are always challenges and interesting hurdles that we face delivering great interactive entertainment experiences, I would tell you, I'm very excited by what I see more so than I have been for our pipeline for a long time.
With respect to Apex, I think it falls into that category. I -- we don't have anything specific to announce beyond what we've already talked about other than to say I just saw the results of our Season 5 trailer for Apex today. So we dropped it. It has a 99% approval rate and is the top trending video on YouTube games today.

And I echo what Andrew just said. If you check out the trailer on Season 5, I think what you'll see is we continue to evolve this live service. And remember, this is a live service. That's why it's so exciting. And we're adding interesting, exciting new content. And then as you look at the trailer, remember, the team did a huge part of this game from home, and I think that's an important message that shouldn't be ignored because it is not easy. And what we've proven to ourselves, we didn't think it was possible, but it's proving that, at least so far, we know there's risks going forward, but it's amazing what the teams have been able to do working apart from each other from home.

I think as most people know, we -- our back half of this year, unlike last year, didn't have any new titles. We obviously benefited from follow-on sales for Jedi: Fallen Order, which were strong, but it was really a live service quarter for us. And as you can see from the numbers, it exceeded our expectations and our guidance substantially. The big drivers on that are Apex, the Ultimate Team businesses across the board and our catalog of great titles. And people always underestimate the power of 2 things inside of EA: the catalog and live services. And we continue to build more and more live services that engage people socially and bring people to -- or allow people to enjoy things that they love. In a world where there was no sports, we became sports for people. And if you look at our business across Madden, FIFA, hockey, it's incredible, the level of engagement we saw and obviously, the level of revenue growth we saw during that time frame.
Madden, on its own, was the biggest Madden year we have ever seen and the biggest Madden Ultimate Team year we have ever seen and much of that due to the amazing work the game teams did in building Madden with incredible new modes and components to it and a ton of fun and then pushing that into Ultimate Team as well. But I think people always need to understand the stability of our business is driven by this incredible machine that we've built around live services and the underlying strength of our portfolio and our long and large catalog. Andrew, I'll let you jump in on development."

One, are there any metrics that we could point to just kind of speak to the level of elevation we've seen? I would tell you that FIFA hours watched in April were up 135% over last April and are up 115% for Madden. Our esports TV broadcast hours in the U.S. in April were up 250% over last year, and April alone was 30% bigger than all of calendar year 2019. So we're seeing tremendous engagement in the unbelievable creativity and innovation that our teams are delivering.
As we think about this on a go-forward basis, I think about it in 2 buckets. One is just how do we think about building games going forward and how do we think players will engage as things start to return to normal. Again, I would take this opportunity to celebrate the creativity and ingenuity of our teams. They have been truly inspirational in how they have come together and how they work and build games and create games and deliver epic entertainment to our global audience of players. We had already, over the last 5 years, started to move towards a distributed development model. We utilize the best creative talent in a number of different regions around the world to come together and build spectacular entertainment for players. I think what we have learned through this process is that there are new areas of innovation and creativity that we can unlock in a distributed model and some of the foundations that our teams are building in the context of developing games, of developing motion capture, of developing commentary, of filing games are going to be really helpful for us on a go-forward basis.
I also spoke to -- in the prepared remarks, about how our esports teams have built a fully cloud-based broadcast model. Again, we have a wonderful facility at our head office, and we'll use other people's facilities to bring people together and broadcast esports events. But we've been able to deliver hundreds and hundreds of hours of esports content completely remotely with host, broadcasters, players and fans all safely at home. I believe this will accelerate our ability to develop and deliver amazing esports content to a global audience and continue to fulfill the insatiable appetite that is absolutely there that we're seeing right now.
As it relates to gamers, again, I think it's too early to tell, but a few things we know are true. One is that games fulfill these core motivations that we have, the ones I talked about in the prepared remarks, like inspiration and escape and social connection and competition and creation and learning, better than just about any other form of entertainment on the planet. And there are many, many new players who are coming and discovering just how wonderful games are and the joy of games and how spectacular they can bring people together. And our expectation is that people having invested this time and built relationships with friends through new games they're playing will continue to drive engagement over the long term. And our objective, of course, is to fully support them as they move through this COVID-19 phase and ensure that we are able to continue to fulfill the motivations they have even as we get on the other side of this."

And what we're seeing through this period of time is, as more people come to recognize the true joy of interactive entertainment, the true joy of gaming even as I think linear media has also benefited through this time, I do believe that engagement will be more consistent in the interactive industry over time. I do believe we're seeing new players come in who maybe hadn't played before and who are experiencing the goodness that comes from connecting with friends in a truly interactive environment through games.

We're obviously -- both gamescom and E3 have been canceled. Many of the industry events that typically we would bring people together or our own internal events where we would have brought people together were canceled. So obviously, we'll see some savings there. We don't really have a full sense on what the future will bring a year from now, but I know we will think differently about how we operate, how many people we have in certain offices, what that looks like. That could actually change expenses in a negative way. I hope not. I don't think that's what we're focused on. We hope that we can actually have more people working from home that changes expenses to a positive. But it's early days to say, but I know at least in the near term we will see some savings. And we've tried to reflect that in some of our guidance, but we don't really have a sense of how long this will go. We're currently working on plans as to how we would bring people back into offices and what the pace would be. We're not going to bring everybody back on day 1. And I think most companies are going through the same thing.

So I don't know if it's turning a catalyst to M&A.
We do feel like this will continue longer term to emphasize the fact that scale is incredibly important in this business, and maybe that turns into something which helps us with M&A going forward. We're -- our model right now is just really simple, which is stay close to all the companies we know. It's harder because you can't go meet with them face to face, but stay close to them on the phone, on Zoom, wherever it is, and make sure you're supportive because we believe, longer term, that helps us potentially become a deeper partnership with them.

I don't -- I think you should assume our costs won't change versus what they've been historically. The real question is going to be do we benefit from slower hiring and less travel during the coming few quarters. And I think we will, and that's built into our guidance. But I don't have a sense of does that last another year or more. So I think that will take some time for us to really better understand that.
As both Andrew and I said on the call, our focus is on how do we hold together our team. We do not want to have to reduce what we believe is one of the greatest teams in the industry, and that's our #1 focus. And I think everybody aligns with that. And they understand, okay, we will do everything we can to not spend to make sure that, that happens.
In terms of the sports calendar, I mean, the biggest unknown for us right now is 2 things. The economy, what really happens to the economy over time. Today, we see our core audience spending because they're at home more. But does that change over time? And then the second challenge is what's the impact if the sports calendar does not start up at some period of time. We know, today, people are engaging with sports because that's what they love to do. If you are a sports fan, it doesn't stop. And so the only way they're getting their sports engagement is through our games, and that's a huge benefit for us. But we don't know because there's no precedent on this, is what happens long term if any of the sports seasons get delayed even further. But we do believe that everything we're seeing now and everything we're seeing particularly in esports is we can be a huge factor in helping people socialize and do what they love around the sport they love.
And don't forget the social part because, remember, people don't sit and watch a sports game alone. They sit and watch a sports game and interact with all their friends that they know engage in that sport. And what we're doing is we're enabling that to happen through our games and through the watching of esports online. So we hope that, that bodes for a great season going forward, but we've never been at a time like this before. And so that's why you're hearing any caution from us."

And the result is the best year in Madden history. I would tell you, our relationship with the NFL was very, very strong. We look forward to building NFL games for many years to come. And what you should expect from us over time is that we will continue to build out our NFL football offerings, both in the context of building on the Madden platform.
Again, when you think about gamers the biggest -- one of the most important things to them is a sense of community and being part of such a big community like the Madden community, whether they're playing frontline 11-on-11 simulation football or they're playing the fast knockout modes that we launched this year or whether they start to play some of the new modes that we plan to deliver in the future on console, on PC and on mobile. So we're excited about our football future and believe that it will continue to be a strong part of our portfolio and a really strong offering for football fans in many years to come.

So on live services, almost all of the delta was driven by Apex Legends. And remember, we came out of the gate last -- or last February, excuse me, on fire, like you never would have believed, right? And so a massive bus",556,"Yes. Sure. Thanks. Good questions. So on live services, almost all of the delta was driven by Apex Legends. And remember, we came out of the gate last -- or last February, excuse me, on fire, like you never would have believed, right? And so a massive business. And then we settled into a regular cadence, and we've been able to grow that each quarter through all the seasons that we've had, and we're feeling very good about that.
The second piece is we -- as the sports calendar shut down, we made the decision to move the -- what is the -- it's called the FUT Birthday, FIFA Ultimate Team Birthday event from the end of March into the first 2 weeks of April. And it was really driven by trying to pace out sports content knowing that there was no sports content in the world. And so -- but it's one of the biggest events of the year. And so you can imagine that also impacted the year as we went from Q4 compared to previous year Q4. Those were the 2 biggest drivers.
On the positive side, Madden both live service, the Ultimate Team has been on fire, which in the February, March time frame is rare because it's post the Super Bowl but it's been very strong. FIFA Online 4 in Korea was very strong. Remember, we -- I think we said in the last earnings call, we shut off FIFA Online 3 in Korea. We're still running both FIFA Online 3 and FIFA Online 4 in China at this point. But as we shut off FIFA Online 3 in Korea, we saw massive growth in FIFA Online 4. And so that's kind of the puts and takes. And then on top of that, I would say, Sims 4 continues to be the title that just doesn't stop. And I think as Andrew mentioned in his previous comments, it has continued to grow quarter after quarter after quarter. It is an incredible team, an incredible product and amazing engagement. And so you can say, put it all on the Apex last year, unbelievable benefit and then the FIFA move of the FUT birthday in the quarter.
Mobile, the way we've approached mobile for the year in terms of our guidance is we basically have assumed that mobile titles will stay in soft launch much longer than they have historically. And so we have relatively little new mobile growth from new products in the year. Our hope is that we can exceed that, but that's how we've built our guidance because we know the mobile industry continues to get harder and harder. And that means people are keeping mobile tiles in soft launch for longer and longer to try to tune them. The good news is that we still have a strong set of mobile titles today that are highly profitable. You look at Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, for example, continues to perform extremely well. Things like SimCity continue to perform extremely well. And while we're not growing dramatically, we're still extremely profitable across those titles, and our hope is the new titles that we have in the mix will get out of soft launch faster than we anticipate and possibly help us generate something above what we forecast for the year."

I would say the strength of Electronic Arts is built on our ability to be platform agnostic. We have been able -- throughout our history, we've been able to get to more platforms with more titles of higher quality than most everyone else in the industry. It is a position we're very proud of, and we continue to drive against that. 6 or 7 years ago, we anticipated there to be many more new platforms we would have to build on over time and that ultimately the cloud would also emerge as its own platform across a number of different companies or portals. And part of the reason we moved the organization to a single digital platform, single ID, single commerce, single data, single infrastructure, single security and we moved the organization to a single engine in Frostbite was in anticipation of this so that as these new platforms come online, we're able to get to them more quickly and more efficiently and at higher quality than maybe our competitors can who are working on multiple platforms and multiple engines and actually really use our scale to our advantage in our ability to do that. And what you're seeing from us now is our ability to get to console and new consoles and PC and Steam and Stadia and mobile, and you should expect that we have -- and Switch. And you should expect that we will continue to look to deliver great content on any and all new platforms that we think have the ability to reach critical mass of gamers.
In the context of overall time between games, I think it's different by game. What we know to be true is that games are getting bigger and more complex in development, but they're also entertaining significantly more players on each release basis and holding onto those players for much, much longer through ongoing engagement in live services and social interaction.
And so as we think about our broader portfolio, you'll continue to see us launch games on an annualized basis. Our sports games would be a good example there. You'll continue to see us launch games on a multiyear basis. Things like Battlefield or some of our titles out of Dragon Age would be a good example of that. You'll continue to see us think about games on a 5- and 6-year time horizon. The Sims, which launched again over 5 years ago and continues to grow every year through extra content and live services, would be an example of that. And then you'll see us launch true platform games like Apex Legends, which we expect will have -- continue to grow over the next decade.
So again, I would come back to I feel good about how we have moved the company on a technology basis. That puts us in a position to reach as many players as possible across geographies, across platforms, across business models, across genres as this global playing audience continues to expand."

Look at Q1. The largest Q1 in the history of the company was $0.31 in EPS, and we just provided you guidance for $0.70 in EPS. And that could -- the business could fall off the cliff tomorrow, and we would be dead wrong. But I think all of you know how Andrew and I and all of our teams have been very conservative. I would think about that as you're thinking about the year forward.
So with that, wonderful soliloquy, however you say that, we will end the call, and I appreciate everybody. And most important, make sure your families are healthy, you're spending time with them and you all stay healthy as well because we need to have you guys around to help us in the marketplace. So thank you."

As global citizens, we are all enduring a period of great uncertainty and continuing to fight the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. We're here to report on our quarterly results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, and Blake and I will speak to those. However, our focus, first and foremost, has been on the health and well-being of our teams and their families during the COVID-19 situation. I'll start by sharing a little about our actions to support our employees around the world.
We have an internal COVID-19 task force that has been tracking and making decisions on a daily basis since January to keep our teams safe, including early decisions to restrict business travel, cancel events and close our Shanghai and Seoul facilities. By mid-March, we shifted nearly all of our global workforce to work from home in response to the growing threat of the pandemic. Through this transition, we've put a heavy focus on ensuring our people have everything they need to balance the challenges of work and home life during stay-at-home orders and physical distancing.
We continue to be in a work-from-home status for all of our locations outside of Shanghai. We have detailed protocols to evaluate our readiness to return in each of our offices when the time is right, accounting for guidance from health authorities and government, the comfort level of our employees and preparation of our facilities for continued physical distancing. We're planning for the return to take place over an extended period, and we make -- as we make longer-term changes to our locations and practices in response to the pandemic. We will continue to do everything we need to support our teams as we go forward.
Moving to our results. We finished a strong year for Electronic Arts with fourth quarter and full year revenue and earnings above our previously raised guidance. The innovation that we are delivering to players across the breadth of our games and live services continues to drive strength in our business. I'll touch on a few examples from the year.
EA SPORTS is a pillar of our portfolio and continues to bring more players together. FIFA is one of the biggest and most engaging entertainment franchises in the world. With approximately 100 million players engaging globally in our FIFA franchise, more than 25 million unique players have joined FIFA 20 so far with VOLTA opening up an entirely new dimension of the game and FIFA Ultimate Team continue to grow as the most popular mode. FIFA Online in Asia also continues its momentum, significantly outperforming our expectations.
Madden NFL is a cultural icon in football, gaming and entertainment, and it just had its biggest year ever. We took a new approach to launching and rolling out new modes of play in Madden NFL 20, and the result was the highest engagement levels in franchise history.
Apex Legends was the most downloaded free-to-play game on PS4 in 2019 and continues to grow as an innovative long-term service for players. It's been continually recognized as one of the best multi-player experiences available. And with each new season of content, Respawn had been delivering more of what players love from lore to new legends to in-game events.
Before COVID-19 stay-at-home orders began, season 4 was already outperforming each of the 2 prior seasons, and the Old Ways Event in April has become the most successful ever for Apex. Our Apex esports tournaments have generated approximately 2x the average viewing audience of other top esports leagues. Respawn have added more teams in our development organization to work on great new content, and we continue to have a strong focus on the thriving Apex Legends community.
Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is one of the breakout titles of the last several years. More than 10 million unique players have joined the game since launch, a rare achievement for a first title in an entirely new franchise. It's a meticulously well-crafted game, and it continues to give fans a deeply engaging and original Star Wars experience.
The Sims 4 inspires an entirely different gaming audience and one that continues to grow. It provides a completely unique experience from anything else in the market, and FY '20 was its biggest year since launch. In every quarter this year, monthly average players in the Sims 4 were higher than the previous year. Our Sims community is diverse and highly creative, and our success continues to be built on delivering a wide variety of content and ways to engage for players with very different interests.
With more people staying at home in the fourth quarter, we did see rise in usage and engagement levels in many of our games. We're humbled to see people wanting to connect through our games during this time, in part, has been made possible by the amazing work of our teams and our technology investments across the company. For more than 5 years, we've been investing in a single technology infrastructure architecture and digital platform as we accelerate into a digital world. That's enabled us to provide mobility for our employees in this environment and maintain strong productivity.
But the real story is the people of Electronics Arts. We have such tremendously talented, dedicated and determined teams. They've come together in the strongest and most inspiring way through this pandemic response period in service of each other and in service of our players. And as a result, we have been able to adapt and scale in this changing environment where engagement in our games has reached new peaks and continues at elevated levels through the current quarter to date.
We've had a deep focus on our players through this time, our amazing studio teams have delivered great live service content while working from home, including FIFA Ultimate Team events, Madden Ultimate Team content, the NFL Draft and new additions to Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes. We also launched our stay-at-home play together initiative to do some special things for our players as shelter-in-place orders began to take effect in March.
Thanks to the dedicated work of our teams and our partners, we've delivered dozens of stay and play programs to date from special community live streams and giveaways to athletes and celebrities playing our games with fans. Our sports teams launched a fully cloud-based broadcasting platform that allows us to produce high-quality esports content with competitors, hosts and production staff all safely at home. We've since conducted major online                                 tournaments for Apex Legends, Madden NFL 20, FIFA Online 4 and FIFA 20, including the FIFA Stay and Play Cup, a $1 million charity tournament for COVID-19 relief that brought together top European clubs and footballers and aired in more than 100 countries. We've now executed or plan to execute in the coming months more than 100 celebrity, athlete, community and charity online esports events.
The global crisis has also been hitting local communities very hard, and we've increased the funding in our charitable match program to support local organizations around the world. Our teams have also been doing extraordinary things to help in their communities, from sourcing quantities of personal protective equipment for health care workers to food drives and much more, and we're supporting them in any way we can. I want to say a huge thanks again to the people of Electronic Arts in making all of this possible. Because of their fast and determined work, we've responded well to this global challenge, and we're in a good position to continue connecting more players through great games and content and supporting our communities when and where they need it most.
Looking to FY '21, we are growing our portfolio of high-quality and innovative new games. We are planning to launch 40 new titles to play this fiscal year. That includes 4 new EA SPORTS titles, FIFA, Madden, NHL and 1 more unannounced sports title, all of which deliver on the mix of creativity, authenticity and quality that sets EA SPORTS apart. EA SPORTS will also lead for us on the next-generation consoles this year, and we're excited to share more about the breakthroughs in those experiences soon.
Our FY '21 plans also include 4 more games drawing on the breadth of our IP from Command & Conquer Remastered to unannounced games for console and PC. We'll have more games from indie developers launching this year through EA partners and 2 new mobile titles leveraging top IP that will bring to players worldwide.
With our team's expertise in live services, we're also building some of the biggest ongoing experiences in the industry. We have a lot more for the growing Apex Legends community this year, starting next week with Season 5. Maxis will continue delivering Sims 4 content that empowers self-expression and fuels the creativity of our diverse player audience. 
In addition, our new EA SPORTS games will continue delivering fans daily connection to sports through our live services even if the real-world leagues and teams aren't back in action yet. And we are also working to bring more content to FIFA Online and Apex Legends in Asia that will excite our current players and welcome new ones.
This year, we plan to grow our communities across more platforms and ways to play. Building on our announcement with Google Stadia last week, we plan to bring our games to more digital distribution channels. We'll take our subscription service to a fourth platform in Steam, and we're also planning to deliver for more Nintendo fans with multiple EA games set to launch on Nintendo Switch this year.
As we begin FY '21, our outlook for the year is strong. We also know there is uncertainty ahead as COVID-19 situation continues to unfold. Factors like macroeconomic challenges, the status of sports seasons, unknown impacts to our business partners and long-term impacts to our productivity in a global work-from-home environment are among the areas we will be watching closely and could affect both player behavior and our ability to deliver on our planned time lines.
We are thankful for the extraordinary people that we have Electronic Arts and for their dedication to each other, to our players, to our communities and our company. Now I'll turn the call over to Blake."
27963,628674198,1998879,"Electronic Arts Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, May 05, 2020",2020-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Electronic Arts Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Andrew. We had a strong year, but it is impossible for me to reflect on the past 12 months without acknowledging that we are all currently going through a very difficult time, and I hope that you and those close to you are healthy and safe. I'd",1852,"Thanks, Andrew. We had a strong year, but it is impossible for me to reflect on the past 12 months without acknowledging that we are all currently going through a very difficult time, and I hope that you and those close to you are healthy and safe. 
I'd like to focus on the impacts we're seeing in our business. First and foremost, we are concerned for the safety and well-being of our people. Andrew has given you a brief introduction to the measures we have taken and continue to take. Teams across the company have shown extraordinary innovation in meeting the challenges of delivering games from home. Developing a game from home inevitably carries risks, and we haven't yet solved all those problems. But for example, we just had a very successful FIFA Ultimate Team Birthday event. Apex Legends Season 5 is about to launch, and we expect to see the next Sims expansion; and Command & Conquer Remastered to both launch in June as scheduled. Learning from this period will forever change the way we work at EA.
Secondly, there is a question as to how this might affect how players behave. From Andrew, you've heard that people are playing our games a lot more, and we've seen a corresponding large rise in live service revenues that continues today. Our results this quarter proved the value of the live service path that we've been on now for a decade. The breadth and depth of our live services give us tremendous flexibility at times like this to meet player needs in a variety of ways.
The closure of physical retail has not yet affected the sales of full games with sales actually above where we would have expected them to be at this time of the year. This suggests that people who want a game are finding a title in our catalog and downloading a digital copy or ordering a physical copy online. In addition, the shift to digital since the last recession reduces both the impact of store closures and of inventory risk. Physical game sales comprised 84% of our annual net bookings in fiscal 2009 compared to only 20% last year.
Turning to our results. I'll report them on a GAAP basis, then use our operational measures of net bookings to discuss the business dynamics. To compare results to historically reported non-GAAP measures, please refer to the relevant tabs in our downloadable financial model.
GAAP net revenue for the fiscal year was $5.54 billion; cost of revenue, $1.37 billion. Operating income was $1.45 billion, delivering an EPS of $10.30, including onetime tax benefit of $5.97 that we previously discussed. These results enabled us to deliver free cash flow of $1.66 billion.
Total net bookings for the fiscal year were $5.21 billion, up 5.4% year-on-year. At constant currency, growth would have been over 7%. Digital net bookings accounted for $4.05 billion of this. Live services net bookings were $2.78 billion, up 15% year-on-year driven by strength across our business.
Moving on to the details of our fourth quarter. GAAP net revenues for the quarter were $1.39 billion, above our guidance by $62 million. Operating expenses were $717 million, slightly less than what we guided. Operating income was $401 million and resulted in earnings per share of $1.43, $0.38 better than our guidance. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $498 million, down $101 million from last year, driven by increased royalties and cash taxes paid. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $40 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $458 million. You can see this in our earnings slide for further cash flow information.
During the quarter, we repurchased 2.7 million shares at a cost of $291 million. Since quarter end, we have completed our 2-year $2.4 billion repurchase program. Due to the uncertainty of the markets and in the economy, management and the Board have chosen to postpone a review of our capital return plans until next quarter. Let me emphasize that this is a precaution. Our business today is extremely strong.
Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $5.74 billion. Our balance sheet is very strong. With regards to debt, we have $1 billion in senior notes with $600 million maturing in March 2021 and $400 million due in 2026. Our debt equates to significantly less than the fiscal 2020 free cash flow.
Now I'd like to turn to the key drivers of our business in the quarter. Net bookings were $1.21 billion, well above our guidance of $1.15 billion, driven by our digital business. Digital net bookings were $1.12 billion with the beat versus expectations driven by The Sims 4 and Apex Legends. Digital net bookings represent 78% of our business on a trailing 12-month basis, a new record. This compares to 75% in the prior year. Live service net bookings were $789 million. The year-on-year decrease is driven by the massive launch of Apex Legends a year ago offset by growth across the rest of our live services. Ultimate Team grew strongly throughout fiscal 2020.
Mobile delivered net bookings of $138 million, up 2% year-on-year driven by our sports titles in Asia. Full game PC and console downloads generated net bookings of $190 million, down 11% from last year driven by the launch of Anthem in the year-ago quarter partially offset by the ongoing shift to digital. Overall, 49% of our units sold through were digital rather than physical, measured on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 over the last 12 months, and we continue to model underlying growth at 5 percentage points per year.
Looking ahead to the next 12 months. We are focused first and foremost on supporting our people, helping them cope with the world in which we find ourselves. Second, we are focused on enabling them to deliver the new content we're providing to our players through live services and the new games we have on our slate.
The market outlook is uncertain, but we're basing our modeling on the gaming software market growing in mid-single digits in calendar 2020 with mobile up 7%, console up 5% and PC up 5% in dollar terms. In addition, although our sports live services are continuing -- are currently performing extremely well, it's not yet known when professional sports might resume nor what the impact on our business might be if that takes some time. In the meantime, our esports activities are providing to be popular competitive outlets for football, soccer and hockey fans.
There are also risks associated with our ability to deliver new games, and the guidance I'm about to provide is predicting -- are predicted on the title slate as outlined in the earnings presentation on our website. Note that this slide only identifies those titles that are already announced. As we have previously stated, our FY '21 revenue forecast includes additional titles from both EA and third-party studios, which will be announced in the coming quarters. We're not seeing material impact on our FY '21 title slate, but that could change, and the risk is higher for third-party titles where we have less control.
Finally, with regard to potential impacts of a recession. The video game market has historically proven resilient as players have seen games as a relatively inexpensive form of entertainment. Nevertheless, future economic indicators are extremely weak and may affect our business.
Before I get to the numbers, let me also discuss 3 changes we are making with regards to our reporting. First, we will present GAAP net revenue in the income statement as one item rather than as product and service. Secondly, we will report mobile bookings gross of platform fees instead of net to align with industry practice. Finally, we're updating the presentation of net bookings by composition to focus on full game and live service sales in line with the direction we continue to drive the business. We've published more details on our IR website.
Guidance for fiscal 2021 is for GAAP net revenue of $5.525 billion, cost of revenue at $1.382 billion and GAAP EPS of $3.35. As you compare with last year, remember, fiscal '20's GAAP EPS included a onetime tax benefit of $5.97 per share. We continue to forecast our management tax rate for the fiscal 2021 to be 18%.
With regards to cash flow for fiscal 2021, we expect operating cash flow to be approximately $1.575 billion. We anticipate capital expenditures of around $125 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.45 billion. Free cash flow is down slightly year-on-year with higher underlying profits more than offset by higher cash taxes and higher variable compensation and lower interest income.
Turning to business drivers. We anticipate net bookings for the year to be $5.55 billion, up 3.3% year-on-year on a like-for-like basis. Growth is primarily driven by live services plus strong sports launches and a broad portfolio of partner titles. Our projections assume a headwind from FX to net bookings of roughly $60 million, although we note that exchange rates are likely to be more volatile in the near term as the result of market uncertainties induced by the pandemic. Both of these numbers are net of hedges. Our currency assumptions are disclosed in our earnings presentation on our website.
Drilling down further into the key drivers of our full year net bookings guidance, we expect live services and other to be $3.85 billion in fiscal 2021, up 7% compared to fiscal 2020. And full game net bookings to be $1.7 billion, down almost 5% year-on-year. Finally, with live services, we expect mobile to deliver net bookings of $721 million in fiscal 2001 (sic) [ 2021 ], up 1% on a like-for-like basis.
On a management reporting basis, operating expenses will grow 2% during fiscal 2021, reflecting tight expense controls in the face of macroeconomic uncertainties. We expect Q1 net bookings to be $1 billion. While we're seeing very strong engagement in net bookings growth to date, we're only a month into the quarter, and our current levels of engagement and monetization could subside as stay-at-home orders are eased and lifted. In addition, the swing factors discussed above in these unprecedented times are potentially huge, impossible to forecast and beyond our control. Thus, we're taking a more cautious view than normal.
As usual, we have presented the quarterly phasing of our net bookings in our earnings presentation. Note that this year, the phasing includes the effect of revenue recognition from the games we are launching for the current generation of consoles that can also be upgraded free for the next generation. We've made a preliminary estimate of that impact in the phasing, but it should be noted that this will not affect net bookings for the full year nor cash flow, just    the timing of recognition.
I'll finish by personally thanking everybody at the company for rising to the challenge. Every one of you have shown energy and ingenuity to enable us to deliver games and content at a time when players want them the most. Thank you.
With that, I'll hand it back to Andrew."

And again, in the context of the work-at-home environment, they have been truly inspirational in how they've continued to develop great entertainment in the context of our Battlefield universe. I'm excited for when next year comes.
In terms of specific announcements around what might be coming in the out years, I would tell you that we don't have anything to announce today. But more broadly, you should imagine that we're going to continue to invest heavily in our EA SPORTS-branded properties, bringing some new properties back over the coming years. We've talked before about having new IP in development, both for console and PC and for mobile. We're excited about that. And I'd also say we've got a number of new incubation products that are starting to come together that are looking exciting for the future as well. So I don't think we've ever had as robust a pipeline of content ahead of us as we have right now. I don't think we've ever had the level of execution that we're seeing around the development and launch of content and the management of ongoing live services than we have right now. And while there are always challenges and interesting hurdles that we face delivering great interactive entertainment experiences, I would tell you, I'm very excited by what I see more so than I have been for our pipeline for a long time.
With respect to Apex, I think it falls into that category. I -- we don't have anything specific to announce beyond what we've already talked about other than to say I just saw the results of our Season 5 trailer for Apex today. So we dropped it. It has a 99% approval rate and is the top trending video on YouTube games today.

That's why it's so exciting. And we're adding interesting, exciting new content. And then as you look at the trailer, remember, the team did a huge part of this game from home, and I think that's an important message that shouldn't be ignored because it is not easy. And what we've proven to ourselves, we didn't think it was possible, but it's proving that, at least so far, we know there's risks going forward, but it's amazing what the teams have been able to do working apart from each other from home.

I think as most people know, we -- our back half of this year, unlike last year, didn't have any new titles. We obviously benefited from follow-on sales for Jedi: Fallen Order, which were strong, but it was really a live service quarter for us. And as you can see from the numbers, it exceeded our expectations and our guidance substantially. The big drivers on that are Apex, the Ultimate Team businesses across the board and our catalog of great titles. And people always underestimate the power of 2 things inside of EA: the catalog and live services. And we continue to build more and more live services that engage people socially and bring people to -- or allow people to enjoy things that they love. In a world where there was no sports, we became sports for people. And if you look at our business across Madden, FIFA, hockey, it's incredible, the level of engagement we saw and obviously, the level of revenue growth we saw during that time frame.
Madden, on its own, was the biggest Madden year we have ever seen and the biggest Madden Ultimate Team year we have ever seen and much of that due to the amazing work the game teams did in building Madden with incredible new modes and components to it and a ton of fun and then pushing that into Ultimate Team as well. But I think people always need to understand the stability of our business is driven by this incredible machine that we've built around live services and the underlying strength of our portfolio and our long and large catalog. Andrew, I'll let you jump in on development."

One, are there any metrics that we could point to just kind of speak to the level of elevation we've seen? I would tell you that FIFA hours watched in April were up 135% over last April and are up 115% for Madden. Our esports TV broadcast hours in the U.S. in April were up 250% over last year, and April alone was 30% bigger than all of calendar year 2019. So we're seeing tremendous engagement in the unbelievable creativity and innovation that our teams are delivering.
As we think about this on a go-forward basis, I think about it in 2 buckets. One is just how do we think about building games going forward and how do we think players will engage as things start to return to normal. Again, I would take this opportunity to celebrate the creativity and ingenuity of our teams. They have been truly inspirational in how they have come together and how they work and build games and create games and deliver epic entertainment to our global audience of players. We had already, over the last 5 years, started to move towards a distributed development model. We utilize the best creative talent in a number of different regions around the world to come together and build spectacular entertainment for players. I think what we have learned through this process is that there are new areas of innovation and creativity that we can unlock in a distributed model and some of the foundations that our teams are building in the context of developing games, of developing motion capture, of developing commentary, of filing games are going to be really helpful for us on a go-forward basis.
I also spoke to, in the prepared remarks, about how our esports teams have built a fully cloud-based broadcast model. Again, we have a wonderful facility at our head office, and we'll use other people's facilities to bring people together and broadcast esports events. But we've been able to deliver hundreds and hundreds of hours of esports content completely remotely with host, broadcasters, players and fans all safely at home. I believe this will accelerate our ability to develop and deliver amazing esports content to a global audience and continue to fulfill the insatiable appetite that is absolutely there that we're seeing right now.
As it relates to gamers, again, I think it's too early to tell, but a few things we know are true. One is that games fulfill these core motivations that we have, the ones I talked about in the prepared remarks, like inspiration and escape and social connection and competition and creation and learning, better than just about any other form of entertainment on the planet. And there are many, many new players who are coming and discovering just how wonderful games are and the joy of games and how spectacular they can bring people together. And our expectation is that people having invested this time and relationships with friends through new games they're playing will continue to drive engagement over the long term. And our objective, of course, is to fully support them as they move through this COVID-19 phase and ensure that we are able to continue to fulfill the motivations they have even as we get on the other side of this."

Many of the industry events that typically we would bring people together or our own internal events where we would have brought people together were canceled. So obviously, we'll see some savings there. We don't really have a full sense on what the future will bring a year from now, but I know we will think differently about how we operate, how many people we have in certain offices, what that looks like. That could actually change expenses in a negative way. I hope not. I don't think that's what we're focused on. We hope that we can actually have more people working from home that changes expenses to a positive. But it's early days to say, but I know at least in the near term we will see some savings. And we've tried to reflect that in some of our guidance, but we don't really have a sense of how long this will go. We're currently working on plans as to how we would bring people back into offices and what the pace would be. We're not going to bring everybody back on day 1. And I think most companies are going through the same thing.

I don't -- I think you should assume our costs won't change versus what they've been historically. The real question is going to be do we benefit from slower hiring and less travel during the coming few quarters. And I think we will, and that's built into our guidance. But I don't have a sense of does that last another year or more. So I think that will take some time for us to really better understand that.
As both Andrew and I said on the call, our focus is on how do we hold together our team. We do not want to have to reduce what we believe is one of the greatest teams in the industry, and that's our #1 focus. And I think everybody aligns with that. And they understand, okay, we will do everything we can to not spend to make sure that, that happens.
In terms of the sports calendar, I mean, the biggest unknown for us right now is 2 things. The economy, what really happens to the economy over time. Today, we see our core audience spending because they're at home more. But does that change over time? And then the second challenge is what's the impact if the sports calendar does not start up at some period of time. We know, today, people are engaging with sports because that's what they love to do. If you are a sports fan, it doesn't stop. And so the only way they're getting their sports engagement is through our games, and that's a huge benefit for us. But we don't know because there's no precedent on this, is what happens long term if any of the sports seasons get delayed even further. But we do believe that everything we're seeing now and everything we're seeing particularly in esports is we can be a huge factor in helping people socialize and do what they love around the sport they love.
And don't forget the social part because, remember, people don't sit and watch a sports game alone. They sit and watch a sports game and interact with all their friends that they know engage in that sport. And what we're doing is we're enabling that to happen through our games and through the watching of esports online. So we hope that, that bodes for a great season going forward, but we've never been at a time like this before. And so that's why you're hearing any caution from us."

And what you should expect from us over time is that we will continue to build out our NFL football offerings, both in the context of building on the Madden platform.
Again, when you think about gamers the biggest -- one of the most important things to them is a sense of community and being part of such a big community like the Madden community, whether they're playing frontline 11-on-11 simulation football or whether they're playing the fast knockout modes that we launched this year or whether they start to play some of the new modes that we plan to deliver in the future on console, on PC and on mobile.

And so a massive bus",556,"Yes. Sure. Thanks. Good questions. So on live services, almost all of the delta was driven by Apex Legends. And remember, we came out of the gate last -- or last February, excuse me, on fire, like you never would have believed, right? And so a massive business. And then we settled into a regular cadence, and we've been able to grow that each quarter through all the seasons that we've had, and we're feeling very good about that.
The second piece is we -- as the sports calendar shut down, we made the decision to move the -- what is the -- it's called the FUT Birthday, FIFA Ultimate Team Birthday event from the end of March into the first 2 weeks of April. And it was really driven by trying to pace out sports content knowing that there was no sports content in the world. And so -- but it's one of the biggest events of the year. And so you can imagine that also impacted the year as we went from Q4 compared to previous year Q4. Those were the 2 biggest drivers.
On the positive side, Madden both live service, the Ultimate Team has been on fire, which in the February, March time frame is rare because it's post the Super Bowl but it's been very strong. FIFA Online 4 in Korea was very strong. Remember, we -- I think we said in the last earnings call, we shut off FIFA Online 3 in Korea. We're still running both FIFA Online 3 and FIFA Online 4 in China at this point. But as we shut off FIFA Online 3 in Korea, we saw massive growth in FIFA Online 4. And so that's kind of the puts and takes. And then on top of that, I would say, Sims 4 continues to be the title that just doesn't stop. And I think as Andrew mentioned in his previous comments, it has continued to grow quarter after quarter after quarter. It is an incredible team, an incredible product and amazing engagement. And so you can say, put it all on the Apex last year, unbelievable benefit and then the FIFA move of the FUT birthday in the quarter.
Mobile, the way we've approached mobile for the year in terms of our guidance is we basically have assumed that mobile titles will stay in soft launch much longer than they have historically. And so we have relatively little new mobile growth from new products in the year. Our hope is that we can exceed that, but that's how we've built our guidance because we know the mobile industry continues to get harder and harder. And that means people are keeping mobile titles in soft launch for longer and longer to try to tune them. The good news is that we still have a strong set of mobile titles today that are highly profitable. You look at Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, for example, continues to perform extremely well. Things like SimCity continue to perform extremely well. And while we're not growing dramatically, we're still extremely profitable across those titles, and our hope is the new titles that we have in the mix will get out of soft launch faster than we anticipate and possibly help us generate something above what we forecast for the year."

We have been able -- throughout our history, we've been able to get to more platforms with more titles of higher quality than most everyone else in the industry. It is a position we're very proud of, and we continue to drive against that. 6 or 7 years ago, we anticipated there to be many more new platforms we would have to build on over time and that ultimately the cloud would also emerge as its own platform across a number of different companies or portals. And part of the reason we moved the organization to a single digital platform, single ID, single commerce, single data, single infrastructure, single security and we moved the organization to a single engine in Frostbite was in anticipation of this so that as these new platforms come online, we're able to get to them more quickly and more efficiently and at higher quality than maybe our competitors can who are working on multiple platforms and multiple engines and actually really use our scale to our advantage in our ability to do that. And what you're seeing from us now is our ability to get to console and new consoles and PC and Steam and Stadia and mobile, and you should expect that we have -- and Switch. And you should expect that we will continue to look to deliver great content on any and all new platforms that we think have the ability to reach critical mass of gamers.
In the context of overall time between games, I think it's different by game. What we know to be true is that games are getting bigger and more complex in development, but they're also entertaining significantly more players on each release basis and holding onto those players for much, much longer through ongoing engagement in live services and social interaction.
And so as we think about our broader portfolio, you'll continue to see us launch games on an annualized basis. Our sports games would be a good example there. You'll continue to see us launch games on a multiyear basis. Things like Battlefield or some of our titles out of Dragon Age would be a good example of that. You'll continue to see us think about games on a 5- and 6-year time horizon. The Sims, which launched again over 5 years ago and continues to grow every year through extra content and live services, would be an example of that. And then you'll see us launch true platform games like Apex Legends, which we expect will have -- continue to grow over the next decade.
So again, I would come back to I feel good about how we have moved the company on a technology basis. That puts us in a position to reach as many players as possible across geographies, across platforms, across business models, across genres as this global playing audience continues to expand."

First, I would just remind everybody, which I think you all know, but we've just finished a year in which we raised guidance 3 times and delivered on that with beats every time. We just put out guidance for next year -- or this year, coming year that we're in right now, in probably the most uncertain time that we've ever faced, and yet -- and we've cautioned everyone and we've put caveats on everything. And I don't know what's going to transpire, but we were still willing to come out and put out guidance that we thought would grow both top line and bottom line year-over-year.
Look at Q1. The largest Q1 in the history of the company was $0.31 in EPS, and we just provided you guidance for $0.70 in EPS. And that could -- the business could fall off the cliff tomorrow, and we would be dead wrong. But I think all of you know how Andrew and I and all of our teams have been very conservative. I would think about that as you're thinking about the year forward.
So with that, wonderful soliloquy, however you say that, we will end the call, and I appreciate everybody. And most important, make sure your families are healthy, you're spending time with them and you all stay healthy as well because we need to have you guys around to help us in the marketplace.

As global citizens, we are all enduring a period of great uncertainty and continuing to fight the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. We're here to report on our quarterly results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, and Blake and I will speak to those. However, our focus, first and foremost, has been on the health and well-being of our teams and their families during the COVID-19 situation. I'll start by sharing a little about our actions to support our employees around the world.
We have an internal COVID-19 task force that has been tracking and making decisions on a daily basis since January to keep our teams safe, including early decisions to restrict business travel, cancel events and close our Shanghai and Seoul facilities. By mid-March, we shifted nearly all of our global workforce to work from home in response to the growing threat of the pandemic. Through this transition, we've put a heavy focus on ensuring our people have everything they need to balance the challenges of work and home life during stay-at-home orders and physical distancing.
We continue to be in a work-from-home status for all of our locations outside of Shanghai. We have detailed protocols to evaluate our readiness to return in each of our offices when the time is right, accounting for guidance from health authorities and government, the comfort level of our employees and preparation of our facilities for continued physical distancing. We're planning for the return to take place over an extended period, and we make -- as we make longer-term changes to our locations and practices in response to the pandemic. We will continue to do everything we need to support our teams as we go forward.
Moving to our results. We finished a strong year for Electronic Arts with fourth quarter and full year revenue and earnings above our previously raised guidance. The innovation that we are delivering to players across the breadth of our games and live services continues to drive strength in our business. I'll touch on a few examples from the year.
EA SPORTS is a pillar of our portfolio and continues to bring more players together. FIFA is one of the biggest and most engaging entertainment franchises in the world. With approximately 100 million players engaging globally in our FIFA franchise, more than 25 million unique players have joined FIFA 20 so far with VOLTA opening up an entirely new dimension of the game and FIFA Ultimate Team continue to grow as the most popular mode. FIFA Online in Asia also continues its momentum, significantly outperforming our expectations.
Madden NFL is a cultural icon in football, gaming and entertainment, and it just had its biggest year ever. We took a new approach to launching and rolling out new modes of play in Madden NFL 20, and the result was the highest engagement levels in franchise history.
Apex Legends was the most downloaded free-to-play game on PS4 in 2019 and continues to grow as an innovative long-term service for players. It's been continually recognized as one of the best multi-player experiences available. And with each new season of content, Respawn had been delivering more of what players love from lore to new legends to in-game events.
Before COVID-19 stay-at-home orders began, season 4 was already outperforming each of the 2 prior seasons, and the Old Ways Event in April has become the most successful ever for Apex. Our Apex esports tournaments have generated approximately 2x the average viewing audience of other top esports leagues. Respawn have added more teams in our development organization to work on great new content, and we continue to have a strong focus on the thriving Apex Legends community.
Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is one of the breakout titles of the last several years. More than 10 million unique players have joined the game since launch, a rare achievement for a first title in an entirely new franchise. It's a meticulously well-crafted game, and it continues to give fans a deeply engaging and original Star Wars experience.
The Sims 4 inspires an entirely different gaming audience and one that continues to grow. It provides a completely unique experience from anything else in the market, and FY '20 was its biggest year since launch. In every quarter this year, monthly average players in the Sims 4 were higher than the previous year. Our Sims community is diverse and highly creative, and our success continues to be built on delivering a wide variety of content and ways to engage for players with very different interests.
With more people staying at home in the fourth quarter, we did see rise in usage and engagement levels in many of our games. We're humbled to see people wanting to connect through our games during this time, in part, has been made possible by the amazing work of our teams and our technology investments across the company. For more than 5 years, we've been investing in a single technology infrastructure architecture and digital platform as we accelerate into a digital world. That's enabled us to provide mobility for our employees in this environment and maintain strong productivity.
But the real story is the people of Electronics Arts. We have such tremendously talented, dedicated and determined teams. They've come together in the strongest and most inspiring way through this pandemic response period in service of each other and in service of our players. And as a result, we have been able to adapt and scale in this changing environment where engagement in our games has reached new peaks and continues at elevated levels through the current quarter to date.
We've had a deep focus on our players through this time, our amazing studio teams have delivered great live service content while working from home, including FIFA Ultimate Team events, Madden Ultimate Team content, the NFL Draft and new additions to Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes. We also launched our stay-at-home play together initiative to do some special things for our players as shelter-in-place orders began to take effect in March.
Thanks to the dedicated work of our teams and our partners, we've delivered dozens of stay and play programs to date from special community live streams and giveaways to athletes and celebrities playing our games with fans. Our sports teams launched a fully cloud-based broadcasting platform that allows us to produce high-quality esports content with competitors, hosts and production staff all safely at home. We've since conducted major online tournaments for Apex Legends, Madden NFL 20, FIFA Online 4 and FIFA 20, including the FIFA Stay and Play Cup, a $1 million charity tournament for COVID-19 relief that brought together top European clubs and footballers and aired in more than 100 countries. We've now executed or plan to execute in the coming months more than 100 celebrity, athlete, community and charity online esports events.
The global crisis has also been hitting local communities very hard, and we've increased the funding in our charitable match program to support local organizations around the world. Our teams have also been doing extraordinary things to help in their communities, from sourcing quantities of personal protective equipment for health care workers to food drives and much more, and we're supporting them in any way we can. I want to say a huge thanks again to the people of Electronic Arts in making all of this possible. Because of their fast and determined work, we've responded well to this global challenge, and we're in a good position to continue connecting more players through great games and content and supporting our communities when and where they need it most.
Looking to FY '21, we are growing our portfolio of high-quality and innovative new games. We are planning to launch 40 new titles to play this fiscal year. That includes 4 new EA SPORTS titles, FIFA, Madden, NHL and 1 more unannounced sports title, all of which deliver on the mix of creativity, authenticity and quality that sets EA SPORTS apart. EA SPORTS will also lead for us on the next-generation consoles this year, and we're excited to share more about the breakthroughs in those experiences soon.
Our FY '21 plans also include 4 more games drawing on the breadth of our IP from Command & Conquer Remastered to unannounced games for console and PC. We'll have more games from indie developers launching this year through EA partners and 2 new mobile titles leveraging top IP that will bring to players worldwide.
With our team's expertise in live services, we're also building some of the biggest ongoing experiences in the industry. We have a lot more for the growing Apex Legends community this year, starting next week with Season 5. Maxis will continue delivering Sims 4 content that empowers self-expression and fuels the creativity of our diverse player audience. 
In addition, our new EA SPORTS games will continue delivering fans daily connection to sports through our live services even if the real-world leagues and teams aren't back in action yet. And we are also working to bring more content to FIFA Online and Apex Legends in Asia that will excite our current players and welcome new ones.
This year, we plan to grow our communities across more platforms and ways to play. Building on our announcement with Google Stadia last week, we plan to bring our games to more digital distribution channels. We'll take our subscription service to a fourth platform in Steam, and we're also planning to deliver for more Nintendo fans with multiple EA games set to launch on Nintendo Switch this year.
As we begin FY '21, our outlook for the year is strong. We also know there is uncertainty ahead as COVID-19 situation continues to unfold. Factors like macroeconomic challenges, the status of sports seasons, unknown impacts to our business partners and long-term impacts to our productivity in a global work-from-home environment are among the areas we will be watching closely and could affect both player behavior and our ability to deliver on our planned time lines.
We are thankful for the extraordinary people that we have Electronic Arts and for their dedication to each other, to our players, to our communities and our company. Now I'll turn the call over to Blake."
27963,628674198,2000108,"Electronic Arts Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, May 05, 2020",2020-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Electronic Arts Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Andrew. We had a strong year, but it is impossible for me to reflect on the past 12 months without acknowledging that we are all currently going through a very difficult time, and I hope that you and those close to you are healthy and safe. I'd",1852,"Thanks, Andrew. We had a strong year, but it is impossible for me to reflect on the past 12 months without acknowledging that we are all currently going through a very difficult time, and I hope that you and those close to you are healthy and safe. 
I'd like to focus on the impacts we're seeing in our business. First and foremost, we are concerned for the safety and well-being of our people. Andrew has given you a brief introduction to the measures we have taken and continue to take. Teams across the company have shown extraordinary innovation in meeting the challenges of delivering games from home. Developing a game from home inevitably carries risks, and we haven't yet solved all those problems. But for example, we just had a very successful FIFA Ultimate Team Birthday event. Apex Legends Season 5 is about to launch, and we expect to see the next Sims expansion; and Command & Conquer Remastered to both launch in June as scheduled. Learning from this period will forever change the way we work at EA.
Secondly, there is a question as to how this might affect how players behave. From Andrew, you've heard that people are playing our games a lot more, and we've seen a corresponding large rise in live service revenues that continues today. Our results this quarter proved the value of the live service path that we've been on now for a decade. The breadth and depth of our live services give us tremendous flexibility at times like this to meet player needs in a variety of ways.
The closure of physical retail has not yet affected the sales of full games with sales actually above where we would have expected them to be at this time of the year. This suggests that people who want a game are finding a title in our catalog and downloading a digital copy or ordering a physical copy online. In addition, the shift to digital since the last recession reduces both the impact of store closures and of inventory risk. Physical game sales comprised 84% of our annual net bookings in fiscal 2009 compared to only 20% last year.
Turning to our results. I'll report them on a GAAP basis, then use our operational measures of net bookings to discuss the business dynamics. To compare results to historically reported non-GAAP measures, please refer to the relevant tabs in our downloadable financial model.
GAAP net revenue for the fiscal year was $5.54 billion; cost of revenue, $1.37 billion. Operating income was $1.45 billion, delivering an EPS of $10.30, including onetime tax benefit of $5.97 that we previously discussed. These results enabled us to deliver free cash flow of $1.66 billion.
Total net bookings for the fiscal year were $5.21 billion, up 5.4% year-on-year. At constant currency, growth would have been over 7%. Digital net bookings accounted for $4.05 billion of this. Live services net bookings were $2.78 billion, up 15% year-on-year driven by strength across our business.
Moving on to the details of our fourth quarter. GAAP net revenues for the quarter were $1.39 billion, above our guidance by $62 million. Operating expenses were $717 million, slightly less than what we guided. Operating income was $401 million and resulted in earnings per share of $1.43, $0.38 better than our guidance. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $498 million, down $101 million from last year, driven by increased royalties and cash taxes paid. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $40 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $458 million. You can see this in our earnings slide for further cash flow information.
During the quarter, we repurchased 2.7 million shares at a cost of $291 million. Since quarter end, we have completed our 2-year $2.4 billion repurchase program. Due to the uncertainty of the markets and in the economy, management and the Board have chosen to postpone a review of our capital return plans until next quarter. Let me emphasize that this is a precaution. Our business today is extremely strong.
Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $5.74 billion. Our balance sheet is very strong. With regards to debt, we have $1 billion in senior notes with $600 million maturing in March 2021 and $400 million due in 2026. Our debt equates to significantly less than the fiscal 2020 free cash flow.
Now I'd like to turn to the key drivers of our business in the quarter. Net bookings were $1.21 billion, well above our guidance of $1.15 billion, driven by our digital business. Digital net bookings were $1.12 billion with the beat versus expectations driven by The Sims 4 and Apex Legends. Digital net bookings represent 78% of our business on a trailing 12-month basis, a new record. This compares to 75% in the prior year. Live service net bookings were $789 million. The year-on-year decrease is driven by the massive launch of Apex Legends a year ago offset by growth across the rest of our live services. Ultimate Team grew strongly throughout fiscal 2020.
Mobile delivered net bookings of $138 million, up 2% year-on-year driven by our sports titles in Asia. Full game PC and console downloads generated net bookings of $190 million, down 11% from last year driven by the launch of Anthem in the year-ago quarter partially offset by the ongoing shift to digital. Overall, 49% of our units sold through were digital rather than physical, measured on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 over the last 12 months, and we continue to model underlying growth at 5 percentage points per year.
Looking ahead to the next 12 months. We are focused first and foremost on supporting our people, helping them cope with the world in which we find ourselves. Second, we are focused on enabling them to deliver the new content we're providing to our players through live services and the new games we have on our slate.
The market outlook is uncertain, but we're basing our modeling on the gaming software market growing in mid-single digits in calendar 2020 with mobile up 7%, console up 5% and PC up 5% in dollar terms. In addition, although our sports live services are continuing -- are currently performing extremely well, it's not yet known when professional sports might resume nor what the impact on our business might be if that takes some time. In the meantime, our esports activities are providing to be popular competitive outlets for football, soccer and hockey fans.
There are also risks associated with our ability to deliver new games, and the guidance I'm about to provide is predicting -- are predicted on the title slate as outlined in the earnings presentation on our website. Note that this slide only identifies those titles that are already announced. As we have previously stated, our FY '21 revenue forecast includes additional titles from both EA and third-party studios, which will be announced in the coming quarters. We're not seeing material impact on our FY '21 title slate, but that could change, and the risk is higher for third-party titles where we have less control.
Finally, with regard to potential impacts of a recession. The video game market has historically proven resilient as players have seen games as a relatively inexpensive form of entertainment. Nevertheless, future economic indicators are extremely weak and may affect our business.
Before I get to the numbers, let me also discuss 3 changes we are making with regards to our reporting. First, we will present GAAP net revenue in the income statement as one item rather than as product and service. Secondly, we will report mobile bookings gross of platform fees instead of net to align with industry practice. Finally, we're updating the presentation of net bookings by composition to focus on full game and live service sales in line with the direction we continue to drive the business. We've published more details on our IR website.
Guidance for fiscal 2021 is for GAAP net revenue of $5.525 billion, cost of revenue at $1.382 billion and GAAP EPS of $3.35. As you compare with last year, remember, fiscal '20's GAAP EPS included a onetime tax benefit of $5.97 per share. We continue to forecast our management tax rate for the fiscal 2021 to be 18%.
With regards to cash flow for fiscal 2021, we expect operating cash flow to be approximately $1.575 billion. We anticipate capital expenditures of around $125 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.45 billion. Free cash flow is down slightly year-on-year with higher underlying profits more than offset by higher cash taxes and higher variable compensation and lower interest income.
Turning to business drivers. We anticipate net bookings for the year to be $5.55 billion, up 3.3% year-on-year on a like-for-like basis. Growth is primarily driven by live services plus strong sports launches and a broad portfolio of partner titles. Our projections assume a headwind from FX to net bookings of roughly $60 million, although we note that exchange rates are likely to be more volatile in the near term as the result of market uncertainties induced by the pandemic. Both of these numbers are net of hedges. Our currency assumptions are disclosed in our earnings presentation on our website.
Drilling down further into the key drivers of our full year net bookings guidance, we expect live services and other to be $3.85 billion in fiscal 2021, up 7% compared to fiscal 2020. And full game net bookings to be $1.7 billion, down almost 5% year-on-year. Finally, with live services, we expect mobile to deliver net bookings of $721 million in fiscal 2001 (sic) [ 2021 ], up 1% on a like-for-like basis.
On a management reporting basis, operating expenses will grow 2% during fiscal 2021, reflecting tight expense controls in the face of macroeconomic uncertainties. We expect Q1 net bookings to be $1 billion. While we're seeing very strong engagement in net bookings growth to date, we're only a month into the quarter, and our current levels of engagement and monetization could subside as stay-at-home orders are eased and lifted. In addition, the swing factors discussed above in these unprecedented times are potentially huge, impossible to forecast and beyond our control. Thus, we're taking a more cautious view than normal.
As usual, we have presented the quarterly phasing of our net bookings in our earnings presentation. Note that this year, the phasing includes the effect of revenue recognition from the games we are launching for the current generation of consoles that can also be upgraded free for the next generation. We've made a preliminary estimate of that impact in the phasing, but it should be noted that this will not affect net bookings for the full year nor cash flow, just the timing of recognition.
I'll finish by personally thanking everybody at the company for rising to the challenge. Every one of you have shown energy and ingenuity to enable us to deliver games and content at a time when players want them the most. Thank you.
With that, I'll hand it back to Andrew."

In terms of specific announcements around what might be coming in the out years, I would tell you that we don't have anything to announce today. But more broadly, you should imagine that we're going to continue to invest heavily in our EA SPORTS-branded properties, bringing some new properties back over the coming years. We've talked before about having new IP in development, both for console and PC and for mobile. We're excited about that. 
And I'd also say we've got a number of new incubation products that are starting to come together that are looking exciting for the future as well. So I don't think we've ever had as robust a pipeline of content ahead of us as we have right now. I don't think we've ever had the level of execution that we're seeing around the development and launch of content and the management of ongoing live services than we have right now. And while there are always challenges and interesting hurdles that we face delivering great interactive entertainment experiences, I would tell you, I'm very excited by what I see more so than I have been for our pipeline for a long time.
With respect to Apex, I think it falls into that category. I -- we don't have anything specific to announce beyond what we've already talked about other than to say I just saw the results of our Season 5 trailer for Apex today. So we dropped it. It has a 99% approval rate and is the top trending video on YouTube games today. That, in conjunction with some game players we saw in our Apex mobile title, I feel very excited about that franchise overall."

And I echo what Andrew just said. If you check out the trailer on Season 5, I think what you'll see is we continue to evolve this live service. 
And remember, this is a live service. That's why it's so exciting. And we're adding interesting, exciting new content. And then as you look at the trailer, remember, the team did a huge part of this game from home, and I think that's an important message that shouldn't be ignored because it is not easy. And what we've proven to ourselves, we didn't think it was possible, but it's proving that, at least so far, we know there's risks going forward, but it's amazing what the teams have been able to do working apart from each other from home. And just check out the trailer."

I think as most people know, we -- our back half of this year, unlike last year, didn't have any new titles. We obviously benefited from follow-on sales for Jedi: Fallen Order, which were strong, but it was really a live service quarter for us. 
And as you can see from the numbers, it exceeded our expectations and our guidance substantially. The big drivers on that are Apex, the Ultimate Team businesses across the board and our catalog of great titles. And people always underestimate the power of 2 things inside of EA: the catalog and live services. And we continue to build more and more live services that engage people socially and bring people to -- or allow people to enjoy things that they love. In a world where there was no sports, we became sports for people. And if you look at our business across Madden, FIFA, hockey, it's incredible, the level of engagement we saw and obviously, the level of revenue growth we saw during that time frame.
Madden, on its own, was the biggest Madden year we have ever seen and the biggest Madden Ultimate Team year we have ever seen and much of that due to the amazing work the game teams did in building Madden with incredible new modes and components to it and a ton of fun and then pushing that into Ultimate Team as well. But I think people always need to understand the stability of our business is driven by this incredible machine that we've built around live services and the underlying strength of our portfolio and our long and large catalog. Andrew, I'll let you jump in on development."

One, are there any metrics that we could point to just kind of speak to the level of elevation we've seen? I would tell you that FIFA hours watched in April were up 135% over last April and are up 115% for Madden. Our esports TV broadcast hours in the U.S. in April were up 250% over last year, and April alone was 30% bigger than all of calendar year 2019. So we're seeing tremendous engagement in the unbelievable creativity and innovation that our teams are delivering.
As we think about this on a go-forward basis, I think about it in 2 buckets. One is just how do we think about building games going forward and how do we think players will engage as things start to return to normal. Again, I would take this opportunity to celebrate the creativity and ingenuity of our teams. They have been truly inspirational in how they have come together and how they work and build games and create games and deliver epic entertainment to our global audience of players. 
We had already, over the last 5 years, started to move towards a distributed development model. We utilize the best creative talent in a number of different regions around the world to come together and build spectacular entertainment for players. I think what we have learned through this process is that there are new areas of innovation and creativity that we can unlock in a distributed model and some of the foundations that our teams are building in the context of developing games, of developing motion capture, of developing commentary, of filing games are going to be really helpful for us on a go-forward basis.
I also spoke to, in the prepared remarks, about how our esports teams have built a fully cloud-based broadcast model. Again, we have a wonderful facility at our head office, and we'll use other people's facilities to bring people together and broadcast esports events. But we've been able to deliver hundreds and hundreds of hours of esports content completely remotely with host, broadcasters, players and fans all safely at home. I believe this will accelerate our ability to develop and deliver amazing esports content to a global audience and continue to fulfill the insatiable appetite that is absolutely there that we're seeing right now.
As it relates to gamers, again, I think it's too early to tell, but a few things we know are true. One is that games fulfill these core motivations that we have, the ones I talked about in the prepared remarks, like inspiration and escape and social connection and competition and creation and learning, better than just about any other form of entertainment on the planet. And there are many, many new players who are coming and discovering just how wonderful games are and the joy of games and how spectacular they can bring people together. And our expectation is that people having invested this time and relationships with friends through new games they're playing will continue to drive engagement over the long term. And our objective, of course, is to fully support them as they move through this COVID-19 phase and ensure that we are able to continue to fulfill the motivations they have even as we get on the other side of this."

And that has been the very core of our strategy at Electronics Arts. 
And what we're seeing through this period of time is, as more people come to recognize the true joy of interactive entertainment, the true joy of gaming even as I think linear media has also benefited through this time, I do believe that engagement will be more consistent in the interactive industry over time. I do believe we're seeing new players come in who maybe hadn't played before and who are experiencing the goodness that comes from connecting with friends in a truly interactive environment through games. We're excited about that. We're excited to deliver new and interesting and innovative and creative entertainment to fans.

We're obviously -- both gamescom and E3 have been canceled. Many of the industry events that typically we would bring people together or our own internal events where we would have brought people together were canceled. So obviously, we'll see some savings there. 
We don't really have a full sense on what the future will bring a year from now, but I know we will think differently about how we operate, how many people we have in certain offices, what that looks like. That could actually change expenses in a negative way. I hope not. I don't think that's what we're focused on. We hope that we can actually have more people working from home that changes expenses to a positive. But it's early days to say, but I know at least in the near term we will see some savings. And we've tried to reflect that in some of our guidance, but we don't really have a sense of how long this will go. 
We're currently working on plans as to how we would bring people back into offices and what the pace would be. We're not going to bring everybody back on day 1. And I think most companies are going through the same thing.

It's harder because you can't go meet with them face to face, but stay close to them on the phone, on Zoom, wherever it is, and make sure you're supportive because we believe, longer term, that helps us potentially become a deeper partnership with them.

I don't -- I think you should assume our costs won't change versus what they've been historically. The real question is going to be do we benefit from slower hiring and less travel during the coming few quarters. And I think we will, and that's built into our guidance. But I don't have a sense of does that last another year or more. So I think that will take some time for us to really better understand that.
As both Andrew and I said on the call, our focus is on how do we hold together our team. We do not want to have to reduce what we believe is one of the greatest teams in the industry, and that's our #1 focus. And I think everybody aligns with that. And they understand, okay, we will do everything we can to not spend to make sure that, that happens.
In terms of the sports calendar, I mean, the biggest unknown for us right now is 2 things. The economy, what really happens to the economy over time. Today, we see our core audience spending because they're at home more. But does that change over time? And then the second challenge is what's the impact if the sports calendar does not start up at some period of time. We know, today, people are engaging with sports because that's what they love to do. If you are a sports fan, it doesn't stop. And so the only way they're getting their sports engagement is through our games, and that's a huge benefit for us. But we don't know because there's no precedent on this, is what happens long term if any of the sports seasons get delayed even further. But we do believe that everything we're seeing now and everything we're seeing particularly in esports is we can be a huge factor in helping people socialize and do what they love around the sport they love.
And don't forget the social part because, remember, people don't sit and watch a sports game alone. They sit and watch a sports game and interact with all their friends that they know engage in that sport. And what we're doing is we're enabling that to happen through our games and through the watching of esports online. So we hope that, that bodes for a great season going forward, but we've never been at a time like this before. And so that's why you're hearing any caution from us."

And what you should expect from us over time is that we will continue to build out our NFL football offerings, both in the context of building on the Madden platform.
Again, when you think about gamers the biggest -- one of the most important things to them is a sense of community and being part of such a big community like the Madden community, whether they're playing frontline 11-on-11 simulation football or whether they're playing the fast knockout modes that we launched this year or whether they start to play some of the new modes that we plan to deliver in the future on console, on PC and on mobile.

So on live services, almost all of the delta was driven by Apex Legends. And remember, we came out of the gate last -- or last February, excuse me, on fire, like you never would have believed, right? And so a massive bus",556,"Yes. Sure. Thanks. Good questions. So on live services, almost all of the delta was driven by Apex Legends. And remember, we came out of the gate last -- or last February, excuse me, on fire, like you never would have believed, right? And so a massive business. And then we settled into a regular cadence, and we've been able to grow that each quarter through all the seasons that we've had, and we're feeling very good about that.
The second piece is we -- as the sports calendar shut down, we made the decision to move the -- what is the -- it's called the FUT Birthday, FIFA Ultimate Team Birthday event from the end of March into the first 2 weeks of April. And it was really driven by trying to pace out sports content knowing that there was no sports content in the world. And so -- but it's one of the biggest events of the year. And so you can imagine that also impacted the year as we went from Q4 compared to previous year Q4. Those were the 2 biggest drivers.
On the positive side, Madden both live service, the Ultimate Team has been on fire, which in the February, March time frame is rare because it's post the Super Bowl but it's been very strong. FIFA Online 4 in Korea was very strong. Remember, we -- I think we said in the last earnings call, we shut off FIFA Online 3 in Korea. We're still running both FIFA Online 3 and FIFA Online 4 in China at this point. But as we shut off FIFA Online 3 in Korea, we saw massive growth in FIFA Online 4. And so that's kind of the puts and takes. And then on top of that, I would say, Sims 4 continues to be the title that just doesn't stop. And I think as Andrew mentioned in his previous comments, it has continued to grow quarter after quarter after quarter. It is an incredible team, an incredible product and amazing engagement. And so you can say, put it all on the Apex last year, unbelievable benefit and then the FIFA move of the FUT birthday in the quarter.
Mobile, the way we've approached mobile for the year in terms of our guidance is we basically have assumed that mobile titles will stay in soft launch much longer than they have historically. And so we have relatively little new mobile growth from new products in the year. Our hope is that we can exceed that, but that's how we've built our guidance because we know the mobile industry continues to get harder and harder. And that means people are keeping mobile titles in soft launch for longer and longer to try to tune them. 
The good news is that we still have a strong set of mobile titles today that are highly profitable. You look at Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, for example, continues to perform extremely well. Things like SimCity continue to perform extremely well. And while we're not growing dramatically, we're still extremely profitable across those titles, and our hope is the new titles that we have in the mix will get out of soft launch faster than we anticipate and possibly help us generate something above what we forecast for the year."

With so many different new platforms to launch on, should we expect sort of the cadence between titles to kind of lengthen and going forward, kind of dig into the catalog and find things that either could be brought back to life or remastered? Or how does the broader platform strategy affected -- how should we think about it affecting future game development? 
And then my second question probably is more for Blake. Could you -- if you could give us some color on sort of almost -- has the sports titles seen any sort of deterioration at all relative to the other titles through the month of April at all?

I would say the strength of Electronic Arts is built on our ability to be platform agnostic. We have been able -- throughout our history, we've been able to get to more platforms with more titles of higher quality than most everyone else",501,"Yes, absolutely. I would say the strength of Electronic Arts is built on our ability to be platform agnostic. We have been able -- throughout our history, we've been able to get to more platforms with more titles of higher quality than most everyone else in the industry. It is a position we're very proud of, and we continue to drive against that. 6 or 7 years ago, we anticipated there to be many more new platforms we would have to build on over time and that ultimately the cloud would also emerge as its own platform across a number of different companies or portals. 
And part of the reason we moved the organization to a single digital platform, single ID, single commerce, single data, single infrastructure, single security and we moved the organization to a single engine in Frostbite was in anticipation of this so that as these new platforms come online, we're able to get to them more quickly and more efficiently and at higher quality than maybe our competitors can who are working on multiple platforms and multiple engines and actually really use our scale to our advantage in our ability to do that. And what you're seeing from us now is our ability to get to console and new consoles and PC and Steam and Stadia and mobile, and you should expect that we have -- and Switch. And you should expect that we will continue to look to deliver great content on any and all new platforms that we think have the ability to reach critical mass of gamers.
In the context of overall time between games, I think it's different by game. What we know to be true is that games are getting bigger and more complex in development, but they're also entertaining significantly more players on each release basis and holding onto those players for much, much longer through ongoing engagement in live services and social interaction.
And so as we think about our broader portfolio, you'll continue to see us launch games on an annualized basis. Our sports games would be a good example there. You'll continue to see us launch games on a multiyear basis. Things like Battlefield or some of our titles out of Dragon Age would be a good example of that. You'll continue to see us think about games on a 5- and 6-year time horizon. The Sims, which launched again over 5 years ago and continues to grow every year through extra content and live services, would be an example of that. And then you'll see us launch true platform games like Apex Legends, which we expect will have -- continue to grow over the next decade.
So again, I would come back to I feel good about how we have moved the company on a technology basis. That puts us in a position to reach as many players as possible across geographies, across platforms, across business models, across genres as this global playing audience continues to expand."

We just put out guidance for next year -- or this year, coming year that we're in right now, in probably the most uncertain time that we've ever faced, and yet -- and we've cautioned everyone and we've put caveats on everything. And I don't know what's going to transpire, but we were still willing to come out and put out guidance that we thought would grow both top line and bottom line year-over-year.
Look at Q1. The largest Q1 in the history of the company was $0.31 in EPS, and we just provided you guidance for $0.70 in EPS. And that could -- the business could fall off the cliff tomorrow, and we would be dead wrong. But I think all of you know how Andrew and I and all of our teams have been very conservative. I would think about that as you're thinking about the year forward.

First off, I hope that all of you listening today are well and your families are in good health. This is an unprecedented time, and it was an unprecedented first quarter for our business at Electronic Arts with extraordinary growth in our games and live services and record financial performance. I'll speak to both of those in a moment, but first, let me touch on our efforts to continue supporting our teams through the evolving COVID-19 situation. our amazing teams of Electronic Arts, the ingenuity, creativity and determination of all of our talented people is making it possible for us to continue delivering all the great games and players even as almost all of us continue to work from home. The world being of our people is our top priority and to keep everyone as safe as possible, the vast majority of us at EA be working from home at least through the remainder of the calendar year. These are challenging times for everyone managing through the pandemic effect on their personal and professional lives. We're helping, however, we can, with support and resources, including quarterly payments to assist our people with work from home costs and care needs, a care program, additional services for mental and physical health and more. In addition to the ongoing challenges of pandemic, these last few months have brought forward important cultural conversations around racial and social justice, harassment and conduct. We've long-held a quality inclusion and diversity at the center of our beliefs at Electronic Arts. And as a company, we've made our positions clear and demonstrated with our actions that we have a long-term commitment to making a positive impact in our world. 
As we've shared previously, our business focus continues to be on our key growth drivers, delivering amazing games and content, offering live services that extend and enhance the experience and connecting more players across more platforms and ways to play. In our first quarter of FY '21, engagement was exceptionally strong across our portfolio. We launched new games, delivering incredible growth in live services and welcomed tens millions of new players into the EA network since the beginning of April.  the biggest first quarter in EA history with net bookings and operating cash flow, both setting new records. As a result, we are raising our full year FY '21 net revenue and net bookings guidance today. 
We've seen tremendous growth over the last 4 months in our business and across the industry. At EA, we sit at the intersection of 2 fundamental secular trends that have become increasingly clear. First, social interactions in our world are moving from physical to digital. And second, the consumption of sports and entertainment is moving from linear to interactive. We've seen both of these trends accelerate during the COVID-19 period. Tens of millions of new players have come into our games, and we also have many players returning to our franchises after some time away. In addition to higher engagement from our existing players, these new and returning players are now deeply engaged in our live services, establishing new play patents and building new friendships through our games. So while there are noble aspects to this period of time we are in, and it may be difficult to predict the patterns of new and returning players, we expect these trends to continue during and after the pandemic. We remain committed to continuing to innovate in this space, keeping EA at the forefront, providing social interaction and interactive entertainment to a wide global audience. 
I'll share a few highlights here that capture what our teams delivered for players in Q1. We launched 2 new games to players during the quarter, Command & Conquer Remastered, which was incredibly well received by fans and critics and became a top-selling title on and as well as Burnout Paradise Remastered on the Nintendo switch. Our teams also delivered over 30 new content updates for our console and PC titles, including 2 major game expansions as well as more than 50 updates to our mobile games. All of this and the continued development of our upcoming titles for FY '21 and beyond was completed with our teams working from home. Apex Legends continues its momentum as an exceptional live service, building on strong performance for the last several quarters and bringing even more players together in the game. Q1 saw the most game sessions played and highest revenue total since the launch for Apex. And engagement in season 5 was the highest level since our first new season of content. Creative events continue to be a huge draw for our Apex community, and the most recent event Lost Treasures had over 96 million hours played in the first 2 weeks. We're bringing Apex to players on the Switch and Steam, and we're excited to introduce cross play later this year, so more players get engaged and play together with their friends. 
The world has an appetite for sports and for the experiences that EA SPORTS delivers in our games. With real-world sports disrupted, EA SPORTS has become the center of the emotional connection of sports. And we brought millions of new returning and existing players into their own personal sports stories through our games. 
acquisition of new and returning players in FIFA grew more than 100% year-over-year in Q1 with more than 7 million joining during the quarter. There are now -- these are now among our most engaged groups of players, demonstrating commitment and longevity in our FIFA live service. FIFA in Asia grew significantly year-over-year in Q1 as well, with FIFA online 4 now engaging nearly 30 million players to date. Madden NFL 20 also had an incredible Q1, building on what is already the biggest year ever for our Madden franchise. Player acquisition in Madden NFL grew nearly 140% year-over-year in Q1 and virtually every measure of Madden ultimate team engagement is up more than double over last year. The Sims continues to resonate with more players around the world. The Sims 4 now has more than 30 million players life-to-date across all platforms and daily, weekly and molly active player totals in the game all reached record highs for our first quarter. Sims Mobile games had an excellent Q1 as well. The creative and inclusive nature of the Sims experience on any device is truly unique in all of gaming. And we're especially proud of the way it helps players community and express themselves during culturally challenging times. 
During Q1, we also launched 30 titles on the Steam platform, bringing our games to Steam enables us to substantially grow our PC audience. Our Origin business grew 75% year-over-year as well by opening up the ability for Steam and Origin plays to play together, we're now positioned to harness the full power of the PC community. Bringing Steam is also foundational to our EA subscription service that will go live on the platform later this month. In addition, the total number of players in our subscriptions on Origin, Xbox 1 and PS4 grew quarter-over-quarter with new players coming into our services to experience more great games. It was an unprecedented quarter of growth. Looking forward, we've also seen strong engagement in Q2. Although, it is difficult to predict ongoing levels of growth in this environment, we have grown our player base during this period and added value to our network. Our EA SPORTS live services are acting as social networks for sports fans around the world, and the strength of those connections will grow as real sports seasons return. Players communities for the Sims, Apex, Star Wars and more are building relationships through our games, and we expect them to be with us for a long time to come. 
Building on this strength, we have exciting new tiles and content coming in Q2 and beyond, including Rocket Arena, which just launched with final strike games. We showcased many of these new experiences in our EA Play live broadcast in June, where our audience grew significantly year-over-year and the trailers and videos that we debuted have been watched more than 31 million times. We will begin launching our new EA SPORTS games starting in August. Nowhere else in the world can sports fans find the breadth and depth of interactive experiences like the ones in our EA SPORTS portfolio this year. With UFC 4 launching on August 14, we've got something for every fight fan, an amazing roster of fighters, tremendous customization, brand-new environments and more fluid gameplay, all making this the most authentic MMA game we've ever created. 
Madden NFL 21 is then set to launch on August 28. On top of major gameplay innovation, a new campaign mode and more of the superstar X factor abilities that fans love, we're bringing creative and innovative new ways to play Madden that build on the strength of our NFL partnership. We have more people than ever before playing and connecting through FIFA. And when FIFA 21 launches on October 9, the world's leading football experience will expand with more ways to play with friends. VOLTA and will bring new social dimensions to the game, and we're also delivering the most comprehensive update to career mode that we've ever released. NHL 21 launches October 16, and we're excited about the great work from our NHL team this year, and we'll hear more about that soon. Then in the season, EA SPORTS will also lead the way on the new PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. Next-generation of FIFA 21 and Madden 21 will bring the next level of innovation and interactive sports experiences to fans with the launch of the new consoles. This will be a great year of new games and comment for sports fans around the world. 
With our cloud-based broadcasting platform esports operating at global scale, we delivered 85% more esports broadcast content in the last 4 months that we give in all of calendar 2019. Demand for our FIFA Apex Legions and Madden esports content across major network is unprecedented. And the great entertainment we are providing is bringing more players and viewers into new experiences with our games. We're now significantly expanding and diversifying our content for the rest of this year. Our plan to deliver 3x as many broadcast events in FY '21 over last year spanning linear and digital breakouts with more athlete celebrity and fan competitions in addition to global esports ecosystems Apex Legends, FIFA and Madden. We also just launched a Sims on TBS and Buzzfeed, our first ever reality competition TV show. Seamlessly integrating entertaining player stories and gameplay alongside weakly challenges for the Sims 4 players, it's an entirely new and unique way to create competition. It shows the innovation we can bring to the esports space with our franchises, and we're excited by the fan reaction to date. We're also very pleased with the response to our new Star Wars: Squadrons game from studios set the launch on October 2. This is going to be the game for anyone that's ever had the fantasy of piloting a Star Wars fighter with a deep level of immersion built by our teams in collaboration with Disney and We're decided to add another all new experience to the portfolio of amazing Star Wars titles we've delivered to fans, especially one that opens up new dimensions like full VR support and cross play. 
Our business is strong, and it's been an amazing start to the year. These are challenging times in pandemic, and we're deeply appreciative of all that our teams are doing to continually innovate and deliver for our players, and push the boundaries of being entertainment at every step of the way, even while working from home. We also have to thank all of our players for their support. We're humbled to see so many using our games and our network as a way to connect with their friends and families during this time. There is much more to come from Electronic Arts in FY '21. Now I'll hand the call over to Blake."

We saw extraordinary levels of player engagement through the first quarter, far higher than we even ever expected or had forecast in May. And it proved more resilient than we had expected. Engagement was broad-based, with net bookings for live services at extraordinary levels for FIFA, Madden, Apex Legends, The Sims and our mobile titles. And with increased sales of our games across the breadth of our entire catalog, we connected with more people to the games they want and to each other. All of this was reflected in our results with record Q1 highs in net revenue, net bookings, live services and cash flow. 
I'll report the specifics of our results on a GAAP basis, then use our operational measure of net bookings to discuss the dynamics of our business. Before I get to the numbers, let me remind everyone of the 3 reporting changes we implemented this quarter and discussed in our last quarter call. First, we now represent GAAP net revenues in the income statement as 1 item rather than as product and service. Second, we report mobile bookings gross of platform fees instead of net. And finally, we updated the presentation of our net books by composition to focus on full game and live service sales. Our historical results have been recast for comparability. EA's net revenue was $1.46 billion compared to $1.21 billion a year ago and above our guidance by $239 million. Operating expenses were $700 million compared to $607 million a year ago. This was above our expectations, driven by variable compensation due to our strong performance in the quarter as well as  COVID related costs and lower attrition. Operating income was $471 million compared to $415 million a year ago and above our expectations. 
Diluted earnings per share was $1.25 as well above our expectations of $0.93, driven by the top line beat. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $378 million, up $220 million from last year. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $38 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $340 million. Operating cash flow for the last 12 months was $2.02 billion, a new record. See our earnings slides for further cash flow information. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $5.96 billion, up 15% year-on-year. Now I'd like to turn to the key drivers of our business this quarter. Net bookings for the quarter were $1.39 billion, up $608 million from the prior year and $390 million above our guidance, driven by strength across the board with strong performance from our core franchises and live services. Currency headwind net of hedges was $42 million year-on-year. Live service and other net bookings were $1.103 billion, up $416 million from the prior year. This extraordinary result is a consequence of the years of work we've invested in building teams, processes and content for our titles, which delivered strength across our portfolio. FIFA, Madden, Apex Legends and The Sims all grew very strongly. Ultimate Team was up 70% on a like-for-like basis, adjusting for the timing of Ultimate Team events for the extra week in the quarter and for currency. With Lost Treasures, Apex Legends presented its most engaging event ever and delivered its biggest season since launch. And as Andrew mentioned, The Sims 4 exceeded 30 million users life to date, and Q1 net bookings was more than double year-on-year. 
Mobile was up 32%, with success across our portfolio, led by Star Wars Galaxy of Hero, which had the best quarter since 2018. The game has now generated over $1 billion in lifetime bookings. FIFA Mobile, SimCity, Sims FreePlay showed growth of a similar magnitude. Full game bookings were $287 million, up $192 million from the prior year. 52% of our unit sales are now digital rather than physical, measured on Xbox 1 and PlayStation 4 over the last 12 months. Net bookings for the packaged goods and for the full game digital downloads are This was primarily driven by our deep catalog. 
A brief note on financial reporting before we go into guidance. People are playing our games for longer as a result of the amazing content provided on our live service games and the social connections they make within our games. So for GAAP reporting, we're increasing the period of time over which we recognize the portion of net revenue. This begins in our second quarter only affects GAAP revenue and only affects the timing of recognition, not total net revenue. We estimate that it will move the recognition of approximately $300 million in GAAP net revenue from fiscal 2021 into fiscal 2022. It does not affect net bookings or operating cash flow. 
Now turning to guidance. Due to the significant outperformance during the quarter, we're increasing both our net revenue and net booking guidance for the full year. In doing so, we had to balance the significant boost we saw in Q1 and the confidence we have in our games and live services against the unknowable macroeconomic environment for the rest of the fiscal year. We're taking a cautious view that assumes that we will continue to see a modest tailwind to engagement driven in part by continued shelter in place orders. This is offset by a weaker economy or could be weaker economies around the world and the slightly sports launches. optimism. For example, we've added tens of millions of players to the EA player network since the beginning of April. As Andrew mentioned, FIFA alone attracted 7 million new players on console in the last quarter, and more people are at this time than any previous cycle. This is significant in that people have played the game recently are more likely to buy the new one. New players are building networks of friends in our games as they play. Engagement in FIFA and Madden continue to be massively above where we would normally expect it to be. Nevertheless, we haven't launched a major tile since the pandemic struck, so it's too early to draw general conclusions. Our business is strong. Our games are on track. Hopefully, our base case around the uncertain economic will prove to be too cautious. Thus, our expectations for full year GAAP revenue are now $5.625 billion, cost of revenue to be $1.483 billion and earnings per share of $2.97. We're raising our operating cash flow guidance by $275 million to $1.85 billion. We continue to anticipate capital expenditures of around $125 million, which would deliver free cash flow of $1.725 billion. A note on OpEx before moving into the business drivers. 
The increase in our prior guidance is mainly driven by variable compensation plus higher-than-expected headcount due to lower turnover during this difficult period. We're continuing to invest in our growth drivers, and in particular, we're increasing the number of mobile tiles we have in development. We now expect net bookings for the year to be $5.95 billion, $400 million above our prior guidance. Versus last year, this factors in an FX headwind of about $100 million. And as you build your models, note that we are also forecasting a fall in interest rates of about $80 million compared to last year as we mentioned in our last quarterly earnings call. For the second quarter, we now expect GAAP net revenue of $1.125 billion, cost of revenue to be $280 million and operating expenses of $755 million. This results in earnings per share of $0.21 in the second quarter. We anticipate net bookings for the second quarter to be $875 million. The significant year-on-year variance is driven by the move of FIFA 21 from Q2 to Q3 and by the later launch of Madden NFL in Q2, which we have previously announced. The change in mix for Q2 weighs on gross margin for the quarter. Madden stays in Q2, but has less live service opportunity than in prior years by virtue of starting and FIFO moves at the beginning of Q3. 
With regard to live services, remember, we are focused on engagement ahead of product launches, so expect lower bookings at that point of the cycle, see the phasing that we provided in our quarterly presentations on our IR website. You'll see that the smaller Q2 is more than offset by a much larger Q3 and a slightly larger Q4. 
As we approach 6 months working from home, we're finding ways to continue to deliver great games and services. We're excited to showcase the incredible efforts or Madden, FIFA, AHL and have done through the upcoming -- as they lead into the upcoming launches and by the work of all of our live serve teams. The shelter in place orders have so far been a strong tailwind for our business as players look for safe, and social entertainment in these difficult times. A macroeconomic headwind in the second half seems very likely nevertheless, our ability to deliver high quality, AAA and titles for our players, combined with the incredible success of our ongoing live services and increased reach across platforms and geographies enable us to continue to deliver for players and investors. Now I'll turn the call back to Andrew."

Nothing else is going on. We've tried to be pretty clear about that. I don't think people have necessarily heard that, but that's the entire delta. We've also not changed the back half of the year guidance down. So you should assume we are planning -- we will make up anything we might have missed during the quarter or the 2 quarters. The other thing I would just want to remind people is that it's all -- Ultimate Team is all event-driven. That means that there may be some events that roll into next year, which actually strengthen next year as well as this year. We made a simple decision, which is we wanted to give both the FIFA and Madden team a couple of extra weeks to final and what has been the most difficult situation we've ever lived through, which is building games from home. We are incredibly impressed with what they've been able to do, how they've been able to innovate the game within this context. And so our view is -- our hope is that most investors are focused on each quarter. They're focused on the full year. We just raised guidance by $400 million. And I remind people in the history of both Andrew and I running the company, we have only raised guidance in the first quarter once. So you guys all know our conservative approach and how we're always cautious. We also mentioned today that we know there is there's not economic risk the back half of the year, I'd like to know that, but we all know there's economic risk. And so I think I would take our raising of guidance and not lowering guidance in the back half of the year even after moving FIFA and Madden is a pretty positive signal. And I think Andrew and I both mentioned in the call, the other thing, which was we are continuing to see engagement and monetization levels higher than we've normally seen during the -- where we currently are in the second quarter. And I'm not telling you that, that's going to change the second quarter or we would have changed guidance because we just don't know yet. But remember, the unbelievably high monetization we saw in Q1 does not drop off a cliff. It will slowly decline as we all go back to a normal life. But if you ask many of us, that might be 6 months, 9 months or 2 years. And what we also mentioned, which I think is the most important component is as people, rejoin or join as a new member of a social network around the game, they tend not to lead. And so this should ultimately long-term benefit our business. And it's just -- the problem for us is we've never lived through this before, and none of us have -- you guys haven't either. And so we don't have a road map to be able to help us be able to predict exactly what it's going to look like. And so we're trying to be transparent. We're trying to be straightforward. And we're trying to be optimistic because we are optimistic, but we're also trying to be realistic that we know that there's economic strains out there around the world that could ultimately come back to impact our business or anybody's business. 
So sorry to go on about the question, but I think we want to try to make sure we're -- people are understanding that it's FIFA and Madden and FIFA Ultimate Team that are moving. But other than that, we're not signaling anything else other than we made a decision. And we made it some time ago because we enhanced it some time ago. So we wanted to give the teams a few extra weeks to make sure that the product was exceptional when it came out the door, and we're confident that that's where it's going to be. Now your second question, sorry, I went on too long in the first question. So I forgot your second question."

And I guess I'll have Andrew sort of help out on this as well because it's important to hear for both of us. I mean we always look at the games, and we want to make sure we are providing the greatest value for our players. And games all have different scale. And most of our games right now have huge scale. We designed this game to really focus on what we heard from consumers, which is one of their greatest and that's to be able to fly fighter, fighter will be in a dog fight. And so it doesn't have the breadth of some of our games, but it is still an incredible game. And so that's why we chose to price it at a slightly lower level to also allow access to as many people as possible who had that Star Wars fantasy. I'll let Andrew jump in and talk about how we view pricing long term. But I think you've seen us over the years differentiate pricing on games. We've differentiated pricing on things like plants versus zombies games because we knew that they were skewed to younger audiences, for example, or maybe didn't have the depth of all of the game modes that you might see in an Ultimate or FIFA or Madden. Andrew, do you want to add to that?"

I would start with what are the player motivations we're trying to fulfill and what are the expectations of those player groups in fulfillment of those motivations. And I think that we start there long before we ever get to price point. And as you've seen from us, we have games across the spectrum of pricing, whether that's free-to-play or at $60 or at $60 with an additional live service for as part of our subscription offerings. And at the end of the day, as we think about it, we start with a player, we start with the motivations and expectations that they have, and we build out the game. In this case, this is a very deep and immersive game and that $40 felt like the right price point, given the breadth of the game. Very proud of what doing. We wanted it to be a wholly experience that was deeply emerging in that fantasy. As we think about pricing more broadly, I would come back to that position, which is we start with what are the player motivations we're trying to fulfill, what are the expectations that players have around depth and breadth and live service in any given experience, and we build from there. As we think about this year, you've seen what we've done as we've announced that we will offer the ability for players to transition free of charge from existing generation of console titles to the next-generation of console titles for FIFA and Madden. We did that, and we set out to build the best Playstation 4, Xbox One experience as we could as well as the most innovative and creative experiences for Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5. And what we wanted for our players this year because what they asked for was the smoothest possible transition that meant that they could jump into the game when it launched on existing platforms and then move into the next platform as it made sense for them later on in the year. And that has been our focus this year. And we will continue to kind of look at this over time."

Can I ask, if you don't mind, just thinking through the changes in real estates and the sports titles. I know that was probably a production driven decision. But when we're looking at the real live physical sports leagues around the world, especially in the states, obviously there's a lot of uncertainty about the timing and shape of their seasons this year and next. And just wondering how that maps to the release of your games and the events and the live services and how matters. For instance, if there was no NFL season in the fall or if it had to be stopped in the halfway through, how does that matter to your games, how should we think about that? I know it's sort of a broad hypothetical, but there's so much uncertainty there. So I guess the underlying question is how much does whatever happens as live sports affect how we should think about and expect people to engage with and spend money in your games? And I have a follow-up."

Second thing is regardless of whether we do or we don't, sports fans have an insatiable appetite for sports day in, day out, week in, week out, month in, month out. And what you heard us talk about in the prepared remarks and what you have seen in Q1 is we've been able to fulfill that insatiable appetite for sports with our games. And there's really -- when we think about our sports games, we think about it on 2 vectors. One is the connection -- the emotional connection of the real world sports and all that's happening with the players and teams and the leagues that you love. The other is we provide you a tool set that features those players, teams and the leagues that you love, but allows you to tell your own personal sports stories. And what you saw from us this past quarter is we really leaned into that. And we actually augmented that some. So while we provided opportunities and events so that you might tell your own personal sports stories with your friends and your rivals, we also talked in about additional esports content, celebrity content and esports and celebrity competitions. And what we've seen is that we've been able to uphold and fulfill the motivations of sports fans and the needs of sports fans and allow them to remain connected to the sports they love. And I would tell you, I think that we are comfortable doing that for as long as it needs to. And then to the extent that sports come back online, we believe that's a further accelerator to our business."

And as part of that, we know, for example, Madden Ultimate Team was up over 300%. And there was no sports -- live sports going on at any point in time during that quarter. And I think Andrew made the point, and I would just stress this is when people are sports fans, remember they are sports fans connected to a social network. No one plays a fantasy sports game alone. No one plays Ultimate Team alone. They play with each other. And that means that it builds off of the social network more than anything else. And so in the absence of sports, people double down and are excited. And so while we always want live sports to go on because it helps feed the engagement and excitement around the business. We also know sports fans are not going to stop being sports fans if the underlying sports stops. And I think the first quarter proves that better than anything we've ever seen. And so we hope sports is back because we all love sports, and we want to engage in it. I'd prefer not to watch sports with an empty stadium. But at the end of the day, it's better than no sports at all. And our games allow people that continued engagement with something that they really love. And I would tell you, that extends well beyond sports, right? I mean, you might ask, well, if there's no Star Wars content in the next 6 months because movie studios are shut down or TV studios are shut down, does that hurt your business? No, it goes just the opposite, which is, if you're a Star Wars fan, you want to find every single opportunity to engage in Star Wars. And that's why we saw growth of Star Wars in order, growth of our Star Wars online business and continued growth of the catalog of Battlefield 1 or Battlefront I and Battlefront II during the quarter. It's -- when you're Star Wars fan, you want Star Wars, and you got to get it somewhere. So that's why we keep coming back to -- this is an incredible opportunity for us. But at the same time, we also understand that we don't -- we can't predict the future. And so we're always careful of trying to predict the future, but we do see a huge opportunity."

So we get to look at almost everything. I can't comment on any specific acquisition other than what I will tell you is as you've seen in the past, where we've done the best is where we have long-term relationships with people, and we're really trying to buy great talent versus games. And I think Respawn is a classic example of that. We were able to bring them into the fold, give them incredible support, and it was all driven by the fact that they had incredible talent. It wasn't about and we'll maybe see it fall at some point, some time down the road, but it was really about the team. And it starts at the top with but it goes all the way through the whole organization. So we're always looking at that. We'll always continue to look at that. We would hope we can find more. Our hope was that some of the challenges in our broad world economy would actually make people think and understand that being subscale is difficult. But at the same time, as you've seen from our results, I think everybody is going to do well in the next couple of quarters in our industry. And so it might take some time, but trust that we are more interested than ever because we see talent and building great new franchises as critical to the long-term growth of the business."

I mean, I don't know off the top of my head, remember, but I think we were bouncing between high single digits and low double digits, maybe mid-double digits, like between 15% and 20%. I mean, we were having a strong Ultimate Team quarter. If you go to the fourth quarter, if you go back and look at the transcript, you could probably see it, I just don't have it in front of me. But I mean, this is off the charts different, right? I mean it is exceptional. And particularly for games like Madden, where normally, the soft spot in a game like that, where we really come out of the Super Bowl, and there's only a few places where you can kind of continue to drive engagement around things like the draft and the combiners. And you would expect this year, maybe because many of those things were not done in person that might have hurt ultimately. But remember, the team a couple of years ago, started working on changing and adding new modes to the game and improving, and it really came to play in the past year. So we were seeing super strength in Madden base game, ad Madden Ultimate Team coming into the quarter, and it just continued to get stronger and strongest. I think the other thing is that all the Ultimate Team teams stepped up to think about what new events could they run a world of stay at home, work from home or whatever it might be. And so they doubled down on social and really drove opportunities in a world in which there was sports. But as I said in the last question, sports fans were looking for their sports excitement and essentially to be able to play. And so you saw that in our esports calendar. As Andrew mentioned, we completely doubled down esports even though we had to do it all from a virtual broadcasting facility versus our own broadcasting facility. And our team did an amazing job of creating some incredible content. And I'll just give you a personal When I see my wife watching a Madden esports tournament and cheering on TV, I know -- because she's a massive sports fan. I know we get the right tone with consumers. We're delivering for consumers what they want. So what we've seen so far, as I mentioned on the call earlier, we saw this peak of massive engagement in the April, May time frame, and that slowly declined as some people have gone back to work or their offices. But it is still well above what we've normally seen, particularly at this time of the year, which is the slowest time as we move from one sport season to the next. And I can't tell you how that's going to look for the rest of the quarter or for the rest of the year. But remember, we know we've got a lot of new people in this game. A lot of people are engaging in Ultimate Team and the sports franchises. And we don't think that shuts off overnight and maybe never shuts off. And we hope that will give us longer-term growth. But that will ultimately be a question when we start talking about next year's guidance and all those things that we normally do. But don't take our conservatism in any way on guidance going forward as saying anything about the gains and on engagement, it's all about the economy at the end of the day. And you guys tell me, you saw the GDP numbers this morning. Are you confident the economy is going to be strong in the next 6, 12 months? I just don't know. That's the thing that weighs on us the most. And yet at the same time, we know that the engagement in our games has never been higher. To to see The Sims up 110% year-over-year, I mean, that's driven by a lot of new people, players coming into the Sims. And we know with the Sims, remember, it's grown every year for the last 6 years. That means that people who come in don't churn out. They get engaged and then they continue to engage in all content that's been produced and the new content. And that's where we get pretty excited. So sorry, a bigger answer to your question than you probably wanted, but we're -- I want to make sure everyone understands. We are prudent. We are conservative, as you guys all know, and yet at the same time, we are unbelievably optimistic about the business, even though we got here would be a really difficult time around the world."

I mean, we're always assuming that if we bring new players in, we can most likely increase the player base and the future purchases. I would say right now, as you can see, we didn't take our guidance down for the back half of the year. We simply move",388,"Yes. I mean, we're always assuming that if we bring new players in, we can most likely increase the player base and the future purchases. I would say right now, as you can see, we didn't take our guidance down for the back half of the year. We simply moved FIFA 2 weeks and as a quarterly change. So I wouldn't take any of that as a message that we have moved or changed our our forecast either way. It's just -- it's still too early to say on that. And so more to come, I think by the time we get to our second quarter earnings, we'll have a much better sense of do we think guidance is going to go up or down based on where both FIFA, Madden and hockey are all -- hockey and UFC are tracking. But we're very optimistic about all those. On capital allocation, we paused our program because we felt like at the time, it was -- we didn't pause it -- sorry, we didn't restart a new program because we were at the end of our old program. We felt like it was not the right time to send a message, both externally as well as internally into our company that we were starting a new program until we got through this pandemic and had a little  feeling about how things would look in the future. And I think we're closer now. I can't tell you when we would restart a program. There is no doubt that there is a commitment to have a program. It's really a timing issue and it's a timing issue driven by the COVID situation. And I think that's pretty consistent with almost every company out there. There's only a couple of companies that have started new programs in the last quarter. And so that's the answer. There's no change in our thinking. We believe we want to effectively and always be returning capital to shareholders. As you saw, we had the greatest cash flow we've ever had as a company over the last 12 months. We know that we should be returning some of that on a large portion to the shareholders. And so expect you'll hear something from us in the future. I just can't predict exactly when that's going to happen."

And so to Blake's point, I think it's too early to tell what we have seen in our games is continued strong engagement. And we believe that, that's because we are providing, particularly as it relates to FIFA in Europe, that emotional connection to football that was missing. And what we saw is football came back online, at least somewhat in Europe, is that further bolstered that emotional connection to the sport that was able to provide. So too early to tell, but we've seen continued strong engagement even in Europe as they -- as some of those markets have gone back online."

And in some cases, I think we are significantly more productive work home environment as it relates to our efficiency levels. At the same time, I think we would all acknowledge that there are other components of work from home that are very challenging. Home schooling is challenging. The mental and emotional well-being can be challenged if you're spending all your time in 1 place. I think as an organization, we've remained committed to our employees. We are providing financial assistance, mental and physical and emotional assistance. We're offering flexibility in work hours wherever possible and offering caregiver leave as members of our employee base think about home schooling or caring for family and loved ones. I think there's a lot of things that we've learned. I don't think we'll ever go back exactly to the way things were. But at the same time, I don't think we would ever move to a place where the entire workforce would work from home. I do believe there is a kinetic energy that comes from being creative people together in a building, at least for some part of the time. And again, we're just a few months into this. As I said in my prepared remarks, we will likely all likelihood and what we've communicated to employers that we'll be -- most of us will be work from home through the rest of this calendar year, at which point we'll reevaluate. And that we are being very open in our dialogue and communication with employees. And to the extent that there are things that we can do to help them through this process or to the extent that there might be longer-term changes that we might make, we're opening up that dialogue and having those conversations now. So not much a share at this point in terms of long-term changes other than there will likely be some, but those some probably won't involve the entire workforce staying work from home"

Most of our revenue for the quarter was live services. And live services require people to be doing something every single day. We're running events every week. We're developing new characters. We're developing new content. We're changing things. We're managing security, managing monetization. That is as hard as game development is the fact that we have proven in the quarter that we could show live service growth like we have. I mean, Andrew and I, every morning wake up and realize we are unbelievably blessed with an incredible workforce that has figured out how to do this. Because as I said earlier, there's no playbook that how do you run how do you run Ultimate Team or Apex from home. No one's ever And it just shows the strength of this organization and the commitment that people have to drive the business in ways that they've never thought they could. And that's pretty powerful. And so for anybody who's over-indexing on us moving FIFA out of second quarter to third quarter, I just suggest, go back and just think about $1.1 billion in live services in the quarter. That is amazing. And so that's why I think what we're trying to send a signal to people is we don't like the fact that we had to get here for the COVID virus, but we've proven that this is something that's really special. So with that, I'll end the call and look forward to seeing everyone or talking to everyone in person, maybe someday or maybe a year from now, who ever -- who knows.

First off, I hope that all of you listening today are well and that you and your families are in good health. This is an unprecedented time, and it was an unprecedented first quarter for our business at Electronic Arts, with extraordinary growth in our games and live services and record financial performance. I'll speak to both of those in a moment, but first let me touch on our efforts to continue supporting our teams through the evolving COVID-19 situation.
I'm incredibly proud of our amazing teams at Electronic Arts. The ingenuity, creativity, and determination of all of our talented people is making it possible for us to continue delivering all the great games and content to players, even as almost all of us continue to work from home. The wellbeing of our people is our top priority, and to keep everyone as safe as possible, the vast majority of us at EA will be working from home at least through the remainder of the calendar year. These are challenging times for everyone managing through the pandemic's effect on their personal and professional lives. We're helping however we can with support and resources, including quarterly payments to assist our people with work-from-home costs and care needs, a pandemic care leave program, additional services for mental and physical health, and more.
In addition to the ongoing challenges of the pandemic, these last few months have brought forward important cultural conversations around racial and social injustice, harassment and misconduct. We've long held equality, inclusion and diversity at the center of our beliefs at Electronic Arts, and as a company, we've made our positions clear and demonstrated with our actions that we have a long-term commitment to making a positive impact in our world.
As we've shared previously, our business focus continues to be on our key growth drivers, delivering amazing games and content, offering live services that extend and enhance the experience, and connecting more players across more platforms and ways to play. In our first quarter of FY '21, engagement was exceptionally strong across our portfolio. We launched new games, delivered incredible growth in our live services, and welcomed tens of millions of new players into the EA network since the beginning of April. This drove the biggest first quarter in EA history, with net bookings and operating cash flow both setting new records. As a result, we are raising our full year FY '21 net revenue and net bookings guidance today.
We've seen tremendous growth over the last 4 months in our business and across the industry. As EA, we sit at the intersection of 2 fundamental secular trends that have become increasingly clear. First, social interactions in our world are moving from physical to digital. And second, the consumption of sports and entertainment is moving from linear to interactive. We've seen both of these trends accelerate during the COVID-19 period. Tens of millions of new players have come into our games, and we also have many players returning to our franchises after some time away. In addition to higher engagement from our existing players, these new and returning players are now deeply engaged in our live services, establishing new play patterns and building new friendships in our games. So while there are unknowable aspects to this period of time we are in, and it may be difficult to predict the patterns of new and returning players, we expect these trends to continue during and after the pandemic. We remain committed to continuing to innovate in this space, keeping EA at the forefront of providing social interaction and interactive entertainment to a wide global audience.
I'll share a few highlights here that capture what our teams delivered for players in Q1. We launched 2 new games to players during the quarter. Command & Conquer Remastered, which was incredibly well-received by fans and critics and became a top selling title on Origin and Steam, as well as Burnout Paradise Remastered on the Nintendo Switch. Our teams also delivered over 30 new content updates for our console and PC titles, including two major game expansions, as well as more than 50 updates to our mobile games. All of this, and the continued development of our upcoming titles for FY '21 and beyond, was completed with our teams working from home.
Apex Legends continues its momentum as an exceptional live service, building on strong performance through the last several quarters and bringing even more players together in the game. Q1 saw the most game sessions played and highest revenue total since the launch quarter for Apex, and engagement in Season 5 reached the highest levels since our first new season of content. Creative in-game events continue to be a huge draw for our Apex community, and the most recent event, Lost Treasures, had more than 96 million hours played in the first 2 weeks. We're bringing Apex to players on the Switch and Steam, and we're excited to introduce cross-play later this year so more players can engage and play together with their friends.
The world has an insatiable appetite for sports, and for the experiences that EA SPORTS delivers in our games. With real world sports disrupted, EA SPORTS has become the center of the emotional connection to sports, and we've brought millions of new, returning and existing players into their own personal sports stories through our games.
Player acquisition of new and returning players in FIFA grew more than 100% year-over-year in Q1, with more than 7 million joining during the quarter. There are now -- these are now among our most engaged groups of players, demonstrating commitment and longevity in our FIFA live service. FIFA in Asia grew significantly year-over-year in Q1 as well, with FIFA Online 4 now engaging nearly 30 million players to date.
Madden NFL 20 also had an incredible Q1, building on what is already the biggest year ever for our Madden franchise. Player acquisition in Madden NFL grew nearly 140% year-over-year in Q1, and virtually every measure of Madden Ultimate Team engagement is up more than double over last year.
The Sims continues to resonate with more players around the world. The Sims 4 now has more than 30 million players life-to-date across all platforms, and daily, weekly and monthly active player totals in the game all reached record highs for a first quarter. Our Sims mobile games had an excellent Q1 as well. The creative and inclusive nature of The Sims experience on any device is truly unique in all of gaming, and we're especially proud of the way it helps players find community and express themselves during culturally challenging times.
During Q1, we also launched nearly 30 titles on the Steam platform. Bringing our games to Steam enables us to substantially grow our PC audience. Our Origin business grew 75% year-over-year as well, and by opening up the ability for Steam and Origin players to play together, we're now positioned to harness the full power of the PC community. Bringing titles to Steam is also foundational to our EA subscription service that will go live on the platform later this summer. In addition, the total number of players in our subscriptions on Origin, Xbox One and PS4 grew quarter-over-quarter, with new players coming into our services to experience more great games.
It was an unprecedented quarter of growth. Looking forward, we're also seeing strong engagement in Q2. Although it is difficult to predict ongoing levels of growth in this environment, we have grown our player base during this period and added value to our network. Our EA SPORTS live services are acting as social networks for sports fans around the world, and the strength of those connections will grow as real sports seasons return. Players in our communities for The Sims, Apex, Star Wars and more are building relationships through our games, and we expect them to be with us for a long time to come.
Building on this strength, we have exciting new titles and content coming in Q2 and beyond, including Rocket Arena which we just launched with Final Strike Games. We showcased many of these new experiences in our EA Play Live broadcast in June, where our audience grew significantly year-over-year, and the trailers and videos that we debuted have been watched more than 31 million times. We will begin launching our new EA SPORTS games starting in August. Nowhere else in the world can sports fans find the breadth and depth of interactive experiences like the ones in our EA SPORTS portfolio this year. With UFC 4 launching on August 14, we've got something for every fight fan, an amazing roster of fighters, tremendous customization, brand new environments, and more fluid gameplay, all making this the most authentic MMA game we've ever created.
Madden NFL 21 is then set to launch on August 28. On top of major gameplay innovation, a new campaign mode, and more of the Superstar X-Factor abilities that fans love, we're bringing creative and innovative new ways to play Madden that build on the strength of our NFL partnership.
We have more people than ever before playing and connecting through FIFA, and when FIFA 21 launches on October 9, the world's leading football experience will expand with more ways to play with friends. VOLTA SQUADS and FUT Co-Op will bring new social dimensions to the game, and we're also delivering the most comprehensive update to Career Mode that we've ever released.
NHL 21 launches October 16, and we're excited about the great work from our NHL team this year and we'll share more about that soon. Then in the holiday season, EA SPORTS will also lead the way on the new PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. Next-generation versions of FIFA 21 and Madden 21 will bring the next level of innovation and interactive sports experiences to fans with the launch of the new consoles. This will be a great year of new games and content for sports fans around the world.
With our cloud-based broadcasting platform for esports operating at global scale, we delivered 85% more esports broadcast content in the last 4 months than we did in all of calendar year 2019. Demand for our FIFA, Apex Legends and Madden esports content across major networks is unprecedented. And the great entertainment we are providing is bringing more players and viewers into new experiences with our games. We're now significantly expanding and diversifying our content for the rest of this year. Our plans are to deliver 3x as many broadcasted events in FY '21 over last year, spanning linear and digital broadcasts, with more athlete, celebrity and fan competitions, in addition to global esports ecosystems for Apex Legends, FIFA and Madden.
We also just launched The Sims Spark'd on TBS and Buzzfeed, our first-ever reality competition TV show. Seamlessly integrating entertaining player stories and gameplay, alongside weekly challenges for the Sims 4 players, it's an entirely new and unique way to create competition. It shows the innovation we can bring to the esports space with our franchises, and we're very excited by the fan reaction to date.
We're also very pleased with the response to our new Star Wars: Squadrons game from Motive Studios set to launch on October 2. This is going to be the game for anyone that's ever had the fantasy of piloting a Star Wars starfighter, with a deep level of immersion built by our teams in collaboration with Disney and Lucasfilm. We're excited to add another all-new experience to the portfolio of amazing Star Wars titles we've delivered to fans, especially one that opens up new dimensions like full VR support and cross-play.
Our business is strong and it's been an amazing start to the year. These are challenging times amidst the pandemic, and we are deeply appreciative of all that our teams are doing to continually innovate and deliver for our players and push the boundaries of interactive entertainment every step of the way even while working from home. We also have to thank all of our players for their support. We're humbled to see so many using our games and our network as a way to connect with their friends and families during this time. There is much more to come from us at Electronic Arts in FY '21.
Now I'll hand the call over to Blake."

We saw extraordinary levels of player engagement through the first quarter, far higher than we even ever expected or had forecasted in May. And it proved more resilient than we had expected. Engagement was broad-based, with net bookings for live services at extraordinary levels for FIFA, Madden, Apex Legends, The Sims and our mobile titles. And with increased sales of our games across the breadth of our entire catalog, we connected with more people to the games they want and to each other. All this was reflected in our results, with record Q1 highs in net revenue, net bookings, live services and cash flow.
I'll report the specifics of our results on a GAAP basis, then use our operational measures of net bookings to discuss the dynamics of our business. Before I get to the numbers, let me remind everyone of the 3 reporting changes we implemented this quarter and discussed in our last quarter call. First, we now present GAAP net revenues in the income statement as one item, rather than as product and service. Second, we report mobile bookings gross of platform fees, instead of net. And finally, we updated the presentation of net bookings by composition to focus on full game and live services sales. Our historical results have been recast for comparability.
EA's net revenue was $1.46 billion compared to $1.21 billion a year ago, and above our guidance by $239 million. Operating expenses were $700 million compared to $607 million a year ago. This was above our expectations, driven by variable compensation due to our strong performance in the quarter, as well as COVID-related costs and lower attrition. Operating income was $471 million compared to $415 million a year ago and above our expectations. Diluted earnings per share was $1.25 as well above our expectations of $0.93, driven by the topline beat. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $378 million, up $220 million from last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $38 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $340 million. Operating cash flow for the last 12 months was $2.02 billion, a new record. See our earnings slides for further cash flow information. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $5.96 billion, up 15% year-on-year.
Now, I'd like to turn to the key drivers of our business this quarter. Net bookings for the quarter were $1.39 billion, up $608 million from the prior year, and $390 million above our guidance, driven by strength across the board, with strong performance from our core franchises and live services. The currency headwind net of hedges was $42 million year-on-year. Live services and other net bookings were $1.103 billion, up $416 million from the prior year. This extraordinary result is a consequence of the years of work we've invested in building teams, processes and content for our titles, which delivered strength across our portfolio. FIFA, Madden, Apex Legends, and The Sims all grew very strongly. Ultimate Team was up 70% on a like-for-like basis, adjusting for the timing of Ultimate Team events, for the extra week in the quarter, and for currency. With Lost Treasures, Apex Legends presented its most engaging event ever, and delivered its biggest season since launch. And, as Andrew mentioned, The Sims 4 exceeded 30 million users life-to-date, and Q1 net bookings more than doubled year on year. Mobile was up 32%, with success across our portfolio led by Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, which had the best quarter since 2018. The game has now generated over $1 billion in lifetime bookings. FIFA Mobile, SimCity, The Sims Free Play and more showed growth of a similar magnitude.
Full game net bookings were $287 million, up $192 million from the prior year. 52% of our unit sales are now digital rather than physical, measured on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 over the last 12 months. Net bookings for packaged goods and for the full-game digital downloads almost tripled. This was primarily driven by our deep catalog.
A brief note on financial reporting before we go on to guidance. People are playing our games for longer as a result of the amazing content provided on our live services teams and the social connections they make within our games. So for GAAP reporting, we're increasing the period of time over which we recognize the portion of our net revenue. This begins in our second quarter, only affects GAAP revenue, and only affects the timing of recognition, not total net revenue. We estimate that it will move the recognition of approximately $300 million in GAAP net revenue from fiscal 2021 into fiscal 2022. It does not affect net bookings or operating cash flow.
Now, turning to guidance. Due to the significant outperformance during the quarter, we are increasing both our net revenue and net bookings guidance for the full year. In doing so, we had to balance the significant boost we saw in Q1 and the confidence we have in our games and live services against the unknowable macroeconomic environment for the rest of the fiscal year. We are taking a cautious view that assumes that we will continue to see a modest tailwind to engagement, driven in part by continued shelter-in-place orders. This is offset by a weaker economy or could be weaker economies around the world and the slightly later sports launches. There are reasons for optimism. For example, we've added tens of millions of players to the EA Player Network since the beginning of April. As Andrew mentioned, FIFA alone attracted 7 million new players on console in the last quarter, and more people are playing FIFA now at this time in -- than any previous cycle. This is significant, in that people have played the game recently are more likely to buy the new one. New players are building networks of friends in our games as they play. Engagement in FIFA and Madden continue to be massively above where we would normally expect them to be. Nevertheless, we haven't launched a major title since the pandemic struck, so it's too early to draw general conclusions.
Our business is strong and our games are on track. Hopefully, our base case around the uncertain economic will prove to be too cautious. Thus, our expectations for full-year GAAP revenue are now $5.625 billion, cost of revenue to be $1.483 billion, and earnings per share of $2.97. We are raising our operating cash flow guidance by $275 million to $1.85 billion. We continue to anticipate capital expenditures of around $125 million, which would deliver free cash flow of $1.725 billion.
A note on OpEx before moving onto the business drivers. The increase from our prior guidance is mainly driven by variable compensation plus higher-than-expected headcount, due to lower turnover during this difficult period. We're continuing to invest in our growth drivers, and, in particular, we're increasing the number of mobile titles we have in development. We now expect net bookings for the year to be $5.950 billion, $400 million above our prior guidance. Versus last year, this factors in an FX headwind of about $100 million. And, as you build your model, note that we are also forecasting a fall in interest rates of about $80 million compared to last year as we mentioned in our last quarterly earnings call.
For the second quarter, we now expect GAAP net revenue of $1.125 billion, cost of revenue to be $280 million, and operating expenses of $755 million. This results in earnings per share of $0.21 for the second quarter. We anticipate net bookings for the second quarter to be $875 million. The significant year-on-year variance is driven by the move of FIFA 21 from Q2 to Q3, and by the later launch of Madden NFL 21 in Q2, which we have previously announced. The change in mix for Q2 weighs on gross margin for the quarter. Madden stays in Q2, but has less live services opportunity than in prior years by virtue of starting later, and FIFA moves to the beginning of Q3.
With regard to live services, remember that we're focused on engagement ahead of new product launches, so expect lower bookings at that point of the cycle. See the phasing that we provide in our quarterly presentations on our IR website. You'll see that the smaller Q2 is more than offset by a much larger Q3, and a slightly larger Q4.
As we approach 6 months working from home, we are finding ways to continue to deliver great games and services. We're excited to showcase the incredible efforts of our Madden and FIFA, NHL and UFC teams have done through the upcoming -- as they lead into the upcoming launches, and by the work of all of our live services teams. The shelter-in-place orders have so far been a strong tailwind for our business, as players look for safe and social entertainment in these difficult times. A macroeconomic headwind in the second half seems very likely. Nevertheless, our ability to deliver high quality AAA and indie titles for our players, combined with the incredible success of our ongoing live services and increased reach across platforms and geographies enables us to continue to deliver for players and investors.
Now I'll turn the call back to Andrew."

It was an extraordinary quarter for games and for Electronic Arts. Our business is strong. We've just had the largest first quarter in the history of the company, with tremendous engagement from existing, new and returning players. We are well positioned to build on that strength. We will continue to deliver more amazing games and content, including new EA SPORTS titles, more groundbreaking fun esports content, Star Wars: Squadrons launching in October, and more. We'll continue to extend and enhance the experiences in our live services on all platforms, from console to PC to mobile. And our focus on connecting more players across more platforms will continue, as we bring our subscription to Steam, integrate our games with Stadia, expand support for cross-play, and reach more platforms with our games, including the next-gen consoles coming later this year. It's also increasingly apparent that COVID-19 could be with us for some time. Keeping all of our teams safe is our first priority. They are the true strength of Electronic Arts, and their commitment and courage during the challenges of recent months has been deeply inspiring. Not only have they continued to develop and launch games from home. Our employees have supported nearly 1,000 different charities in the last 3 months, including tens of thousands of hours of volunteer time. Their contributions to COVID relief efforts and racial justice organizations, along with matching funds and additional contributions from EA, have totaled more than $3 million to date. In this environment, supporting our teams, building our culture, and striving to amplify the positive impacts of play in our communities around the world has never been more important. We look forward to sharing more updates with you in the quarters ahead. Be well and stay healthy.
Now Blake and I are here for your questions."

It's a good question, and I appreciate you asking. The entire delta is FIFA. Nothing else is going on. As we've tried to be pretty clear about that, I don't think people have necessarily heard that, but that's the entire delta. We've also not changed",705,"Yes. It's a good question, and I appreciate you asking. The entire delta is FIFA. Nothing else is going on. As we've tried to be pretty clear about that, I don't think people have necessarily heard that, but that's the entire delta. We've also not changed the back half of the year guidance down. So you should assume we are planning and we will make up anything we might have missed during the quarter or the 2 quarters.
The other thing I would just want to remind people is that it's all event -- Ultimate Team's all event-driven. That means that there may be some events that roll into next year, which actually strengthen next year as well as this year. We made a simple decision, which is we wanted to give both the FIFA and Madden team a couple of extra weeks to final and what has been the most difficult situation we've ever lived through, which is building games from home. We are incredibly impressed with what they've been able to do and how they've been able to innovate the game within this context. And so our view is -- our hope is that most investors aren't focused on each quarter, they're focused on the full year. We just raised guidance by $400 million. And I remind people in the history of both Andrew and I running the company, we have only raised guidance in the first quarter once. So you guys all know our conservative approach and how we're always cautious.
We also mentioned today that we know there is and if we went after things that is not economic risk in the back half of the year, I'd like to know that, but we all know there's economic risk. And so I think I would take our raising of guidance and not lowering guidance in the back half of the year even after moving FIFA and Madden is a pretty positive signal. And I think Andrew and I both mentioned in the call, the other thing, which was we are continuing to see engagement and monetization levels higher than we've normally seen during the -- where we currently are in the second quarter. And I'm not telling you that, that's going to change the second quarter or we would have changed guidance because we just don't know yet. But remember, the unbelievably high monetization we saw in Q1 does not drop off a cliff. It will slowly decline as we all go back to a normal life. But if you ask many of us, that might be 6 months, 9 months or 2 years.
And what we also mentioned, which I think is the most important component is as people rejoin or join as a new member of a social network around the game, they tend not to leave. And so this should ultimately long-term benefit our business. And it's just -- the problem for us is we've never lived through this before, and none of us have, you guys haven't either. And so we don't have a road map to be able to help us, be able to predict exactly what it's going to look like. And so we're trying to be transparent. We're trying to be straightforward. And we're trying to be optimistic because we are optimistic, but we're also trying to be realistic that we know that there's economic strains out there around the world that could ultimately come back to impact our business or anybody's business.
So sorry to go on about the question, but I think we want to try and make sure we're -- people are understanding that it's both FIFA and -- Madden and FIFA Ultimate Team that are moving. But other than that, we're not signaling anything else other than we made a decision. And we made it some time ago because we announced it some time ago. So we wanted to give the teams a few extra weeks to make sure that the product was exceptional when it came out the door, and we're confident that that's what it's going to be.
Now your second question, sorry, I went on too long in the first question. So I forgot your second question."

And I guess I'll have Andrew just sort of help out on this as well because it's important to hear from both of us. I mean we always look at the games, and we want to make sure we are providing the greatest value for our players. And games all have different scale. And most of our games right now have huge scale. We designed this game to really focus on what we heard from consumers, which is one of their greatest fantasies and that's to be able to fly a X-wing fighter or a TIE fighter and be in a dog fight. And so it doesn't have the breadth of some of our games, but it is still an incredible game. And so that's why we chose to price it at a slightly lower level to also allow access to as many people as possible who had that Star Wars fantasy. I'll let Andrew jump in and talk about how we view pricing long term. But I think you've seen us over the years differentiate pricing on lots of games. We've differentiated pricing on things like Plants vs Zombies games because we knew that they were skewed to younger audiences, for example, or maybe didn't have the depth of all of the game modes that you might see in an Ultimate or a FIFA or a Madden. Andrew, do you want to add to that?"

I would start with what are the player motivations we're trying to fulfill and what are the expectations of those player groups in fulfillment of those motivations. And I think that we start there long before we ever get to price points. And as you've seen from us, we have games across the spectrum of pricing, whether that's free-to-play or at $60 or at $60 with an additional live service or as part of our subscription offerings. And at the end of the day, as we think about it, we start with a player, we start with the motivations and expectations that they have, and we build out the game. In this case, this is a very deep and immersive game and that $40 felt like the right price points, given the breadth of the game. Very proud of what we're doing. We wanted it to be a wholly self-contained experience that was deeply emerging in that fantasy.
As we think about pricing more broadly, I would come back to that position, which is we start with what are the player motivations we're trying to fulfill, what are the expectations that players have around depth and breadth and live service in any given experience, and we build from there. As we think about this year, you've seen what we've done as we've announced that we will offer the ability for players to transition free of charge from existing generation of console titles to the next-generation of console titles for FIFA and Madden. We did that and we set out to build the best PlayStation 4, Xbox One experience as we could as well as the most innovative and creative experiences for Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5. And what we wanted for our players this year because what they asked for was the smoothest possible transition that meant that they could jump into the game when it launched on existing platforms and then move into the next platform as it made sense for them later on in the year. And that has been our focus this year. And we will continue to kind of look at this over time."

Can I ask, if you don't mind, just thinking through the changes in real estates and the sports titles. I know that was probably a production driven decision.

And just wondering how that maps to the release of your games and the events in the live services and how much it matters. For instance, if there was no NFL season in the fall or if it had to be stopped in the halfway through, how does that matter to your games, how should we think about that? I know it's sort of a broad hypothetical, but there's so much uncertainty there. So I guess the underlying question is how much does whatever happens as live sports affect how we should think about and expect people to engage with and spend money in your games?

One is the connection, the emotional connection to real world of sports and all that's happening with the players and teams and the leagues that you love. The other is we provide you a tool set that features those players, teams and the leagues that you love, but allows you to tell your own personal sports stories. And what you saw from us this past quarter is we really leaned into that. And we actually augmented that some. So while we provided opportunities and events so that you might tell your own personal sports stories with your friends and your rivals, we also dropped in about additional esports content, celebrity content and esports and celebrity competitions. And what we've seen is that we've been able to uphold and fulfill the motivations of sports fans and the needs of sports fans and allow them to remain connected to the sports they love. And I would tell you, I think that we are comfortable doing that for as long as it needs to.

And as part of that, we know, for example, Madden Ultimate Team was up over 300%. And there was no sports -- live sports going on at any point in the time during that quarter. And I think Andrew made the point, and I would just stress this as when people are sports fans, remember they are sports fans connected to a social network. No one plays a fantasy sport game alone. No one plays Ultimate Team alone. They play with each other. And that means that it builds off of the social network more than anything else. And so in the absence of sports, people double down and are excited. And so while we always want live sports to go on because it helps feed the engagement and excitement around the business. We also know sports fans are not going to stop being sports fans if the underlying sports stops. And I think the first quarter proves that better than anything we've ever seen. And so we hope sports is back because we all love sports, and we want to engage in it. I'd prefer not to watch sports with an empty stadium. But at the end of the day, it's better than no sports at all. And our games allow people that continued engagement with something that they really love. And I would tell you, that extends well beyond sports, right? I mean, you might ask, well, if there's no Star Wars content in the next 6 months because movie studios are shut down or TV studios are shut down, does that hurt your business? No, no, it goes just the opposite, which is, if you're a Star Wars fan, you want to find every single opportunity to engage in Star Wars. And that's why we saw growth of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, growth of our Star Wars online business and continued growth of the catalog of Battlefield 1 -- or Battlefront I and Battlefront II during the quarter. It's -- when you're Star Wars fan, you want Star Wars, and you got to get it somewhere. So that's why we keep coming back to -- this is an incredible opportunity for us. But at the same time, we also understand that we don't -- we can't predict the future. And so we're always careful of trying to predict the future, but we do see a huge opportunity."

I can't comment on any specific acquisition other than what I will tell you is, as we've said, you've seen in the past, where we've done the best is where we have long-term relationships with people and we're really trying to buy great talent versus games. And I think Respawn is a classic example of that. We were able to bring them into the fold, give them incredible support, and it was all driven by the fact that they had incredible talent. It wasn't about Titanfall, that's no offense to Titanfall. It's become an amazing game and we'll maybe see Titanfall at some point, sometime down the road, but it was really about the team. And it starts at the top with Vince but it goes all the way through the whole organization. So we're always looking at that. We'll always continue to look at that. We would hope we can find more. Our hope was that some of the challenges in our broad world economy would actually make people think and understand that being subscale is difficult.

I mean, I don't know off the top of my head, remember, but I think we were bouncing between high single digits and low double digits, maybe mid-double digits, like between 15% and 20%. I mean, we were having a strong Ultimate Team quarter. If you go to the fourth quarter, if you go back and look at the transcripts, you could probably see it, I just don't have it in front of me. But I mean, this is off the charts different, right? I mean it is exceptional. And particularly for games like Madden, where normally, the soft spot in a game like that, where we really come out of the Super Bowl, and there's only a few places where you can kind of continue to drive engagement on around things like the Draft and the Combine. And you would expect this year, maybe because many of those things were not done in person that might have hurt Ultimate Team. But remember, the team, a couple of years ago, started working on changing and adding new modes to the game and improving, and it really came to play in the past year. So we were seeing super strength in both Madden base game and Madden Ultimate Team coming into the quarter, and it just continued to get stronger and stronger.
I think the other thing is that all the Ultimate Team teams stepped up to think about what new events could they run in a world of stay at home or work from home or whatever it might be. And so they doubled down on social and really drove opportunities in a world in which there was no sports. But as I said in the last question, sports fans were looking for their sports excitement and fix essentially to be able to play. And so you saw that in our esports calendar. As Andrew mentioned, we completely doubled down on esports even though we had to do it all from a virtual broadcasting facility versus our own broadcasting facility. And our team did an amazing job of creating some incredible content. And I'll just give you a personal example. When I see my wife watching a Madden esports tournament and cheering on TV, I know -- because she's a massive sports fan, I know we've hit the right tone with consumers. We're delivering for consumers what they want.
So what we've seen so far, as I mentioned on the call earlier, we saw this peak of massive engagement in the April, May time frame, and that slowly declined as some people have gone back to work or to their offices. But it is still well above what we've normally seen, particularly at this time of the year, which is the slowest time as we move from one sports event to the next. And I can't tell you how that's going to look for the rest of the quarter or for the rest of the year. But remember, we know we've got a lot of new people into the game. A lot of people are engaging in Ultimate Team and the sports franchises. And we don't think that shuts off overnight and maybe never shuts off. And we hope that will give us longer term growth. But that will ultimately be a question when we start talking about next year's guidance and all those things that we normally do. But don't take our conservatism in any way on guidance going forward as saying anything about the games and about engagement, it's all about the economy at the end of the day. And you guys tell me, you saw the GDP numbers this morning. Are you confident the economy is going to be strong for the next 6 to 12 months? I just don't know. That's the thing that weighs on us the most. And yet at the same time, we know that the engagement in our games has never been higher. To see The Sims up 110% year-over-year, I mean, that's driven by a lot of new people and lapse players coming into The Sims. And we know with The Sims, remember, it's grown every year for the last 6 years. That means that people who come in don't churn out. They get engaged and then they continue to engage in all the content that's been produced and the new content. And that's where we get pretty excited.
So sorry, a bigger answer to your question than you probably wanted, but we're -- I want to make sure everyone understands. We are prudent, we are conservative, as you guys all know, and yet at the same time, we are unbelievably optimistic about the business, even though we got here via a really difficult time around the world."

Or are they the ones that you've seen payer conversion, ARPU in line with your legacy hardcore players that have been in there basically since FY '11 playing FIFA Ultimate Team.

The 7 million is made up of lapsed players, players haven't been with us for a season and some completely new players. What I would tell you is, while it is early, and it is a little bit difficult to predict future behavior on these cohorts at this juncture, they are performing like some of our strongest and most engaged groups in the game. And I think that's testament to the fact that this game does facilitate its connection to friends, in connection to the sport and a live service that sits within that game is now so intrinsic to the experience and a big part of the joy that players get. And what the teams have done through this last quarter is spectacular in terms of their ability to entertain existing players, lapsed returning players and the new players and we're seeing those groups come together and perform in the same way that are traditionally very highly engaged strong play groups have. So we're -- to Blake's point, it's early, it's not easy to predict, but the early signs are very strong and we're very optimistic about what this means for the FIFA community long term."

I mean, we're always assuming that if we bring new players in, we can most likely increase the player base and the future purchases. I would say right now, as you can see, we didn't take our guidance down for the back half of the year. We simply moved FIFA 2 weeks and that's a quarterly change. So I wouldn't take any of that as a message that we have moved or changed our forecast either way. It's just -- it's still too early to say on that. And so more to come, I think by the time we get to our second quarter earnings, we'll have a much better sense of do we think guidance is going to go up or down based on where both FIFA, Madden and Hockey are all -- Hockey and UFC are tracking. But we're very optimistic about all those.
On capital allocation, we paused our program because we felt like at the time, it was -- we didn't pause it. I mean, sorry, we didn't restart a new program because we were at the end of our old program. We felt like it was not the right time to send a message, both externally as well as internally into our company that we were starting a new program until we got through this pandemic and had a little bit of feeling about how things would look in the future. And I think we're closer now. I can't tell you when we would restart a program. There is no doubt that there is a commitment to have a program. It's really a timing issue and it's a timing issue driven by the COVID situation. And I think that's pretty consistent with almost every company out there. There's only a couple of companies that have started new programs in the last quarter. And so that's the answer. There's no change in our thinking. We believe we want to effectively and always be returning capital to shareholders. As you saw, we had the greatest cash flow we've ever had as a company over the last 12 months. We know that we should be returning some of that on a large portion to the shareholders. And so expect you'll hear something from us in the future. I just can't predict exactly when that's going to happen."

So are you seeing a market difference in the behavior of those users? Are they dropping off more? And one of your competitors talked last week about seeing weakness in Europe relative to the U.S.?

And so to Blake's point, I think it's too early to tell what we have seen in our games is continued strong engagement. And we believe that, that's because we are providing, particularly as it relates to FIFA in Europe, that emotional connection to football that was missing. And what we saw is football came back online, at least somewhat in Europe, is that further bolstered that emotional connection to the sport that our FIFA game was able to provide. So too early to tell, but we've seen continued strong engagement even in Europe as they -- as some of those markets have gone back online."

We've cut down our permute time tremendously. We don't travel as much. So we have the opportunity to spend more time with our families. And in some cases, I think we are significantly more productive in a work-from-home environment as it relates to our efficiency levels. At the same time, I think we would all acknowledge that there are other components of work from home that are very challenging. Home schooling is challenging. The mental and emotional well-being can be challenged if you're spending all your time in 1 place. I think as an organization, we've remained committed to our employees. We are providing financial assistance, mental and physical and emotional assistance. We're offering flexibility in work hours wherever possible and offering caregiver leave as members of our employee base think about home schooling or caring for family and loved ones. I think there's a lot of things that we've learned. I don't think we'll ever go back exactly to the way things were. But at the same time, I don't think we would ever move to a place where the entire workforce would work from home. I do believe there is a kinetic energy that come from putting creative people together in a building, at least for some part of the time. And again, we're just a few months into this. As I said in my prepared remarks, we will likely -- in all likelihood and what we've communicated to employers that we'll be -- most of us will be work from home through the rest of this calendar year, at which point we'll reevaluate. And that we are being very open in our dialogue and communication with employees. And to the extent that there are things that we can do to help them through this process or to the extent that there might be longer term changes that we might make, we're opening up that dialogue and having those conversations now. So not much a share at this point in terms of long-term changes other than there will likely be some, but those some probably won't involve the entire workforce staying work from home forever."

Most of our revenue for the quarter was live services. And live services require people to be doing something every single day. We're running events every week. We're developing new characters. We're developing new content. We're changing things. We're managing security, managing monetization. That is as hard as game development is the fact that we have proven in the quarter that we could show live services growth like we have. I mean, Andrew and I, every morning wake up and realize we are unbelievably blessed with an incredible workforce that has figured out how to do this. Because once again as I said earlier, there's no playbook that how do you run live -- how do you run Ultimate Team or Apex from home. No one's ever did that. And it just shows the strength of this organization and the commitment that people have to drive the business in ways that they've never thought they could. And that's pretty powerful. And so for anybody who's over-indexing on us moving FIFA out of the second quarter to third quarter, I just suggest, go back and just think about $1.1 billion in live services in the quarter. That is amazing. And so that's why I think we're trying to send the signal to people is we don't like the fact that we had to get here for the -- via the COVID virus, but we've proven that this is something that's really special.
So with that, I'll end the call and look forward to seeing everyone or talking to everyone in person, maybe someday soon or maybe a year from now, who knows.

First off, I hope that all of you listening today are well and that you and your families are in good health. This is an unprecedented time, and it was an unprecedented first quarter for our business at Electronic Arts, with extraordinary growth in our games and live services and record financial performance. I'll speak to both of those in a moment, but first let me touch on our efforts to continue supporting our teams through the evolving COVID-19 situation.
I'm incredibly proud of our amazing teams at Electronic Arts. The ingenuity, creativity, and determination of all of our talented people is making it possible for us to continue delivering all the great games and content to players, even as almost all of us continue to work from home. The wellbeing of our people is our top priority, and to keep everyone as safe as possible, the vast majority of us at EA will be working from home at least through the remainder of the calendar year. These are challenging times for everyone managing through the pandemic's effect on their personal and professional lives. We're helping however we can with support and resources, including quarterly payments to assist our people with work-from-home costs and care needs, a pandemic care leave program, additional services for mental and physical health, and more.
In addition to the ongoing challenges of the pandemic, these last few months have brought forward important cultural conversations around racial and social injustice, harassment and misconduct. We've long held equality, inclusion and diversity at the center of our beliefs at Electronic Arts, and as a company, we've made our positions clear and demonstrated with our actions that we have a long-term commitment to making a positive impact in our world.
As we've shared previously, our business focus continues to be on our key growth drivers, delivering amazing games and content, offering live services that extend and enhance the experience, and connecting more players across more platforms and ways to play. In our first quarter of FY '21, engagement was exceptionally strong across our portfolio. We launched new games, delivered incredible growth in our live services, and welcomed tens of millions of new players into the EA network since the beginning of April. This drove the biggest first quarter in EA history, with net bookings and operating cash flow both setting new records. As a result, we are raising our full year FY '21 net revenue and net bookings guidance today.
We've seen tremendous growth over the last 4 months in our business and across the industry. As EA, we sit at the intersection of 2 fundamental secular trends that have become increasingly clear. First, social interactions in our world are moving from physical to digital. And second, the consumption of sports and entertainment is moving from linear to interactive. We've seen both of these trends accelerate during the COVID-19 period. Tens of millions of new players have come into our games, and we also have many players returning to our franchises after some time away. In addition to higher engagement from our existing players, these new and returning players are now deeply engaged in our live services, establishing new play patterns and building new friendships in our games. So while there are unknowable aspects to this period of time we are in, and it may be difficult to predict the patterns of new and returning players, we expect these trends to continue during and after the pandemic. We remain committed to continuing to innovate in this space, keeping EA at the forefront of providing social interaction and interactive entertainment to a wide global audience.
I'll share a few highlights here that capture what our teams delivered for players in Q1. We launched 2 new games to players during the quarter. Command & Conquer Remastered, which was incredibly well-received by fans and critics and became a top selling title on Origin and Steam, as well as Burnout Paradise Remastered on the Nintendo Switch. Our teams also delivered over 30 new content updates for our console and PC titles, including two major game expansions, as well as more than 50 updates to our mobile games. All of this, and the continued development of our upcoming titles for FY '21 and beyond, was completed with our teams working from home.
Apex Legends continues its momentum as an exceptional live service, building on strong performance through the last several quarters and bringing even more players together in the game. Q1 saw the most game sessions played and highest revenue total since the launch quarter for Apex, and engagement in Season 5 reached the highest levels since our first new season of content. Creative in-game events continue to be a huge draw for our Apex community, and the most recent event, Lost Treasures, had more than 96 million hours played in the first 2 weeks. We're bringing Apex to players on the Switch and Steam, and we're excited to introduce cross-play later this year so more players can engage and play together with their friends.
The world has an insatiable appetite for sports, and for the experiences that EA SPORTS delivers in our games. With real world sports disrupted, EA SPORTS has become the center of the emotional connection to sports, and we've brought millions of new, returning and existing players into their own personal sports stories through our games.
Player acquisition of new and returning players in FIFA grew more than 100% year-over-year in Q1, with more than 7 million joining during the quarter. There are now -- these are now among our most engaged groups of players, demonstrating commitment and longevity in our FIFA live service. FIFA in Asia grew significantly year-over-year in Q1 as well, with FIFA Online 4 now engaging nearly 30 million players to date.
Madden NFL 20 also had an incredible Q1, building on what is already the biggest year ever for our Madden franchise. Player acquisition in Madden NFL grew nearly 140% year-over-year in Q1, and virtually every measure of Madden Ultimate Team engagement is up more than double over last year.
The Sims continues to resonate with more players around the world. The Sims 4 now has more than 30 million players life-to-date across all platforms, and daily, weekly and monthly active player totals in the game all reached record highs for a first quarter. Our Sims mobile games had an excellent Q1 as well. The creative and inclusive nature of The Sims experience on any device is truly unique in all of gaming, and we're especially proud of the way it helps players find community and express themselves during culturally challenging times.
During Q1, we also launched nearly 30 titles on the Steam platform. Bringing our games to Steam enables us to substantially grow our PC audience. Our Origin business grew 75% year-over-year as well, and by opening up the ability for Steam and Origin players to play together, we're now positioned to harness the full power of the PC community. Bringing titles to Steam is also foundational to our EA subscription service that will go live on the platform later this summer. In addition, the total number of players in our subscriptions on Origin, Xbox One and PS4 grew quarter-over-quarter, with new players coming into our services to experience more great games.
It was an unprecedented quarter of growth. Looking forward, we're also seeing strong engagement in Q2. Although it is difficult to predict ongoing levels of growth in this environment, we have grown our player base during this period and added value to our network. Our EA SPORTS live services are acting as social networks for sports fans around the world, and the strength of those connections will grow as real sports seasons return. Players in our communities for The Sims, Apex, Star Wars and more are building relationships through our games, and we expect them to be with us for a long time to come.
Building on this strength, we have exciting new titles and content coming in Q2 and beyond, including Rocket Arena which we just launched with Final Strike Games. We showcased many of these new experiences in our EA Play Live broadcast in June, where our audience grew significantly year-over-year, and the trailers and videos that we debuted have been watched more than 31 million times. We will begin launching our new EA SPORTS games starting in August. Nowhere else in the world can sports fans find the breadth and depth of interactive experiences like the ones in our EA SPORTS portfolio this year. With UFC 4 launching on August 14, we've got something for every fight fan, an amazing roster of fighters, tremendous customization, brand new environments, and more fluid gameplay, all making this the most authentic MMA game we've ever created.
Madden NFL 21 is then set to launch on August 28. On top of major gameplay innovation, a new campaign mode, and more of the Superstar X-Factor abilities that fans love, we're bringing creative and innovative new ways to play Madden that build on the strength of our NFL partnership.
We have more people than ever before playing and connecting through FIFA, and when FIFA 21 launches on October 9, the world's leading football experience will expand with more ways to play with friends. VOLTA SQUADS and FUT Co-Op will bring new social dimensions to the game, and we're also delivering the most comprehensive update to Career Mode that we've ever released.
NHL 21 launches October 16, and we're excited about the great work from our NHL team this year and we'll share more about that soon. Then in the holiday season, EA SPORTS will also lead the way on the new PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. Next-generation versions of FIFA 21 and Madden 21 will bring the next level of innovation and interactive sports experiences to fans with the launch of the new consoles. This will be a great year of new games and content for sports fans around the world.
With our cloud-based broadcasting platform for esports operating at global scale, we delivered 85% more esports broadcast content in the last 4 months than we did in all of calendar year 2019. Demand for our FIFA, Apex Legends and Madden esports content across major networks is unprecedented. And the great entertainment we are providing is bringing more players and viewers into new experiences with our games. We're now significantly expanding and diversifying our content for the rest of this year. Our plans are to deliver 3x as many broadcasted events in FY '21 over last year, spanning linear and digital broadcasts, with more athlete, celebrity and fan competitions, in addition to global esports ecosystems for Apex Legends, FIFA and Madden.
We also just launched The Sims Spark'd on TBS and Buzzfeed, our first-ever reality competition TV show. Seamlessly integrating entertaining player stories and gameplay, alongside weekly challenges for the Sims 4 players, it's an entirely new and unique way to create competition. It shows the innovation we can bring to the esports space with our franchises, and we're very excited by the fan reaction to date.
We're also very pleased with the response to our new Star Wars: Squadrons game from Motive Studios set to launch on October 2. This is going to be the game for anyone that's ever had the fantasy of piloting a Star Wars starfighter, with a deep level of immersion built by our teams in collaboration with Disney and Lucasfilm. We're excited to add another all-new experience to the portfolio of amazing Star Wars titles we've delivered to fans, especially one that opens up new dimensions like full VR support and cross-play.
Our business is strong and it's been an amazing start to the year. These are challenging times amidst the pandemic, and we are deeply appreciative of all that our teams are doing to continually innovate and deliver for our players and push the boundaries of interactive entertainment every step of the way even while working from home. We also have to thank all of our players for their support. We're humbled to see so many using our games and our network as a way to connect with their friends and families during this time. There is much more to come from us at Electronic Arts in FY '21.
Now I'll hand the call over to Blake."

We saw extraordinary levels of player engagement through the first quarter, far higher than we even ever expected or had forecasted in May. And it proved more resilient than we had expected. Engagement was broad-based, with net bookings for live services at extraordinary levels for FIFA, Madden, Apex Legends, The Sims and our mobile titles. And with increased sales of our games across the breadth of our entire catalog, we connected with more people to the games they want and to each other. All this was reflected in our results, with record Q1 highs in net revenue, net bookings, live services and cash flow.
I'll report the specifics of our results on a GAAP basis, then use our operational measures of net bookings to discuss the dynamics of our business. Before I get to the numbers, let me remind everyone of the 3 reporting changes we implemented this quarter and discussed in our last quarter call. First, we now present GAAP net revenues in the income statement as one item, rather than as product and service. Second, we report mobile bookings gross of platform fees, instead of net. And finally, we updated the presentation of net bookings by composition to focus on full game and live services sales. Our historical results have been recast for comparability.
EA's net revenue was $1.46 billion compared to $1.21 billion a year ago, and above our guidance by $239 million. Operating expenses were $700 million compared to $607 million a year ago. This was above our expectations, driven by variable compensation due to our strong performance in the quarter, as well as COVID-related costs and lower attrition. Operating income was $471 million compared to $415 million a year ago and above our expectations. Diluted earnings per share was $1.25 as well above our expectations of $0.93, driven by the topline beat. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $378 million, up $220 million from last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $38 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $340 million. Operating cash flow for the last 12 months was $2.02 billion, a new record. See our earnings slides for further cash flow information. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $5.96 billion, up 15% year-on-year.
Now, I'd like to turn to the key drivers of our business this quarter. Net bookings for the quarter were $1.39 billion, up $608 million from the prior year, and $390 million above our guidance, driven by strength across the board, with strong performance from our core franchises and live services. The currency headwind net of hedges was $42 million year-on-year. Live services and other net bookings were $1.103 billion, up $416 million from the prior year. This extraordinary result is a consequence of the years of work we've invested in building teams, processes and content for our titles, which delivered strength across our portfolio. FIFA, Madden, Apex Legends, and The Sims all grew very strongly. Ultimate Team was up 70% on a like-for-like basis, adjusting for the timing of Ultimate Team events, for the extra week in the quarter, and for currency. With Lost Treasures, Apex Legends presented its most engaging event ever, and delivered its biggest season since launch. And, as Andrew mentioned, The Sims 4 exceeded 30 million users life-to-date, and Q1 net bookings more than doubled year on year. Mobile was up 32%, with success across our portfolio led by Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, which had the best quarter since 2018. The game has now generated over $1 billion in lifetime bookings. FIFA Mobile, SimCity, The Sims Free Play and more showed growth of a similar magnitude.
Full game net bookings were $287 million, up $192 million from the prior year. 52% of our unit sales are now digital rather than physical, measured on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 over the last 12 months. Net bookings for packaged goods and for the full-game digital downloads almost tripled. This was primarily driven by our deep catalog.
A brief note on financial reporting before we go on to guidance. People are playing our games for longer as a result of the amazing content provided on our live services teams and the social connections they make within our games. So for GAAP reporting, we're increasing the period of time over which we recognize the portion of our net revenue. This begins in our second quarter, only affects GAAP revenue, and only affects the timing of recognition, not total net revenue. We estimate that it will move the recognition of approximately $300 million in GAAP net revenue from fiscal 2021 into fiscal 2022. It does not affect net bookings or operating cash flow.
Now, turning to guidance. Due to the significant outperformance during the quarter, we are increasing both our net revenue and net bookings guidance for the full year. In doing so, we had to balance the significant boost we saw in Q1 and the confidence we have in our games and live services against the unknowable macroeconomic environment for the rest of the fiscal year. We are taking a cautious view that assumes that we will continue to see a modest tailwind to engagement, driven in part by continued shelter-in-place orders. This is offset by a weaker economy or could be weaker economies around the world and the slightly later sports launches. There are reasons for optimism. For example, we've added tens of millions of players to the EA Player Network since the beginning of April. As Andrew mentioned, FIFA alone attracted 7 million new players on console in the last quarter, and more people are playing FIFA now at this time in -- than any previous cycle. This is significant, in that people have played the game recently are more likely to buy the new one. New players are building networks of friends in our games as they play. Engagement in FIFA and Madden continue to be massively above where we would normally expect them to be. Nevertheless, we haven't launched a major title since the pandemic struck, so it's too early to draw general conclusions.
Our business is strong and our games are on track. Hopefully, our base case around the uncertain economic will prove to be too cautious. Thus, our expectations for full-year GAAP revenue are now $5.625 billion, cost of revenue to be $1.483 billion, and earnings per share of $2.97. We are raising our operating cash flow guidance by $275 million to $1.85 billion. We continue to anticipate capital expenditures of around $125 million, which would deliver free cash flow of $1.725 billion.
A note on OpEx before moving onto the business drivers. The increase from our prior guidance is mainly driven by variable compensation plus higher-than-expected headcount, due to lower turnover during this difficult period. We're continuing to invest in our growth drivers, and, in particular, we're increasing the number of mobile titles we have in development. We now expect net bookings for the year to be $5.950 billion, $400 million above our prior guidance. Versus last year, this factors in an FX headwind of about $100 million. And, as you build your model, note that we are also forecasting a fall in interest rates of about $80 million compared to last year as we mentioned in our last quarterly earnings call.
For the second quarter, we now expect GAAP net revenue of $1.125 billion, cost of revenue to be $280 million, and operating expenses of $755 million. This results in earnings per share of $0.21 for the second quarter. We anticipate net bookings for the second quarter to be $875 million. The significant year-on-year variance is driven by the move of FIFA 21 from Q2 to Q3, and by the later launch of Madden NFL 21 in Q2, which we have previously announced. The change in mix for Q2 weighs on gross margin for the quarter. Madden stays in Q2, but has less live services opportunity than in prior years by virtue of starting later, and FIFA moves to the beginning of Q3.
With regard to live services, remember that we're focused on engagement ahead of new product launches, so expect lower bookings at that point of the cycle. See the phasing that we provide in our quarterly presentations on our IR website. You'll see that the smaller Q2 is more than offset by a much larger Q3, and a slightly larger Q4.
As we approach 6 months working from home, we are finding ways to continue to deliver great games and services. We're excited to showcase the incredible efforts of our Madden and FIFA, NHL and UFC teams have done through the upcoming -- as they lead into the upcoming launches, and by the work of all of our live services teams. The shelter-in-place orders have so far been a strong tailwind for our business, as players look for safe and social entertainment in these difficult times. A macroeconomic headwind in the second half seems very likely. Nevertheless, our ability to deliver high quality AAA and indie titles for our players, combined with the incredible success of our ongoing live services and increased reach across platforms and geographies enables us to continue to deliver for players and investors.
Now I'll turn the call back to Andrew."

It was an extraordinary quarter for games and for Electronic Arts. Our business is strong. We've just had the largest first quarter in the history of the company, with tremendous engagement from existing, new and returning players. We are well positioned to build on that strength. We will continue to deliver more amazing games and content, including new EA SPORTS titles, more groundbreaking fun esports content, Star Wars: Squadrons launching in October, and more. We'll continue to extend and enhance the experiences in our live services on all platforms, from console to PC to mobile. And our focus on connecting more players across more platforms will continue, as we bring our subscription to Steam, integrate our games with Stadia, expand support for cross-play, and reach more platforms with our games, including the next-gen consoles coming later this year. It's also increasingly apparent that COVID-19 could be with us for some time. Keeping all of our teams safe is our first priority. They are the true strength of Electronic Arts, and their commitment and courage during the challenges of recent months has been deeply inspiring. Not only have they continued to develop and launch games from home. Our employees have supported nearly 1,000 different charities in the last 3 months, including tens of thousands of hours of volunteer time. Their contributions to COVID relief efforts and racial justice organizations, along with matching funds and additional contributions from EA, have totaled more than $3 million to date. In this environment, supporting our teams, building our culture, and striving to amplify the positive impacts of play in our communities around the world has never been more important. We look forward to sharing more updates with you in the quarters ahead. Be well and stay healthy.
Now Blake and I are here for your questions."

It's a good question, and I appreciate you asking. The entire delta is FIFA. Nothing else is going on. As we've tried to be pretty clear about that, I don't think people have necessarily heard that, but that's the entire delta. We've also not changed",705,"Yes. It's a good question, and I appreciate you asking. The entire delta is FIFA. Nothing else is going on. As we've tried to be pretty clear about that, I don't think people have necessarily heard that, but that's the entire delta. We've also not changed the back half of the year guidance down. So you should assume we are planning and we will make up anything we might have missed during the quarter or the 2 quarters.
The other thing I would just want to remind people is that it's all event -- Ultimate Team's all event-driven. That means that there may be some events that roll into next year, which actually strengthen next year as well as this year. We made a simple decision, which is we wanted to give both the FIFA and Madden team a couple of extra weeks to final and what has been the most difficult situation we've ever lived through, which is building games from home. We are incredibly impressed with what they've been able to do and how they've been able to innovate the game within this context. And so our view is -- our hope is that most investors aren't focused on each quarter, they're focused on the full year. We just raised guidance by $400 million. And I remind people in the history of both Andrew and I running the company, we have only raised guidance in the first quarter once. So you guys all know our conservative approach and how we're always cautious.
We also mentioned today that we know there is and if we went after things that is not economic risk in the back half of the year, I'd like to know that, but we all know there's economic risk. And so I think I would take our raising of guidance and not lowering guidance in the back half of the year even after moving FIFA and Madden is a pretty positive signal. And I think Andrew and I both mentioned in the call, the other thing, which was we are continuing to see engagement and monetization levels higher than we've normally seen during the -- where we currently are in the second quarter. And I'm not telling you that, that's going to change the second quarter or we would have changed guidance because we just don't know yet. But remember, the unbelievably high monetization we saw in Q1 does not drop off a cliff. It will slowly decline as we all go back to a normal life. But if you ask many of us, that might be 6 months, 9 months or 2 years.
And what we also mentioned, which I think is the most important component is as people rejoin or join as a new member of a social network around the game, they tend not to leave. And so this should ultimately long-term benefit our business. And it's just -- the problem for us is we've never lived through this before, and none of us have, you guys haven't either. And so we don't have a road map to be able to help us, be able to predict exactly what it's going to look like. And so we're trying to be transparent. We're trying to be straightforward. And we're trying to be optimistic because we are optimistic, but we're also trying to be realistic that we know that there's economic strains out there around the world that could ultimately come back to impact our business or anybody's business.
So sorry to go on about the question, but I think we want to try and make sure we're -- people are understanding that it's both FIFA and -- Madden and FIFA Ultimate Team that are moving. But other than that, we're not signaling anything else other than we made a decision. And we made it some time ago because we announced it some time ago. So we wanted to give the teams a few extra weeks to make sure that the product was exceptional when it came out the door, and we're confident that that's what it's going to be.
Now your second question, sorry, I went on too long in the first question. So I forgot your second question."

And I guess I'll have Andrew just sort of help out on this as well because it's important to hear from both of us. I mean we always look at the games, and we want to make sure we are providing the greatest value for our players. And games all have different scale. And most of our games right now have huge scale. We designed this game to really focus on what we heard from consumers, which is one of their greatest fantasies and that's to be able to fly a X-wing fighter or a TIE fighter and be in a dog fight. And so it doesn't have the breadth of some of our games, but it is still an incredible game. And so that's why we chose to price it at a slightly lower level to also allow access to as many people as possible who had that Star Wars fantasy. I'll let Andrew jump in and talk about how we view pricing long term. But I think you've seen us over the years differentiate pricing on lots of games. We've differentiated pricing on things like Plants vs Zombies games because we knew that they were skewed to younger audiences, for example, or maybe didn't have the depth of all of the game modes that you might see in an Ultimate or a FIFA or a Madden. Andrew, do you want to add to that?"

I would start with what are the player motivations we're trying to fulfill and what are the expectations of those player groups in fulfillment of those motivations. And I think that we start there long before we ever get to price points. And as you've seen from us, we have games across the spectrum of pricing, whether that's free-to-play or at $60 or at $60 with an additional live service or as part of our subscription offerings. And at the end of the day, as we think about it, we start with a player, we start with the motivations and expectations that they have, and we build out the game. In this case, this is a very deep and immersive game and that $40 felt like the right price points, given the breadth of the game. Very proud of what we're doing. We wanted it to be a wholly self-contained experience that was deeply emerging in that fantasy.
As we think about pricing more broadly, I would come back to that position, which is we start with what are the player motivations we're trying to fulfill, what are the expectations that players have around depth and breadth and live service in any given experience, and we build from there. As we think about this year, you've seen what we've done as we've announced that we will offer the ability for players to transition free of charge from existing generation of console titles to the next-generation of console titles for FIFA and Madden. We did that and we set out to build the best PlayStation 4, Xbox One experience as we could as well as the most innovative and creative experiences for Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5. And what we wanted for our players this year because what they asked for was the smoothest possible transition that meant that they could jump into the game when it launched on existing platforms and then move into the next platform as it made sense for them later on in the year. And that has been our focus this year. And we will continue to kind of look at this over time."

Can I ask, if you don't mind, just thinking through the changes in real estates and the sports titles. I know that was probably a production driven decision. But when we're looking at the real-live physical sports leagues around the world, especially in the states, obviously there's a lot of uncertainty about the timing and shape of their seasons this year and next. And just wondering how that maps to the release of your games and the events in the live services and how much it matters. For instance, if there was no NFL season in the fall or if it had to be stopped in the halfway through, how does that matter to your games, how should we think about that? I know it's sort of a broad hypothetical, but there's so much uncertainty there. So I guess the underlying question is how much does whatever happens as live sports affect how we should think about and expect people to engage with and spend money in your games?

The other is we provide you a tool set that features those players, teams and the leagues that you love, but allows you to tell your own personal sports stories. And what you saw from us this past quarter is we really leaned into that. And we actually augmented that some. So while we provided opportunities and events so that you might tell your own personal sports stories with your friends and your rivals, we also dropped in about additional esports content, celebrity content and esports and celebrity competitions. And what we've seen is that we've been able to uphold and fulfill the motivations of sports fans and the needs of sports fans and allow them to remain connected to the sports they love.

And as part of that, we know, for example, Madden Ultimate Team was up over 300%. And there was no sports -- live sports going on at any point in the time during that quarter. And I think Andrew made the point, and I would just stress this as when people are sports fans, remember they are sports fans connected to a social network. No one plays a fantasy sport game alone. No one plays Ultimate Team alone. They play with each other. And that means that it builds off of the social network more than anything else. And so in the absence of sports, people double down and are excited. And so while we always want live sports to go on because it helps feed the engagement and excitement around the business. We also know sports fans are not going to stop being sports fans if the underlying sports stops. And I think the first quarter proves that better than anything we've ever seen. And so we hope sports is back because we all love sports, and we want to engage in it. I'd prefer not to watch sports with an empty stadium. But at the end of the day, it's better than no sports at all. And our games allow people that continued engagement with something that they really love. And I would tell you, that extends well beyond sports, right? I mean, you might ask, well, if there's no Star Wars content in the next 6 months because movie studios are shut down or TV studios are shut down, does that hurt your business? No, no, it goes just the opposite, which is, if you're a Star Wars fan, you want to find every single opportunity to engage in Star Wars. And that's why we saw growth of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, growth of our Star Wars online business and continued growth of the catalog of Battlefield 1 -- or Battlefront I and Battlefront II during the quarter. It's -- when you're Star Wars fan, you want Star Wars, and you got to get it somewhere. So that's why we keep coming back to -- this is an incredible opportunity for us. But at the same time, we also understand that we don't -- we can't predict the future. And so we're always careful of trying to predict the future, but we do see a huge opportunity."

Juenger, what I would say there is, it is very rare that we don't get a chance to look at anything that's up for sale. I mean, you can imagine, people call us and say, we're thinking about selling this business or we're thinking about selling ourselves. We are a place that a lot of people want to come as a long-term home if they decide to sell the business. So we get to look at almost everything. I can't comment on any specific acquisition other than what I will tell you is, as we've said, you've seen in the past, where we've done the best is where we have long-term relationships with people and we're really trying to buy great talent versus games. And I think Respawn is a classic example of that. We were able to bring them into the fold, give them incredible support, and it was all driven by the fact that they had incredible talent. It wasn't about Titanfall, that's no offense to Titanfall. It's become an amazing game and we'll maybe see Titanfall at some point, sometime down the road, but it was really about the team. And it starts at the top with Vince but it goes all the way through the whole organization. So we're always looking at that. We'll always continue to look at that. We would hope we can find more. Our hope was that some of the challenges in our broad world economy would actually make people think and understand that being subscale is difficult. But at the same time, as you've seen from our results, I think everybody is going to do well in the next couple of quarters in our industry. And so it might take some time, but trust that we are more interested than ever because we see talent and building great new franchises as critical to the long-term growth of the business."

27963,667280573,2092575,"Electronic Arts Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2020",2020-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Electronic Arts Inc.","Executives","Yes. I mean, I don't know off the top of my head, remember, but I think we were bouncing between high single digits and low double digits, maybe mid-double digits, like between 15% and 20%. I mean, we were having a strong Ultimate Team quarter. If you go",798,"Yes. I mean, I don't know off the top of my head, remember, but I think we were bouncing between high single digits and low double digits, maybe mid-double digits, like between 15% and 20%. I mean, we were having a strong Ultimate Team quarter. If you go to the fourth quarter, if you go back and look at the transcripts, you could probably see it, I just don't have it in front of me. But I mean, this is off the charts different, right? I mean it is exceptional. And particularly for games like Madden, where normally, the soft spot in a game like that, where we really come out of the Super Bowl, and there's only a few places where you can kind of continue to drive engagement on around things like the Draft and the Combine. And you would expect this year, maybe because many of those things were not done in person that might have hurt Ultimate Team. But remember, the team, a couple of years ago, started working on changing and adding new modes to the game and improving, and it really came to play in the past year. So we were seeing super strength in both Madden base game and Madden Ultimate Team coming into the quarter, and it just continued to get stronger and stronger.
I think the other thing is that all the Ultimate Team teams stepped up to think about what new events could they run in a world of stay at home or work from home or whatever it might be. And so they doubled down on social and really drove opportunities in a world in which there was no sports. But as I said in the last question, sports fans were looking for their sports excitement and fix essentially to be able to play. And so you saw that in our esports calendar. As Andrew mentioned, we completely doubled down on esports even though we had to do it all from a virtual broadcasting facility versus our own broadcasting facility. And our team did an amazing job of creating some incredible content. And I'll just give you a personal example. When I see my wife watching a Madden esports tournament and cheering on TV, I know -- because she's a massive sports fan, I know we've hit the right tone with consumers. We're delivering for consumers what they want.
So what we've seen so far, as I mentioned on the call earlier, we saw this peak of massive engagement in the April, May time frame, and that slowly declined as some people have gone back to work or to their offices. But it is still well above what we've normally seen, particularly at this time of the year, which is the slowest time as we move from one sports event to the next. And I can't tell you how that's going to look for the rest of the quarter or for the rest of the year. But remember, we know we've got a lot of new people into the game. A lot of people are engaging in Ultimate Team and the sports franchises. And we don't think that shuts off overnight and maybe never shuts off. And we hope that will give us longer term growth. But that will ultimately be a question when we start talking about next year's guidance and all those things that we normally do. But don't take our conservatism in any way on guidance going forward as saying anything about the games and about engagement, it's all about the economy at the end of the day. And you guys tell me, you saw the GDP numbers this morning. Are you confident the economy is going to be strong for the next 6 to 12 months? I just don't know. That's the thing that weighs on us the most. And yet at the same time, we know that the engagement in our games has never been higher. To see The Sims up 110% year-over-year, I mean, that's driven by a lot of new people and lapse players coming into The Sims. And we know with The Sims, remember, it's grown every year for the last 6 years. That means that people who come in don't churn out. They get engaged and then they continue to engage in all the content that's been produced and the new content. And that's where we get pretty excited.
So sorry, a bigger answer to your question than you probably wanted, but we're -- I want to make sure everyone understands. We are prudent, we are conservative, as you guys all know, and yet at the same time, we are unbelievably optimistic about the business, even though we got here via a really difficult time around the world."

The 7 million is made up of lapsed players, players haven't been with us for a season and some completely new players. What I would tell you is, while it is early, and it is a little bit difficult to predict future behavior on these cohorts at this juncture, they are performing like some of our strongest and most engaged groups in the game. And I think that's testament to the fact that this game does facilitate its connection to friends, in connection to the sport and a live service that sits within that game is now so intrinsic to the experience and a big part of the joy that players get. And what the teams have done through this last quarter is spectacular in terms of their ability to entertain existing players, lapsed returning players and the new players and we're seeing those groups come together and perform in the same way that are traditionally very highly engaged strong play groups have. So we're -- to Blake's point, it's early, it's not easy to predict, but the early signs are very strong and we're very optimistic about what this means for the FIFA community long term."

I mean, we're always assuming that if we bring new players in, we can most likely increase the player base and the future purchases. I would say right now, as you can see, we didn't take our guidance down for the back half of the year. We simply moved FIFA 2 weeks and that's a quarterly change. So I wouldn't take any of that as a message that we have moved or changed our forecast either way. It's just -- it's still too early to say on that. And so more to come, I think by the time we get to our second quarter earnings, we'll have a much better sense of do we think guidance is going to go up or down based on where both FIFA, Madden and Hockey are all -- Hockey and UFC are tracking. But we're very optimistic about all those.
On capital allocation, we paused our program because we felt like at the time, it was -- we didn't pause it. I mean, sorry, we didn't restart a new program because we were at the end of our old program. We felt like it was not the right time to send a message, both externally as well as internally into our company that we were starting a new program until we got through this pandemic and had a little bit of feeling about how things would look in the future. And I think we're closer now. I can't tell you when we would restart a program. There is no doubt that there is a commitment to have a program. It's really a timing issue and it's a timing issue driven by the COVID situation. And I think that's pretty consistent with almost every company out there. There's only a couple of companies that have started new programs in the last quarter. And so that's the answer. There's no change in our thinking. We believe we want to effectively and always be returning capital to shareholders. As you saw, we had the greatest cash flow we've ever had as a company over the last 12 months. We know that we should be returning some of that on a large portion to the shareholders. And so expect you'll hear something from us in the future. I just can't predict exactly when that's going to happen."

And so to Blake's point, I think it's too early to tell what we have seen in our games is continued strong engagement. And we believe that, that's because we are providing, particularly as it relates to FIFA in Europe, that emotional connection to football that was missing. And what we saw is football came back online, at least somewhat in Europe, is that further bolstered that emotional connection to the sport that our FIFA game was able to provide. So too early to tell, but we've seen continued strong engagement even in Europe as they -- as some of those markets have gone back online."

We've cut down our permute time tremendously. We don't travel as much. So we have the opportunity to spend more time with our families. And in some cases, I think we are significantly more productive in a work-from-home environment as it relates to our efficiency levels. At the same time, I think we would all acknowledge that there are other components of work from home that are very challenging. Home schooling is challenging. The mental and emotional well-being can be challenged if you're spending all your time in 1 place. I think as an organization, we've remained committed to our employees. We are providing financial assistance, mental and physical and emotional assistance. We're offering flexibility in work hours wherever possible and offering caregiver leave as members of our employee base think about home schooling or caring for family and loved ones. I think there's a lot of things that we've learned. I don't think we'll ever go back exactly to the way things were. But at the same time, I don't think we would ever move to a place where the entire workforce would work from home. I do believe there is a kinetic energy that come from putting creative people together in a building, at least for some part of the time. And again, we're just a few months into this. As I said in my prepared remarks, we will likely -- in all likelihood and what we've communicated to employers that we'll be -- most of us will be work from home through the rest of this calendar year, at which point we'll reevaluate. And that we are being very open in our dialogue and communication with employees. And to the extent that there are things that we can do to help them through this process or to the extent that there might be longer term changes that we might make, we're opening up that dialogue and having those conversations now. So not much a share at this point in terms of long-term changes other than there will likely be some, but those some probably won't involve the entire workforce staying work from home forever."

Most of our revenue for the quarter was live services. And live services require people to be doing something every single day. We're running events every week. We're developing new characters. We're developing new content. We're changing things. We're managing security, managing monetization. That is as hard as game development is the fact that we have proven in the quarter that we could show live services growth like we have. I mean, Andrew and I, every morning wake up and realize we are unbelievably blessed with an incredible workforce that has figured out how to do this. Because once again as I said earlier, there's no playbook that how do you run live -- how do you run Ultimate Team or Apex from home. No one's ever did that. And it just shows the strength of this organization and the commitment that people have to drive the business in ways that they've never thought they could. And that's pretty powerful. And so for anybody who's over-indexing on us moving FIFA out of the second quarter to third quarter, I just suggest, go back and just think about $1.1 billion in live services in the quarter. That is amazing. And so that's why I think we're trying to send the signal to people is we don't like the fact that we had to get here for the -- via the COVID virus, but we've proven that this is something that's really special.
So with that, I'll end the call and look forward to seeing everyone or talking to everyone in person, maybe someday soon or maybe a year from now, who knows.

First off, I hope that all of you listening today are well and that you and your families are in good health. This is an unprecedented time, and it was an unprecedented first quarter for our business at Electronic Arts, with extraordinary growth in our games and live services and record financial performance. I'll speak to both of those in a moment, but first let me touch on our efforts to continue supporting our teams through the evolving COVID-19 situation.
I'm incredibly proud of our amazing teams at Electronic Arts. The ingenuity, creativity, and determination of all of our talented people is making it possible for us to continue delivering all the great games and content to players, even as almost all of us continue to work from home. The wellbeing of our people is our top priority, and to keep everyone as safe as possible, the vast majority of us at EA will be working from home at least through the remainder of the calendar year. These are challenging times for everyone managing through the pandemic's effect on their personal and professional lives. We're helping however we can with support and resources, including quarterly payments to assist our people with work-from-home costs and care needs, a pandemic care leave program, additional services for mental and physical health, and more.
In addition to the ongoing challenges of the pandemic, these last few months have brought forward important cultural conversations around racial and social injustice, harassment and misconduct. We've long held equality, inclusion and diversity at the center of our beliefs at Electronic Arts, and as a company, we've made our positions clear and demonstrated with our actions that we have a long-term commitment to making a positive impact in our world.
As we've shared previously, our business focus continues to be on our key growth drivers, delivering amazing games and content, offering live services that extend and enhance the experience, and connecting more players across more platforms and ways to play. In our first quarter of FY '21, engagement was exceptionally strong across our portfolio. We launched new games, delivered incredible growth in our live services, and welcomed tens of millions of new players into the EA network since the beginning of April. This drove the biggest first quarter in EA history, with net bookings and operating cash flow both setting new records. As a result, we are raising our full year FY '21 net revenue and net bookings guidance today.
We've seen tremendous growth over the last 4 months in our business and across the industry. As EA, we sit at the intersection of 2 fundamental secular trends that have become increasingly clear. First, social interactions in our world are moving from physical to digital. And second, the consumption of sports and entertainment is moving from linear to interactive. We've seen both of these trends accelerate during the COVID-19 period. Tens of millions of new players have come into our games, and we also have many players returning to our franchises after some time away. In addition to higher engagement from our existing players, these new and returning players are now deeply engaged in our live services, establishing new play patterns and building new friendships in our games. So while there are unknowable aspects to this period of time we are in, and it may be difficult to predict the patterns of new and returning players, we expect these trends to continue during and after the pandemic. We remain committed to continuing to innovate in this space, keeping EA at the forefront of providing social interaction and interactive entertainment to a wide global audience.
I'll share a few highlights here that capture what our teams delivered for players in Q1. We launched 2 new games to players during the quarter. Command & Conquer Remastered, which was incredibly well-received by fans and critics and became a top selling title on Origin and Steam, as well as Burnout Paradise Remastered on the Nintendo Switch. Our teams also delivered over 30 new content updates for our console and PC titles, including two major game expansions, as well as more than 50 updates to our mobile games. All of this, and the continued development of our upcoming titles for FY '21 and beyond, was completed with our teams working from home.
Apex Legends continues its momentum as an exceptional live service, building on strong performance through the last several quarters and bringing even more players together in the game. Q1 saw the most game sessions played and highest revenue total since the launch quarter for Apex, and engagement in Season 5 reached the highest levels since our first new season of content. Creative in-game events continue to be a huge draw for our Apex community, and the most recent event, Lost Treasures, had more than 96 million hours played in the first 2 weeks. We're bringing Apex to players on the Switch and Steam, and we're excited to introduce cross-play later this year so more players can engage and play together with their friends.
The world has an insatiable appetite for sports, and for the experiences that EA SPORTS delivers in our games. With real world sports disrupted, EA SPORTS has become the center of the emotional connection to sports, and we've brought millions of new, returning and existing players into their own personal sports stories through our games.
Player acquisition of new and returning players in FIFA grew more than 100% year-over-year in Q1, with more than 7 million joining during the quarter. There are now -- these are now among our most engaged groups of players, demonstrating commitment and longevity in our FIFA live service. FIFA in Asia grew significantly year-over-year in Q1 as well, with FIFA Online 4 now engaging nearly 30 million players to date.
Madden NFL 20 also had an incredible Q1, building on what is already the biggest year ever for our Madden franchise. Player acquisition in Madden NFL grew nearly 140% year-over-year in Q1, and virtually every measure of Madden Ultimate Team engagement is up more than double over last year.
The Sims continues to resonate with more players around the world. The Sims 4 now has more than 30 million players life-to-date across all platforms, and daily, weekly and monthly active player totals in the game all reached record highs for a first quarter. Our Sims mobile games had an excellent Q1 as well. The creative and inclusive nature of The Sims experience on any device is truly unique in all of gaming, and we're especially proud of the way it helps players find community and express themselves during culturally challenging times.
During Q1, we also launched nearly 30 titles on the Steam platform. Bringing our games to Steam enables us to substantially grow our PC audience. Our Origin business grew 75% year-over-year as well, and by opening up the ability for Steam and Origin players to play together, we're now positioned to harness the full power of the PC community. Bringing titles to Steam is also foundational to our EA subscription service that will go live on the platform later this summer. In addition, the total number of players in our subscriptions on Origin, Xbox One and PS4 grew quarter-over-quarter, with new players coming into our services to experience more great games.
It was an unprecedented quarter of growth. Looking forward, we're also seeing strong engagement in Q2. Although it is difficult to predict ongoing levels of growth in this environment, we have grown our player base during this period and added value to our network. Our EA SPORTS live services are acting as social networks for sports fans around the world, and the strength of those connections will grow as real sports seasons return. Players in our communities for The Sims, Apex, Star Wars and more are building relationships through our games, and we expect them to be with us for a long time to come.
Building on this strength, we have exciting new titles and content coming in Q2 and beyond, including Rocket Arena which we just launched with Final Strike Games. We showcased many of these new experiences in our EA Play Live broadcast in June, where our audience grew significantly year-over-year, and the trailers and videos that we debuted have been watched more than 31 million times. We will begin launching our new EA SPORTS games starting in August. Nowhere else in the world can sports fans find the breadth and depth of interactive experiences like the ones in our EA SPORTS portfolio this year. With UFC 4 launching on August 14, we've got something for every fight fan, an amazing roster of fighters, tremendous customization, brand new environments, and more fluid gameplay, all making this the most authentic MMA game we've ever created.
Madden NFL 21 is then set to launch on August 28. On top of major gameplay innovation, a new campaign mode, and more of the Superstar X-Factor abilities that fans love, we're bringing creative and innovative new ways to play Madden that build on the strength of our NFL partnership.
We have more people than ever before playing and connecting through FIFA, and when FIFA 21 launches on October 9, the world's leading football experience will expand with more ways to play with friends. VOLTA SQUADS and FUT Co-Op will bring new social dimensions to the game, and we're also delivering the most comprehensive update to Career Mode that we've ever released.
NHL 21 launches October 16, and we're excited about the great work from our NHL team this year and we'll share more about that soon. Then in the holiday season, EA SPORTS will also lead the way on the new PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. Next-generation versions of FIFA 21 and Madden 21 will bring the next level of innovation and interactive sports experiences to fans with the launch of the new consoles. This will be a great year of new games and content for sports fans around the world.
With our cloud-based broadcasting platform for esports operating at global scale, we delivered 85% more esports broadcast content in the last 4 months than we did in all of calendar year 2019. Demand for our FIFA, Apex Legends and Madden esports content across major networks is unprecedented. And the great entertainment we are providing is bringing more players and viewers into new experiences with our games. We're now significantly expanding and diversifying our content for the rest of this year. Our plans are to deliver 3x as many broadcasted events in FY '21 over last year, spanning linear and digital broadcasts, with more athlete, celebrity and fan competitions, in addition to global esports ecosystems for Apex Legends, FIFA and Madden.
We also just launched The Sims Spark'd on TBS and Buzzfeed, our first-ever reality competition TV show. Seamlessly integrating entertaining player stories and gameplay, alongside weekly challenges for the Sims 4 players, it's an entirely new and unique way to create competition. It shows the innovation we can bring to the esports space with our franchises, and we're very excited by the fan reaction to date.
We're also very pleased with the response to our new Star Wars: Squadrons game from Motive Studios set to launch on October 2. This is going to be the game for anyone that's ever had the fantasy of piloting a Star Wars starfighter, with a deep level of immersion built by our teams in collaboration with Disney and Lucasfilm. We're excited to add another all-new experience to the portfolio of amazing Star Wars titles we've delivered to fans, especially one that opens up new dimensions like full VR support and cross-play.
Our business is strong and it's been an amazing start to the year. These are challenging times amidst the pandemic, and we are deeply appreciative of all that our teams are doing to continually innovate and deliver for our players and push the boundaries of interactive entertainment every step of the way even while working from home. We also have to thank all of our players for their support. We're humbled to see so many using our games and our network as a way to connect with their friends and families during this time. There is much more to come from us at Electronic Arts in FY '21.
Now I'll hand the call over to Blake."
27963,667280573,2092861,"Electronic Arts Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2020",2020-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Electronic Arts Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Andrew.

We saw extraordinary levels of player engagement through the first quarter, far higher than we even ever expected or had forecasted in May. And it proved more resilient than we had expected. Engagement was broad-based, with net bookings for live services at extraordinary levels for FIFA, Madden, Apex Legends, The Sims and our mobile titles. And with increased sales of our games across the breadth of our entire catalog, we connected with more people to the games they want and to each other. All this was reflected in our results, with record Q1 highs in net revenue, net bookings, live services and cash flow.
I'll report the specifics of our results on a GAAP basis, then use our operational measures of net bookings to discuss the dynamics of our business. Before I get to the numbers, let me remind everyone of the 3 reporting changes we implemented this quarter and discussed in our last quarter call. First, we now present GAAP net revenues in the income statement as one item, rather than as product and service. Second, we report mobile bookings gross of platform fees, instead of net. And finally, we updated the presentation of net bookings by composition to focus on full game and live services sales. Our historical results have been recast for comparability.
EA's net revenue was $1.46 billion compared to $1.21 billion a year ago, and above our guidance by $239 million. Operating expenses were $700 million compared to $607 million a year ago. This was above our expectations, driven by variable compensation due to our strong performance in the quarter, as well as COVID-related costs and lower attrition. Operating income was $471 million compared to $415 million a year ago and above our expectations. Diluted earnings per share was $1.25 as well above our expectations of $0.93, driven by the topline beat. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $378 million, up $220 million from last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $38 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $340 million. Operating cash flow for the last 12 months was $2.02 billion, a new record. See our earnings slides for further cash flow information. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $5.96 billion, up 15% year-on-year.
Now, I'd like to turn to the key drivers of our business this quarter. Net bookings for the quarter were $1.39 billion, up $608 million from the prior year, and $390 million above our guidance, driven by strength across the board, with strong performance from our core franchises and live services. The currency headwind net of hedges was $42 million year-on-year. Live services and other net bookings were $1.103 billion, up $416 million from the prior year. This extraordinary result is a consequence of the years of work we've invested in building teams, processes and content for our titles, which delivered strength across our portfolio. FIFA, Madden, Apex Legends, and The Sims all grew very strongly. Ultimate Team was up 70% on a like-for-like basis, adjusting for the timing of Ultimate Team events, for the extra week in the quarter, and for currency. With Lost Treasures, Apex Legends presented its most engaging event ever, and delivered its biggest season since launch. And, as Andrew mentioned, The Sims 4 exceeded 30 million users life-to-date, and Q1 net bookings more than doubled year on year. Mobile was up 32%, with success across our portfolio led by Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, which had the best quarter since 2018. The game has now generated over $1 billion in lifetime bookings. FIFA Mobile, SimCity, The Sims Free Play and more showed growth of a similar magnitude.
Full game net bookings were $287 million, up $192 million from the prior year. 52% of our unit sales are now digital rather than physical, measured on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 over the last 12 months. Net bookings for packaged goods and for the full-game digital downloads almost tripled. This was primarily driven by our deep catalog.
A brief note on financial reporting before we go on to guidance. People are playing our games for longer as a result of the amazing content provided on our live services teams and the social connections they make within our games. So for GAAP reporting, we're increasing the period of time over which we recognize the portion of our net revenue. This begins in our second quarter, only affects GAAP revenue, and only affects the timing of recognition, not total net revenue. We estimate that it will move the recognition of approximately $300 million in GAAP net revenue from fiscal 2021 into fiscal 2022. It does not affect net bookings or operating cash flow.
Now, turning to guidance. Due to the significant outperformance during the quarter, we are increasing both our net revenue and net bookings guidance for the full year. In doing so, we had to balance the significant boost we saw in Q1 and the confidence we have in our games and live services against the unknowable macroeconomic environment for the rest of the fiscal year. We are taking a cautious view that assumes that we will continue to see a modest tailwind to engagement, driven in part by continued shelter-in-place orders. This is offset by a weaker economy or could be weaker economies around the world and the slightly later sports launches. There are reasons for optimism. For example, we've added tens of millions of players to the EA Player Network since the beginning of April. As Andrew mentioned, FIFA alone attracted 7 million new players on console in the last quarter, and more people are playing FIFA now at this time in -- than any previous cycle. This is significant, in that people have played the game recently are more likely to buy the new one. New players are building networks of friends in our games as they play. Engagement in FIFA and Madden continue to be massively above where we would normally expect them to be. Nevertheless, we haven't launched a major title since the pandemic struck, so it's too early to draw general conclusions.
Our business is strong and our games are on track. Hopefully, our base case around the uncertain economic will prove to be too cautious. Thus, our expectations for full-year GAAP revenue are now $5.625 billion, cost of revenue to be $1.483 billion, and earnings per share of $2.97. We are raising our operating cash flow guidance by $275 million to $1.85 billion. We continue to anticipate capital expenditures of around $125 million, which would deliver free cash flow of $1.725 billion.
A note on OpEx before moving onto the business drivers. The increase from our prior guidance is mainly driven by variable compensation plus higher-than-expected headcount, due to lower turnover during this difficult period. We're continuing to invest in our growth drivers, and, in particular, we're increasing the number of mobile titles we have in development. We now expect net bookings for the year to be $5.950 billion, $400 million above our prior guidance. Versus last year, this factors in an FX headwind of about $100 million. And, as you build your model, note that we are also forecasting a fall in interest rates of about $80 million compared to last year as we mentioned in our last quarterly earnings call.
For the second quarter, we now expect GAAP net revenue of $1.125 billion, cost of revenue to be $280 million, and operating expenses of $755 million. This results in earnings per share of $0.21 for the second quarter. We anticipate net bookings for the second quarter to be $875 million. The significant year-on-year variance is driven by the move of FIFA 21 from Q2 to Q3, and by the later launch of Madden NFL 21 in Q2, which we have previously announced. The change in mix for Q2 weighs on gross margin for the quarter. Madden stays in Q2, but has less live services opportunity than in prior years by virtue of starting later, and FIFA moves to the beginning of Q3.
With regard to live services, remember that we're focused on engagement ahead of new product launches, so expect lower bookings at that point of the cycle. See the phasing that we provide in our quarterly presentations on our IR website. You'll see that the smaller Q2 is more than offset by a much larger Q3, and a slightly larger Q4.
As we approach 6 months working from home, we are finding ways to continue to deliver great games and services. We're excited to showcase the incredible efforts of our Madden and FIFA, NHL and UFC teams have done through the upcoming -- as they lead into the upcoming launches, and by the work of all of our live services teams. The shelter-in-place orders have so far been a strong tailwind for our business, as players look for safe and social entertainment in these difficult times. A macroeconomic headwind in the second half seems very likely. Nevertheless, our ability to deliver high quality AAA and indie titles for our players, combined with the incredible success of our ongoing live services and increased reach across platforms and geographies enables us to continue to deliver for players and investors.
Now I'll turn the call back to Andrew."

It was an extraordinary quarter for games and for Electronic Arts. Our business is strong. We've just had the largest first quarter in the history of the company, with tremendous engagement from existing, new and returning players. We are well positioned to build on that strength. We will continue to deliver more amazing games and content, including new EA SPORTS titles, more groundbreaking fun esports content, Star Wars: Squadrons launching in October, and more. We'll continue to extend and enhance the experiences in our live services on all platforms, from console to PC to mobile. And our focus on connecting more players across more platforms will continue, as we bring our subscription to Steam, integrate our games with Stadia, expand support for cross-play, and reach more platforms with our games, including the next-gen consoles coming later this year. It's also increasingly apparent that COVID-19 could be with us for some time. Keeping all of our teams safe is our first priority. They are the true strength of Electronic Arts, and their commitment and courage during the challenges of recent months has been deeply inspiring. Not only have they continued to develop and launch games from home. Our employees have supported nearly 1,000 different charities in the last 3 months, including tens of thousands of hours of volunteer time. Their contributions to COVID relief efforts and racial justice organizations, along with matching funds and additional contributions from EA, have totaled more than $3 million to date. In this environment, supporting our teams, building our culture, and striving to amplify the positive impacts of play in our communities around the world has never been more important. We look forward to sharing more updates with you in the quarters ahead. Be well and stay healthy.

It's a good question, and I appreciate you asking. The entire delta is FIFA. Nothing else is going on. As we've tried to be pretty clear about that, I don't think people have necessarily heard that, but that's the entire delta. We've also not changed",705,"Yes. It's a good question, and I appreciate you asking. The entire delta is FIFA. Nothing else is going on. As we've tried to be pretty clear about that, I don't think people have necessarily heard that, but that's the entire delta. We've also not changed the back half of the year guidance down. So you should assume we are planning and we will make up anything we might have missed during the quarter or the 2 quarters.
The other thing I would just want to remind people is that it's all event -- Ultimate Team's all event-driven. That means that there may be some events that roll into next year, which actually strengthen next year as well as this year. We made a simple decision, which is we wanted to give both the FIFA and Madden team a couple of extra weeks to final and what has been the most difficult situation we've ever lived through, which is building games from home. We are incredibly impressed with what they've been able to do and how they've been able to innovate the game within this context. And so our view is -- our hope is that most investors aren't focused on each quarter, they're focused on the full year. We just raised guidance by $400 million. And I remind people in the history of both Andrew and I running the company, we have only raised guidance in the first quarter once. So you guys all know our conservative approach and how we're always cautious.
We also mentioned today that we know there is and if we went after things that is not economic risk in the back half of the year, I'd like to know that, but we all know there's economic risk. And so I think I would take our raising of guidance and not lowering guidance in the back half of the year even after moving FIFA and Madden is a pretty positive signal. And I think Andrew and I both mentioned in the call, the other thing, which was we are continuing to see engagement and monetization levels higher than we've normally seen during the -- where we currently are in the second quarter. And I'm not telling you that, that's going to change the second quarter or we would have changed guidance because we just don't know yet. But remember, the unbelievably high monetization we saw in Q1 does not drop off a cliff. It will slowly decline as we all go back to a normal life. But if you ask many of us, that might be 6 months, 9 months or 2 years.
And what we also mentioned, which I think is the most important component is as people rejoin or join as a new member of a social network around the game, they tend not to leave. And so this should ultimately long-term benefit our business. And it's just -- the problem for us is we've never lived through this before, and none of us have, you guys haven't either. And so we don't have a road map to be able to help us, be able to predict exactly what it's going to look like. And so we're trying to be transparent. We're trying to be straightforward. And we're trying to be optimistic because we are optimistic, but we're also trying to be realistic that we know that there's economic strains out there around the world that could ultimately come back to impact our business or anybody's business.
So sorry to go on about the question, but I think we want to try and make sure we're -- people are understanding that it's both FIFA and -- Madden and FIFA Ultimate Team that are moving. But other than that, we're not signaling anything else other than we made a decision. And we made it some time ago because we announced it some time ago. So we wanted to give the teams a few extra weeks to make sure that the product was exceptional when it came out the door, and we're confident that that's what it's going to be.
Now your second question, sorry, I went on too long in the first question. So I forgot your second question."

And I guess I'll have Andrew just sort of help out on this as well because it's important to hear from both of us. I mean we always look at the games, and we want to make sure we are providing the greatest value for our players. And games all have different scale. And most of our games right now have huge scale. We designed this game to really focus on what we heard from consumers, which is one of their greatest fantasies and that's to be able to fly a X-wing fighter or a TIE fighter and be in a dog fight. And so it doesn't have the breadth of some of our games, but it is still an incredible game. And so that's why we chose to price it at a slightly lower level to also allow access to as many people as possible who had that Star Wars fantasy. I'll let Andrew jump in and talk about how we view pricing long term. But I think you've seen us over the years differentiate pricing on lots of games. We've differentiated pricing on things like Plants vs Zombies games because we knew that they were skewed to younger audiences, for example, or maybe didn't have the depth of all of the game modes that you might see in an Ultimate or a FIFA or a Madden. Andrew, do you want to add to that?"

I would start with what are the player motivations we're trying to fulfill and what are the expectations of those player groups in fulfillment of those motivations. And I think that we start there long before we ever get to price points. And as you've seen from us, we have games across the spectrum of pricing, whether that's free-to-play or at $60 or at $60 with an additional live service or as part of our subscription offerings. And at the end of the day, as we think about it, we start with a player, we start with the motivations and expectations that they have, and we build out the game. In this case, this is a very deep and immersive game and that $40 felt like the right price points, given the breadth of the game. Very proud of what we're doing. We wanted it to be a wholly self-contained experience that was deeply emerging in that fantasy.
As we think about pricing more broadly, I would come back to that position, which is we start with what are the player motivations we're trying to fulfill, what are the expectations that players have around depth and breadth and live service in any given experience, and we build from there. As we think about this year, you've seen what we've done as we've announced that we will offer the ability for players to transition free of charge from existing generation of console titles to the next-generation of console titles for FIFA and Madden. We did that and we set out to build the best PlayStation 4, Xbox One experience as we could as well as the most innovative and creative experiences for Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5. And what we wanted for our players this year because what they asked for was the smoothest possible transition that meant that they could jump into the game when it launched on existing platforms and then move into the next platform as it made sense for them later on in the year. And that has been our focus this year. And we will continue to kind of look at this over time."

Can I ask, if you don't mind, just thinking through the changes in real estates and the sports titles. I know that was probably a production driven decision. But when we're looking at the real-live physical sports leagues around the world, especially in the states, obviously there's a lot of uncertainty about the timing and shape of their seasons this year and next. And just wondering how that maps to the release of your games and the events in the live services and how much it matters. For instance, if there was no NFL season in the fall or if it had to be stopped in the halfway through, how does that matter to your games, how should we think about that? I know it's sort of a broad hypothetical, but there's so much uncertainty there. So I guess the underlying question is how much does whatever happens as live sports affect how we should think about and expect people to engage with and spend money in your games? And I have a follow-up."

One is, my sense is that we will have sports of some shape or form in the real-world over time. The second thing is regardless of whether we do or we don't, sports fans have an insatiable appetite for sports day in, day out, week in, week out, month in, month out. And what you heard us talk about in the prepared remarks and what you have seen in Q1 is we've been able to fulfill that insatiable appetite for sports with our games. And there's really -- when we think about our sports games, we think about it on 2 vectors. One is the connection, the emotional connection to real world of sports and all that's happening with the players and teams and the leagues that you love. The other is we provide you a tool set that features those players, teams and the leagues that you love, but allows you to tell your own personal sports stories. And what you saw from us this past quarter is we really leaned into that. And we actually augmented that some. So while we provided opportunities and events so that you might tell your own personal sports stories with your friends and your rivals, we also dropped in about additional esports content, celebrity content and esports and celebrity competitions. And what we've seen is that we've been able to uphold and fulfill the motivations of sports fans and the needs of sports fans and allow them to remain connected to the sports they love. And I would tell you, I think that we are comfortable doing that for as long as it needs to. And then to the extent that sports come back online, we believe that's a further accelerator to our business."

And what I said in the remarks was Ultimate Team in the quarter was up 70%. I don't think we've ever seen a growth like that. And as part of that, we know, for example, Madden Ultimate Team was up over 300%. And there was no sports -- live sports going on at any point in the time during that quarter. And I think Andrew made the point, and I would just stress this as when people are sports fans, remember they are sports fans connected to a social network. No one plays a fantasy sport game alone. No one plays Ultimate Team alone. They play with each other. And that means that it builds off of the social network more than anything else. And so in the absence of sports, people double down and are excited. And so while we always want live sports to go on because it helps feed the engagement and excitement around the business. We also know sports fans are not going to stop being sports fans if the underlying sports stops. And I think the first quarter proves that better than anything we've ever seen. And so we hope sports is back because we all love sports, and we want to engage in it. I'd prefer not to watch sports with an empty stadium. But at the end of the day, it's better than no sports at all. And our games allow people that continued engagement with something that they really love. And I would tell you, that extends well beyond sports, right? I mean, you might ask, well, if there's no Star Wars content in the next 6 months because movie studios are shut down or TV studios are shut down, does that hurt your business? No, no, it goes just the opposite, which is, if you're a Star Wars fan, you want to find every single opportunity to engage in Star Wars. And that's why we saw growth of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, growth of our Star Wars online business and continued growth of the catalog of Battlefield 1 -- or Battlefront I and Battlefront II during the quarter. It's -- when you're Star Wars fan, you want Star Wars, and you got to get it somewhere. So that's why we keep coming back to -- this is an incredible opportunity for us. But at the same time, we also understand that we don't -- we can't predict the future. And so we're always careful of trying to predict the future, but we do see a huge opportunity."

Juenger, what I would say there is, it is very rare that we don't get a chance to look at anything that's up for sale. I mean, you can imagine, people call us and say, we're thinking about selling this business or we're thinking about selling ourselves. We are a place that a lot of people want to come as a long-term home if they decide to sell the business. So we get to look at almost everything. I can't comment on any specific acquisition other than what I will tell you is, as we've said, you've seen in the past, where we've done the best is where we have long-term relationships with people and we're really trying to buy great talent versus games. And I think Respawn is a classic example of that. We were able to bring them into the fold, give them incredible support, and it was all driven by the fact that they had incredible talent. It wasn't about Titanfall, that's no offense to Titanfall. It's become an amazing game and we'll maybe see Titanfall at some point, sometime down the road, but it was really about the team. And it starts at the top with Vince but it goes all the way through the whole organization. So we're always looking at that. We'll always continue to look at that. We would hope we can find more. Our hope was that some of the challenges in our broad world economy would actually make people think and understand that being subscale is difficult. But at the same time, as you've seen from our results, I think everybody is going to do well in the next couple of quarters in our industry. And so it might take some time, but trust that we are more interested than ever because we see talent and building great new franchises as critical to the long-term growth of the business."

I mean, I don't know off the top of my head, remember, but I think we were bouncing between high single digits and low double digits, maybe mid-double digits, like between 15% and 20%. I mean, we were having a strong Ultimate Team quarter. If you go",798,"Yes. I mean, I don't know off the top of my head, remember, but I think we were bouncing between high single digits and low double digits, maybe mid-double digits, like between 15% and 20%. I mean, we were having a strong Ultimate Team quarter. If you go to the fourth quarter, if you go back and look at the transcripts, you could probably see it, I just don't have it in front of me. But I mean, this is off the charts different, right? I mean it is exceptional. And particularly for games like Madden, where normally, the soft spot in a game like that, where we really come out of the Super Bowl, and there's only a few places where you can kind of continue to drive engagement on around things like the Draft and the Combine. And you would expect this year, maybe because many of those things were not done in person that might have hurt Ultimate Team. But remember, the team, a couple of years ago, started working on changing and adding new modes to the game and improving, and it really came to play in the past year. So we were seeing super strength in both Madden base game and Madden Ultimate Team coming into the quarter, and it just continued to get stronger and stronger.
I think the other thing is that all the Ultimate Team teams stepped up to think about what new events could they run in a world of stay at home or work from home or whatever it might be. And so they doubled down on social and really drove opportunities in a world in which there was no sports. But as I said in the last question, sports fans were looking for their sports excitement and fix essentially to be able to play. And so you saw that in our esports calendar. As Andrew mentioned, we completely doubled down on esports even though we had to do it all from a virtual broadcasting facility versus our own broadcasting facility. And our team did an amazing job of creating some incredible content. And I'll just give you a personal example. When I see my wife watching a Madden esports tournament and cheering on TV, I know -- because she's a massive sports fan, I know we've hit the right tone with consumers. We're delivering for consumers what they want.
So what we've seen so far, as I mentioned on the call earlier, we saw this peak of massive engagement in the April, May time frame, and that slowly declined as some people have gone back to work or to their offices. But it is still well above what we've normally seen, particularly at this time of the year, which is the slowest time as we move from one sports event to the next. And I can't tell you how that's going to look for the rest of the quarter or for the rest of the year. But remember, we know we've got a lot of new people into the game. A lot of people are engaging in Ultimate Team and the sports franchises. And we don't think that shuts off overnight and maybe never shuts off. And we hope that will give us longer term growth. But that will ultimately be a question when we start talking about next year's guidance and all those things that we normally do. But don't take our conservatism in any way on guidance going forward as saying anything about the games and about engagement, it's all about the economy at the end of the day. And you guys tell me, you saw the GDP numbers this morning. Are you confident the economy is going to be strong for the next 6 to 12 months? I just don't know. That's the thing that weighs on us the most. And yet at the same time, we know that the engagement in our games has never been higher. To see The Sims up 110% year-over-year, I mean, that's driven by a lot of new people and lapse players coming into The Sims. And we know with The Sims, remember, it's grown every year for the last 6 years. That means that people who come in don't churn out. They get engaged and then they continue to engage in all the content that's been produced and the new content. And that's where we get pretty excited.
So sorry, a bigger answer to your question than you probably wanted, but we're -- I want to make sure everyone understands. We are prudent, we are conservative, as you guys all know, and yet at the same time, we are unbelievably optimistic about the business, even though we got here via a really difficult time around the world."

What I would tell you is, while it is early, and it is a little bit difficult to predict future behavior on these cohorts at this juncture, they are performing like some of our strongest and most engaged groups in the game. And I think that's testament to the fact that this game does facilitate its connection to friends, in connection to the sport and a live service that sits within that game is now so intrinsic to the experience and a big part of the joy that players get. And what the teams have done through this last quarter is spectacular in terms of their ability to entertain existing players, lapsed returning players and the new players and we're seeing those groups come together and perform in the same way that are traditionally very highly engaged strong play groups have. So we're -- to Blake's point, it's early, it's not easy to predict, but the early signs are very strong and we're very optimistic about what this means for the FIFA community long term."

I mean, we're always assuming that if we bring new players in, we can most likely increase the player base and the future purchases. I would say right now, as you can see, we didn't take our guidance down for the back half of the year. We simply moved FIFA 2 weeks and that's a quarterly change. So I wouldn't take any of that as a message that we have moved or changed our forecast either way. It's just -- it's still too early to say on that. And so more to come, I think by the time we get to our second quarter earnings, we'll have a much better sense of do we think guidance is going to go up or down based on where both FIFA, Madden and Hockey are all -- Hockey and UFC are tracking. But we're very optimistic about all those.
On capital allocation, we paused our program because we felt like at the time, it was -- we didn't pause it. I mean, sorry, we didn't restart a new program because we were at the end of our old program. We felt like it was not the right time to send a message, both externally as well as internally into our company that we were starting a new program until we got through this pandemic and had a little bit of feeling about how things would look in the future. And I think we're closer now. I can't tell you when we would restart a program. There is no doubt that there is a commitment to have a program. It's really a timing issue and it's a timing issue driven by the COVID situation. And I think that's pretty consistent with almost every company out there. There's only a couple of companies that have started new programs in the last quarter. And so that's the answer. There's no change in our thinking. We believe we want to effectively and always be returning capital to shareholders. As you saw, we had the greatest cash flow we've ever had as a company over the last 12 months. We know that we should be returning some of that on a large portion to the shareholders. And so expect you'll hear something from us in the future.

And we believe that, that's because we are providing, particularly as it relates to FIFA in Europe, that emotional connection to football that was missing.

We've cut down our permute time tremendously. We don't travel as much. So we have the opportunity to spend more time with our families. And in some cases, I think we are significantly more productive in a work-from-home environment as it relates to our efficiency levels. At the same time, I think we would all acknowledge that there are other components of work from home that are very challenging. Home schooling is challenging. The mental and emotional well-being can be challenged if you're spending all your time in 1 place. I think as an organization, we've remained committed to our employees. We are providing financial assistance, mental and physical and emotional assistance. We're offering flexibility in work hours wherever possible and offering caregiver leave as members of our employee base think about home schooling or caring for family and loved ones. I think there's a lot of things that we've learned. I don't think we'll ever go back exactly to the way things were. But at the same time, I don't think we would ever move to a place where the entire workforce would work from home. I do believe there is a kinetic energy that come from putting creative people together in a building, at least for some part of the time. And again, we're just a few months into this. As I said in my prepared remarks, we will likely -- in all likelihood and what we've communicated to employers that we'll be -- most of us will be work from home through the rest of this calendar year, at which point we'll reevaluate. And that we are being very open in our dialogue and communication with employees. And to the extent that there are things that we can do to help them through this process or to the extent that there might be longer term changes that we might make, we're opening up that dialogue and having those conversations now.

Most of our revenue for the quarter was live services. And live services require people to be doing something every single day. We're running events every week. We're developing new characters. We're developing new content. We're changing things. We're managing security, managing monetization. That is as hard as game development is the fact that we have proven in the quarter that we could show live services growth like we have. I mean, Andrew and I, every morning wake up and realize we are unbelievably blessed with an incredible workforce that has figured out how to do this. Because once again as I said earlier, there's no playbook that how do you run live -- how do you run Ultimate Team or Apex from home. No one's ever did that. And it just shows the strength of this organization and the commitment that people have to drive the business in ways that they've never thought they could. And that's pretty powerful. And so for anybody who's over-indexing on us moving FIFA out of the second quarter to third quarter, I just suggest, go back and just think about $1.1 billion in live services in the quarter. That is amazing. And so that's why I think we're trying to send the signal to people is we don't like the fact that we had to get here for the -- via the COVID virus, but we've proven that this is something that's really special.

I hope this find everyone well and staying healthy amidst the ongoing pandemic. After the biggest first quarter in the history of Electronic Arts, our second quarter of FY '21 showed continued strength with net revenue and earnings above our guidance. We are driving growth through the breadth, depth and quality of our new games, our industry-leading live services and expansion to more platforms and more waste to play. Let me first say how thankful I am to our teams for their incredible work and everything they are delivering for our players. The well-being of our people remains our top priority. Even amidst these unprecedented circumstances, we are executing and building great strength across our business. 
Here are a few key examples. We delivered 8 new games so far this year, and our network has grown to more than 330 million unique accounts as tens of millions of new players have joined to enjoy more of our amazing games and content. EA Sports continues to be a leader in sports interactive entertainment. Madden NFL 20 was the most successful game in franchise history last year and now Madden NFL 21 already has nearly 30% more players year-over-year from launch. Our FIFA franchise is engaging more than 100 million players globally. Even prior to launching FIFA 21, our FIFA franchise is having the biggest calendar year ever with our business across all platforms, up 26% year-over-year in net bookings. FIFA 20 has reached nearly 35 million players on console and PC. FIFA Mobile continues to perform well and fee for online Asia broke engagement records across China and Korea in Q2. We just launched FIFA Mobile in Japan in October as we continue to see significant international expansion opportunities for our FIFA franchise. We continue to have an outstanding relationship with Disney and Lucasfilm. Star Wars Quadrants launched a great feedback from critics and the community and has performed above our expectations. This is clearly a special game for fans and continues the extraordinary success we've had bringing great games to life with this IP, including Star Wars, Gears of War, Star Wars Galaxy Heroes, Star Wars: The old Republic and the Star Wars Battlefront Franchise. Our live services are among the most successful in the industry, and our live services net bookings have grown more than 28% fiscal year-over-year to date. EA Board's ultimate team has more than 30 million players so far this year, up 25% year-over-year. Around the world, our multi-platform Sims community continues to grow, and our Sims 4 player base on PC and console is now the largest in franchise history. Apex Legends has established itself as a top global franchise with major year-over-year growth and continued expansion opportunities. Apex in Asia is having great success with each season of content. We've just launched a game to massive steam community and cross play is now live, making it easier for people to play with friends around the world. Our esports programs are scaling a new record in viewership also. Our new Madden NFL episodic content featuring NFL athletes, celebrities and top Madden NFL players is bringing great entertainment to a much wider audience. And our recent FIFA 21 challenge, which paired esports stars with celebrity succulents with our most watch esports event to date with viewership that place it amongst top esports broadcast worldwide. Our EA Play service is the most successful multi-platform subscription in the industry. With the addition of our subscription on PS4 and steam, we've reached more than 6.5 million paid subscribers. EA play is now set to go live on Microsoft Game pass in a few days, and we believe we have the opportunity to double our subscriber base over the next 12 months. 
In addition to our subscription, we launched more than 125 games and content packs on steam this year, with new tiles like CNC remastered and Star Wars Squadrons leading the download chat on the platform. Bringing our games to steam is a new and additive business for us. With the EA and steam communities able to play together, we're able to harness the full opportunity in the PC space as it continues to show strong growth. We can easily use the industry as the only developer and publisher with the ability to bring this much quality content to players. We've done this through unprecedented circumstances in the last 6 months, and now we're delivering more great experiences in our current quarter. 
We started our third quarter by launching 2 new EA Sports Games. When it went live globally on October 9, FIFA 21 already had a record number of plays in the game through the early access benefit of our subscription. Our player metrics in FIFA 21 are strong, and FIFA Ultimate team also continues to grow with matches in the mode up 30% year-over-year. NHL 21, which includes the fan favorite NHL 94 rebind has quickly become the most successful NHL game yet on current gen consoles. The Sims 4 and Apex Legends show how we build great live services into strong ongoing businesses. This quarter, we'll launch our tenth expansion pack for the Sims 4, along with an important game update to add even more cultural customization options for our players. On the heels of our highly successful season 6 we've just launched Season 7 in Apex Legends, which is said to be our biggest season of content this year. We now have more than top 20 live services across console, PC and mobile, forming a foundation for continued growth. 
We will continue to reach more players across more platforms in Q3. We have more tilers launching on Switch and Google study this quarter. Medal of Honors Above and Beyond will launch on oculus VR in December, our second VR experience this year. And as I mentioned before, we will take another step in our subscription strategy this week with our expansion to Microsoft Game pass, opening significant new opportunities to grow our subscriber base. This quarter also brings the launch of next-generation consoles from our partners at Microsoft and Sony. EA Sports is always at the center of innovation for us, and it will lead the way on next-gen consoles. FIFA 21 for PS5 and Xbox Series X will leverage the major upgrading technology to bring players on presented immersion, innovative gameplay and minimal load times to put them into the action in under 2 seconds. Madden NFL 21 for the next-gen consoles will blur the lines with sport even further through a new system that is responsive to the way NFL players perform in the real world. We're excited to have an opportunity to bring even more players into our FIFA and Madden franchises this year, and we're providing a smooth transition for players on corn gen consoles to move over with a next-gen upgrade. 
Looking ahead, I want to offer a few thoughts on our growth drivers for FY '22 and beyond. Each previous console generation has grown in the global market, and we expect this transition will be the same. We plan to launch at least 6 new games on the next-gen consoles in FY '22. These will include a new need for speed game that is being some astounding visual leaps developed by the criterion team who have launched some of the most highly rated games in franchise history. Dice is creating our next battlefield game with never before seen scale. The technical advancements of the new consoles are allowing the team to deliver a true next-gen vision for the franchise. We have hands on play testing underway internally, and the team has been getting very positive feedback on the game as we've begun to engage our community. The next Battlefield is set to launch in Holiday 2021, we're excited to share a lot more about the game in the spring. Our live services are positioned to be a long-term growth driver. Having built Apex Legends into an amazing live service with a deeply engaged community, the talented respond team in Los Angeles has expanded Apex development to include a full team in our Vancouver location so that we can continue delivering more great content. 
Japan is now our second largest market for Apex Legends, and we have strong plans to continue growth in that region. In addition, Apex Mobile development will be complete in the new year and ready for launch in FY '22. We also expect another very strong year for the Sims 4, a testament to the strength of that community as it enters the seventh year of live service. EA Sports will be executing on a significant expansion that will span new games, more geographies and more ways to engage. Deter is growing. In addition to FIFA 21 on next-gen this year and steady in the new year, which accessed our FIFA online for free-to-play game in Asia now leads us to expand that game to new markets, including the Middle East and Eastern Europe. Soccer continues to grow on popularity around the world, and we now have 6 new soccer mobile games in development for new genres and new markets. Our roster of top soccer league licenses is also unmatched. Our recently extended agreements with the Bundesliga and La Liga in addition to more than 30 other league partners, including UEFA Champions League Cable and the premier league, enable us to continue delivering this franchise to more players around the world with the authenticity they expect. We also just announced a new multiyear -- we also just announced new multiyear agreements with our partners at the NHL, NHL PA and UFC that is creating more innovative hockey and finding experiences. We also have plans to add our core EA Sports portfolio with multiple new franchises in the years ahead. In addition to our college esports expansion that we've just announced with ING Redfield, in the weeks ahead, we'll share more about another major new development in our esports program, capitalizing on our growing fan base and demand from esports teams, sponsors and broadcasters. 
Our business has expanded significantly this year. Our pipeline of new games and live services is robust, and we're positioned well for sustained growth. A huge thank you goes to our amazing teams for their incredible spirit and dedication to our players. I am proud of how we have continued to execute. Now I'll turn the call over to Blake."

We continue to be unbelievably impressed by how our teams have actually delivered. And Andrew talked about that, and it is just a testament to the strength of Electronic Arts. As you know from Chris' introduction, we're trying something a little different with our earnings call this quarter. And you should listen to my prepared remarks in conjunction with the expanded presentation we've posted on our Investor Relations website earlier today. It contains the metrics and the color I would normally read and bore you with. But hopefully, it gives you a lot more information than maybe you might hear through the call. This approach gives us more time for analysis and more time for your questions. 
So with that, I'd like to briefly highlight a few points. We came in well above our guidance for the quarter. The beat was driven by our live services, led by Madden Ultimate team and FIFA Ultimate team. First week sell-through for Madden was up nearly 20% year-on-year, and this after Madden NFL 20 turning the best year ever for Madden on console. This is also the first time we linked Madden Mobile to console Madden, and we saw hundreds of thousands of mobile players registered in the first tranche of Madden NFL 21 buyers. Credit is also due to the response teams and the quality of the content that they have been adding to Apex Legends. Apex Legends net booking came in 24% above what we had last year and is off to an incredibly strong start in Q3. We started the year expecting Apex Legends to deliver $300 million to $400 million in net bookings, is now on track to deliver more than $500 million. That is Apex will have gone from $0 billion to about $1 billion in lifetime net bookings in just 2 years. With this velocity and the addition of mobile, we believe Apex has the potential to grow to $1 billion in net bookings every year. This is what we do. We've done it with FIFA. We've done it with Madden. We've done it with the Sims, and we're doing it again with Apex due to the amazing teams that we have really driving this business. Mobile grew year-on-year again, and we're excited about a new title slate for this platform, particularly the Apex Legends and soccer games that Andrew discussed. It's been a strong 3 months for launching new EA games. We launched Madden NFL 21, Star Wars Quadrants, UFC 4 in the quarter, along with rocket arena from final strike games. Squadrons is the latest example of the power of our licensing model in which we leverage the synergy between well-loved IP and the skills of our development teams to bring extraordinary new experiences to fans and gamers. The FIFA franchise continues to grow. FIFA 20 attracted 12% more players than FIFA '19 and  engagement remains strong, making FIFA 20 the most successful FIFA game in the 27-year history of the franchise. 
FIFA 21 launched after quarter end and is off to a great start with live services, net bookings for the first 3 weeks, up relative to the comparable period last year. FIFA Ultimate team contributes to be the most popular mode in the game and also the most engaging for players. After 8 weeks of Madden NFL 21, digital accounted for 66% of units sold through the players. After the first 3 weeks of FIFA 21 number was 50%. These are both up 14 points year-over-year, and we believe this step-up is likely a permanent structural change driven by the COVID shelter-in-place orders. This adds up to 6 new games launched since the beginning of Q2, including blockbuster franchises like FIFA and Madden and fan favorites like Star Wars Quadrants. This is more than our peers manage in a year, the further testimony to our team's ability to execute under difficult circumstances. We've reached more players with the EA play this quarter with the launch of the subscription service on steam. In addition, Microsoft has noted, the value of EA Play will bring to their game pass ultimate, and we expect making it available on that platform will lead to another step-up in EA Play subscribers. 
Operating expenses came in materially below our expectations, driven primarily by variable compensation and phasing of marketing investments. We had a new record in trailing 12-month cash flow of $2.04 billion. The strength and dependability of our cash flow has led us to start a new repurchase program this quarter and to initiate a dividend for the first time in the company's history. The share repurchase authorization is for a $2.6 billion program over 2 years. Our Board has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.17 per share on our common stock, which represents an annualized yield of about 0.5% calculated as of the close of the market on November 4. As a result, we expect to return a total of $3 billion to investors over the next 24 months. We're now looking ahead to the launches of the new Playstation and Xbox. Console transitions have historically driven broad industry growth and our opportunities to grow our franchises. 
In particular, owners of NFL 21 and FIFA 21 for the current generation of consoles can upgrade for free to the next-generation versions any time before the launch of the 22nd or 22 versions of game next year. In addition, we expect to leverage the ongoing strength of FIFA 20, engagement and building an even larger audience for FIFA 21. Our expectations for full year GAAP revenue remain $5.625 billion, cost of revenue to be $1.485 billion and earnings per share of $3.15. We are reaffirming our operating cash flow guidance of $1.85 billion. We continue to anticipate capital expenditures of around $125 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.725 billion. See our earnings slides and further cash flow information for more details. Remember that our guidance EPS calculation do not factor in any share repurchases. We expect net bookings for the year to be $5.95 billion, unchanged from our prior guidance. This is driven by ongoing strength in our live services, offset by the move of Apex Legends on Switch and the extra time we're giving to our EA originals titles. Versus our expectations last quarter, those changes amount to about $120 million of net bookings moved out of the fiscal 2021 year that will benefit fiscal 2022. The annual guidance factors in an FX headwind of about $80 million. And as you build your models, note that we are forecasting a fall in interest income of about $80 million compared to last year due to the sustained low interest rates the world is experiencing. 
For the third quarter, we now expect GAAP net revenue of $1.675 billion, cost of revenue to be $599 million and operating expenses of $840 million. This resulted in earnings per share of $0.61 for the third quarter. We anticipate net bookings for the third quarter to be $2.35 billion, which would make it the largest quarter in EA history. Some context for this guidance. We are now guiding fiscal 2021 net bookings to be 11% higher than fiscal 2020. This is incredible growth, some driven by the shelter-in-place orders but much also driven by the work our teams do every day in bringing new live services, content and games to players. Even with a strong year, we still expect net bookings and earnings to grow next year. The growth will be driven by a great slate of new titles, including Battlefield, our blockbuster sports titles, Need For Speed and the titles we moved out of fiscal '21 to '22. We anticipate a strong performance from our live services, and we continue to bring our franchises to new platforms, for example, bringing Apex legends to mobile. With that, I will now turn it back to Andrew."

Let me jump in first. I appreciate the question. It's a good question. I think the thing to note is unlike, say, March when virtually the whole world shut down at the same time, we're seeing stages of changes in different communities around the world. And so we don't expect that we would see the surge that we saw before. But we also know that as we get into winter, flu season, other things. And I don't want to predict the covet path because that's way out of my expertise. But we do know that people will continue to gravitate to online entertainment. And what we also know is that much of the traditional entertainment, i.e. movies, TV have been stalled because of the COVID situation. And so people will drift towards more and more online entertainment, which we know they're going to engage in, because we've seen that in the past. And we will continue to do things to try to help people understand why it is a great way to engage with things they love, be it sports, be it the Sims, be whatever it is. Hard to say and I will tell you we have been very careful not to try to predict that in our guidance. And thus, the reason that we've provided the guidance, we've provided because it is a world in which we have never been in before. And so trust that we'll keep investors and the sell-side up-to-date as we see things, but we want to also be really careful because of the world that, as I said, we just don't have a lot of history in. And we want to be really careful, but we also want to know that we are one of the most important entertainment vehicles for people during this difficult time."

But guessing approvals is really difficult. But we're optimistic. We believe that this is something that we can ultimately get approval on. But more importantly, remember, the mobile game for Apex outside of China, China doesn't require approval. And so it's more about making sure the game is correct, testing the game and then rolling it out in the key markets, and we're pretty confident all of those, as we talked about, the Japanese market is one of the largest markets for Apex, second largest in the world. We believe that there's a huge opportunity for mobile in that market. And so we will continue to focus on where we think those largest markets are for early rollout, and we'll keep people informed as we start to test the game and get it into the market. But I think, as Andrew said, in his comments, we believe that's coming in the coming fiscal '22. And we're excited -- we're very excited about the opportunity there."

And we're really looking we are -- think about it as we're in the very early days of the industry on subscriptions for games, and we're doing everything possible to help consumers understand why it is a great potential for them to either be -- introduce to new games, play the games they love or play games for a great value.

Again, when we think about Madden and we think about FIFA for that matter, we really think about as a platform to bring the fans of these sports together to engage in interactive consumption of the sport. And 10, 15 years ago, we would have had multiple games, Arcade style, simulation style, management style that we would put in the marketplace at separate packaged goods. As we've really transformed our business into the world of digital as we've moved the experience from product to service for our players what our players have also told us is they want us to keep them together. They want to come together regardless of what format they're engaging with. And so as we continue to develop the Madden franchise as we continue the people franchise, you should expect that we'll continue to add these new modalities of play to the product or through the service. What we've seen so far this year in Madden is there's been really good and strong engagement in the yard. It's early -- it's still early in its life cycle. But it's offering this opportunity for people to come into the franchise in a new way and play a more casual experience. If they haven't really wanted to engage in the full 11, B11 experience of [indiscernible] on buying. But it also allows our hartill players to do something a little different, a little more social and a little faster pace than the traditional margin game. And so overall, we feel like it adds a substantial element to the overall player experience, both for new players and returning players. And the same has been true for Volta inside of FIFA. In the context of cosmetic sale items, we'll start to experiment with that. What we've seen across the industry is when done right, the purchase of cosmetics that allow you to individualize and personalize your experience and build status in that environment as you play with your friends, have been really, really well received. We expect that will be no different in Madden and FIFA over time, and we'll start to work with our gaming communities as to what are the right things to them, what kind of cosmetics they look like, what are most authentic and relatable to the sports that they're playing in, and what gives them the opportunity to be unique in these large growing communities."

He has been an EA veteran and held very senior leadership roles in the company some number of years ago. But I spent the best part of the last decade in kind of mobile-first organizations and comes back to us with unbelievable experience and tremendous expertise. And we are now -- you heard me talk about 6 new FIFA titles. You hear us talk about the push with Apex Legends. What I would tell you is, Jeff has come back and made 3 core assessments. The first is that we have an existing portfolio of games that are tremendously profitable but have significant more opportunity for engagement and monetization than we're presently doing with some changes to the organization and some changes to how we run those live services. And he's already started to work with leaders, and we brought a number of new leaders from across the mobile industry into our company, and they are going through each one of our franchises and looking for opportunities to deliver new content, new experiences and new services to players that will drive higher engagement and result in monetization in our existing franchises. The second thing he has done has come in and said, there are a number of key franchises like FIFA, who have unbelievable exponential opportunity around the world. And he's put in motion a series of internal development and external development that will really start to execute against our big franchises like FIFA and some others that will be able to talk about more soon. And then the third thing is, he also has a tremendous network out there in the mobile sphere. And there are a lot of great developers out there who have really great games and really great game mechanics and one of experience and expertise but you do not have the IP to build their games around or the marketing muscle to really drive acquisition and what is becoming an increasingly competitive market. And so Jeff is also doing a lot of outreach with external developers and publishers and looking at ways that we could partner differently with them with our slate of IP and with our marketing muscle. Either in the context of licensing or co-development or co publishing or in some cases, acquisition. And so I've not been more excited for a number of years about what I think we're going to be able to achieve in our mobile business. And again, what we know is mobile is tremendously competitive. It's somewhat unpredictable. There are a lot of games that come to App stores on an annualized basis. But we are seeing that where you build games with great teams around trusted IP that offer unbelievable experience and values to play that monetization opportunity is very, very strong. And we're confident about that going into FY '22 with FIFA and Apex Legends and Star Wars Galaxy Heroes and others. But certainly, as we look out further into '23 and '24, we feel like we're well positioned there as well."

I would say, I mean, we always know, and we've seen over history that people will delay purchases without gap. I mean, it's just -- it's natural in a console transition. But I would also remember that there will only be a small amount, and this is not a negative on Sony or Microsoft business is just a reality of how many consoles they can produce. Dave, I think both publicly talked about 10 million, 11 million, 12 million consoles in the market between now and the end of March. Because that -- it's just reality, right? So we know that some people will wait but also some people will upgrade over time. And the reason we did the upgrade program is we wanted to make sure people felt that they would be comfortable buying the Gen 4 version and the notion that they would be able to upgrade without any problems. And it's all about the consumer experience, it's about making sure you're staying connected to your social network that plays the same game that you're playing. And we didn't want anyone to feel like for some reason because they didn't want to -- or they wanted to wait for a new console that they didn't fall out of the key component of what is so important in our games, which is the ability to play with your friends. And it's not much more complicated than that. We do think if we look back on past console transitions, we know that it will take time to build the inventory and the level of new consoles. But we also know, based on what we've seen in the new consoles, it will add incredible opportunities for us to build better and better games over time because of more power. And that's what we're really excited about. And as we've talked about, we will build a series of games this year and continue to add to that, no different than we've done in past console cycles. And I think the rest of the industry is that way. And that's how people approach it, but it is where it gets really, really exciting a year or 2 years from now because I will tell you, games are going to be unbelievable when you start to see them a year or 2 years from now in the new consoles."

And most of my career before I was Sportoto have this job, I was building sports video games. And so I went through a number of consoles. And I would tell you, not only do we see the market grow considerably. If you go back and look through history, every console transition meaningfully grows the market, and top-tier frontline sports games almost always drive a lot of that growth and benefit from the growth in player engagement as those console transitions move through and a bigger market buys into the new console generation. We think about game development in terms of kind of what can you do with a core technology level, what can you do at a future level? And what can you do at a social level and as we've gone through generations, the intelligence and the believability of plays in a sports game it's had a step change in immersion and authenticity and realism, each console generation if you go back, you want the history lesson, PS2 was all about, can you make athletes look like the real-world athlete? PS3 or the next-generation was all about, can you make the moves like real athletes. The generation that we're now is, can you make them a moat like real athletes? And as we look at the next-generation of platforms, it can you bring all of those together and at a level of intelligence to those players that upholds the suspension disbelief that you are, in fact, engaging with real athletes in a real game on a real pitch. And so I expect that we will continue to do and drive unbelievable new development in the college of the base technology that drives the gameplay. The second thing that you'll also see as we move through transition, is kind of modality shift how people play, single play to multiplayer, multiplier to cooperative play. And you'll see us continue to do that with the power of these new platforms and how we can bring plays together in new modalities of play. And you're starting to see some of those things with how we started with Bolter, now we've started with a yard, and you should expect that we'll continue to expand the modalities of play on new platforms. And then last and this happened as we move from off-line to online. It's really the social nature of the game and how you tie the game to the real-world of sport. And you heard me talk about how we're building Madden so that there is a greater influence of what's happening in the real-world of sport on your game. But you should also imagine that we'll start to think about how do we use the technology in these new platforms, how do we use them plus the combination of the cloud to bring millions and millions of players together in a social ecosystem around the consumption of their favorite sport. And we're excited by that as much as the base technology, quite frankly, because these are becoming social networks for sports fans and COVID has accelerated that for us as the consumption of sport more broadly has moved from lean interactive and physical interaction has moved -- social interactions move from physical to digital. So as we think about the combination of the base technology of Incus gameplay, the different modalities of play that the new platforms will enable and the new platforms combined with the cloud to offer an expansion of the social network orientation of these games, we're really excited about the future. And you tie that into what will almost certainly be a growing marketplace, we think we have tremendous opportunity, not just this year, but in many years to come."

I would not connect the dots between the buyback or dividend with M&A. I mean, we -- I think you all know, we're on a consistent path of buyback, and we've paused it at the end of the last part of the buyback program when we finished it at the end of March because we were going into COVID, and I think we were pretty transparent with people that it wasn't just a street issue, it was also a concern around how our employees thought about how we are spending our money. And we feel more confident of that today. And in fact, I would say we feel more confident because we've added the dividend. Now the reality is, if we're talking about the buyback level and the dividend level, we're still either under or coming close to our annual cash flow. And we have substantial cash on the balance sheet and substantial debt capacity. So don't read into that as the inability or lack of desire to do any acquisitions. We are incredibly focused on what could we buy, but at the same time, we're also focused on making sure we don't destroy shareholder value in buying and doing an acquisition. 
And I don't want to comment on any individual acquisitions, but it's a balance of driving growth, but at the same time, being responsible with your guy's capital because that's with investors' capital because that's what really matters to us. What I would say, though, is the one thing to read into the buyback and the dividend is an incredible confidence in the business. And that's not short-term confidence because that's not how we operate the company. I remind people, we increased our guidance by almost $500 million at the end of the first quarter. And if many of you have been around a long time, we've almost rarely ever increased guidance coming out of the first quarter and granted. We had the COVID situation that created one of the greatest first quarters, unfortunately because of the situation that was going on around the world. But what we are continuing to do is feel very, very confident about our business. I don't want anyone to read the fact that we may not be raising guidance now. As a negative because we need to all remember, we've raised guidance $500 million during the year. We thought we were going to do $5.55 billion, and we're talking about close to $6 billion and what you heard from Andrew and I today as we're planning on growth again next year. That's the most important message. What I will also tell you is if anyone can predict right now what's going to happen in the economy over the next 3 months or 6 months. Call me and tell me because it is going to be very difficult, and we are very careful in how we present and focus our guidance in our business, but we are very confident in the strength of our business right now. And we are seeing things, as we mentioned. A simple example, Apex Japan, and we don't know when it will happen. But if it happens, it will be big. There is so many different things inside our business that are so strong that we are very, very excited about where it can go. So I just -- I don't want anyone get ahead of themselves on guidance, but I don't want anyone to think that the message we're sending out is in any way negative that we haven't raised guidance because remember, we raised guidance by $500 million, and we've told people, we're going to grow again next year. So keep it in that context, that's where it gets exciting. That's where the opportunity is. I know that's not the question you asked, but don't read anything into things like share repurchase or dividend is a negative. They're all positive. It's a commitment and a confidence in the business that I think we're -- it's where Andrew and I are and why it's so exciting in our industry is so exciting going forward. So sorry to a little too much more than everyone wanted to hear, but I just -- I think both Andrew and I are really passionate about where we think this is going. And we want to make sure people don't get over indexed on the short term, and they actually read what we're telling people as the real opportunity."

There are some benefits that come from having our scale and having our organizational structure that allows us greater fluidity of our talent. We're able to move talent from project to project. We're able to kind of leverage our scale in the development process. And you've seen that play out this year in our ability to launch as much high-quality content as we have. And even as of 11 a.m. this morning, season 7 of Apex Legends is on track to be our largest launch day since the launch of the product. Steam in the first 12-hour performance has been extremely strong. Our new champion addition is already a top 3 best seller on steam. We've had the most minutes watched on Twitch since the launch of the product. So another testament to just the unbelievable inspirational capabilities of our teams and our ability to continue to deliver amazing games, experiences and content in the face of these ongoing challenges. As we think about that till next year, again, you heard me talk about we're doing internal play testing. We're starting to go out to our community and get feedback. I was part of the product review last week. We have rallied that entire studio around the development of Battlefield, specifically. We've given them an extra year of development. You'll remember to ensure that they can, in fact, build a true next-gen vision around that game. Darts is one of the most talented studios on the plant, and we've been able to add leadership from our EA Sports business and David Rutter, who understands both live services and the rigor of development. We've brought in talent from across the industry who have really bolstered our belief and our confidence in our ability to launch that game next year. So lots more to come in the next couple of months.

And thank you, everyone, for joining us, and we do hope you stay safe and healthy in what appears to be a second surge of COVID in parts of the world. What I think you've earn from me today is extremely confident in where we're at right now and where we're going for our business. We've had strength and growth in our business this year, already forecasting 11% growth year-over-year for FY '21. We've launched great new games in content, FIFA, Madden, Apex Legends, the Sims, all continue to be major growth drivers, and we've got further expansion opportunities this year and beyond. We are excited for the upcoming console launches. New hardware has historically always grown the market and offers us another opportunity to grow FIFA and Madden franchises with our next-gen games, and we're projecting continued growth in fiscal year FY '22 and beyond with an expansion of our sports portfolio, a double down in mobile, extension of our live services and of course, a new battlefield game.

I hope this find everyone well and staying healthy amidst the ongoing pandemic. After the biggest first quarter in the history of Electronic Arts, our second quarter of FY '21 showed continued strength with net revenue and earnings above our guidance. We are driving growth through the breadth, depth and quality of our new games, our industry-leading live services and expansion to more platforms and more ways to play. Let me first say how thankful I am to our teams for their incredible work and everything they are delivering for our players. The well-being of our people remains our top priority. Even amidst these unprecedented circumstances, we are executing and building great strength across our business. 
Here are a few key examples. We delivered 8 new games so far this year, and our network has grown to more than 330 million unique accounts as tens of millions of new players have joined to enjoy more of our amazing games and content. EA SPORTS continues to be a leader in sports interactive entertainment. Madden NFL 20 was the most successful game in franchise history last year and now Madden NFL 21 already has nearly 30% more players year-over-year from launch. 
Our FIFA franchise is engaging more than 100 million players globally. Even prior to launching FIFA 21, our FIFA franchise is having the biggest calendar year ever with our business across all platforms, up 26% year-over-year in net bookings. FIFA 20 has reached nearly 35 million players on console and PC. FIFA Mobile continues to perform well and FIFA Online Asia broke engagement records across China and Korea in Q2. We just launched FIFA Mobile in Japan in October as we continue to see significant international expansion opportunities for our FIFA franchise. 
We continue to have an outstanding relationship with Disney and Lucasfilms. Star Wars: Squadrons launched a great feedback from critics and the community and has performed above our expectations. This is clearly a special game for fans and continues the extraordinary success we've had bringing great games to life with this IP, including Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, Star Wars: The Old Republic and the Star Wars Battlefront franchise. 
Our live services are among the most successful in the industry, and our live services net bookings have grown more than 28% fiscal year-over-year to date. EA SPORTS ultimate team has more than 30 million players so far this year, up 25% year-over-year. Around the world, our multi-platform Sims community continues to grow, and our Sims 4 player base on PC and console is now the largest in franchise history. 
Apex Legends has established itself as a top global franchise with major year-over-year growth and continued expansion opportunities. Apex in Asia is having great success with each season of content. We've just launched a game to massive Steam community and cross play is now live, making it easier for people to play with friends around the world. 
Our esports programs are scaling the new records in viewership also. Our new Madden NFL episodic content featuring NFL athletes, celebrities and top Madden NFL players is bringing great entertainment to a much wider audience. And our recent FIFA 21 challenge, which paired esports stars with celebrity soccer players was our most watch esports event to date with viewership that place it amongst top esports broadcast worldwide. 
Our EA PLAY service is the most successful multi-platform subscription in the industry. With the addition of our subscription on PS4 and Steam, we've reached more than 6.5 million paid subscribers. EA PLAY is now set to go live on Microsoft Game Pass in a few days, and we believe we have the opportunity to double our subscriber base over the next 12 months. 
In addition to our subscription, we launched more than 125 games and content packs on Steam this year, with new tiles like C&C Remastered and Star Wars: Squadrons leading the download chat on the platform. Bringing our games to Steam is a new and additive business for us. With the EA and Steam communities able to play together, we're able to harness the full opportunity in the PC space as it continues to show strong growth. We continue to lead the industry as the only developer and publisher with the ability to bring this much quality content to players. We've done this through unprecedented circumstances in the last 6 months, and now we're delivering more great experiences in our current quarter. 
We started our third quarter by launching 2 new EA SPORTS games. When it went live globally on October 9, FIFA 21 already had a record number of players in the game through the early access benefit of our subscription. Our player metrics in FIFA 21 are strong, and FIFA Ultimate Team also continues to grow with matches in the mode up 30% year-over-year. 
NHL 21, which includes the fan favorite NHL 94 Rewind has quickly become the most successful NHL game yet on current gen consoles. 
The Sims 4 and Apex Legends show how we build great live services into strong ongoing businesses. This quarter, we'll launch our tenth expansion pack for the Sims 4, along with an important game update to add even more cultural customization options for our players. On the heels of our highly successful Season 6 we've just launched Season 7 in Apex Legends, which is said to be our biggest season of content this year. We now have more than 20 top live services across console, PC and mobile, forming a foundation for continued growth. 
We will continue to reach more players across more platforms in Q3. We have more titles launching on Switch and Google Stadia this quarter. Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond will launch on Oculus VR in December, our second VR experience this year. And as I mentioned before, we will take another step in our subscription strategy this week with our expansion to Microsoft Game Pass, opening significant new opportunities to grow our subscriber base. 
This quarter also brings the launch of next-generation consoles from our partners at Microsoft and Sony. EA SPORTS is always at the center of innovation for us, and it will lead the way on next-gen consoles. FIFA 21 for PS5 and Xbox Series X will leverage the major upgrading technology to bring players unprecedented immersion, innovative gameplay and minimal load times to put them into the action in under 2 seconds. Madden NFL 21 for the next-gen consoles will blur the lines of sport even further through a new system that is responsive to the way NFL players perform in the real world. We're excited to have an opportunity to bring even more players into our FIFA and Madden franchises this year, and we're providing a smooth transition for players on current gen consoles to move over with the next-gen upgrade. 
Looking ahead, I want to offer a few thoughts on our growth drivers for FY '22 and beyond. Each previous console generation has grown in the global market, and we expect this transition will be the same. We plan to launch at least 6 new games on the next-gen consoles in FY '22. These will include a new Need for Speed game that is bringing some astounding visual leaps developed by the Criterion team who have launched some of the most highly rated games in franchise history. 
DICE is creating our next Battlefield game with never before seen scale. The technical advancements of the new consoles are allowing the team to deliver a true next-gen vision for the franchise. We have hands on play testing underway internally, and the team has been getting very positive feedback on the game as we've begun to engage our community. The next Battlefield is set to launch in holiday 2021, we're excited to share a lot more about the game in the spring. 
Our live services are positioned to be a long-term growth driver. Having built Apex Legends into an amazing live service with a deeply engaged community, the talented Respawn team in Los Angeles has expanded Apex development to include a full team in our Vancouver location, so that we can continue delivering more great content. Japan is now our second largest market for Apex Legends, and we have strong plans to continue growth in that region. In addition, Apex mobile development will be complete in the new year and ready for launch in FY '22. 
We also expect another very strong year for the Sims 4, a testament to the strength of that community as it enters the seventh year of live service. 
EA SPORTS will be executing on a significant expansion that will span new games, more geographies and more ways to engage.  FIFA is growing. In addition to FIFA 21 on next-gen this year and Stadia in the new year, the success of our FIFA Online 4 free-to-play game in Asia now leads us to expand that game to new markets, including the Middle East and Eastern Europe. 
Soccer continues to grow on popularity around the world, and we now have 6 new soccer mobile games in development for new genres and new markets. Our roster of top soccer league licenses is also unmatched. Our recently extended agreements with the Bundesliga and La Liga in addition to more than 30 other league partners, including UEFA Champions League, [indiscernible] and the Premier League, enable us to continue delivering this franchise to more players around the world with the authenticity they expect. 
We also just announced a new multiyear -- we also just announced new multiyear agreements with our partners at the NHL, NHLPA and UFC that is creating more innovative hockey and fighting experiences. We also have plans to add our core EA SPORTS portfolio with multiple new franchises in the years ahead. In addition to our college esports expansion that we've just announced with [indiscernible], in the weeks ahead, we'll share more about another major new development in our esports program, capitalizing on our growing fan base and demand from esports teams, sponsors and broadcasters. 
Our business has expanded significantly this year. Our pipeline of new games and live services is robust, and we're positioned well for sustained growth. A huge thank you goes to our amazing teams for their incredible spirit and dedication to our players. I am proud of how we have continued to execute. Now I'll turn the call over to Blake."

We continue to be unbelievably impressed by how our teams have actually delivered. And Andrew talked about that, and it is just a testament to the strength of Electronic Arts. 
As you know from Chris' introduction, we're trying something a little different with our earnings call this quarter. And you should listen to my prepared remarks in conjunction with the expanded presentation we've posted on our Investor Relations website earlier today. It contains the metrics and the color I would normally read and bore you with. But hopefully, it gives you a lot more information than maybe you might hear through the call. This approach gives us more time for analysis and more time for your questions. 
So with that, I'd like to briefly highlight a few points. We came in well above our guidance for the quarter. The beat was driven by our live services, led by Madden Ultimate Team and FIFA Ultimate Team. First week sell-through for Madden was up nearly 20% year-on-year, and this after Madden NFL 20 turning the best year ever for Madden on console. This is also the first time we linked Madden Mobile to console Madden, and we saw hundreds of thousands of mobile players registered in the first tranche of Madden NFL 21 buyers. 
Credit is also due to the Respawn teams and the quality of the content that they have been adding to Apex Legends. Apex Legends net booking came in 24% above what we had last year and is off to an incredibly strong start in Q3. We started the year expecting Apex Legends to deliver $300 million to $400 million in net bookings, is now on track to deliver more than $500 million. That is Apex will have gone from $0 billion to about $1 billion in lifetime net bookings in just 2 years. With this velocity and the addition of mobile, we believe Apex has the potential to grow to $1 billion in net bookings every year. This is what we do. We've done it with FIFA. We've done it with Madden. We've done it with the Sims, and we're doing it again with Apex due to the amazing teams that we have really driving this business. 
Mobile grew year-on-year again, and we're excited about a new title slate for this platform, particularly the Apex Legends and soccer games that Andrew discussed. It's been a strong 3 months for launching new EA games. We launched Madden NFL 21, Star Wars: Squadrons, UFC 4 in the quarter, along with Rocket Arena from Final Strike Games. Squadrons is the latest example of the power of our licensing model in which we leverage the synergy between well-loved IP and the skills of our development teams to bring extraordinary new experiences to fans and gamers. 
The FIFA franchise continues to grow. FIFA 20 attracted 12% more players than FIFA '19 and  engagement remains strong, making FIFA 20 the most successful FIFA game in the 27-year history of the franchise. 
FIFA 21 launched after quarter end and is off to a great start with live services, net bookings for the first 3 weeks, up relative to the comparable period last year. FIFA Ultimate Team contributes to be the most popular mode in the game and also the most engaging for players. After 8 weeks of Madden NFL 21, digital accounted for 66% of units sold through the players. After the first 3 weeks of FIFA 21 number was 50%. These are both up 14 points year-over-year, and we believe this step-up is likely a permanent structural change driven by the COVID shelter-in-place orders. 
This adds up to 6 new games launched since the beginning of Q2, including blockbuster franchises like FIFA and Madden and fan favorites like Star Wars: Squadrons. This is more than our peers manage in a year, the further testimony to our team's ability to execute under difficult circumstances. We've reached more players with the EA PLAY this quarter with the launch of the subscription service on Steam. In addition, Microsoft has noted, the value of EA PLAY will bring to their game pass ultimate, and we expect making it available on that platform will lead to another step-up in EA PLAY subscribers. 
Operating expenses came in materially below our expectations, driven primarily by variable compensation and phasing of marketing investments. We had a new record in trailing 12-month cash flow of $2.04 billion. The strength and dependability of our cash flow has led us to start a new repurchase program this quarter and to initiate a dividend for the first time in the company's history. The share repurchase authorization is for a $2.6 billion program over 2 years. Our Board has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.17 per share on our common stock, which represents an annualized yield of about 0.5% calculated as of the close of the market on November 4. As a result, we expect to return a total of $3 billion to investors over the next 24 months. We're now looking ahead to the launches of the new Playstation and Xbox. Console transitions have historically driven broad industry growth and our opportunities to grow our franchises. 
In particular, owners of NFL 21 and FIFA 21 for the current generation of consoles can upgrade for free to the next-generation versions any time before the launch of the 22nd or 22 versions of game next year. In addition, we expect to leverage the ongoing strength of FIFA 20, engagement and building an even larger audience for FIFA 21. 
Our expectations for full year GAAP revenue remain $5.625 billion, cost of revenue to be $1.485 billion and earnings per share of $3.15. We are reaffirming our operating cash flow guidance of $1.85 billion. We continue to anticipate capital expenditures of around $125 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.725 billion. See our earnings slides and further cash flow information for more details. Remember that our guidance EPS calculation do not factor in any share repurchases. 
We expect net bookings for the year to be $5.95 billion, unchanged from our prior guidance. This is driven by ongoing strength in our live services, offset by the move of Apex Legends on Switch and the extra time we're giving to our EA originals titles. Versus our expectations last quarter, those changes amount to about $120 million of net bookings moved out of the fiscal 2021 year that will benefit fiscal 2022. The annual guidance factors in an FX headwind of about $80 million. And as you build your models, note that we are forecasting a fall in interest income of about $80 million compared to last year due to the sustained low interest rates the world is experiencing. 
For the third quarter, we now expect GAAP net revenue of $1.675 billion, cost of revenue to be $599 million and operating expenses of $840 million. This resulted in earnings per share of $0.61 for the third quarter. We anticipate net bookings for the third quarter to be $2.35 billion, which would make it the largest quarter in EA history. 
Some context for this guidance. We are now guiding fiscal 2021 net bookings to be 11% higher than fiscal 2020. This is incredible growth, some driven by the shelter-in-place orders but much also driven by the work our teams do every day in bringing new live services, content and games to players. Even with a strong year, we still expect net bookings and earnings to grow next year. The growth will be driven by a great slate of new titles, including Battlefield, our blockbuster sports titles, Need For Speed and the titles we moved out of fiscal '21 to '22. We anticipate a strong performance from our live services, and we continue to bring our franchises to new platforms, for example, bringing Apex Legends to mobile. With that, I will now turn it back to Andrew."

Let me jump in first. I appreciate the question. It's a good question. I think the thing to note is unlike, say, March when virtually the whole world shutdown at the same time, we're seeing stages of changes in different communities around the world. And so we don't expect that we would see the surge that we saw before. But we also know that as we get into winter, flu season, other things. And I don't want to predict the COVID path because that's way out of my expertise. But we do know that people will continue to gravitate to online entertainment. 
And what we also know is that much of the traditional entertainment, i.e. movies, TV have been stalled because of the COVID situation. And so people will drift towards more and more online entertainment, which we know they're going to engage in, because we've seen that in the past. And we will continue to do things to try to help people understand why it is a great way to engage with things they love, be it sports, be it the Sims, be whatever it is. 
Hard to say and I will tell you we have been very careful not to try to predict that in our guidance. And thus, the reason that we've provided the guidance, we've provided because it is a world in which we have never been in before. And so trust that we'll keep investors and the sell-side up-to-date as we see things, but we want to also be really careful because of the world that, as I said, we just don't have a lot of history in. And we want to be really careful, but we also want to know that we are one of the most important entertainment vehicles for people during this difficult time."

But guessing approvals is really difficult. But we're optimistic. We believe that this is something that we can ultimately get approval on. But more importantly, remember, the mobile game for Apex outside of China, China doesn't require approval. And so it's more about making sure the game is correct, testing the game and then rolling it out in the key markets, and we're pretty confident on all of those. 
As we talked about, the Japanese market is one of the largest markets for Apex, second largest in the world. We believe that there's a huge opportunity for mobile in that market. And so we will continue to focus on where we think those largest markets are for early rollout, and we'll keep people informed as we start to test the game and get it into the market. But I think, as Andrew said, in his comments, we believe that's coming in the coming fiscal '22. And we're excited -- we're very excited about the opportunity there."

We have strong partnership with Microsoft and Sony and Steam. And of course, we have our own platform with EA PLAY and as we looked at it, we saw this as an opportunity to build an access point for our EA PLAY subscription on the Microsoft platform. We saw it as a way to give gamers easy and frictionless access. 
We will -- as part of that, this is not just putting our games at Microsoft subscription, this is actually an entitlement to the EA PLAY subscription. And as a result of that, the relationship that we have with those players who make those subscriptions, they will be the same as if we sold it outside the platform. So you'll continue to see us think about our subscription broadly across platforms and making it available to any player wherever they want in any way they need with as little friction as possible."

When it comes to giving guidance next year, we probably still won't give detail because it's not that big of an overall business. I think to Andrew's point is the real goal is how do we grow our subscription and also help Microsoft grow their subscription. I mean this is a great partnership with them. And we're really looking. We are -- think about it as we're in the very early days of the industry on subscriptions for games, and we're doing everything possible to help consumers understand why it is a great potential for them to either be  introduced to new games, play the games they love or play games for a great value.

So we -- and Microsoft to figure it out the right way, I think the economics work for both of us and that's how we've approached it."

Again, when we think about Madden and we think about FIFA for that matter, we really think about as a platform to bring the fans of these sports together to engage in interactive consumption of the sport. And 10, 15 years ago, we would have had multiple games, arcade style, simulation style, management style that we would put in the marketplace as separate packaged goods. As we've really transformed our business into the world of digital, as we've moved the experience from product to service for our players what our players have also told us is they want us to keep them together. They want to come together regardless of what format they're engaging with. And so as we continue to develop the Madden franchise, as we continue the FIFA franchise, you should expect that we'll continue to add these new modalities of play to the product or to the service. 
What we've seen so far this year in Madden is there's been really good and strong engagement in The Yard. It's early -- it's still early in its life cycle. But it's offering this opportunity for people to come into the franchise in a new way and play a more casual experience. If they haven't really wanted to engage in the full 11, V11 experience that he is going to buy. But it also allows our harder core players to do something a little different, a little more social and a little faster paced than the traditional Madden game. And so overall, we feel like it adds a substantial element to the overall player experience, both for new players and returning players. And the same has been true for Volta inside of FIFA. 
In the context of cosmetic sale items, we'll start to experiment with that. What we've seen across the industry is when done right, the purchase of cosmetics that allow you to individualize and personalize your experience and build status in that environment as you play with your friends, have been really, really well received. We expect that will be no different in Madden and FIFA over time, and we'll start to work with our gaming communities as to what are the right things to them? What kind of cosmetics they look like? What are most authentic and relatable to the sports that they're playing in? And what gives them the opportunity to be unique in these large growing communities?"

He has been an EA veteran and held very senior leadership roles in the company some number of years ago. But spent the best part of the last decade in kind of mobile-first organizations and comes back to us with unbelievable experience and tremendous expertise. And we are now -- you heard me talk about 6 new FIFA titles. You hear us talk about the push with Apex Legends. 
What I would tell you is, Jeff has come back and made 3 core assessments. The first is that we have an existing portfolio of games that are tremendously profitable but have significant more opportunity for engagement and monetization than we're presently doing with some changes to the organization and some changes to how we run those live services. And he's already started to work with leaders, and we brought a number of new leaders from across the mobile industry into our company, and they are going through each one of our franchises and looking for opportunities to deliver new content, new experiences and new services to players that will drive higher engagement and result in monetization in our existing franchises. 
The second thing he has done has come in and said, there are a number of key franchises like FIFA, who have unbelievable exponential opportunity around the world. And he's put in motion a series of internal development and external development that will really start to execute against our big franchises like FIFA and some others that we will be able to talk about more soon. And then the third thing is, he also has a tremendous network out there in the mobile sphere. And there are a lot of great developers out there who have really great games and really great game mechanics and lot of experience and expertise but they do not have the IP to build their games around or the marketing muscle to really drive acquisition and what is becoming an increasingly competitive market. 
And so Jeff is also doing a lot of outreach with external developers and publishers and looking at ways that we could partner differently with them with our slate of IP and with our marketing muscle. Either in the context of licensing or co-development or co-publishing or in some cases, acquisition. And so I've not been more excited for a number of years about what I think we're going to be able to achieve in our mobile business. And again, what we know is mobile is tremendously competitive. It's somewhat unpredictable. There are a lot of games that come to app stores on an annualized basis. But we are seeing that where you build games with great teams around trusted IP that offer unbelievable experience and value to players that monetization opportunity is very, very strong. And we're confident about that going into FY '22 with FIFA and Apex Legends and Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes and others. But certainly, as we look out further into '23 and '24, we feel like we're well positioned there as well."

I would say, I mean, we've always known, and we've seen over history that people will delay purchases without gap. I mean, it's just -- it's natural in a console transition. But I would also remember that there will only be a small amount, and this is not a negative on Sony or Microsoft business is just a reality of how many consoles they can produce. Dave, I think both publicly talked about 8 million, 10 million, 11 million, 12 million consoles in the market between now and the end of March. Because that -- it's just reality, right? 
So we know that some people will wait but also some people will upgrade over time. And the reason we did the upgrade program is we wanted to make sure people felt that they would be comfortable buying the Gen 4 version and the notion that they would be able to upgrade without any problems. And it's all about the consumer experience, it's about making sure you're staying connected to your social network that plays the same game that you're playing. And we didn't want anyone to feel like for some reason because they didn't want to -- or they wanted to wait for a new console that they didn't fall out of the key component of what is so important in our games, which is the ability to play with your friends. And it's not much more complicated than that. 
We do think if we look back on past console transitions, we know that it will take time to build the inventory and the level of new consoles. But we also know, based on what we've seen in the new consoles, it will add incredible opportunities for us to build better and better games over time because of more power. And that's what we're really excited about. And as we've talked about, we will build a series of games this year and continue to add to that, no different than we've done in past console cycles. And I think the rest of the industry is that way. And that's how people approach it, but it is where it gets really, really exciting a year or 2 years from now because I will tell you, games are going to be unbelievable when you start to see them a year or 2 years from now in the new consoles."

And most of my career before I was fortunate enough to have this job, I was building sports video games. And so I went through a number of consoles. And I would tell you, not only do we see the market grow considerably. If you go back and look through history, every console transition meaningfully grows the market, and top-tier frontline sports games almost always drive a lot of that growth and benefit from the growth in player engagement as those console transitions move through and a bigger market buys into the new console generation. 
We think about game development in terms of kind of what can you do with a core technology level, what can you do at a future level? And what can you do at a social level and as we've gone through generations, the intelligence and the believability of plays in a sports game, it's had a step change in immersion and authenticity and realism, each console generation. 
If you go back, you want the history lesson, PS2 was all about, can you make athletes look like the real-world athlete? PS3 or the next-generation was all about, can you make the moves like real athletes. The generation that we're now is, can you make them [indiscernible] like real athletes? And as we look at the next-generation of platforms, it's can you bring all of those together and add a level of intelligence to those players that upholds the suspense and this belief that you are, in fact, engaging with real athletes in a real game on a real pitch. And so I expect that we will continue to do and drive unbelievable new development in the context of the base technology that drives the game play. 
The second thing that you'll also see as we move through transition, is kind of modality shift how people play, single player to multiplayer, multiplier to cooperative play. And you'll see us continue to do that with the power of these new platforms and how we can bring players together in new modalities of play. And you're starting to see some of those things with how we started with Volta, how we've started with The Yard, and you should expect that we'll continue to expand the modalities of play on new platforms. 
And then last and this happened as we move from offline to online. It's really the social nature of the game and how you tie the game to the real-world of sport. And you heard me talk about how we're building Madden so that there is a greater influence of what's happening in the real-world of sport on your game. But you should also imagine that we'll start to think about how do we use the technology in these new platforms, how do we use them plus the combination of the cloud to bring millions and millions of players together in a social ecosystem around the consumption of their favorite sport. 
And we're excited by that as much as the base technology, quite frankly, because these are becoming social networks for sports fans and COVID has accelerated that for us as the consumption of sport more broadly has moved from lean interactive and physical interaction has moved -- social interactions move from physical to digital. So as we think about the combination of the base technology that influence gameplay, the different modalities of play that the new platforms will enable and the new platforms combined with the cloud to offer an expansion of the social network orientation of these games, we're really excited about the future. And you tie that into what will almost certainly be a growing marketplace. We think we have tremendous opportunity, not just this year, but in many years to come."

I would not connect the dots between the buyback or dividend with M&A. I mean, we -- I think you all know, we're on a consistent path of buyback, and we paused it at the end of the last part of the buyback program when we finished it at the end of March because we were going into COVID, and I think we were pretty transparent with people that it wasn't just a street issue. It was also a concern around how our employees thought about how we are spending our money. And we feel more confident of that today. And in fact, I would say we feel more confident because we've added the dividend. 
Now the reality is, if we're talking about the buyback level and the dividend level, we're still either under or coming close to our annual cash flow. And we have substantial cash on the balance sheet and substantial debt capacity. So don't read into that as the inability or lack of desire to do any acquisitions. We are incredibly focused on what could we buy, but at the same time, we're also focused on making sure we don't destroy shareholder value in buying and doing an acquisition. And I don't want to comment on any individual acquisitions, but it's a balance of driving growth, but at the same time, being responsible with your guy's capital because that's with investors' capital because that's what really matters to us. 
What I would say, though, is the one thing to read into the buyback and the dividend is an incredible confidence in the business. And that's not short-term confidence because that's not how we operate the company. I remind people, we increased our guidance by almost $500 million at the end of the first quarter. And if many of you have been around a long time, we've almost rarely ever increased guidance coming out of the first quarter. And granted, we had the COVID situation that created one of the greatest first quarters, unfortunately because of the situation that was going on around the world. But what we are continuing to do is feel very, very confident about our business. I don't want anyone to read the fact that we may not be raising guidance now, as a negative because we need to all remember, we've raised guidance $500 million during the year. We thought we were going to do $5.55 billion, and we're talking about close to $6 billion and what you heard from Andrew and I today as we're planning on growth again next year. That's the most important message. 
What I will also tell you is if anyone can predict right now what's going to happen in the economy over the next 3 months or 6 months, call me and tell me. Because it is going to be very difficult, and we are very careful in how we present and focus our guidance in our business, but we are very confident in the strength of our business right now. And we are seeing things, as we mentioned. A simple example, Apex Japan, and we don't know when it will happen. But if it happens, it will be big. There is so many different things inside our business that are so strong that we are very, very excited about where it can go. 
So I just -- I don't want anyone to get ahead of themselves on guidance, but I don't want anyone to think that the message we're sending out is in any way negative that we haven't raised guidance because remember, we raised guidance by $500 million, and we've told people, we're going to grow again next year. So keep it in that context, that's where it gets exciting. That's where the opportunity is. I know that's not the question you asked, but don't read anything into things like share repurchase or dividend as a negative. They're all positive. 
It's a commitment and a confidence in the business that I think we're -- that's where Andrew and I are and why it's so exciting in our industry is so exciting going forward. So sorry to a little too much more than everyone wanted to hear, but I just -- I think both Andrew and I are really passionate about where we think this is going. And we want to make sure people don't get over indexed on the short term, and they actually read what we're telling people as the real opportunity."

Working from home is -- there's no doubt it's extraordinarily hard and we're doing all we can to support our teams in any way we can. There are some benefits that come from having our scale and having our organizational structure that allows us greater fluidity of our talent. 
We're able to move talent from project to project. We're able to kind of leverage our scale in the development process. And you've seen that play out this year in our ability to launch as much high-quality content as we have. And even as of 11:00 a.m. this morning, season 7 of Apex Legends is on track to be our largest launch day since the launch of the product. 
Steam in the first rolled out performance has been extremely strong. Our new champion edition is already a top 3 bestseller on Steam. We've had the most minutes watched on Twitch since the launch of the product. So another testament to just the unbelievable inspirational capabilities of our teams and our ability to continue to deliver amazing games, experiences and content in the face of these ongoing challenges. 
As we think about Battlefield next year, again, you heard me talk about we're doing internal play testing. We're starting to go out to our community and get feedback. I was part of the product review last week. We have rallied that entire studio around the development of Battlefield, specifically. We've given them an extra year of development. You'll remember to ensure that they can, in fact, build a true next-gen vision around that game. DICE is one of the most talented studios on the planet, and we've been able to add leadership from our EA SPORTS business and David Rutter, who understands both live services and the rigor of development. 
We've brought in talent from across the industry who have really bolstered our belief and our confidence in our ability to launch that game next year.
