For the second consecutive quarter, we achieved all-time record sales, earnings per share and free cash flow. Likewise, full year 2019 was by any measures, each of sales, earnings, GAAP operating margin and free cash flow were all-time records. Fourth quarter and full year sales increased 11.5% and 9%, respectively. Organic growth for both periods also exceeded 4%, including some modest currency headwinds about 0.6% in Q4 and about 1% headwind for the full year 2019. 
In addition, for both the fourth quarter and full year, GAAP operating margin expanded just under 120 basis points. Fourth quarter earnings were $3.06, exceeding $3 per share for the first time, an increase of 24.9% compared to last year. While we've increased our emphasis on margin improvement, we are continuing our proven strategy of disciplined capital deployment for compound growth in earnings and cash flow. 
In 2019, we deployed $484 million on complementary acquisitions. And earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of OakGate Technology, a software and hardware company focused on the test, validation and operating performance of solid-state electronic storage media. 
This is our third bolt-on acquisition for Teledyne and our last Teledyne to provide a complete set of protocol analysis software and hardware used from the design of new data storage devices, to the use of search devices in hyperscale cloud storage networks. 
Teledyne continues to benefit from our balanced portfolio of common technologies serving different complementary markets. We begin 2020, with growth in our defense businesses expected to offset declines in sales of OEM avionics. Marine instrumentation continues to recover, with growing sales, but also with orders having exceeded sales for the sixth consecutive quarter. 
In Digital Imaging, we expect to see continued strength in certain high-growth markets like micro electromechanical system for men's and a modest recovery in certain commercial machine vision market, such as the semiconductor industry. 
Given the short-cycle nature of our environmental and electronic test and measurement instrumentation businesses at this point, we're only projecting low single-digit GDP-like organic growth. 
Finally, our balance sheet remains exceptionally strong, with a quarter-end leverage ratio of 1.4x, and we are continuing to pursue acquisition opportunities. 
Before turning the call to Al, I want to emphasize that all of our financial results this morning are reported on a GAAP basis with no adjustments for amortization, stock compensation, acquisition charges, purchase accounting, restructuring or other charges. 
I will now comment on the performance of our 4 business segments."

In our Instrumentation segment, overall fourth quarter sales increased 14.5% from last year. Sales of marine instrumentation increased 14.7% organically in the quarter. And we also closed 2019 with the highest year-end backlog since 201",481,"Thank you, Robert. In our Instrumentation segment, overall fourth quarter sales increased 14.5% from last year. Sales of marine instrumentation increased 14.7% organically in the quarter. And we also closed 2019 with the highest year-end backlog since 2014. 
In addition, operating profit improved significantly. In the environmental domain, sales increased 31.9% as a result of our recent acquisition of the gas and flame detection business. In addition, greater organic sales of pollution control instrumentation were offset by lower sales of selected process gas analyzers and laboratory instruments. 
Sales of electronic test and measurement systems increased sequentially to the highest level of 2019, but decreased 6.8% year-over-year, given an especially tough comparison. For the full year, sales increased 6% organically. 
Overall, Instrumentation segment operating profit increased 38.4% in the quarter, and margin increased 340 basis points, with margins increasing for test and measurement and marine instrumentation. 
Excluding the gas and plane detection acquisition and related purchase accounting, margins also increased within the environmental instrumentation. 
Turning to the Digital Imaging segment. Fourth quarter sales increased 20.1%. Sales of our proprietary medical and dental x-ray detectors, again increased significantly year-over-year. 
Sales of geospatial sensor systems and MEMS devices also grew nicely, as did sales of advanced infrared and invisible light detectors for defense and space applications. The strong growth in these businesses more than offset some expected declines in the portion of our industrial machine vision business, which serves consumer electronics and generally factory automation markets, especially in Asia. 
However, sales of these products did increase sequentially, given some recent recovery in the semiconductor-related inspection systems. GAAP segment operating profit increased 29.8%, and margin increased 131 basis points generally as a result of the increased sales volume. 
In the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, fourth quarter sales increased 2.7%, primarily due to strong growth across the majority of our Defense Electronics businesses, partially offset by lower sales of OB and aerospace electronics. Segment operating margin decreased to 180 basis points to 19.2%. The operating margin primarily resulted from product mix differences in Defense Electronics and lower sales of commercial avionics. 
In the Engineered Systems segment, fourth quarter revenue decreased 1.7%, with greater sales related to space and energy programs, electronic manufacturing and turbine engines. More than offset by lower sales from missile defense programs and energy systems. Segment operating profit and margin was flat year-to-year. 
Before turning to Sue, I want to offer some additional commentary regarding our 2020 outlook. Given the points raised by Robert earlier, we believe that total organic revenue growth into full year 2020 will be 3% to 3.5%. In addition, the full year contribution from the scientific camera, gas and flame detection, microline and OakGate acquisition will add another $100 million or so of incremental revenue. This translates into total revenue of approximately $3.36 billion to $3.37 billion for 2020. 
I will now turn the call over to Sue."

I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert and Al, and then I will discuss the first quarter and full year 2020 outlook. 
In the fourth quarter, record cash flow from operating activities was $167.9 million compared with cash flow of $125.5 million for the same period of 2018. The cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter of 2019 reflected the impact of higher operating income, cash flow from recent acquisitions and improved working capital management. 
Free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, was $144 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared with $106.8 million in 2018. Capital expenditures were $23.9 million in the fourth quarter compared to $18.7 million for the same period of 2018. 
Depreciation and amortization expense was $29.3 million in both the fourth quarters of 2019 and 2018. 
We ended the quarter with $651.1 million of net debt, that is $850.6 million of debt less cash of $199.5 million for a net debt-to-capital ratio of 19.4%. 
Stock option compensation expense was $5.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared with $4.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the first quarter of 2020 will be in the range of $2.25 to $2.35 per share. And for the full year 2020, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $11.23 to $11.30. The 2020 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items, is expected to be 22.3%, a 170 basis point increase compared to full year 2019 due to in part to less R&D tax credits as a percentage of taxable income. 
In addition, we currently expect significantly less discrete items in 2020 compared with 2019. 
I will now pass the call back to Robert."

We ended the year with about 1.1% in terms of book-to-bill. The -- it's been a good run. There are oil prices hovered between $55 and $65 for Brent. And a lot of deepwater production is profitable below $50. So we're seeing both improvements in our seismic activities and activities for oil exploration as well as long-term oil production contracts. We think that in 2020, Marine would have increased revenues in the range of about 6.6% versus 4% in 2019. Now continuing with the second part of your question, which is why we have organic growth less than 4% or so. This year, we achieved about 4.4%. We're projecting between 3.5% for next year, that's primarily primarily affected by the 737MAX. It impacts our revenues by 1%. That's our best guess right now, which is equivalent to about $30 million. We anticipated that we would have revenues of over $40, maybe as much as $45. And because of the delays that you're very familiar with, we expect that, that would be down about -- affect our revenue about 1% or $30 million. Having said that, I think it's important to note that with even that hit that we're taking in our revenue because of our balanced portfolio, even in the Aerospace and Defense segment, we expect revenue to be flat year-over-year because the defense businesses are going to do much better this year than they did last year. So the answer to your question is primarily driven by when it comes back into production will pick it up again."

The Digital Imaging that includes machine vision is recovered modestly, where we've done well really is in the health care, which is our X-ray business and our men's areas. And we think those areas will help us as well. We think the sales in that whole Digital Imaging will increase from what was this year is about $900 million -- to about $990 million -- I'm sorry, $900 million to about $1.4 billion, $1,450,000,000. So I mean, $1,045,000,000. And so we're positive about machine vision. Of course, it is -- if the business picks up more, especially in the flat panel displays, then we'll do better."

Instrumentation had a full year margin of about 18.1%, and that was really good because it improved about 370 basis points over 2018. We think that will go up again in 2020, perhaps as much as 70 basis points. Right now, we always think you'd end up at 18.8%. And moving to Digital Imaging, Digital Imaging margins were flat year-over-year that '18 was 17.48% and '19 was 17.8%. We think we're going to get some margin improvement there, perhaps as much as 65 basis points. Aerospace and Defense and Engineered Systems, we don't think we're going to improve margins. The Aerospace and Defense, primarily because the margins are already pretty high at 20.8%, but also, as I mentioned, because of the headwind from 737Max, we think even though defense will make up for the revenue margins will stay flat. And in Engineered Systems, we think margins will remain about 9.7%. So overall, in the segment, we think that the margins will increase overall, about 45% or 45 basis points. And the company as a whole, it will be about 50 basis points. Regarding the question you asked about dilution appreciation dilution from the acquisitions, the Roper acquisition was the scientific cameras was not dilutive. Right now, gas and flame, which is a business we bought out from 3M and Micralyne, which we bought. We think they will add about -- they added about 50 basis points in dilution, probably in Q4. Or we think going forward, they will be flat. Most of our acquisitions that we make, maybe diluted that very early on because of the expenses we have in acquiring them, but after a while, they are accretive."

For the second consecutive quarter, we achieved all-time record sales, earnings per share and free cash flow. Likewise, full year 2019 was by any measure a record year, each of sales, earnings, GAAP operating margin and free cash flow were all-time records. Fourth quarter and full year sales increased 11.5% and 9%, respectively. Organic growth for both periods also exceeded 4%, including some modest currency headwinds about 0.6% in Q4 and about 1% headwind for the full year 2019. In addition, for both the fourth quarter and full year, GAAP operating margin expanded just under 120 basis points.
Fourth quarter earnings were $3.06, exceeding $3 per share for the first time, an increase of 24.9% compared to last year. While we've increased our emphasis on margin improvement, we are continuing our proven strategy of disciplined capital deployment for compound growth in earnings and cash flow.
In 2019, we deployed $484 million on complementary acquisitions. And earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of OakGate Technology, a software and hardware company focused on the test, validation and operating performance of solid-state electronic storage media. This is our third bolt-on acquisition for Teledyne LeCroy and allows Teledyne to provide a complete set of protocol analysis software and hardware used from the design of new data storage devices to the use of search devices in hyperscale cloud storage networks.
Teledyne continues to benefit from our balanced portfolio of common technologies serving different complementary market. We begin 2020 with growth in our defense businesses expected to offset declines in sales of OEM avionics. Marine instrumentation continues to recover, with growing sales, but also with orders having exceeded sales for the sixth consecutive quarter. In Digital Imaging, we expect to see continued strength in certain high-growth markets like micro electromechanical system or MEMS and a modest recovery in certain commercial machine vision market, such as the semiconductor industry.
Given the short-cycle nature of our environmental and electronic test and measurement instrumentation businesses, at this point, we're only projecting low single-digit GDP-like organic growth.
Finally, our balance sheet remains exceptionally strong, with the quarter end leverage ratio of 1.4x, and we're continuing to pursue acquisition opportunities.
Before turning the call to Al, I want to emphasize that all of our financial results this morning are reported on a GAAP basis with no adjustments for amortization, stock compensation, acquisition charges, purchase accounting, restructuring or other charges.
I will now -- Al will now comment on the performance of our 4 business segments."

In our Instrumentation segment, overall fourth quarter sales increased 14.5% from last year. Sales of marine instrumentation increased 14.7% organically in the quarter. And we also closed 2019 with the highest year-end backlog since 201",479,"Thank you, Robert. In our Instrumentation segment, overall fourth quarter sales increased 14.5% from last year. Sales of marine instrumentation increased 14.7% organically in the quarter. And we also closed 2019 with the highest year-end backlog since 2014. In addition, operating profit improved significantly.
In the environmental domain, sales increased 31.9% as a result of our recent acquisition of the Gas and Flame Detection business. In addition, greater organic sales of pollution control instrumentation were offset by lower sales of selected process gas analyzers and laboratory instruments.
Sales of electronic test and measurement systems increased sequentially to the highest level of 2019, but decreased 6.8% year-over-year given an especially tough comparison. For the full year, sales increased 6% organically.
Overall, Instrumentation segment operating profit increased 38.4% in the quarter, and margin increased 340 basis points, with margins increasing for test and measurement and marine instrumentation. Excluding the Gas and Flame Detection acquisition and related purchase accounting, margins also increased within the environmental instrumentation. 
Turning to the Digital Imaging segment. Fourth quarter sales increased 20.1%. Sales of our proprietary medical and dental X-ray detectors, again increased significantly year-over-year. Sales of geospatial sensor systems and MEMS devices also grew nicely, as did sales of advanced infrared and invisible light detectors for defense and space applications. 
The strong growth in these businesses more than offset some expected declines in the portion of our industrial machine vision business, which serves consumer electronics and generally factory automation markets, especially in Asia. However, sales of these products did increase sequentially, given some recent recovery in the semiconductor-related inspection systems. GAAP segment operating profit increased 29.8% and margin increased 131 basis points generally as a result of the increased sales volume.
In the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, fourth quarter sales increased 2.7%, primarily due to strong growth across the majority of our Defense Electronics businesses, partially offset by lower sales of OEM aerospace electronics. Segment operating margin decreased 208 basis points to 19.2%. The operating margin primarily resulted from product mix differences in Defense Electronics and lower sales of commercial avionics. 
In the Engineered Systems segment, fourth quarter revenue decreased 1.7%, with greater sales related to space and energy programs, electronic manufacturing and turbine engines, more than offset by lower sales from missile defense programs and energy systems. Segment operating profit and margin was flat year-to-year. 
Before turning to Sue, I want to offer some additional commentary regarding our 2020 outlook. Given the points raised by Robert earlier, we believe that total organic revenue growth into full year 2020 will be 3% to 3.5%. In addition, the full year contribution from the scientific camera, Gas and Flame Detection, Micralyne and OakGate acquisition will add another $100 million or so of incremental revenue. This translate to total revenue of approximately $3.36 billion to $3.37 billion for 2020.
I will now turn the call over to Sue."

I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert and Al, and then I will discuss the first quarter and full year 2020 outlook.
In the fourth quarter, record cash flow from operating activities was $167.9 million compared with cash flow of $125.5 million for the same period of 2018. The cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter of 2019 reflected the impact of higher operating income, cash flow from recent acquisitions and improved working capital management.
Free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, was $144 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared with $106.8 million in 2018. Capital expenditures were $23.9 million in the fourth quarter compared to $18.7 million for the same period of 2018.
Depreciation and amortization expense was $29.3 million in both the fourth quarters of 2019 and 2018. We ended the quarter with $651.1 million of net debt, that is $850.6 million of debt less cash of $199.5 million for a net debt-to-capital ratio of 19.4%. Stock option compensation expense was $5.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared with $4.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2018.
Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the first quarter of 2020 will be in the range of $2.25 to $2.35 per share. And for the full year 2020, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $11.20 to $11.30. The 2020 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items, is expected to be 22.3%, a 170 basis point increase compared to full year 2019 due in part to less R&D tax credits as a percentage of taxable income. In addition, we currently expect significantly less discrete items in 2020 compared with 2019.
I will now pass the call back to Robert."

We ended the year with about 1.1% in terms of book-to-bill. The -- it's been a good run. There are -- the oil prices hovered between $55 and $65 for Brent, and a lot of deepwater production is profitable below $50. So we're seeing both improvements in our seismic activities and the activities for oil exploration as well as long-term oil production contracts. We think that in 2020, marine would have increased revenues in the range of about 6.6% versus 4% in 2019.
Now continuing with the second part of your question, which is why we have organic growth less than 4% or so. This year, we achieved [ about ] 4.4%. We're projecting between 3% and 3.5% for next year, that's primarily affected by the 737MAX. It impacts our revenues by 1%. That's our best guess right now, which is equivalent to about $30 million. We anticipated that we would have revenues of over $40 million, maybe as much as $45 million. And because of the delays that you're very familiar with, we expect that, that would be down about -- affect our revenue about 1% or $30 million. 
Having said that, I think it's important that -- to note that with even that hit that we're taking in our revenue because of our balanced portfolio, even in the Aerospace and Defense segment, we expect revenue to be flat year-over-year because the defense businesses are going to do much better this year than they did last year. So the answer to your question is primarily driven by MAX. When it comes back into production, we'll pick it up again."

Where we've done well really is in the health care, which is our X-ray business and our MEMS areas. And we think those areas will help us as well.

So -- I mean $1,045,000,000. And so we're positive about machine vision. Of course, it is -- if the business picks up more, especially in the flat panel displays, then we'll do better."

We think that will go up again in 2020, perhaps as much as 70 basis points. Right now, we always think it will end up at 18.8%. And moving to Digital Imaging, Digital Imaging margins were flat year-over-year at '18 was 17.8% and '19 was 17.8%. We think we're going to get some margin improvement there, perhaps as much as 65 basis points. Aerospace and Defense and Engineered Systems, we don't think we're going to improve margins. Aerospace and Defense, primarily because the margins are already pretty high at 20.8%, but also, as I mentioned because of the headwind from 737MAX, we think even though defense will make up for the revenue, margins will stay flat. And in Engineered Systems, we think margins would remain about 9.7%. So overall, in the segment, we think that the margins will increase overall; about 45% -- or 45 basis points, and the company as a whole, it will be about 50 basis points.
Regarding the question you asked about dilution -- appreciation, dilution from the acquisitions, the Roper acquisition was the scientific cameras was not dilutive. Right now, gas and flame, which is the business we bought from 3M and Micralyne, which we bought, we think they will add about -- they added about 50 basis points in dilution, probably in Q4. Now we think going forward, they will be flat. Most of our acquisitions that we make maybe dilutive at very early on because of the expenses we have in acquiring them, but after a while, they're accreted."

This is our third bolt-on acquisition for Teledyne LeCroy and allows Teledyne to provide a complete set of protocol analysis software and hardware used from the design of new data storage devices to the use of search devices in hyperscale cloud storage networks.
Teledyne continues to benefit from our balanced portfolio of common technologies serving different complementary market. We begin 2020 with growth in our defense businesses expected to offset declines in sales of OEM avionics. Marine instrumentation continues to recover, with growing sales, but also with orders having exceeded sales for the sixth consecutive quarter. In Digital Imaging, we expect to see continued strength in certain high-growth markets like micro electromechanical system or MEMS and a modest recovery in certain commercial machine vision market, such as the semiconductor industry.
Given the short-cycle nature of our environmental and electronic test and measurement instrumentation businesses, at this point, we're only projecting low single-digit GDP-like organic growth.
Finally, our balance sheet remains exceptionally strong, with the quarter end leverage ratio of 1.4x, and we're continuing to pursue acquisition opportunities.
Before turning the call to Al, I want to emphasize that all of our financial results this morning are reported on a GAAP basis with no adjustments for amortization, stock compensation, acquisition charges, purchase accounting, restructuring or other charges.
I will now -- Al will now comment on the performance of our 4 business segments."

In our Instrumentation segment, overall fourth quarter sales increased 14.5% from last year. Sales of marine instrumentation increased 14.7% organically in the quarter. And we also closed 2019 with the highest year-end backlog since 201",479,"Thank you, Robert. In our Instrumentation segment, overall fourth quarter sales increased 14.5% from last year. Sales of marine instrumentation increased 14.7% organically in the quarter. And we also closed 2019 with the highest year-end backlog since 2014. In addition, operating profit improved significantly.
In the environmental domain, sales increased 31.9% as a result of our recent acquisition of the Gas and Flame Detection business. In addition, greater organic sales of pollution control instrumentation were offset by lower sales of selected process gas analyzers and laboratory instruments.
Sales of electronic test and measurement systems increased sequentially to the highest level of 2019, but decreased 6.8% year-over-year given an especially tough comparison. For the full year, sales increased 6% organically.
Overall, Instrumentation segment operating profit increased 38.4% in the quarter, and margin increased 340 basis points, with margins increasing for test and measurement and marine instrumentation. Excluding the Gas and Flame Detection acquisition and related purchase accounting, margins also increased within the environmental instrumentation. 
Turning to the Digital Imaging segment. Fourth quarter sales increased 20.1%. Sales of our proprietary medical and dental X-ray detectors, again increased significantly year-over-year. Sales of geospatial sensor systems and MEMS devices also grew nicely, as did sales of advanced infrared and invisible light detectors for defense and space applications. 
The strong growth in these businesses more than offset some expected declines in the portion of our industrial machine vision business, which serves consumer electronics and generally factory automation markets, especially in Asia. However, sales of these products did increase sequentially, given some recent recovery in the semiconductor-related inspection systems. GAAP segment operating profit increased 29.8% and margin increased 131 basis points generally as a result of the increased sales volume.
In the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, fourth quarter sales increased 2.7%, primarily due to strong growth across the majority of our Defense Electronics businesses, partially offset by lower sales of OEM aerospace electronics. Segment operating margin decreased 208 basis points to 19.2%. The operating margin primarily resulted from product mix differences in Defense Electronics and lower sales of commercial avionics. 
In the Engineered Systems segment, fourth quarter revenue decreased 1.7%, with greater sales related to space and energy programs, electronic manufacturing and turbine engines, more than offset by lower sales from missile defense programs and energy systems. Segment operating profit and margin was flat year-to-year. 
Before turning to Sue, I want to offer some additional commentary regarding our 2020 outlook. Given the points raised by Robert earlier, we believe that total organic revenue growth into full year 2020 will be 3% to 3.5%. In addition, the full year contribution from the scientific camera, Gas and Flame Detection, Micralyne and OakGate acquisition will add another $100 million or so of incremental revenue. This translate to total revenue of approximately $3.36 billion to $3.37 billion for 2020.
I will now turn the call over to Sue."

I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert and Al, and then I will discuss the first quarter and full year 2020 outlook.
In the fourth quarter, record cash flow from operating activities was $167.9 million compared with cash flow of $125.5 million for the same period of 2018. The cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter of 2019 reflected the impact of higher operating income, cash flow from recent acquisitions and improved working capital management.
Free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, was $144 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared with $106.8 million in 2018. Capital expenditures were $23.9 million in the fourth quarter compared to $18.7 million for the same period of 2018.
Depreciation and amortization expense was $29.3 million in both the fourth quarters of 2019 and 2018. We ended the quarter with $651.1 million of net debt, that is $850.6 million of debt less cash of $199.5 million for a net debt-to-capital ratio of 19.4%. Stock option compensation expense was $5.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared with $4.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2018.
Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the first quarter of 2020 will be in the range of $2.25 to $2.35 per share. And for the full year 2020, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $11.20 to $11.30. The 2020 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items, is expected to be 22.3%, a 170 basis point increase compared to full year 2019 due in part to less R&D tax credits as a percentage of taxable income. In addition, we currently expect significantly less discrete items in 2020 compared with 2019.
I will now pass the call back to Robert."

We ended the year with about 1.1% in terms of book-to-bill. The -- it's been a good run. There are -- the oil prices hovered between $55 and $65 for Brent, and a lot of deepwater production is profitable below $50. So we're seeing both improvements in our seismic activities and the activities for oil exploration as well as long-term oil production contracts. We think that in 2020, marine would have increased revenues in the range of about 6.6% versus 4% in 2019.
Now continuing with the second part of your question, which is why we have organic growth less than 4% or so. This year, we achieved [ about ] 4.4%. We're projecting between 3% and 3.5% for next year, that's primarily affected by the 737MAX. It impacts our revenues by 1%. That's our best guess right now, which is equivalent to about $30 million. We anticipated that we would have revenues of over $40 million, maybe as much as $45 million. And because of the delays that you're very familiar with, we expect that, that would be down about -- affect our revenue about 1% or $30 million. 
Having said that, I think it's important that -- to note that with even that hit that we're taking in our revenue because of our balanced portfolio, even in the Aerospace and Defense segment, we expect revenue to be flat year-over-year because the defense businesses are going to do much better this year than they did last year. So the answer to your question is primarily driven by MAX. When it comes back into production, we'll pick it up again."

And moving to Digital Imaging, Digital Imaging margins were flat year-over-year at '18 was 17.8% and '19 was 17.8%. We think we're going to get some margin improvement there, perhaps as much as 65 basis points. Aerospace and Defense and Engineered Systems, we don't think we're going to improve margins. Aerospace and Defense, primarily because the margins are already pretty high at 20.8%, but also, as I mentioned because of the headwind from 737MAX, we think even though defense will make up for the revenue, margins will stay flat. And in Engineered Systems, we think margins would remain about 9.7%. So overall, in the segment, we think that the margins will increase overall; about 45% -- or 45 basis points, and the company as a whole, it will be about 50 basis points.
Regarding the question you asked about dilution -- appreciation, dilution from the acquisitions, the Roper acquisition was the scientific cameras was not dilutive. Right now, gas and flame, which is the business we bought from 3M and Micralyne, which we bought, we think they will add about -- they added about 50 basis points in dilution, probably in Q4. Now we think going forward, they will be flat. Most of our acquisitions that we make maybe dilutive at very early on because of the expenses we have in acquiring them, but after a while, they're accreted."

For the second consecutive quarter, we achieved all-time record sales, earnings per share and free cash flow. Likewise, full year 2019 was by any measure a record year, each of sales, earnings, GAAP operating margin and free cash flow were all-time records. Fourth quarter and full year sales increased 11.5% and 9%, respectively. Organic growth for both periods also exceeded 4%, including some modest currency headwinds about 0.6% in Q4 and about 1% headwind for the full year 2019. In addition, for both the fourth quarter and full year, GAAP operating margin expanded just under 120 basis points.
Fourth quarter earnings were $3.06, exceeding $3 per share for the first time, an increase of 24.9% compared to last year. While we've increased our emphasis on margin improvement, we are continuing our proven strategy of disciplined capital deployment for compound growth in earnings and cash flow.
In 2019, we deployed $484 million on complementary acquisitions. And earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of OakGate Technology, a software and hardware company focused on the test, validation and operating performance of solid-state electronic storage media. This is our third bolt-on acquisition for Teledyne LeCroy and allows Teledyne to provide a complete set of protocol analysis software and hardware used from the design of new data storage devices to the use of search devices in hyperscale cloud storage networks.
Teledyne continues to benefit from our balanced portfolio of common technologies serving different complementary market. We begin 2020 with growth in our defense businesses expected to offset declines in sales of OEM avionics. Marine instrumentation continues to recover, with growing sales, but also with orders having exceeded sales for the sixth consecutive quarter. In Digital Imaging, we expect to see continued strength in certain high-growth markets like micro electromechanical system or MEMS and a modest recovery in certain commercial machine vision market, such as the semiconductor industry.
Given the short-cycle nature of our environmental and electronic test and measurement instrumentation businesses, at this point, we're only projecting low single-digit GDP-like organic growth.

Sales of geospatial sensor systems and MEMS devices also grew nicely, as did sales of advanced infrared and invisible light detectors for defense and space applications. 
The strong growth in these businesses more than offset some expected declines in the portion of our industrial machine vision business, which serves consumer electronics and generally factory automation markets, especially in Asia. However, sales of these products did increase sequentially, given some recent recovery in the semiconductor-related inspection systems. GAAP segment operating profit increased 29.8% and margin increased 131 basis points generally as a result of the increased sales volume.
In the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, fourth quarter sales increased 2.7%, primarily due to strong growth across the majority of our Defense Electronics businesses partially offset by lower sales of OEM aerospace electronics. Segment operating margin decreased 208 basis points to 19.2%. The operating margin primarily resulted from product mix differences in Defense Electronics and lower sales of commercial avionics. 
In the Engineered Systems segment, fourth quarter revenue decreased 1.7%, with greater sales related to space and energy programs, electronic manufacturing and turbine engines, more than offset by lower sales from missile defense programs and energy systems. Segment operating profit and margin was flat year-to-year. 
Before turning to Sue, I want to offer some additional commentary regarding our 2020 outlook. Given the points raised by Robert earlier, we believe that total organic revenue growth into full year 2020 will be 3% to 3.5%. In addition, the full year contribution from the scientific camera, Gas and Flame Detection, Micralyne and OakGate acquisition will add another $100 million or so of incremental revenue. This translate to total revenue of approximately $3.36 billion to $3.37 billion for 2020.
I will now turn the call over to Sue."

I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert and Al, and then I will discuss the first quarter and full year 2020 outlook.
In the fourth quarter, record cash flow from operating activities was $167.9 million compared with cash flow of $125.5 million for the same period of 2018. The cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter of 2019 reflected the impact of higher operating income, cash flow from recent acquisitions and improved working capital management.
Free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, was $144 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared with $106.8 million in 2018. Capital expenditures were $23.9 million in the fourth quarter compared to $18.7 million for the same period of 2018.
Depreciation and amortization expense was $29.3 million in both the fourth quarters of 2019 and 2018. We ended the quarter with $651.1 million of net debt, that is $850.6 million of debt less cash of $199.5 million for a net debt-to-capital ratio of 19.4%. Stock option compensation expense was $5.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared with $4.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2018.
Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the first quarter of 2020 will be in the range of $2.25 to $2.35 per share. And for the full year 2020, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $11.20 to $11.30. The 2020 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items, is expected to be 22.3%, a 170 basis point increase compared to full year 2019 due in part to less R&D tax credits as a percentage of taxable income. In addition, we currently expect significantly less discrete items in 2020 compared with 2019.

We ended the year with about 1.1% in terms of book-to-bill. The -- it's been a good run. There are -- the oil prices hovered between $55 and $65 for Brent, and a lot of deepwater production is profitable below $50. So we're seeing both improvements in our seismic activities and the activities for oil exploration as well as long-term oil production contracts. We think that in 2020, marine would have increased revenues in the range of about 6.6% versus 4% in 2019.
Now continuing with the second part of your question, which is why we have organic growth less than 4% or so. This year, we achieved [ about ] 4.4%. We're projecting between 3% and 3.5% for next year, that's primarily affected by the 737MAX. It impacts our revenues by 1%. That's our best guess right now, which is equivalent to about $30 million. We anticipated that we would have revenues of over $40 million, maybe as much as $45 million. And because of the delays that you're very familiar with, we expect that, that would be down about -- affect our revenue about 1% or $30 million. 
Having said that, I think it's important that -- to note that with even that hit that we're taking in our revenue because of our balanced portfolio, even in the Aerospace and Defense segment, we expect revenue to be flat year-over-year because the defense businesses are going to do much better this year than they did last year. So the answer to your question is primarily driven by MAX. When it comes back into production, we'll pick it up again."

We think that will go up again in 2020, perhaps as much as 70 basis points. Right now, we always think it will end up at 18.8%. And moving to Digital Imaging, Digital Imaging margins were flat year-over-year at '18 was 17.8% and '19 was 17.8%. We think we're going to get some margin improvement there, perhaps as much as 65 basis points. Aerospace and Defense and Engineered Systems, we don't think we're going to improve margins. Aerospace and Defense, primarily because the margins are already pretty high at 20.8%, but also, as I mentioned because of the headwind from 737MAX, we think even though defense will make up for the revenue, margins will stay flat. And in Engineered Systems, we think margins would remain about 9.7%. So overall, in the segment, we think that the margins will increase overall; about 45% -- or 45 basis points, and the company as a whole, it will be about 50 basis points.
Regarding the question you asked about dilution -- appreciation, dilution from the acquisitions, the Roper acquisition was the scientific cameras was not dilutive. Right now, gas and flame, which is the business we bought from 3M and Micralyne, which we bought, we think they will add about -- they added about 50 basis points in dilution, probably in Q4. Now we think going forward, they will be flat. Most of our acquisitions that we make maybe dilutive at very early on because of the expenses we have in acquiring them, but after a while, they're accreted."

For the second consecutive quarter, we achieved all-time record sales, earnings per share and free cash flow. Likewise, full year 2019 was by any measure a record year, each of sales, earnings, GAAP operating margin and free cash flow were all-time records. Fourth quarter and full year sales increased 11.5% and 9%, respectively. Organic growth for both periods also exceeded 4%, including some modest currency headwinds about 0.6% in Q4 and about 1% headwind for the full year 2019. In addition, for both the fourth quarter and full year, GAAP operating margin expanded just under 120 basis points.
Fourth quarter earnings were $3.06, exceeding $3 per share for the first time, an increase of 24.9% compared to last year. While we've increased our emphasis on margin improvement, we are continuing our proven strategy of disciplined capital deployment for compound growth in earnings and cash flow.
In 2019, we deployed $484 million on complementary acquisitions. And earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of OakGate Technology, a software and hardware company focused on the test, validation and operating performance of solid-state electronic storage media. This is our third bolt-on acquisition for Teledyne LeCroy and allows Teledyne to provide a complete set of protocol analysis software and hardware used from the design of new data storage devices to the use of search devices in hyperscale cloud storage networks.
Teledyne continues to benefit from our balanced portfolio of common technologies serving different complementary market. We begin 2020 with growth in our defense businesses expected to offset declines in sales of OEM avionics. Marine instrumentation continues to recover, with growing sales, but also with orders having exceeded sales for the sixth consecutive quarter. In Digital Imaging, we expect to see continued strength in certain high-growth markets like micro electromechanical system or MEMS and a modest recovery in certain commercial machine vision market, such as the semiconductor industry.
Given the short-cycle nature of our environmental and electronic test and measurement instrumentation businesses, at this point, we're only projecting low single-digit GDP-like organic growth.
Finally, our balance sheet remains exceptionally strong, with the quarter end leverage ratio of 1.4x, and we're continuing to pursue acquisition opportunities.

In addition, operating profit improved significantly.
In the environmental domain, sales increased 31.9% as a result of our recent acquisition of the Gas and Flame Detection business. In addition, greater organic sales of pollution control instrumentation were offset by lower sales of selected process gas analyzers and laboratory instruments.
Sales of electronic test and measurement systems increased sequentially to the highest level of 2019, but decreased 6.8% year-over-year given an especially tough comparison. For the full year, sales increased 6% organically.
Overall, Instrumentation segment operating profit increased 38.4% in the quarter, and margin increased 340 basis points, with margins increasing for test and measurement and marine instrumentation. Excluding the Gas and Flame Detection acquisition and related purchase accounting, margins also increased within the environmental instrumentation. 
Turning to the Digital Imaging segment. Fourth quarter sales increased 20.1%. Sales of our proprietary medical and dental X-ray detectors, again increased significantly year-over-year. Sales of geospatial sensor systems and MEMS devices also grew nicely, as did sales of advanced infrared and invisible light detectors for defense and space applications. 
The strong growth in these businesses more than offset some expected declines in the portion of our industrial machine vision business, which serves consumer electronics and generally factory automation markets, especially in Asia. However, sales of these products did increase sequentially, given some recent recovery in the semiconductor-related inspection systems. GAAP segment operating profit increased 29.8% and margin increased 131 basis points generally as a result of the increased sales volume.
In the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, fourth quarter sales increased 2.7%, primarily due to strong growth across the majority of our Defense Electronics businesses partially offset by lower sales of OEM aerospace electronics. Segment operating margin decreased 208 basis points to 19.2%. The operating margin primarily resulted from product mix differences in Defense Electronics and lower sales of commercial avionics.

Given the points raised by Robert earlier, we believe that total organic revenue growth into full year 2020 will be 3% to 3.5%. In addition, the full year contribution from the scientific camera, Gas and Flame Detection, Micralyne and OakGate acquisition will add another $100 million or so of incremental revenue. This translate to total revenue of approximately $3.36 billion to $3.37 billion for 2020.

In the fourth quarter, record cash flow from operating activities was $167.9 million compared with cash flow of $125.5 million for the same period of 2018. The cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter of 2019 reflected the impact of higher operating income, cash flow from recent acquisitions and improved working capital management.
Free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, was $144 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared with $106.8 million in 2018. Capital expenditures were $23.9 million in the fourth quarter compared to $18.7 million for the same period of 2018.
Depreciation and amortization expense was $29.3 million in both the fourth quarters of 2019 and 2018. We ended the quarter with $651.1 million of net debt, that is $850.6 million of debt less cash of $199.5 million for a net debt-to-capital ratio of 19.4%. Stock option compensation expense was $5.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared with $4.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2018.
Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the first quarter of 2020 will be in the range of $2.25 to $2.35 per share. And for the full year 2020, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $11.20 to $11.30. The 2020 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items, is expected to be 22.3%, a 170 basis point increase compared to full year 2019 due in part to less R&D tax credits as a percentage of taxable income. In addition, we currently expect significantly less discrete items in 2020 compared with 2019.
I will now pass the call back to Robert."

Let me start with Marine. I think our orders in marine were significant this year. We ended the year with about 1.1% in terms of book-to-bill. The -- it's been a good run.

We ended the year with about 1.1% in terms of book-to-bill. The -- it's been a good run. There are -- the oil prices hovered between $55 and $65 for Brent, and a lot of deepwater production is profitable below $50. So we're seeing both improvements in our seismic activities and the activities for oil exploration as well as long-term oil production contracts. We think that in 2020, marine would have increased revenues in the range of about 6.6% versus 4% in 2019.
Now continuing with the second part of your question, which is why we have organic growth less than 4% or so. This year, we achieved [ about ] 4.4%. We're projecting between 3% and 3.5% for next year, that's primarily affected by the 737MAX. It impacts our revenues by 1%. That's our best guess right now, which is equivalent to about $30 million. We anticipated that we would have revenues of over $40 million, maybe as much as $45 million. And because of the delays that you're very familiar with, we expect that, that would be down about -- affect our revenue about 1% or $30 million. 
Having said that, I think it's important that -- to note that with even that hit that we're taking in our revenue because of our balanced portfolio, even in the Aerospace and Defense segment, we expect revenue to be flat year-over-year because the defense businesses are going to do much better this year than they did last year. So the answer to your question is primarily driven by MAX. When it comes back into production, we'll pick it up again."

Where we've done well really is in the health care, which is our X-ray business and our MEMS areas. And we think those areas will help us as well. 
We think the sales in that whole Digital Imaging will increase from what was this year about $900 million -- to about $990 million -- I'm sorry, $900 million -- to about [ $1.4 billion, $1.450 billion ].

We think that will go up again in 2020, perhaps as much as 70 basis points. Right now, we always think it will end up at 18.8%. And moving to Digital Imaging, Digital Imaging margins were flat year-over-year at '18 was 17.8% and '19 was 17.8%. We think we're going to get some margin improvement there, perhaps as much as 65 basis points. Aerospace and Defense and Engineered Systems, we don't think we're going to improve margins. Aerospace and Defense, primarily because the margins are already pretty high at 20.8%, but also, as I mentioned because of the headwind from 737MAX, we think even though defense will make up for the revenue, margins will stay flat. And in Engineered Systems, we think margins would remain about 9.7%. So overall, in the segment, we think that the margins will increase overall; about 45% -- or 45 basis points, and the company as a whole, it will be about 50 basis points.
Regarding the question you asked about dilution -- appreciation, dilution from the acquisitions, the Roper acquisition was the scientific cameras was not dilutive. Right now, gas and flame, which is the business we bought from 3M and Micralyne, which we bought, we think they will add about -- they added about 50 basis points in dilution, probably in Q4. Now we think going forward, they will be flat. Most of our acquisitions that we make maybe dilutive at very early on because of the expenses we have in acquiring them, but after a while, they're accreted."

And we think the rest of marine, which is -- has to do with defense and security and other things that will go up from $265 million to $278 million.

For the second consecutive quarter, we achieved all-time record sales, earnings per share and free cash flow. Likewise, full year 2019 was by any measure a record year, each of sales, earnings, GAAP operating margin and free cash flow were all-time records. Fourth quarter and full year sales increased 11.5% and 9%, respectively. Organic growth for both periods also exceeded 4%, including some modest currency headwinds about 0.6% in Q4 and about 1% headwind for the full year 2019. In addition, for both the fourth quarter and full year, GAAP operating margin expanded just under 120 basis points.
Fourth quarter earnings were $3.06, exceeding $3 per share for the first time, an increase of 24.9% compared to last year. While we've increased our emphasis on margin improvement, we are continuing our proven strategy of disciplined capital deployment for compound growth in earnings and cash flow.
In 2019, we deployed $484 million on complementary acquisitions. And earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of OakGate Technology, a software and hardware company focused on the test, validation and operating performance of solid-state electronic storage media. This is our third bolt-on acquisition for Teledyne LeCroy and allows Teledyne to provide a complete set of protocol analysis software and hardware used from the design of new data storage devices to the use of search devices in hyperscale cloud storage networks.
Teledyne continues to benefit from our balanced portfolio of common technologies serving different complementary market. We begin 2020 with growth in our defense businesses expected to offset declines in sales of OEM avionics. Marine instrumentation continues to recover, with growing sales, but also with orders having exceeded sales for the sixth consecutive quarter. In Digital Imaging, we expect to see continued strength in certain high-growth markets like micro-electromechanical system or MEMS and a modest recovery in certain commercial machine vision market, such as the semiconductor industry.
Given the short-cycle nature of our environmental and electronic test and measurement instrumentation businesses, at this point, we're only projecting low single-digit GDP-like organic growth.
Finally, our balance sheet remains exceptionally strong, with a quarter-end leverage ratio of 1.4x, and we're continuing to pursue acquisition opportunities.
Before turning the call to Al, I want to emphasize that all of our financial results this morning are reported on a GAAP basis with no adjustments for amortization, stock compensation, acquisition charges, purchase accounting, restructuring or other charges.

Sales of marine instrumentation increased 14.7% organically in the quarter. And we also closed 2019 with the highest year-end backlog since 2014. In addition, operating profit improved significantly.
In the environmental domain, sales increased 31.9% as a result of our recent acquisition of the Gas and Flame Detection business. In addition, greater organic sales of pollution control instrumentation were offset by lower sales of selected process gas analyzers and laboratory instruments.
Sales of electronic test and measurement systems increased sequentially to the highest level of 2019, but decreased 6.8% year-over-year given an especially tough comparison. For the full year, sales increased 6% organically.
Overall, Instrumentation segment operating profit increased 38.4% in the quarter, and margin increased 340 basis points, with margins increasing for test and measurement and marine instrumentation. Excluding the Gas and Flame Detection acquisition and related purchase accounting, margins also increased within the environmental instrumentation.
Turning to the Digital Imaging segment. Fourth quarter sales increased 20.1%. Sales of our proprietary medical and dental X-ray detectors, again, increased significantly year-over-year. Sales of geospatial sensor systems and MEMS devices also grew nicely, as did sales of advanced infrared and visible light detectors for defense and space applications.
The strong growth in these businesses more than offset some expected declines in the portion of our industrial machine vision business, which serves consumer electronics and generally factory automation markets, especially in Asia. However, sales of these products did increase sequentially, given some recent recovery in the semiconductor-related inspection systems. GAAP segment operating profit increased 29.8% and margin increased 131 basis points generally as a result of the increased sales volume.
In the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, fourth quarter sales increased 2.7%, primarily due to strong growth across the majority of our Defense Electronics businesses, partially offset by lower sales of OEM aerospace electronics. Segment operating margin decreased 208 basis points to 19.2%. The operating margin primarily resulted from product mix differences in Defense Electronics and lower sales of commercial avionics. 
In the Engineered Systems segment, fourth quarter revenue decreased 1.7%, with greater sales related to space and energy programs, electronic manufacturing and turbine engines, more than offset by lower sales from missile defense programs and energy systems. Segment operating profit and margin was flat year-to-year. 
Before turning to Sue, I want to offer some additional commentary regarding our 2020 outlook. Given the points raised by Robert earlier, we believe that total organic revenue growth into full year 2020 will be 3% to 3.5%. In addition, the full year contribution from the scientific camera, Gas and Flame Detection, Micralyne and OakGate acquisition will add another $100 million or so of incremental revenue. This translate to total revenue of approximately $3.36 billion to $3.37 billion for 2020.
I will now turn the call over to Sue."

Let me start with marine. I think our orders in marine were significant this year. We ended the year with about 1.1% in terms of book-to-bill. The -- it's been a good run.

We ended the year with about 1.1% in terms of book-to-bill. The -- it's been a good run. There are -- the oil prices hovered between $55 and $65 for Brent, and a lot of deepwater production is profitable below $50. So we're seeing both improvements in our seismic activities and the activities for oil exploration as well as long-term oil production contracts. We think that in 2020, marine would have increased revenues in the range of about 6.6% versus 4% in 2019.
Now continuing with the second part of your question, which is why we have organic growth less than 4% or so. This year, we achieved about 4.4%. We're projecting between 3% and 3.5% for next year, that's primarily affected by the 737 MAX. It impacts our revenues by 1%. That's our best guess right now, which is equivalent to about $30 million. We anticipated that we would have revenues of over $40 million, maybe as much as $45 million. And because of the delays that you're very familiar with, we expect that, that would be down about -- affect our revenue about 1% or $30 million.
Having said that, I think it's important that -- to note that with even that hit that we're taking in our revenue because of our balanced portfolio even in the Aerospace and Defense segment, we expect revenue to be flat year-over-year because the defense businesses are going to do much better this year than they did last year. So the answer to your question is primarily driven by MAX. Whenever it comes back into production, we'll pick it up again."

We think that will go up again in 2020, perhaps as much as 70 basis points. Right now, we think it will end up at 18.8%. And moving to Digital Imaging, Digital Imaging margins were flat year-over-year at '18 it was 17.8% and '19 was 17.8%. We think we're going to get some margin improvement there, perhaps as much as 65 basis points. Aerospace and Defense and Engineered Systems, we don't think we're going to improve margins. Aerospace and Defense, primarily because the margins are already pretty high at 20.8%, but also, as I mentioned because of the headwind from 737 MAX, we think even though defense will make up for the revenue, margins will stay flat. And in Engineered Systems, we think margins would remain about 9.7%. So overall, in the segment, we think that the margins will increase overall, about 45% -- or 45 basis points, and the company as a whole, it will be about 50 basis points.
Regarding the question you asked about dilution -- appreciation, dilution from the acquisitions, the Roper acquisition was with scientific cameras, was not dilutive. Right now, Gas and Flame, which is the business we bought from 3M and Micralyne, which we bought, we think they will add about -- they added about 50 basis points in dilution, probably in Q4. Now we think going forward, they will be flat. Most of our acquisitions that we make maybe dilutive at very early on because of the expenses we have in acquiring them, but after a while, they're accreted."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our earnings call. Before discussing our results and outlook, I want to talk very briefly about our people, our response to COVID-19 and our business portfolio as a whole. Our first prior",957,"Thank you, Jason. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our earnings call. Before discussing our results and outlook, I want to talk very briefly about our people, our response to COVID-19 and our business portfolio as a whole. Our first priority remains the health and safety of our employees and their family. Employees with tasks can be done off-site have been instructed to work from home and currently, up to 40% of our total personnel are working remotely. Our corporate office has been and remains open. And all of our 70 manufacturing sites worldwide are operational, but we are maintaining social distancing, enhanced cleaning protocols and usage of personal protective equipment where appropriate. 
Our businesses can remain open because they serve critical infrastructure sectors such as the defense industrial base, water and wastewater, health care and public health. Teledyne's business portfolio also remains exceptionally well balanced across end markets and geographies. In addition, approximately 1/2 of our businesses are longer cycle, more predictable and supported by record ending -- quarter ending backlog. 
Looking back to the first quarter. We did not suffer any widespread reduction in customer demand. In fact, orders exceeded sales in each month, including March, and quarter end backlog was a record of -- at approximately $1.8 billion. Likewise, we did not incur any significant negative impact to our supply chain. Nevertheless, there were some first quarter operational challenges in manufacturing and tipping products due to our policy of maintaining appropriate employee density at the workplace, balancing employee absenteeism and the availability of our customers to accept product. 
These operational and HR matters, along with some demand and supply chain issues, likely reduced our first quarter revenue by approximately $15 million. Nevertheless, organic sales growth was positive, and overall first quarter revenue increased 5.3% from last year. GAAP earnings increased 7.4% and despite $10.4 million of pretax charges, GAAP operating margin also increased. Finally, revenue, earnings and operating margin were all records for any first quarter period. 
Now looking forward to the second quarter and the full year. The operational challenges encountered in the first quarter remain. However, there is now uncertainty regarding customer demand in the 50% of Teledyne's businesses that are shorter cycle and generally tied to corporate capital expenditures and the global economy as a whole. In addition, segment markets such as commercial aviation, although just 6% of sales in the first quarter, will be impacted beyond the next few quarters and 2020. 
While many other industrial companies have withdrawn 2020 earnings guidance, our total company has a relatively, and I emphasize relatively, high degree of predictability and stability. Nevertheless, in the current environment, we find by prudent to both lower and widen our prior expectations for revenue and earnings that we provided on January 22, 2020. 
Our current outlook is based on the following assumptions. First, at the lower end of our earnings range in the second quarter, we've assumed overall revenue contraction of approximately 6% as well as year-over-year declines in each of quarter 3 and quarter 4, although moderating by year-end. This would result in an overall full year-over-year revenue decline of approximately 2%. 
Second, at the high end of our earnings range in the second quarter, we've assumed overall revenue contraction of approximately 4%, more modest contraction in Q3 but flat year-over-year sales in Q4. This would result in roughly flat year-over-year overall sales. And by segment, for instrumentation, which is our shortest-cycle business group, we expect an overall revenue change in the second quarter ranging from negative 5% to flat. 
At the midpoint of our outlook range, we expect full year segment sales to be flat, including incremental sales contribution of about $60 million from Gas and Flame and OakGate acquisitions. 
We expect Digital Imaging to be more resilient, as nearly half of the segment serves defense-based, health care and scientific markets. This segment also has greater exposure to now ""back-at-work"" customers in Asia. Plus, given a weaker 2019 in those Digital Imaging businesses serving semiconductor inspection and factory automation, we have an easier comparison in 2020. Hence, we expect to achieve positive albeit low single-digit segment full year sales growth. 
In the other 2 segments, that is Aerospace and Defense Electronics and Engineering Systems, we continue to see our defense businesses in this segment growing at mid-single-digit rates, perhaps even high single digits, despite the ongoing operations-related challenges mentioned previously. However, we are forecasting a collapse in commercial aviation in the aerospace portion of our Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment. While less than 6% of our total sales in the first quarter, we're expecting a 40%-plus year-over-year decline in commercial aviation due to both significant air transport OEM and aftermarket declines. As a result, we expect total year-over-year segment sales to decrease approximately $90 million. 
Before turning to Al's report on the first quarter performance by segment, I want to emphasize the following. We do not know the debt and duration of the economical decline or the pace of the recovery. But as we have repeatedly shown in the past, we know how to be disciplined and performed well in challenging environment. We are aggressively managing variable costs, CapEx and cash flow and quickly and permanently reducing costs where a prolonged down-cycle is anticipated such as in aviation. 
Finally, our balance sheet is exceptionally strong with over $230 million of cash and cash equivalents and more than $600 million available under our credit facility maturing in 2024. Given our ample liquidity and the resilience of our business portfolio, we continue to review and pursue acquisition opportunities. 
Al will now comment on the performance of our 4 business segments, followed by Sue Main, who will give further financial details and present our outlook. Al?"

Sales of marine instrumentation increased 3.9% organically in the quarter. Backlog continues to grow, and it was at the highest level since early 2015. In addition, operating profit improved significantly. 
As a reminder, while marine includes products sold in the energy industry, we expect this market to directly account for just over 1/3 of total marine sales in 2020 or approximately $150 million of annual revenue compared to almost $400 million in 2014. 
In the environmental domain, sales increased 26.5% as a result of our acquisition of the Gas and Flame Detection business. In addition, we received -- we achieved organic sales growth of certain laboratory instrumentation products, but this was offset by lower sales of other industrial instruments. Sales of electronic test and measurement systems increased 2.5% due to the acquisition of OakGate. Nevertheless, organic sales were flat given continued strong demand for our protocol test instrumentation. 
Overall Instrumentation segment operating profit increased 27.3% in the first quarter, and margin increased 226 basis points, with margins increasing for test and measurement and marine instrumentation. Excluding the Gas and Flame Detection acquisition and related purchase accounting, margin was flat for environmental instrumentation. 
Turning to the Digital Imaging segment. First quarter sales increased 6.2% and included higher sales of infrared detectors for defense applications, MEMS products and X-ray detectors for life sciences. Sales along machine vision products collectively decreased slightly but nevertheless stabilized with improved orders and sales for advanced inspection camera systems. GAAP segment operating profit increased 19.7%, and margin increased 201 basis points, generally as a result of the increased sales volume. 
In the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, first quarter sales decreased 6.2% as positive 9% growth in sales of Defense Electronics was more than offset by a 35% decline in sales of commercial aerospace products. GAAP segment operating margin decreased due to lower aerospace sales but also 525 basis points of charges for severance, facility consolidations and certain contract cost adjustments. 
In the Engineering Systems segment, first quarter revenue increased 7.6% with greater sales related to marine, space and nuclear programs as well as electronic manufacturing and turbine engines, partially offset by lower sales from missile defense programs. Segment operating profit increased 468 basis points largely due to higher sales and greater mix of our higher-margin manufacturing programs.

I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert and Al, and then I will discuss our second quarter and full year 2020 outlook. 
In the first quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $76.4 million compared with cash flow of $80.1 million for the same period of 2019. The cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of 2020 reflected the timing of accounts receivable collections partially offset by the impact of higher operating income, lower income tax payments and incremental cash flow from recent acquisitions. 
Free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, was $56.2 million in the first quarter of 2020 compared with $58.8 million in 2019. Capital expenditures were $20.2 million in the first quarter compared to $21.3 million for the same period of 2019. Depreciation and amortization expense was $29.3 million in the first quarter compared to $27.6 million for the same period of 2019. 
We ended the quarter with $618.3 million of net debt. That is $849.7 million of debt less cash of $231.4 million or net debt-to-capital ratio of 18.3%. Stock option compensation expense was $7.4 million in the first quarter of 2020 compared with $8.9 million in the first quarter of 2019. 
Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the second quarter of 2020 will be in the range of $1.90 to $2.05 per share. And for the full year 2020, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $9.30 to $10. The 2020 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items, is expected to be 22.8%, a 220 basis point increase compared to full year 2019 due in part to less R&D tax credits.

The marine businesses today are really -- we expect in the midpoint to be over $425 million. Only $150 million of that or 35% about is in offshore oil exploration, offshore oil production, very little on landlord. So most of our marine businesses, the other 65% is in defense, construction and other areas. 
Going back to the oil and gas, we do have good orders so far for the year. It's over 1. It's 1.1. And we don't see any cancellations yet. Having said that, that's in the oil production. In the oil exploration, we're seeing a little bit of softening but is in our orders. And considering the price of crude and what's happened to Brent, we think that -- we expect to have some softening later in the year. So we're taking that into consideration in our guidance. 
But the good part, if there is a good part to this for us versus 2014 when oil collapsed in '15 and '16, is that at that time, the majority of our marine sales were in oil and gas. Today, it's only 35%."

We're doing a little cost takeout right now in the second quarter. And we expect that if things don't change, get worse, we'll have to take some more out. We think that overall for the year, including first quarter, margin effect is very interesting. We -- our margins are weak on the midpoint. Let me just always go with the midpoint of our guidance, which would -- Greg, would be about 9 65 in earnings in EPS and about   3 140   in revenue. Let's stay with that. 
With those numbers, I think instruments margin in the instrument segment should increase slightly, maybe as much as 15 basis points. Digital Imaging year-over-year, we believe margins can go as high as 90 basis points above last year. 
In the Aerospace and Defense, we have a different issue. Defense is going to do okay, but aerospace is going to be down significantly, and that's one of our highest-margin businesses. So we think margins over -- year-over-year will go down as much as 700 basis points. Engineered Systems will go up probably 75 to 80 basis points. So overall segments will go down because of aerospace primarily a little over 100 basis points and maybe 110. But we have cost control in the corporate domain. So overall, in the midpoint, we think margins can go down as much as 80 basis points. But that, of course, is preliminary based on everything that we know right now."

There are -- we're seeing a little disruption right now, especially in our printed circuit board -- specialized printed circuit board supply chain. 
The flip side of it is, while we have hiccups, we have a very strong procurement initiative underway that started 2 years ago actually to reduce procurement costs, and they're shifting their emphasis to working with our suppliers to ensure that we do have a reasonable supply chain. 
Hiccups? Yes, I expect that we'll have more. So far, nothing very serious. What's a little troubling on the defense side is the availability of some of our customers to approve product that we're delivering to them. For example, just a simple example, in our shallow-water combat submersibles, which are the boats we make for the special ops, we have the boat ready to test. But because of the restrictions -- COVID restrictions, our divers and the government divers can't test them. So they can't take delivery completely, and we're not getting paid completely. So there are those kinds of things happening all over. 
But going back to something I said, Jim, earlier, we know how to deal with these issues. We've done it before. We did it in 2015, '16 when oil collapsed. We did it in 2008 and 2009 when the financial crisis, so we're taking this into consideration with our guidance."

Usually, we say things like, we have tough comps with prior years. Last year, semiconductor and factory automation were, in general, relatively weak. So our comps this year against last year are better. Let me start there. 
We think machine vision, the vision systems part of our overall Digital Imaging, should be flat this year. We think overall Digital Imaging will increase. But I think the vision system would be flat, and there's some gives and takes. Our flat panel display orders are pretty good right now. Our scientific cameras are doing well. Semi is catching up. We do have some incremental sales from acquisitions that we made, Sicam from Roper and Micralyne in Canada, which makes MEMS products. So we think some of the other stuff is going to do well. Our Aerospace and Defense businesses in machine vision are doing well, and we expect them to continue. 
So overall, I'm going to say the semi and factory automation, we're lucky because last year, we had such weak revenue, so the comps are easier. The others, we're doing okay."

That market, the products that we make lag the overall market. That is our orders presently are good and will continue for the next 2 quarters. We think it will soften in Q4. So while the primes are suffering today, I think our suffering will come a little later. 
The same happens with the recovery. If the recovery comes, which would obviously depend on the overall economy, we will lag in the recovery. Having said all of that, in the overall marine businesses, which we kind of look at it as our energy businesses, we have really strong programs in the defense area, both vehicles and other areas like mine countermeasures, et cetera. So we see some downside for us. 
Recovery, as to when it will bottom, I don't know. But I think recovery for us will come later, and we will suffer the consequences of the current downturn perhaps later in the year. 
Going to commercial aerospace, I can't guess. If right now, it's -- again, we're lucky. It's 6% of our sales. We have a $90 million decline that we're projecting from last year to this year from about $211 million to $120 million or so. And again, we also there also lag the market. After the 9/11 in 2001, aviation didn't really recover until 2003. So that was a 2-year hiatus, and we suffered the consequences of that. 
So if you -- that's an indication of how long. It'll probably before things bottom, start turning up, it'd be another 2 years before we see a recovery. And frankly, that's the way we're treating these businesses. We're taking costs out permanently and very -- we've taken almost 20% of our folks out in that business. Plus the other people are on furlough and other things. 
So the long answer is the recoveries in both segments -- the aerospace should be longer time frame than energy. In my view, we won't suffer much from energy. We are taking hit from the aviation."

So our free cash should be a little lower than last year. Last year, we had about $400 million. We think this year, it'd be about $375 million, maybe even a little less. 
Having said that, we are taking very strong action now to reduce our inventories across our businesses. How successful we'll be will depend on how well we execute. If we do all of the things that we've laid off -- out to do, we might keep last year's free cash flow. 
But the other thing that happened is, if you look at 2009 versus 2008, in 2008, our free cash flow was fairly low. It was like $111 million. In 2009, when we came out of it, our free cash flow grew -- almost doubled to $190 million. The same thing happened in the '15, '16 time frame. Free cash flow went from $160 million in 2015 to $250 million in 2016. 
So the answer is this: I think we'll do okay this year. If we execute, we'll be around $375 million, maybe a little better. But if history is a lesson, we'll come out of this much stronger next year because of our ability to be disciplined. Our CapEx is going to be lower this year than last year. Al is kind of controlling that almost project-by-project justification. So I think we should be all right. And we do have cash in the bank."

The other part, the protocol, which is the standards by which the -- in Digital Imaging systems communicate, that area, we're doing really well, both here and in China. 
And so I think our T&M, test and measurement, while we expect it to be essentially flat this year, it's probably going to be a little down because of -- but we do have acquisition there. So it might be down 3% or 4%. But China is not our problem. Our problem is really right now is Europe and North America. 
Moving to environment. That's a different story. We're seeing some compression there in China. 2 reasons: one, we make a lot of product that go in air quality monitoring and measurements of air quality, continuous modeling as well as measurement, and we're seeing weaknesses there. The second thing, which is a little even more troubling, is the Chinese government emphasis that Chinese companies buy Chinese-made products. That's not as much discussed in the United States. We've had initiatives like buy America initiatives previously. But there's a strong emphasis there to do that. 
And frankly, while I don't mind assembling products there, I don't want to manufacture products there because of other issues. So we're seeing some compression there.

Everything has gone quiet since then. There are some indications that the Minister of Economy may be reconsidering. We don't know. 
Ultimately, 1 or 2 scenarios can develop. They will reaffirm the verbal veto. We have to have a written response from them because our agreement with the people we're buying it from is such that everything is in escrow until a final decision has been made. So once again, a written agreement would be one of the following: either they'll reject it, which is same as the verbal; or they'll come back and agree to a transaction but put certain conditions on it. 
Now we are used to certain conditions because we bought 2 businesses in France or have operations in France. First, e2v which we bought several years ago. And last year, we bought Gas and Flame Detection business from 3M. In both those cases, there were certain conditions in terms of because they were supplying product to the French government, et cetera; in terms of how long we kept the businesses, et cetera. And we agreed to those conditions because, frankly, they were also in our best interest. 
So we have a really good relationship with the Ministry of Economy and his offices in that domain, and we have a good track record with them. So if the conditions are not onerous, they could be onerous, then we could live with it. On the other hand, if the conditions are onerous that would damage our ability to run the company, then we won't be able to complete the transaction. So that's a long way of giving you the best answer I have. And we expect to hear from them, I don't know, it could be shortly or it could be a couple of months."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our earnings call. Before discussing our results and outlook, I want to talk very briefly about our people, our response to COVID-19 and our business portfolio as a whole. Our first pri",957,"Thank you, Jason. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our earnings call. Before discussing our results and outlook, I want to talk very briefly about our people, our response to COVID-19 and our business portfolio as a whole. 
Our first priority remains the health and safety of our employees and their family. Employees whose tasks can be done off-site have been instructed to work from home, and currently, up to 40% of our total personnel are working remotely. Our corporate office has been and remains open. And all of our 70 manufacturing sites worldwide are operational, but we are maintaining social distancing, enhanced cleaning protocols and usage of personal protective equipment where appropriate.  Our businesses can remain open because they serve critical infrastructure sectors such as the defense industrial base, water and wastewater, health care and public health. 
Teledyne's business portfolio also remains exceptionally well-balanced across end markets and geographies. In addition, approximately 1/2 of our businesses are longer cycle, more predictable and supported by record ending -- quarter ending backlog. 
Looking back to the first quarter, we did not suffer any widespread reduction in customer demand. In fact, orders exceeded sales in each month, including March, and quarter end backlog was a record of -- at approximately $1.8 billion. Likewise, we did not incur any significant negative impact to our supply chain. Nevertheless, there were some first quarter operational challenges in manufacturing and chipping products due to our policy of maintaining appropriate employee density at the workplace, balancing employee absenteeism and the availability of our customers to accept product.  These operational and HR matters, along with some demand and supply chain issues, likely reduced our first quarter revenue by approximately $15 million. Nevertheless, organic sales growth was positive, and overall first quarter revenue increased 5.3% from last year. GAAP earnings increased 7.4%. And despite $10.4 million of pretax charges, GAAP operating margin also increased. Finally, revenue, earnings and operating margin were all records for any first quarter period. 
Now looking forward to the second quarter and the full year. The operational challenges encountered in the first quarter remain. However, there is now uncertainty regarding customer demand in the 50% of Teledyne's businesses that are shorter cycle and generally tied to corporate capital expenditures and the global economy as a whole. In addition, some end markets such as commercial aviation, although just 6% of sales in the first quarter, will be impacted beyond the next few quarters and 2020. 
While many other industrial companies have withdrawn 2020 earnings guidance, our total company has a relatively, and I emphasize relatively, high degree of predictability and stability. Nevertheless, in the current environment, we find it prudent to both lower and widen our prior expectations for revenue and earnings that we provided on January 22, 2020. 
Our current outlook is based on the following assumptions. First, at the lower end of our earnings range in the second quarter, we've assumed overall revenue contraction of approximately 6% as well as year-over-year declines in each of quarter 3 and quarter 4, although moderating by year-end. This would result in an overall full year-over-year revenue decline of approximately 2%. 
Second, at the high end of our earnings range, in the second quarter, we've assumed overall revenue contraction of approximately 4%, more modest contraction in Q3, but flat year-over-year sales in Q4. This would result in roughly flat year-over-year overall sales. And by segment, for instrumentation, which is our shortest-cycle business group, we expect an overall revenue change in the second quarter ranging from negative 5% to flat. At the midpoint of our outlook range, we expect full year segment sales to be flat, including incremental sales contribution of about $60 million from Gas and Flame and OakGate acquisitions. 
We expect Digital Imaging to be more resilient, as nearly half of the segment serves defense-based health care and scientific markets. This segment also has greater exposure to now ""back-at-work"" customers in Asia. Plus, given a weaker 2019 in those Digital Imaging businesses serving semiconductor inspection and factory automation, we have an easier comparison in 2020. Hence, we expect to achieve positive albeit low single-digit segment full year sales growth. 
In the other 2 segments, that is Aerospace and Defense Electronics and Engineered Systems, we continue to see our defense businesses in this segment growing at mid-single-digit rates, perhaps even high single digits, despite the ongoing operations-related challenges mentioned previously. However, we are forecasting a collapse in commercial aviation in the aerospace portion of our Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment. While less than 6% of our total sales in the first quarter, we're expecting a 40%-plus year-over-year decline in commercial aviation due to both significant air transport OEM and aftermarket declines. As a result, we expect total year-over-year segment sales to decrease approximately $90 million. 
Before turning to Al's report on the first quarter performance by segment, I want to emphasize the following. We do not know the debt and duration of the economical decline or the pace of the recovery. But as we have repeatedly shown in the past, we know how to be disciplined and perform well in challenging environment. We are aggressively managing variable costs, CapEx and cash flow, and quickly and permanently reducing costs where a prolonged down-cycle is anticipated such as in aviation. 
Finally, our balance sheet is exceptionally strong with over $230 million of cash and cash equivalents and more than $600 million available under our credit facility maturing in 2024. Given our ample liquidity and the resilience of our business portfolio, we continue to review and pursue acquisition opportunities. 
Al will now comment on the performance of our 4 business segments, followed by Sue Main, who will give further financial details and present our outlook. Al?"

Sales of marine instrumentation increased 3.9% organically in the quarter. Backlog continues to grow, and it was at the highest level since early 2015. In addition, operating profit improved significantly. 
As a reminder, while marine includes products sold in the energy industry, we expect this market to directly account for just over 1/3 of total marine sales in 2020, or approximately $150 million of annual revenue compared to almost $400 million in 2014. 
In the environmental domain, sales increased 26.5% as a result of our acquisition of the Gas and Flame Detection business. In addition, we received -- we achieved organic sales growth of certain laboratory instrumentation products, but this was offset by lower sales of other industrial instruments. 
Sales of electronic test and measurement systems increased 2.5% due to the acquisition of OakGate. Nevertheless, organic sales were flat, given continued strong demand for our protocol test instrumentation. 
Overall Instrumentation segment operating profit increased 27.3% in the first quarter, and margin increased 226 basis points, with margins increasing for test and measurement and marine instrumentation. Excluding the Gas and Flame Detection acquisition and related purchase accounting, margin was flat for environmental instrumentation. 
Turning to the Digital Imaging segment. First quarter sales increased 6.2% and included higher sales of infrared detectors for defense applications, MEMS products and X-ray detectors for life sciences. Sales of all machine vision products collectively decreased slightly, but nevertheless stabilized with improved orders and sales for advanced inspection camera systems. GAAP segment operating profit increased 19.7%, and margin increased 201 basis points, generally as a result of the increased sales volume. 
In the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, first quarter sales decreased 6.2% as positive 9% growth in sales of defense electronics was more than offset by a 35% decline in sales of commercial aerospace products. GAAP segment operating margin decreased due to lower aerospace sales, but also 525 basis points of charges for severance, facility consolidations and certain contract cost adjustments. 
In the Engineered Systems segment, first quarter revenue increased 7.6% with greater sales related to marine, space and nuclear programs as well as electronic manufacturing and turbine engines, partially offset by lower sales from missile defense programs. Segment operating profit increased 468 basis points largely due to higher sales and greater mix of our higher-margin manufacturing programs.

I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert and Al, and then I will discuss our second quarter and full year 2020 outlook. 
In the first quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $76.4 million compared with cash flow of $80.1 million for the same period of 2019. The cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of 2020 reflected the timing of accounts receivable collections partially offset by the impact of higher operating income, lower income tax payments and incremental cash flow from recent acquisitions. 
Free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, was $56.2 million in the first quarter of 2020 compared with $58.8 million in 2019. Capital expenditures were $20.2 million in the first quarter compared to $21.3 million for the same period of 2019. Depreciation and amortization expense was $29.3 million in the first quarter compared to $27.6 million for the same period of 2019. 
We ended the quarter with $618.3 million of net debt. That is $849.7 million of debt less cash of $231.4 million, or net debt-to-capital ratio of 18.3%. Stock option compensation expense was $7.4 million in the first quarter of 2020 compared with $8.9 million in the first quarter of 2019. 
Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the second quarter of 2020 will be in the range of $1.90 to $2.05 per share. And for the full year 2020, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $9.30 to $10. The 2020 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items, is expected to be 22.8%, a 220-basis-point increase compared to full year 2019, due in part to less R&D tax credits. In addition, we currently expect significantly less discrete tax items in 2020 compared with 2019. 
Please note that the estimate for second quarter and full year 2020 GAAP diluted earnings per share exclude any future potential charge related to Airbus OneWeb satellites.

The marine businesses today are really -- we expect in the midpoint to be over $425 million. Only $150 million of that, or 35% about, is in offshore oil exploration, offshore oil production, very little on land oil. So most of our marine businesses, the other 65% is in defense, construction and other areas. 
Going back to the oil and gas, we do have good orders so far for the year. It's over 1. It's 1.1. And we don't see any cancellations yet. Having said that, that's in the oil production. In the oil exploration, we're seeing a little bit of softening, but within our orders. And considering the price of crude and what's happened to Brent, we think that -- we expect to have some softening later in the year. So we're taking that into consideration in our guidance. 
But the good part, if there is a good part to this for us, versus 2014 when oil collapsed in '15 and '16, is that at that time, the majority of our marine sales were in oil and gas. Today, it's only 35%."

We're doing a little cost takeout right now in the second quarter. And we expect that if things don't change, get worse, we'll have to take some more out. We think that overall for the year, including first quarter, can range between $0.40 and $0.50. $0.40 on the lower side. The margin effect is very interesting. We -- our margins, we -- on the midpoint. Let me just always work with the midpoint of our guidance, which would -- Greg, would be about $9.65 in earnings, in EPS, and about   3 140   in revenue. Let's stay with that.  With those numbers, I think instruments margin, in the instrument segment, should increase slightly, maybe as much as 15 basis points. Digital Imaging, year-over-year, we believe margins can go as high as 90 basis points above last year. 
In the Aerospace and Defense, we have a different issue. Defense is going to do okay, but aerospace is going to be down significantly, and that's one of our highest-margin businesses. So we think margins over -- year-over-year will go down as much as 700 basis points. Engineered Systems will go up probably 75 to 80 basis points. So overall, segments will go down because of aerospace primarily, a little over 100 basis points, maybe 110. But we have cost control in the corporate domain. So overall, in the midpoint, we think margins can go down as much as 80 basis points. But that, of course, is preliminary based on everything that we know right now."

The flip side of it is, while we have hiccups, we have a very strong procurement initiative underway that started 2 years ago actually to reduce procurement costs, and they're shifting their emphasis to working with our suppliers to ensure that we do have a reasonable supply chain. 
Hiccups. Yes, I expect that we'll have more. So far, nothing very serious. What's a little troubling on the defense side is the availability of some of our customers to approve product that we're delivering to them. For example, just a simple example, in our Shallow Water Combat Submersibles, which are the boats we make for the special ops, we have the boat ready to test. But because of the restrictions -- COVID restrictions, our divers and the government divers can't test them. So they can't take delivery completely, and we're not getting paid completely. So there are those kinds of things happening all over. 
But going back to something I said, Jim, earlier, we know how to deal with these issues. We've done it before. We did it in 2015, '16 when oil collapsed. We did it in 2008 and 2009 in the financial crisis. So we're taking this into consideration with our guidance."

We think overall, Digital Imaging will increase, but I think the vision system would be flat. And there's some gives and takes. Our flat panel display orders are pretty good right now. Our scientific cameras are doing well. Semi is catching up. We do have some incremental sales from acquisitions that we made, sci cam from Roper and Micralyne in Canada, which makes MEMS products. So we think some of the other stuff is going to do well. Our Aerospace and Defense businesses in machine vision are doing well, and we expect them to continue. 
So overall, I'm going to say the semi and factory automation, we're lucky because last year, we had such weak revenue, so the comps are easier. The others, we're doing okay."

There seems to be kind of debate or confusion around when these things actually bottom. So like are these markets now, given what's happening and the time it takes to kind of flow through, are these markets that are likely worse in '21 than they are in '20? Or is this something that -- how do you characterize the likelihood of recovery in these markets over the next 12 to 24 months?"

As I mentioned before, on the oil and gas part of our business, it's about $150 million, and it's less than 5% of our revenues today. In that market, the product that we make lag the overall market. That is our or",371,"Let me start with energy first, if I may. As I mentioned before, on the oil and gas part of our business, it's about $150 million, and it's less than 5% of our revenues today. In that market, the product that we make lag the overall market. That is our orders presently are good and will continue for the next 2 quarters, but we think it will soften in Q4. So while the primes are suffering today, I think our suffering will come a little later. 
The same happens with the recovery. If the recovery comes, which would obviously depend on the overall economy, we will lag in the recovery. Having said all of that, in the overall marine businesses, which we kind of look at it as our energy businesses, we have really strong programs in the defense area, both vehicles and other areas like mine countermeasures, et cetera. So we see some downside for us. 
Recovery, as to when it will bottom, I don't know. But I think recovery for us will come later, and we will suffer the consequences of the current downturn perhaps later in the year. 
Going to commercial aerospace, I can't guess. Right now, it's -- again, we're lucky. It's 6% of our sales. We have a $90 million decline that we're projecting from last year to this year, from about $211 million to $120 million or so. And again, we also, there, also lag the market. After the 9/11 in 2001, aviation didn't really recover until 2003. So that was a 2-year hiatus, and we suffered the consequences of that. 
So if you -- if that's an indication of how long probably  before things bottom -- start turning up, it'd be another 2 years before we see a recovery. And frankly, that's the way we're treating these businesses. We're taking cost out permanently and very -- we've taken almost 20% of our folks out in that business, plus the other people are on furlough and other things.  So the long answer is the recoveries in both segments -- the aerospace should be longer time frame than energy. In my view, we won't suffer much from the energy. We are taking hit from the aviation."

So our free cash should be a little lower than last year. Last year, we had about $400 million. We think this year, it'd be about $375 million, maybe even a little less. 
Having said that, we are taking very strong action now to reduce our inventories across our businesses. How successful we'll be will depend on how well we execute. If we do all of the things that we've laid out to do, we might keep last year's free cash flow. 
But the other thing that happened is, if you look at 2009 versus 2008, in 2008, our free cash flow was fairly low. It was like $111 million. In 2009, when we came out of it, our free cash flow grew -- almost doubles to $190 million. The same thing happened in the '15, '16 timeframe. Free cash flow went from $160 million in 2015 to $250 million in 2016. 
So the answer is this: I think we'll do okay this year. If we execute, we'll be around $375 million, maybe a little better. But if history is a lesson, we'll come out of this much stronger next year because of our ability to be disciplined. Our CapEx is going to be lower this year than last year. Al is kind of controlling that almost project-by-project justification. So I think we should be all right. And we do have cash in the bank."

One of it is oscilloscope and affiliated systems for looking at electronics hardware. The other part, the protocol, which are the standards by which the Digital Imaging systems communicate, that area, we're doing really well, both here and in China.

So it might be down 3% or 4%. But China is not our problem. Our; really, right now, is Europe and North America. 
Moving to environment. That's a different story. We're seeing some compression there in China. 2 reasons: one, we make a lot of product that go in air quality monitoring and measurements of air quality, continuous monitoring as well as measurement. And we're seeing weaknesses there. The second thing, which is a little even more troubling, is the Chinese government emphasis that Chinese companies buy Chinese-made products. That's not as much discussed in the United States. We've had initiatives like buy America initiatives previously, but there's a strong emphasis there to do that.  And frankly, while I don't mind assembling products there, I don't want to manufacture products there because of other issues. So we're seeing some compression there. And that's a little worrisome, but we do have new products. And we'll compete with everybody, and we'll get our share of the market in that business."

Photonis primarily makes night-vision products for the war fighters. And they do it for almost the rest of the world that has to have an ITAR-free product, whereas our 2 companies in this country do have ITAR restrictions. The second part of their business, related, again, is in life sciences. But 80% of their business is in defense. Now what they do have is a very nice product, nice processes. But what they have lacked, because they've been supported in -- by private equity, what they've lacked is the ability to significantly invest or acquire digital imaging companies that would complement it. Almost everything we do in our Digital Imaging is complementary to what they have, including the in-product sensors I just mentioned. So we think we will -- and digitization is obviously the future of that domain as well. So we think we bring some significant capabilities to that product. 
Now where are we? Unfortunately, on March 31, we verbally -- we were verbally notified by the foreign investment office of France that they were going to have a negative opinion by the Minister of Economy, essentially saying they are going to veto the transaction. Everything has gone quiet since then. There are some indications that the Minister of Economy may be reconsidering. We don't know.  Ultimately, 1 or 2 scenarios can develop. They will reaffirm the verbal veto. We have to have a written response from them because our agreement with the people we're buying it from is such that everything is in escrow until a final decision has been made. So once we get a written agreement would be one of the following: either they'll reject it, which is same as their verbal; or they'll come back and agree to a transaction but put certain conditions on it. 
Now we are used to certain conditions because we bought 2 businesses in France or have operations in France. First, e2v, which we bought several years ago. And last year, we bought Gas and Flame Detection business from 3M. In both those cases, there were certain conditions in terms of because they were supplying product to the French government, et cetera; in terms of how long we kept the businesses, et cetera. And we agreed to those conditions because, frankly, they were also in our best interest.  So we have a really good relationship with the Ministry of Economy and his offices in that domain, and we have a good track record with them. So if the conditions are not onerous. They could be onerous. Then we could live with it. On the other hand, if the conditions are onerous, that would damage our ability to run the company, then we won't be able to complete the transaction. So that's a long way of giving you the best answer I have. And we expect to hear from them, I don't know, it could be shortly or it could be a couple of months."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our earnings call. Before discussing our results and outlook, I want to talk very briefly about our people, our response to COVID-19 and our business portfolio as a whole. Our first pri",957,"Thank you, Jason. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our earnings call. Before discussing our results and outlook, I want to talk very briefly about our people, our response to COVID-19 and our business portfolio as a whole. 
Our first priority remains the health and safety of our employees and their family. Employees whose tasks can be done off-site have been instructed to work from home, and currently, up to 40% of our total personnel are working remotely. Our corporate office has been and remains open. And all of our 70 manufacturing sites worldwide are operational, but we are maintaining social distancing, enhanced cleaning protocols and usage of personal protective equipment where appropriate.  Our businesses can remain open because they serve critical infrastructure sectors such as the defense industrial base, water and wastewater, health care and public health. 
Teledyne's business portfolio also remains exceptionally well-balanced across end markets and geographies. In addition, approximately 1/2 of our businesses are longer cycle, more predictable and supported by record ending -- quarter ending backlog. 
Looking back to the first quarter, we did not suffer any widespread reduction in customer demand. In fact, orders exceeded sales in each month, including March, and quarter end backlog was a record of -- at approximately $1.8 billion. Likewise, we did not incur any significant negative impact to our supply chain. Nevertheless, there were some first quarter operational challenges in manufacturing and chipping products due to our policy of maintaining appropriate employee density at the workplace, balancing employee absenteeism and the availability of our customers to accept product.  These operational and HR matters, along with some demand and supply chain issues, likely reduced our first quarter revenue by approximately $15 million. Nevertheless, organic sales growth was positive, and overall first quarter revenue increased 5.3% from last year. GAAP earnings increased 7.4%. And despite $10.4 million of pretax charges, GAAP operating margin also increased. Finally, revenue, earnings and operating margin were all records for any first quarter period. 
Now looking forward to the second quarter and the full year. The operational challenges encountered in the first quarter remain. However, there is now uncertainty regarding customer demand in the 50% of Teledyne's businesses that are shorter cycle and generally tied to corporate capital expenditures and the global economy as a whole. In addition, some end markets such as commercial aviation, although just 6% of sales in the first quarter, will be impacted beyond the next few quarters and 2020. 
While many other industrial companies have withdrawn 2020 earnings guidance, our total company has a relatively, and I emphasize relatively, high degree of predictability and stability. Nevertheless, in the current environment, we find it prudent to both lower and widen our prior expectations for revenue and earnings that we provided on January 22, 2020. 
Our current outlook is based on the following assumptions. First, at the lower end of our earnings range in the second quarter, we've assumed overall revenue contraction of approximately 6% as well as year-over-year declines in each of quarter 3 and quarter 4, although moderating by year-end. This would result in an overall full year-over-year revenue decline of approximately 2%. 
Second, at the high end of our earnings range, in the second quarter, we've assumed overall revenue contraction of approximately 4%, more modest contraction in Q3, but flat year-over-year sales in Q4. This would result in roughly flat year-over-year overall sales. And by segment, for instrumentation, which is our shortest-cycle business group, we expect an overall revenue change in the second quarter ranging from negative 5% to flat. At the midpoint of our outlook range, we expect full year segment sales to be flat, including incremental sales contribution of about $60 million from Gas and Flame and OakGate acquisitions. 
We expect Digital Imaging to be more resilient, as nearly half of the segment serves defense-based health care and scientific markets. This segment also has greater exposure to now ""back-at-work"" customers in Asia. Plus, given a weaker 2019 in those Digital Imaging businesses serving semiconductor inspection and factory automation, we have an easier comparison in 2020. Hence, we expect to achieve positive albeit low single-digit segment full year sales growth. 
In the other 2 segments, that is Aerospace and Defense Electronics and Engineered Systems, we continue to see our defense businesses in this segment growing at mid-single-digit rates, perhaps even high single digits, despite the ongoing operations-related challenges mentioned previously. However, we are forecasting a collapse in commercial aviation in the aerospace portion of our Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment. While less than 6% of our total sales in the first quarter, we're expecting a 40%-plus year-over-year decline in commercial aviation due to both significant air transport OEM and aftermarket declines. As a result, we expect total year-over-year segment sales to decrease approximately $90 million. 
Before turning to Al's report on the first quarter performance by segment, I want to emphasize the following. We do not know the debt and duration of the economical decline or the pace of the recovery. But as we have repeatedly shown in the past, we know how to be disciplined and perform well in challenging environment. We are aggressively managing variable costs, CapEx and cash flow, and quickly and permanently reducing costs where a prolonged down-cycle is anticipated such as in aviation. 
Finally, our balance sheet is exceptionally strong with over $230 million of cash and cash equivalents and more than $600 million available under our credit facility maturing in 2024. Given our ample liquidity and the resilience of our business portfolio, we continue to review and pursue acquisition opportunities. 
Al will now comment on the performance of our 4 business segments, followed by Sue Main, who will give further financial details and present our outlook. Al?"

In addition, operating profit improved significantly. 
As a reminder, while marine includes products sold in the energy industry, we expect this market to directly account for just over 1/3 of total marine sales in 2020, or approximately $150 million of annual revenue compared to almost $400 million in 2014. 
In the environmental domain, sales increased 26.5% as a result of our acquisition of the Gas and Flame Detection business. In addition, we received -- we achieved organic sales growth of certain laboratory instrumentation products, but this was offset by lower sales of other industrial instruments. 
Sales of electronic test and measurement systems increased 2.5% due to the acquisition of OakGate. Nevertheless, organic sales were flat, given continued strong demand for our protocol test instrumentation. 
Overall Instrumentation segment operating profit increased 27.3% in the first quarter, and margin increased 226 basis points, with margins increasing for test and measurement and marine instrumentation. Excluding the Gas and Flame Detection acquisition and related purchase accounting, margin was flat for environmental instrumentation. 
Turning to the Digital Imaging segment. First quarter sales increased 6.2% and included higher sales of infrared detectors for defense applications, MEMS products and X-ray detectors for life sciences. Sales of all machine vision products collectively decreased slightly, but nevertheless stabilized with improved orders and sales for advanced inspection camera systems. GAAP segment operating profit increased 19.7%, and margin increased 201 basis points, generally as a result of the increased sales volume. 
In the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, first quarter sales decreased 6.2% as positive 9% growth in sales of defense electronics was more than offset by a 35% decline in sales of commercial aerospace products. GAAP segment operating margin decreased due to lower aerospace sales, but also 525 basis points of charges for severance, facility consolidations and certain contract cost adjustments. 
In the Engineered Systems segment, first quarter revenue increased 7.6% with greater sales related to marine, space and nuclear programs as well as electronic manufacturing and turbine engines, partially offset by lower sales from missile defense programs. Segment operating profit increased 468 basis points largely due to higher sales and greater mix of our higher-margin manufacturing programs. 
I will now turn the call to Sue, who will offer some additional commentary regarding the first quarter and our 2020 outlook."

I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert and Al, and then I will discuss our second quarter and full year 2020 outlook. 
In the first quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $76.4 million compared with cash flow of $80.1 million for the same period of 2019. The cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of 2020 reflected the timing of accounts receivable collections partially offset by the impact of higher operating income, lower income tax payments and incremental cash flow from recent acquisitions. 
Free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, was $56.2 million in the first quarter of 2020 compared with $58.8 million in 2019. Capital expenditures were $20.2 million in the first quarter compared to $21.3 million for the same period of 2019. Depreciation and amortization expense was $29.3 million in the first quarter compared to $27.6 million for the same period of 2019. 
We ended the quarter with $618.3 million of net debt. That is $849.7 million of debt less cash of $231.4 million, or net debt-to-capital ratio of 18.3%. Stock option compensation expense was $7.4 million in the first quarter of 2020 compared with $8.9 million in the first quarter of 2019. 
Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the second quarter of 2020 will be in the range of $1.90 to $2.05 per share. And for the full year 2020, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $9.30 to $10. The 2020 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items, is expected to be 22.8%, a 220-basis-point increase compared to full year 2019, due in part to less R&D tax credits. In addition, we currently expect significantly less discrete tax items in 2020 compared with 2019. 
Please note that the estimate for second quarter and full year 2020 GAAP diluted earnings per share exclude any future potential charge related to Airbus OneWeb satellites. 
I will now pass the call back to Robert."

The marine businesses today are really -- we expect in the midpoint to be over $425 million. Only $150 million of that, or 35% about, is in offshore oil exploration, offshore oil production, very little on land oil. So most of our marine businesses, the other 65% is in defense, construction and other areas. 
Going back to the oil and gas, we do have good orders so far for the year. It's over 1. It's 1.1. And we don't see any cancellations yet. Having said that, that's in the oil production. In the oil exploration, we're seeing a little bit of softening, but within our orders. And considering the price of crude and what's happened to Brent, we think that -- we expect to have some softening later in the year. So we're taking that into consideration in our guidance. 
But the good part, if there is a good part to this for us, versus 2014 when oil collapsed in '15 and '16, is that at that time, the majority of our marine sales were in oil and gas. Today, it's only 35%."

We're doing a little cost takeout right now in the second quarter. And we expect that if things don't change, get worse, we'll have to take some more out. We think that overall for the year, including first quarter, can range between $0.40 and $0.50. $0.40 on the lower side. The margin effect is very interesting. We -- our margins, we -- on the midpoint. Let me just always work with the midpoint of our guidance, which would -- Greg, would be about $9.65 in earnings, in EPS, and about  [ 3 140 ]   in revenue. Let's stay with that.  With those numbers, I think instruments margin, in the instrument segment, should increase slightly, maybe as much as 15 basis points. Digital Imaging, year-over-year, we believe margins can go as high as 90 basis points above last year. 
In the Aerospace and Defense, we have a different issue. Defense is going to do okay, but aerospace is going to be down significantly, and that's one of our highest-margin businesses. So we think margins over -- year-over-year will go down as much as 700 basis points. Engineered Systems will go up probably 75 to 80 basis points. So overall, segments will go down because of aerospace primarily, a little over 100 basis points, maybe 110. But we have cost control in the corporate domain. So overall, in the midpoint, we think margins can go down as much as 80 basis points. But that, of course, is preliminary based on everything that we know right now."

There are -- we're seeing a little disruption right now, especially in our printed circuit board -- specialized printed circuit board supply chain.  The flip side of it is, while we have hiccups, we have a very strong procurement initiative underway that started 2 years ago actually to reduce procurement costs, and they're shifting their emphasis to working with our suppliers to ensure that we do have a reasonable supply chain. 
Hiccups. Yes, I expect that we'll have more. So far, nothing very serious. What's a little troubling on the defense side is the availability of some of our customers to approve product that we're delivering to them. For example, just a simple example, in our Shallow Water Combat Submersibles, which are the boats we make for the special ops, we have the boat ready to test. But because of the restrictions -- COVID restrictions, our divers and the government divers can't test them. So they can't take delivery completely, and we're not getting paid completely. So there are those kinds of things happening all over. 
But going back to something I said, Jim, earlier, we know how to deal with these issues. We've done it before. We did it in 2015, '16 when oil collapsed. We did it in 2008 and 2009 in the financial crisis. So we're taking this into consideration with our guidance."

Usually, we say things like, we have a tough comps with prior year. Last year, semiconductor and factory automation were, in general, relatively weak. So our comps this year against last year are better. Let me start there. 
We think machine vision, the vision systems part of our overall Digital Imaging, should be flat this year. We think overall, Digital Imaging will increase, but I think the vision system would be flat. And there's some gives and takes. Our flat panel display orders are pretty good right now. Our scientific cameras are doing well. Semi is catching up. We do have some incremental sales from acquisitions that we made, sci cam from Roper and Micralyne in Canada, which makes MEMS products. So we think some of the other stuff is going to do well. Our Aerospace and Defense businesses in machine vision are doing well, and we expect them to continue. 
So overall, I'm going to say the semi and factory automation, we're lucky because last year, we had such weak revenue, so the comps are easier. The others, we're doing okay."

In that market, the product that we make lag the overall market. That is our orders presently are good and will continue for the next 2 quarters, but we think it will soften in Q4. So while the primes are suffering today, I think our suffering will come a little later. 
The same happens with the recovery. If the recovery comes, which would obviously depend on the overall economy, we will lag in the recovery. Having said all of that, in the overall marine businesses, which we kind of look at it as our energy businesses, we have really strong programs in the defense area, both vehicles and other areas like mine countermeasures, et cetera. So we see some downside for us. 
Recovery, as to when it will bottom, I don't know. But I think recovery for us will come later, and we will suffer the consequences of the current downturn perhaps later in the year. 
Going to commercial aerospace, I can't guess. Right now, it's -- again, we're lucky. It's 6% of our sales. We have a $90 million decline that we're projecting from last year to this year, from about $211 million to $120 million or so. And again, we also, there, also lag the market. After the 9/11 in 2001, aviation didn't really recover until 2003. So that was a 2-year hiatus, and we suffered the consequences of that. 
So if you -- if that's an indication of how long probably  before things bottom -- start turning up, it'd be another 2 years before we see a recovery. And frankly, that's the way we're treating these businesses. We're taking cost out permanently and very -- we've taken almost 20% of our folks out in that business, plus the other people are on furlough and other things.  So the long answer is the recoveries in both segments -- the aerospace should be longer time frame than energy. In my view, we won't suffer much from the energy. We are taking hit from the aviation."

Having said that, we are taking very strong action now to reduce our inventories across our businesses. How successful we'll be will depend on how well we execute. If we do all of the things that we've laid out to do, we might keep last year's free cash flow. 
But the other thing that happened is, if you look at 2009 versus 2008, in 2008, our free cash flow was fairly low. It was like $111 million. In 2009, when we came out of it, our free cash flow grew -- almost doubles to $190 million. The same thing happened in the '15, '16 timeframe. Free cash flow went from $160 million in 2015 to $250 million in 2016. 
So the answer is this: I think we'll do okay this year. If we execute, we'll be around $375 million, maybe a little better. But if history is a lesson, we'll come out of this much stronger next year because of our ability to be disciplined. Our CapEx is going to be lower this year than last year.

Moving to environment. That's a different story. We're seeing some compression there in China. 2 reasons: one, we make a lot of product that go in air quality monitoring and measurements of air quality, continuous monitoring as well as measurement. And we're seeing weaknesses there. The second thing, which is a little even more troubling, is the Chinese government emphasis that Chinese companies buy Chinese-made products. That's not as much discussed in the United States. We've had initiatives like buy America initiatives previously, but there's a strong emphasis there to do that.  And frankly, while I don't mind assembling products there, I don't want to manufacture products there because of other issues. So we're seeing some compression there.

Let me start with the latter part of the question, Andrew, if I may. As I mentioned, unlike other companies that are making such devices, we make the sensors ourselves in our MEMS foundry in Canada, in Bromont. And we make it on a wafer-level packaging scale. So we are the -- our own supply chain. So that's the good part.  
The cameras are called Calibir. And we've been making various versions of the Calibir camera for about a year or longer. The ones that we're talking about are handheld. They're our newest product. They're just being manufactured. I cannot tell you how fast we can grow that. But obviously, we're going to do our best to increase production as fast as we can. Our cameras are also -- lastly, the sensors that we use, that we make, are vanadium-based -- vanadium oxide-based sensors. Really nice sensors, 17-micron pixels. Whereas a lot of the other products around the world are made from amorphous silicon. So we think we have a niche there. I know there are some other companies that have had really a ton of publicity because of this domain. I don't know whether this is going to move the needle in a $3.2 billion revenue company."

Photonis primarily makes night-vision products for the war fighters. And they do it for almost the rest of the world that has to have an ITAR-free product, whereas our 2 companies in this country do have ITAR restrictions. The second part of their business, related, again, is in life sciences. But 80% of their business is in defense. Now what they do have is a very nice product, nice processes. But what they have lacked, because they've been supported in -- by private equity, what they've lacked is the ability to significantly invest or acquire digital imaging companies that would complement it. Almost everything we do in our Digital Imaging is complementary to what they have, including the in-product sensors I just mentioned. So we think we will -- and digitization is obviously the future of that domain as well. So we think we bring some significant capabilities to that product. 
Now where are we? Unfortunately, on March 31, we verbally -- we were verbally notified by the foreign investment office of France that they were going to have a negative opinion by the Minister of Economy, essentially saying they are going to veto the transaction. Everything has gone quiet since then. There are some indications that the Minister of Economy may be reconsidering. We don't know.  Ultimately, 1 or 2 scenarios can develop. They will reaffirm the verbal veto. We have to have a written response from them because our agreement with the people we're buying it from is such that everything is in escrow until a final decision has been made. So once we get a written agreement would be one of the following: either they'll reject it, which is same as their verbal; or they'll come back and agree to a transaction but put certain conditions on it. 
Now we are used to certain conditions because we bought 2 businesses in France or have operations in France. First, e2v, which we bought several years ago. And last year, we bought Gas and Flame Detection business from 3M. In both those cases, there were certain conditions in terms of because they were supplying product to the French government, et cetera; in terms of how long we kept the businesses, et cetera. And we agreed to those conditions because, frankly, they were also in our best interest.  So we have a really good relationship with the Ministry of Economy and his offices in that domain, and we have a good track record with them. So if the conditions are not onerous. They could be onerous. Then we could live with it. On the other hand, if the conditions are onerous, that would damage our ability to run the company, then we won't be able to complete the transaction. So that's a long way of giving you the best answer I have. And we expect to hear from them, I don't know, it could be shortly or it could be a couple of months."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our earnings call. Before discussing our results and outlook, I want to talk very briefly about our people, our response to COVID-19 and our business portfolio as a whole. Our first pri",957,"Thank you, Jason. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our earnings call. Before discussing our results and outlook, I want to talk very briefly about our people, our response to COVID-19 and our business portfolio as a whole. 
Our first priority remains the health and safety of our employees and their family. Employees whose tasks can be done off-site have been instructed to work from home, and currently, up to 40% of our total personnel are working remotely. Our corporate office has been and remains open. And all of our 70 manufacturing sites worldwide are operational, but we are maintaining social distancing, enhanced cleaning protocols and usage of personal protective equipment where appropriate.  Our businesses can remain open because they serve critical infrastructure sectors such as the defense industrial base, water and wastewater, health care and public health. 
Teledyne's business portfolio also remains exceptionally well-balanced across end markets and geographies. In addition, approximately 1/2 of our businesses are longer cycle, more predictable and supported by record ending -- quarter ending backlog. 
Looking back to the first quarter, we did not suffer any widespread reduction in customer demand. In fact, orders exceeded sales in each month, including March, and quarter end backlog was a record of -- at approximately $1.8 billion. Likewise, we did not incur any significant negative impact to our supply chain. Nevertheless, there were some first quarter operational challenges in manufacturing and chipping products due to our policy of maintaining appropriate employee density at the workplace, balancing employee absenteeism and the availability of our customers to accept product.  These operational and HR matters, along with some demand and supply chain issues, likely reduced our first quarter revenue by approximately $15 million. Nevertheless, organic sales growth was positive, and overall first quarter revenue increased 5.3% from last year. GAAP earnings increased 7.4%. And despite $10.4 million of pretax charges, GAAP operating margin also increased. Finally, revenue, earnings and operating margin were all records for any first quarter period. 
Now looking forward to the second quarter and the full year. The operational challenges encountered in the first quarter remain. However, there is now uncertainty regarding customer demand in the 50% of Teledyne's businesses that are shorter cycle and generally tied to corporate capital expenditures and the global economy as a whole. In addition, some end markets such as commercial aviation, although just 6% of sales in the first quarter, will be impacted beyond the next few quarters and 2020. 
While many other industrial companies have withdrawn 2020 earnings guidance, our total company has a relatively, and I emphasize relatively, high degree of predictability and stability. Nevertheless, in the current environment, we find it prudent to both lower and widen our prior expectations for revenue and earnings that we provided on January 22, 2020. 
Our current outlook is based on the following assumptions. First, at the lower end of our earnings range in the second quarter, we've assumed overall revenue contraction of approximately 6% as well as year-over-year declines in each of quarter 3 and quarter 4, although moderating by year-end. This would result in an overall full year-over-year revenue decline of approximately 2%. 
Second, at the high end of our earnings range, in the second quarter, we've assumed overall revenue contraction of approximately 4%, more modest contraction in Q3, but flat year-over-year sales in Q4. This would result in roughly flat year-over-year overall sales. And by segment, for instrumentation, which is our shortest-cycle business group, we expect an overall revenue change in the second quarter ranging from negative 5% to flat. At the midpoint of our outlook range, we expect full year segment sales to be flat, including incremental sales contribution of about $60 million from Gas and Flame and OakGate acquisitions. 
We expect Digital Imaging to be more resilient, as nearly half of the segment serves defense-based health care and scientific markets. This segment also has greater exposure to now ""back-at-work"" customers in Asia. Plus, given a weaker 2019 in those Digital Imaging businesses serving semiconductor inspection and factory automation, we have an easier comparison in 2020. Hence, we expect to achieve positive albeit low single-digit segment full year sales growth. 
In the other 2 segments, that is Aerospace and Defense Electronics and Engineered Systems, we continue to see our defense businesses in this segment growing at mid-single-digit rates, perhaps even high single digits, despite the ongoing operations-related challenges mentioned previously. However, we are forecasting a collapse in commercial aviation in the aerospace portion of our Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment. While less than 6% of our total sales in the first quarter, we're expecting a 40%-plus year-over-year decline in commercial aviation due to both significant air transport OEM and aftermarket declines. As a result, we expect total year-over-year segment sales to decrease approximately $90 million. 
Before turning to Al's report on the first quarter performance by segment, I want to emphasize the following. We do not know the debt and duration of the economical decline or the pace of the recovery. But as we have repeatedly shown in the past, we know how to be disciplined and perform well in challenging environment. We are aggressively managing variable costs, CapEx and cash flow, and quickly and permanently reducing costs where a prolonged down-cycle is anticipated such as in aviation. 
Finally, our balance sheet is exceptionally strong with over $230 million of cash and cash equivalents and more than $600 million available under our credit facility maturing in 2024. Given our ample liquidity and the resilience of our business portfolio, we continue to review and pursue acquisition opportunities. 
Al will now comment on the performance of our 4 business segments, followed by Sue Main, who will give further financial details and present our outlook. Al?"

Sales of marine instrumentation increased 3.9% organically in the quarter. Backlog continues to grow, and it was at the highest level since early 2015. In addition, operating profit improved significantly. 
As a reminder, while marine includes products sold in the energy industry, we expect this market to directly account for just over 1/3 of total marine sales in 2020, or approximately $150 million of annual revenue compared to almost $400 million in 2014. 
In the environmental domain, sales increased 26.5% as a result of our acquisition of the Gas and Flame Detection business. In addition, we received -- we achieved organic sales growth of certain laboratory instrumentation products, but this was offset by lower sales of other industrial instruments. 
Sales of electronic test and measurement systems increased 2.5% due to the acquisition of OakGate. Nevertheless, organic sales were flat, given continued strong demand for our protocol test instrumentation. 
Overall Instrumentation segment operating profit increased 27.3% in the first quarter, and margin increased 226 basis points, with margins increasing for test and measurement and marine instrumentation. Excluding the Gas and Flame Detection acquisition and related purchase accounting, margin was flat for environmental instrumentation. 
Turning to the Digital Imaging segment. First quarter sales increased 6.2% and included higher sales of infrared detectors for defense applications, MEMS products and X-ray detectors for life sciences. Sales of all machine vision products collectively decreased slightly, but nevertheless stabilized with improved orders and sales for advanced inspection camera systems. GAAP segment operating profit increased 19.7%, and margin increased 201 basis points, generally as a result of the increased sales volume. 
In the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, first quarter sales decreased 6.2% as positive 9% growth in sales of defense electronics was more than offset by a 35% decline in sales of commercial aerospace products. GAAP segment operating margin decreased due to lower aerospace sales, but also 525 basis points of charges for severance, facility consolidations and certain contract cost adjustments. 
In the Engineered Systems segment, first quarter revenue increased 7.6% with greater sales related to marine, space and nuclear programs as well as electronic manufacturing and turbine engines, partially offset by lower sales from missile defense programs. Segment operating profit increased 468 basis points largely due to higher sales and greater mix of our higher-margin manufacturing programs.

I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert and Al, and then I will discuss our second quarter and full year 2020 outlook. 
In the first quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $76.4 million compared with cash flow of $80.1 million for the same period of 2019. The cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of 2020 reflected the timing of accounts receivable collections partially offset by the impact of higher operating income, lower income tax payments and incremental cash flow from recent acquisitions. 
Free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, was $56.2 million in the first quarter of 2020 compared with $58.8 million in 2019. Capital expenditures were $20.2 million in the first quarter compared to $21.3 million for the same period of 2019. Depreciation and amortization expense was $29.3 million in the first quarter compared to $27.6 million for the same period of 2019. 
We ended the quarter with $618.3 million of net debt. That is $849.7 million of debt less cash of $231.4 million, or net debt-to-capital ratio of 18.3%. Stock option compensation expense was $7.4 million in the first quarter of 2020 compared with $8.9 million in the first quarter of 2019. 
Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the second quarter of 2020 will be in the range of $1.90 to $2.05 per share. And for the full year 2020, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $9.30 to $10. The 2020 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items, is expected to be 22.8%, a 220-basis-point increase compared to full year 2019, due in part to less R&D tax credits. In addition, we currently expect significantly less discrete tax items in 2020 compared with 2019. 
Please note that the estimate for second quarter and full year 2020 GAAP diluted earnings per share exclude any future potential charge related to Airbus OneWeb satellites.

The marine businesses today are really -- we expect in the midpoint to be over $425 million. Only $150 million of that, or 35% about, is in offshore oil exploration, offshore oil production, very little on land oil. So most of our marine businesses, the other 65% is in defense, construction and other areas. 
Going back to the oil and gas, we do have good orders so far for the year. It's over 1. It's 1.1. And we don't see any cancellations yet. Having said that, that's in the oil production. In the oil exploration, we're seeing a little bit of softening, but within our orders. And considering the price of crude and what's happened to Brent, we think that -- we expect to have some softening later in the year. So we're taking that into consideration in our guidance. 
But the good part, if there is a good part to this for us, versus 2014 when oil collapsed in '15 and '16, is that at that time, the majority of our marine sales were in oil and gas. Today, it's only 35%."

We think that overall for the year, including first quarter, can range between $0.40 and $0.50. $0.40 on the lower side. The margin effect is very interesting. We -- our margins, we -- on the midpoint. Let me just always work with the midpoint of our guidance, which would -- Greg, would be about $9.65 in earnings, in EPS, and about  [ 3 140 ]   in revenue. Let's stay with that.  With those numbers, I think instruments margin, in the instrument segment, should increase slightly, maybe as much as 15 basis points. Digital Imaging, year-over-year, we believe margins can go as high as 90 basis points above last year. 
In the Aerospace and Defense, we have a different issue. Defense is going to do okay, but aerospace is going to be down significantly, and that's one of our highest-margin businesses. So we think margins over -- year-over-year will go down as much as 700 basis points. Engineered Systems will go up probably 75 to 80 basis points. So overall, segments will go down because of aerospace primarily, a little over 100 basis points, maybe 110. But we have cost control in the corporate domain. So overall, in the midpoint, we think margins can go down as much as 80 basis points. But that, of course, is preliminary based on everything that we know right now."

There are -- we're seeing a little disruption right now, especially in our printed circuit board -- specialized printed circuit board supply chain.  The flip side of it is, while we have hiccups, we have a very strong procurement initiative underway that started 2 years ago actually to reduce procurement costs, and they're shifting their emphasis to working with our suppliers to ensure that we do have a reasonable supply chain. 
Hiccups. Yes, I expect that we'll have more. So far, nothing very serious. What's a little troubling on the defense side is the availability of some of our customers to approve product that we're delivering to them. For example, just a simple example, in our Shallow Water Combat Submersibles, which are the boats we make for the special ops, we have the boat ready to test. But because of the restrictions -- COVID restrictions, our divers and the government divers can't test them. So they can't take delivery completely, and we're not getting paid completely. So there are those kinds of things happening all over. 
But going back to something I said, Jim, earlier, we know how to deal with these issues. We've done it before. We did it in 2015, '16 when oil collapsed. We did it in 2008 and 2009 in the financial crisis. So we're taking this into consideration with our guidance."

Usually, we say things like, we have a tough comps with prior year. Last year, semiconductor and factory automation were, in general, relatively weak. So our comps this year against last year are better. Let me start there. 
We think machine vision, the vision systems part of our overall Digital Imaging, should be flat this year. We think overall, Digital Imaging will increase, but I think the vision system would be flat. And there's some gives and takes. Our flat panel display orders are pretty good right now. Our scientific cameras are doing well. Semi is catching up. We do have some incremental sales from acquisitions that we made, sci cam from Roper and Micralyne in Canada, which makes MEMS products. So we think some of the other stuff is going to do well. Our Aerospace and Defense businesses in machine vision are doing well, and we expect them to continue. 
So overall, I'm going to say the semi and factory automation, we're lucky because last year, we had such weak revenue, so the comps are easier. The others, we're doing okay."

That is our or",371,"Let me start with energy first, if I may. As I mentioned before, on the oil and gas part of our business, it's about $150 million, and it's less than 5% of our revenues today. In that market, the product that we make lag the overall market. That is our orders presently are good and will continue for the next 2 quarters, but we think it will soften in Q4. So while the primes are suffering today, I think our suffering will come a little later. 
The same happens with the recovery. If the recovery comes, which would obviously depend on the overall economy, we will lag in the recovery. Having said all of that, in the overall marine businesses, which we kind of look at it as our energy businesses, we have really strong programs in the defense area, both vehicles and other areas like mine countermeasures, et cetera. So we see some downside for us. 
Recovery, as to when it will bottom, I don't know. But I think recovery for us will come later, and we will suffer the consequences of the current downturn perhaps later in the year. 
Going to commercial aerospace, I can't guess. Right now, it's -- again, we're lucky. It's 6% of our sales. We have a $90 million decline that we're projecting from last year to this year, from about $211 million to $120 million or so. And again, we also, there, also lag the market. After the 9/11 in 2001, aviation didn't really recover until 2003. So that was a 2-year hiatus, and we suffered the consequences of that. 
So if you -- if that's an indication of how long probably  before things bottom -- start turning up, it'd be another 2 years before we see a recovery. And frankly, that's the way we're treating these businesses. We're taking cost out permanently and very -- we've taken almost 20% of our folks out in that business, plus the other people are on furlough and other things.  So the long answer is the recoveries in both segments -- the aerospace should be longer time frame than energy. In my view, we won't suffer much from the energy. We are taking hit from the aviation."

So our free cash should be a little lower than last year. Last year, we had about $400 million. We think this year, it'd be about $375 million, maybe even a little less. 
Having said that, we are taking very strong action now to reduce our inventories across our businesses. How successful we'll be will depend on how well we execute. If we do all of the things that we've laid out to do, we might keep last year's free cash flow. 
But the other thing that happened is, if you look at 2009 versus 2008, in 2008, our free cash flow was fairly low. It was like $111 million. In 2009, when we came out of it, our free cash flow grew -- almost doubles to $190 million. The same thing happened in the '15, '16 timeframe. Free cash flow went from $160 million in 2015 to $250 million in 2016. 
So the answer is this: I think we'll do okay this year. If we execute, we'll be around $375 million, maybe a little better. But if history is a lesson, we'll come out of this much stronger next year because of our ability to be disciplined. Our CapEx is going to be lower this year than last year. Al is kind of controlling that almost project-by-project justification. So I think we should be all right. And we do have cash in the bank."

One of it is oscilloscope and affiliated systems for looking at electronics hardware. The other part, the protocol, which are the standards by which the Digital Imaging systems communicate, that area, we're doing really well, both here and in China.  And so I think our T&M, test and measurement, while we expect it to be essentially flat this year, it's; probably going to be a little down because of -- but we do have acquisition there. So it might be down 3% or 4%. But China is not our problem. Our; really, right now, is Europe and North America. 
Moving to environment. That's a different story. We're seeing some compression there in China. 2 reasons: one, we make a lot of product that go in air quality monitoring and measurements of air quality, continuous monitoring as well as measurement. And we're seeing weaknesses there. The second thing, which is a little even more troubling, is the Chinese government emphasis that Chinese companies buy Chinese-made products. That's not as much discussed in the United States. We've had initiatives like buy America initiatives previously, but there's a strong emphasis there to do that.  And frankly, while I don't mind assembling products there, I don't want to manufacture products there because of other issues. So we're seeing some compression there. And that's a little worrisome, but we do have new products. And we'll compete with everybody, and we'll get our share of the market in that business."

The cameras are called Calibir. And we've been making various versions of the Calibir camera for about a year or longer. The ones that we're talking about are handheld. They're our newest product. They're just being manufactured. I cannot tell you how fast we can grow that. But obviously, we're going to do our best to increase production as fast as we can. Our cameras are also -- lastly, the sensors that we use, that we make, are vanadium-based -- vanadium oxide-based sensors. Really nice sensors, 17-micron pixels.

And they do it for almost the rest of the world that has to have an ITAR-free product, whereas our 2 companies in this country do have ITAR restrictions. The second part of their business, related, again, is in life sciences. But 80% of their business is in defense. Now what they do have is a very nice product, nice processes. But what they have lacked, because they've been supported in -- by private equity, what they've lacked is the ability to significantly invest or acquire digital imaging companies that would complement it. Almost everything we do in our Digital Imaging is complementary to what they have, including the in-product sensors I just mentioned. So we think we will -- and digitization is obviously the future of that domain as well. So we think we bring some significant capabilities to that product. 
Now where are we? Unfortunately, on March 31, we verbally -- we were verbally notified by the foreign investment office of France that they were going to have a negative opinion by the Minister of Economy, essentially saying they are going to veto the transaction. Everything has gone quiet since then. There are some indications that the Minister of Economy may be reconsidering. We don't know.  Ultimately, 1 or 2 scenarios can develop. They will reaffirm the verbal veto. We have to have a written response from them because our agreement with the people we're buying it from is such that everything is in escrow until a final decision has been made. So once we get a written agreement would be one of the following: either they'll reject it, which is same as their verbal; or they'll come back and agree to a transaction but put certain conditions on it. 
Now we are used to certain conditions because we bought 2 businesses in France or have operations in France. First, e2v, which we bought several years ago. And last year, we bought Gas and Flame Detection business from 3M. In both those cases, there were certain conditions in terms of because they were supplying product to the French government, et cetera; in terms of how long we kept the businesses, et cetera. And we agreed to those conditions because, frankly, they were also in our best interest.  So we have a really good relationship with the Ministry of Economy and his offices in that domain, and we have a good track record with them. So if the conditions are not onerous. They could be onerous. Then we could live with it. On the other hand, if the conditions are onerous, that would damage our ability to run the company, then we won't be able to complete the transaction. So that's a long way of giving you the best answer I have. And we expect to hear from them, I don't know, it could be shortly or it could be a couple of months."

Teledyne's business portfolio also remains exceptionally well-balanced across end markets and geographies. In addition, approximately 1/2 of our businesses are longer cycle, more predictable and supported by record ending -- quarter ending backlog. 
Looking back to the first quarter, we did not suffer any widespread reduction in customer demand. In fact, orders exceeded sales in each month, including March, and quarter end backlog was a record of -- at approximately $1.8 billion. Likewise, we did not incur any significant negative impact to our supply chain. Nevertheless, there were some first quarter operational challenges in manufacturing and chipping products due to our policy of maintaining appropriate employee density at the workplace, balancing employee absenteeism and the availability of our customers to accept product.  These operational and HR matters, along with some demand and supply chain issues, likely reduced our first quarter revenue by approximately $15 million. Nevertheless, organic sales growth was positive, and overall first quarter revenue increased 5.3% from last year. GAAP earnings increased 7.4%. And despite $10.4 million of pretax charges, GAAP operating margin also increased. Finally, revenue, earnings and operating margin were all records for any first quarter period. 
Now looking forward to the second quarter and the full year. The operational challenges encountered in the first quarter remain. However, there is now uncertainty regarding customer demand in the 50% of Teledyne's businesses that are shorter cycle and generally tied to corporate capital expenditures and the global economy as a whole. In addition, some end markets such as commercial aviation, although just 6% of sales in the first quarter, will be impacted beyond the next few quarters and 2020. 
While many other industrial companies have withdrawn 2020 earnings guidance, our total company has a relatively, and I emphasize relatively, high degree of predictability and stability. Nevertheless, in the current environment, we find it prudent to both lower and widen our prior expectations for revenue and earnings that we provided on January 22, 2020. 
Our current outlook is based on the following assumptions. First, at the lower end of our earnings range in the second quarter, we've assumed overall revenue contraction of approximately 6% as well as year-over-year declines in each of quarter 3 and quarter 4, although moderating by year-end. This would result in an overall full year-over-year revenue decline of approximately 2%. 
Second, at the high end of our earnings range, in the second quarter, we've assumed overall revenue contraction of approximately 4%, more modest contraction in Q3, but flat year-over-year sales in Q4. This would result in roughly flat year-over-year overall sales. And by segment, for instrumentation, which is our shortest-cycle business group, we expect an overall revenue change in the second quarter ranging from negative 5% to flat. At the midpoint of our outlook range, we expect full year segment sales to be flat, including incremental sales contribution of about $60 million from Gas and Flame and OakGate acquisitions. 
We expect Digital Imaging to be more resilient, as nearly half of the segment serves defense-based health care and scientific markets. This segment also has greater exposure to now ""back-at-work"" customers in Asia. Plus, given a weaker 2019 in those Digital Imaging businesses serving semiconductor inspection and factory automation, we have an easier comparison in 2020. Hence, we expect to achieve positive albeit low single-digit segment full year sales growth. 
In the other 2 segments, that is Aerospace and Defense Electronics and Engineered Systems, we continue to see our defense businesses in this segment growing at mid-single-digit rates, perhaps even high single digits, despite the ongoing operations-related challenges mentioned previously. However, we are forecasting a collapse in commercial aviation in the aerospace portion of our Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment. While less than 6% of our total sales in the first quarter, we're expecting a 40%-plus year-over-year decline in commercial aviation due to both significant air transport OEM and aftermarket declines. As a result, we expect total year-over-year segment sales to decrease approximately $90 million. 
Before turning to Al's report on the first quarter performance by segment, I want to emphasize the following. We do not know the debt and duration of the economical decline or the pace of the recovery. But as we have repeatedly shown in the past, we know how to be disciplined and perform well in challenging environment. We are aggressively managing variable costs, CapEx and cash flow, and quickly and permanently reducing costs where a prolonged down-cycle is anticipated such as in aviation. 
Finally, our balance sheet is exceptionally strong with over $230 million of cash and cash equivalents and more than $600 million available under our credit facility maturing in 2024. Given our ample liquidity and the resilience of our business portfolio, we continue to review and pursue acquisition opportunities. 
Al will now comment on the performance of our 4 business segments, followed by Sue Main, who will give further financial details and present our outlook. Al?"

Sales of marine instrumentation increased 3.9% organically in the quarter. Backlog continues to grow, and it was at the highest level since early 2015. In addition, operating profit improved significantly. 
As a reminder, while marine includes products sold in the energy industry, we expect this market to directly account for just over 1/3 of total marine sales in 2020, or approximately $150 million of annual revenue compared to almost $400 million in 2014. 
In the environmental domain, sales increased 26.5% as a result of our acquisition of the Gas and Flame Detection business. In addition, we received -- we achieved organic sales growth of certain laboratory instrumentation products, but this was offset by lower sales of other industrial instruments. 
Sales of electronic test and measurement systems increased 2.5% due to the acquisition of OakGate. Nevertheless, organic sales were flat, given continued strong demand for our protocol test instrumentation. 
Overall Instrumentation segment operating profit increased 27.3% in the first quarter, and margin increased 226 basis points, with margins increasing for test and measurement and marine instrumentation. Excluding the Gas and Flame Detection acquisition and related purchase accounting, margin was flat for environmental instrumentation. 
Turning to the Digital Imaging segment. First quarter sales increased 6.2% and included higher sales of infrared detectors for defense applications, MEMS products and X-ray detectors for life sciences. Sales of all machine vision products collectively decreased slightly, but nevertheless stabilized with improved orders and sales for advanced inspection camera systems. GAAP segment operating profit increased 19.7%, and margin increased 201 basis points, generally as a result of the increased sales volume. 
In the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, first quarter sales decreased 6.2% as positive 9% growth in sales of defense electronics was more than offset by a 35% decline in sales of commercial aerospace products. GAAP segment operating margin decreased due to lower aerospace sales, but also 525 basis points of charges for severance, facility consolidations and certain contract cost adjustments. 
In the Engineered Systems segment, first quarter revenue increased 7.6% with greater sales related to marine, space and nuclear programs as well as electronic manufacturing and turbine engines, partially offset by lower sales from missile defense programs. Segment operating profit increased 468 basis points largely due to higher sales and greater mix of our higher-margin manufacturing programs. 
I will now turn the call to Sue, who will offer some additional commentary regarding the first quarter and our 2020 outlook."

I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert and Al, and then I will discuss our second quarter and full year 2020 outlook. 
In the first quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $76.4 million compared with cash flow of $80.1 million for the same period of 2019. The cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of 2020 reflected the timing of accounts receivable collections partially offset by the impact of higher operating income, lower income tax payments and incremental cash flow from recent acquisitions. 
Free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, was $56.2 million in the first quarter of 2020 compared with $58.8 million in 2019. Capital expenditures were $20.2 million in the first quarter compared to $21.3 million for the same period of 2019. Depreciation and amortization expense was $29.3 million in the first quarter compared to $27.6 million for the same period of 2019. 
We ended the quarter with $618.3 million of net debt. That is $849.7 million of debt less cash of $231.4 million, or net debt-to-capital ratio of 18.3%. Stock option compensation expense was $7.4 million in the first quarter of 2020 compared with $8.9 million in the first quarter of 2019. 
Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the second quarter of 2020 will be in the range of $1.90 to $2.05 per share. And for the full year 2020, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $9.30 to $10. The 2020 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items, is expected to be 22.8%, a 220-basis-point increase compared to full year 2019, due in part to less R&D tax credits. In addition, we currently expect significantly less discrete tax items in 2020 compared with 2019. 
Please note that the estimate for second quarter and full year 2020 GAAP diluted earnings per share exclude any future potential charge related to Airbus OneWeb satellites. 
I will now pass the call back to Robert."

The marine businesses today are really -- we expect in the midpoint to be over $425 million. Only $150 million of that, or 35% about, is in offshore oil exploration, offshore oil production, very little on land oil. So most of our marine businesses, the other 65% is in defense, construction and other areas. 
Going back to the oil and gas, we do have good orders so far for the year. It's over 1. It's 1.1. And we don't see any cancellations yet. Having said that, that's in the oil production. In the oil exploration, we're seeing a little bit of softening, but within our orders. And considering the price of crude and what's happened to Brent, we think that -- we expect to have some softening later in the year. So we're taking that into consideration in our guidance. 
But the good part, if there is a good part to this for us, versus 2014 when oil collapsed in '15 and '16, is that at that time, the majority of our marine sales were in oil and gas. Today, it's only 35%."

We're doing a little cost takeout right now in the second quarter. And we expect that if things don't change, get worse, we'll have to take some more out. We think that overall for the year, including first quarter, can range between $0.40 and $0.50. $0.40 on the lower side. The margin effect is very interesting. We -- our margins, we -- on the midpoint. Let me just always work with the midpoint of our guidance, which would -- Greg, would be about $9.65 in earnings, in EPS, and about  [ 3 140 ]   in revenue. Let's stay with that.  With those numbers, I think instruments margin, in the instrument segment, should increase slightly, maybe as much as 15 basis points. Digital Imaging, year-over-year, we believe margins can go as high as 90 basis points above last year. 
In the Aerospace and Defense, we have a different issue. Defense is going to do okay, but aerospace is going to be down significantly, and that's one of our highest-margin businesses. So we think margins over -- year-over-year will go down as much as 700 basis points. Engineered Systems will go up probably 75 to 80 basis points. So overall, segments will go down because of aerospace primarily, a little over 100 basis points, maybe 110. But we have cost control in the corporate domain. So overall, in the midpoint, we think margins can go down as much as 80 basis points. But that, of course, is preliminary based on everything that we know right now."

The flip side of it is, while we have hiccups, we have a very strong procurement initiative underway that started 2 years ago actually to reduce procurement costs, and they're shifting their emphasis to working with our suppliers to ensure that we do have a reasonable supply chain. 
Hiccups. Yes, I expect that we'll have more. So far, nothing very serious. What's a little troubling on the defense side is the availability of some of our customers to approve product that we're delivering to them. For example, just a simple example, in our Shallow Water Combat Submersibles, which are the boats we make for the special ops, we have the boat ready to test. But because of the restrictions -- COVID restrictions, our divers and the government divers can't test them. So they can't take delivery completely, and we're not getting paid completely. So there are those kinds of things happening all over. 
But going back to something I said, Jim, earlier, we know how to deal with these issues. We've done it before. We did it in 2015, '16 when oil collapsed. We did it in 2008 and 2009 in the financial crisis. So we're taking this into consideration with our guidance."

Usually, we say things like, we have a tough comps with prior year. Last year, semiconductor and factory automation were, in general, relatively weak. So our comps this year against last year are better. Let me start there. 
We think machine vision, the vision systems part of our overall Digital Imaging, should be flat this year. We think overall, Digital Imaging will increase, but I think the vision system would be flat. And there's some gives and takes. Our flat panel display orders are pretty good right now. Our scientific cameras are doing well. Semi is catching up. We do have some incremental sales from acquisitions that we made, sci cam from Roper and Micralyne in Canada, which makes MEMS products. So we think some of the other stuff is going to do well. Our Aerospace and Defense businesses in machine vision are doing well, and we expect them to continue.

So while the primes are suffering today, I think our suffering will come a little later. 
The same happens with the recovery. If the recovery comes, which would obviously depend on the overall economy, we will lag in the recovery. Having said all of that, in the overall marine businesses, which we kind of look at it as our energy businesses, we have really strong programs in the defense area, both vehicles and other areas like mine countermeasures, et cetera. So we see some downside for us. 
Recovery, as to when it will bottom, I don't know. But I think recovery for us will come later, and we will suffer the consequences of the current downturn perhaps later in the year. 
Going to commercial aerospace, I can't guess. Right now, it's -- again, we're lucky. It's 6% of our sales. We have a $90 million decline that we're projecting from last year to this year, from about $211 million to $120 million or so. And again, we also, there, also lag the market. After the 9/11 in 2001, aviation didn't really recover until 2003. So that was a 2-year hiatus, and we suffered the consequences of that. 
So if you -- if that's an indication of how long probably  before things bottom -- start turning up, it'd be another 2 years before we see a recovery. And frankly, that's the way we're treating these businesses. We're taking cost out permanently and very -- we've taken almost 20% of our folks out in that business, plus the other people are on furlough and other things.  So the long answer is the recoveries in both segments -- the aerospace should be longer time frame than energy. In my view, we won't suffer much from the energy. We are taking hit from the aviation."

Having said that, we are taking very strong action now to reduce our inventories across our businesses. How successful we'll be will depend on how well we execute. If we do all of the things that we've laid out to do, we might keep last year's free cash flow. 
But the other thing that happened is, if you look at 2009 versus 2008, in 2008, our free cash flow was fairly low. It was like $111 million. In 2009, when we came out of it, our free cash flow grew -- almost doubles to $190 million. The same thing happened in the '15, '16 timeframe. Free cash flow went from $160 million in 2015 to $250 million in 2016. 
So the answer is this: I think we'll do okay this year. If we execute, we'll be around $375 million, maybe a little better. But if history is a lesson, we'll come out of this much stronger next year because of our ability to be disciplined. Our CapEx is going to be lower this year than last year.

We're -- in the test and measurement, we're lagging a little bit. On the other hand, our protocol in our test and measurement businesses have 2 legs to it. One of it is oscilloscope and affiliated systems for looking at electronics hardware. The other part, the protocol, which are the standards by which the Digital Imaging systems communicate, that area, we're doing really well, both here and in China.  And so I think our T&M, test and measurement, while we expect it to be essentially flat this year, it's; probably going to be a little down because of -- but we do have acquisition there. So it might be down 3% or 4%. But China is not our problem. Our; really, right now, is Europe and North America. 
Moving to environment. That's a different story. We're seeing some compression there in China. 2 reasons: one, we make a lot of product that go in air quality monitoring and measurements of air quality, continuous monitoring as well as measurement. And we're seeing weaknesses there. The second thing, which is a little even more troubling, is the Chinese government emphasis that Chinese companies buy Chinese-made products. That's not as much discussed in the United States. We've had initiatives like buy America initiatives previously, but there's a strong emphasis there to do that.  And frankly, while I don't mind assembling products there, I don't want to manufacture products there because of other issues. So we're seeing some compression there. And that's a little worrisome, but we do have new products. And we'll compete with everybody, and we'll get our share of the market in that business."

Our cameras are also -- lastly, the sensors that we use, that we make, are vanadium-based -- vanadium oxide-based sensors. Really nice sensors, 17-micron pixels.

Photonis primarily makes night-vision products for the war fighters. And they do it for almost the rest of the world that has to have an ITAR-free product, whereas our 2 companies in this country do have ITAR restrictions. The second part of their business, related, again, is in life sciences. But 80% of their business is in defense. Now what they do have is a very nice product, nice processes. But what they have lacked, because they've been supported in -- by private equity, what they've lacked is the ability to significantly invest or acquire digital imaging companies that would complement it. Almost everything we do in our Digital Imaging is complementary to what they have, including the in-product sensors I just mentioned. So we think we will -- and digitization is obviously the future of that domain as well. So we think we bring some significant capabilities to that product. 
Now where are we? Unfortunately, on March 31, we verbally -- we were verbally notified by the foreign investment office of France that they were going to have a negative opinion by the Minister of Economy, essentially saying they are going to veto the transaction. Everything has gone quiet since then. There are some indications that the Minister of Economy may be reconsidering. We don't know.  Ultimately, 1 or 2 scenarios can develop. They will reaffirm the verbal veto. We have to have a written response from them because our agreement with the people we're buying it from is such that everything is in escrow until a final decision has been made. So once we get a written agreement would be one of the following: either they'll reject it, which is same as their verbal; or they'll come back and agree to a transaction but put certain conditions on it. 
Now we are used to certain conditions because we bought 2 businesses in France or have operations in France. First, e2v, which we bought several years ago. And last year, we bought Gas and Flame Detection business from 3M. In both those cases, there were certain conditions in terms of because they were supplying product to the French government, et cetera; in terms of how long we kept the businesses, et cetera. And we agreed to those conditions because, frankly, they were also in our best interest.  So we have a really good relationship with the Ministry of Economy and his offices in that domain, and we have a good track record with them. So if the conditions are not onerous. They could be onerous. Then we could live with it. On the other hand, if the conditions are onerous, that would damage our ability to run the company, then we won't be able to complete the transaction. So that's a long way of giving you the best answer I have. And we expect to hear from them, I don't know, it could be shortly or it could be a couple of months."

For the second consecutive quarter, we achieved all-time record sales, earnings per share and free cash flow. Likewise, full year 2019 was by any measure a record year, each of sales, earnings, GAAP operating margin and free cash flow were all-time records. Fourth quarter and full year sales increased 11.5% and 9%, respectively. Organic growth for both periods also exceeded 4%, including some modest currency headwinds about 0.6% in Q4 and about 1% headwind for the full year 2019. In addition, for both the fourth quarter and full year, GAAP operating margin expanded just under 120 basis points.
Fourth quarter earnings were $3.06, exceeding $3 per share for the first time, an increase of 24.9% compared to last year. While we've increased our emphasis on margin improvement, we are continuing our proven strategy of disciplined capital deployment for compound growth in earnings and cash flow.
In 2019, we deployed $484 million on complementary acquisitions. And earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of OakGate Technology, a software and hardware company focused on the test, validation and operating performance of solid-state electronic storage media. This is our third bolt-on acquisition for Teledyne LeCroy and allows Teledyne to provide a complete set of protocol analysis software and hardware used from the design of new data storage devices to the use of search devices in hyperscale cloud storage networks.
Teledyne continues to benefit from our balanced portfolio of common technologies serving different complementary market. We begin 2020 with growth in our defense businesses expected to offset declines in sales of OEM avionics. Marine instrumentation continues to recover, with growing sales, but also with orders having exceeded sales for the sixth consecutive quarter. In Digital Imaging, we expect to see continued strength in certain high-growth markets like micro-electromechanical system or MEMS and a modest recovery in certain commercial machine vision market, such as the semiconductor industry.
Given the short-cycle nature of our environmental and electronic test and measurement instrumentation businesses, at this point, we're only projecting low single-digit GDP-like organic growth.
Finally, our balance sheet remains exceptionally strong, with a quarter-end leverage ratio of 1.4x, and we're continuing to pursue acquisition opportunities.
Before turning the call to Al, I want to emphasize that all of our financial results this morning are reported on a GAAP basis with no adjustments for amortization, stock compensation, acquisition charges, purchase accounting, restructuring or other charges.
I will now -- Al will now comment on the performance of our 4 business segments."

Sales of marine instrumentation increased 14.7% organically in the quarter. And we also closed 2019 with the highest year-end backlog since 2014. In addition, operating profit improved significantly.
In the environmental domain, sales increased 31.9% as a result of our recent acquisition of the Gas and Flame Detection business. In addition, greater organic sales of pollution control instrumentation were offset by lower sales of selected process gas analyzers and laboratory instruments.
Sales of electronic test and measurement systems increased sequentially to the highest level of 2019, but decreased 6.8% year-over-year given an especially tough comparison. For the full year, sales increased 6% organically.
Overall, Instrumentation segment operating profit increased 38.4% in the quarter, and margin increased 340 basis points, with margins increasing for test and measurement and marine instrumentation. Excluding the Gas and Flame Detection acquisition and related purchase accounting, margins also increased within the environmental instrumentation.
Turning to the Digital Imaging segment. Fourth quarter sales increased 20.1%. Sales of our proprietary medical and dental X-ray detectors, again, increased significantly year-over-year. Sales of geospatial sensor systems and MEMS devices also grew nicely, as did sales of advanced infrared and visible light detectors for defense and space applications.
The strong growth in these businesses more than offset some expected declines in the portion of our industrial machine vision business, which serves consumer electronics and generally factory automation markets, especially in Asia. However, sales of these products did increase sequentially, given some recent recovery in the semiconductor-related inspection systems. GAAP segment operating profit increased 29.8% and margin increased 131 basis points generally as a result of the increased sales volume.
In the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, fourth quarter sales increased 2.7%, primarily due to strong growth across the majority of our Defense Electronics businesses, partially offset by lower sales of OEM aerospace electronics. Segment operating margin decreased 208 basis points to 19.2%. The operating margin primarily resulted from product mix differences in Defense Electronics and lower sales of commercial avionics. 
In the Engineered Systems segment, fourth quarter revenue decreased 1.7%, with greater sales related to space and energy programs, electronic manufacturing and turbine engines, more than offset by lower sales from missile defense programs and energy systems. Segment operating profit and margin was flat year-to-year. 
Before turning to Sue, I want to offer some additional commentary regarding our 2020 outlook. Given the points raised by Robert earlier, we believe that total organic revenue growth into full year 2020 will be 3% to 3.5%. In addition, the full year contribution from the scientific camera, Gas and Flame Detection, Micralyne and OakGate acquisition will add another $100 million or so of incremental revenue. This translate to total revenue of approximately $3.36 billion to $3.37 billion for 2020.
I will now turn the call over to Sue."

I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert and Al, and then I will discuss the first quarter and full year 2020 outlook.
In the fourth quarter, record cash flow from operating activities was $167.9 million compared with cash flow of $125.5 million for the same period of 2018. The cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter of 2019 reflected the impact of higher operating income, cash flow from recent acquisitions and improved working capital management.
Free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, was $144 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared with $106.8 million in 2018. Capital expenditures were $23.9 million in the fourth quarter compared to $18.7 million for the same period of 2018.
Depreciation and amortization expense was $29.3 million in both the fourth quarters of 2019 and 2018. We ended the quarter with $651.1 million of net debt, that is $850.6 million of debt less cash of $199.5 million for a net debt-to-capital ratio of 19.4%. Stock option compensation expense was $5.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared with $4.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2018.
Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the first quarter of 2020 will be in the range of $2.25 to $2.35 per share. And for the full year 2020, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $11.20 to $11.30. The 2020 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items, is expected to be 22.3%, a 170 basis point increase compared to full year 2019 due in part to less R&D tax credits as a percentage of taxable income. In addition, we currently expect significantly less discrete items in 2020 compared with 2019.

So we're seeing both improvements in our seismic activities and the activities for oil exploration as well as long-term oil production contracts. We think that in 2020, marine would have increased revenues in the range of about 6.6% versus 4% in 2019.
Now continuing with the second part of your question, which is why we have organic growth less than 4% or so. This year, we achieved about 4.4%. We're projecting between 3% and 3.5% for next year, that's primarily affected by the 737 MAX. It impacts our revenues by 1%. That's our best guess right now, which is equivalent to about $30 million. We anticipated that we would have revenues of over $40 million, maybe as much as $45 million. And because of the delays that you're very familiar with, we expect that, that would be down about -- affect our revenue about 1% or $30 million.
Having said that, I think it's important that -- to note that with even that hit that we're taking in our revenue because of our balanced portfolio even in the Aerospace and Defense segment, we expect revenue to be flat year-over-year because the defense businesses are going to do much better this year than they did last year. So the answer to your question is primarily driven by MAX. Whenever it comes back into production, we'll pick it up again."

Where we've done well really is in the health care, which is our X-ray business and our MEMS areas, and we think those areas will help us as well.
We think the sales in that whole Digital Imaging will increase from what was this year about $900 million to about $990 million -- I'm sorry, $900 million to about $1.4 billion, $1.450 billion. So -- I mean $1,045,000,000. And so we're positive about machine vision. Of course, it is -- if the business picks up more, especially in the flat panel displays, then we'll do better."

We think that will go up again in 2020, perhaps as much as 70 basis points. Right now, we think it will end up at 18.8%. And moving to Digital Imaging, Digital Imaging margins were flat year-over-year at '18 it was 17.8% and '19 was 17.8%. We think we're going to get some margin improvement there, perhaps as much as 65 basis points. Aerospace and Defense and Engineered Systems, we don't think we're going to improve margins. Aerospace and Defense, primarily because the margins are already pretty high at 20.8%, but also, as I mentioned because of the headwind from 737 MAX, we think even though defense will make up for the revenue, margins will stay flat. And in Engineered Systems, we think margins would remain about 9.7%. So overall, in the segment, we think that the margins will increase overall, about 45% -- or 45 basis points, and the company as a whole, it will be about 50 basis points.
Regarding the question you asked about dilution -- appreciation, dilution from the acquisitions, the Roper acquisition was with scientific cameras, was not dilutive. Right now, Gas and Flame, which is the business we bought from 3M and Micralyne, which we bought, we think they will add about -- they added about 50 basis points in dilution, probably in Q4. Now we think going forward, they will be flat. Most of our acquisitions that we make maybe dilutive at very early on because of the expenses we have in acquiring them, but after a while, they're accreted."

406526,664142978,2013837,"Teledyne Technologies Incorporated, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2020",2020-04-22,"Earnings Calls","Teledyne Technologies Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Jason. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our earnings call. Before discussing our results and outlook, I want to talk very briefly about our people, our response to COVID-19 and our business portfolio as a whole. Our first pri",957,"Thank you, Jason. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our earnings call. Before discussing our results and outlook, I want to talk very briefly about our people, our response to COVID-19 and our business portfolio as a whole. 
Our first priority remains the health and safety of our employees and their family. Employees whose tasks can be done off-site have been instructed to work from home, and currently, up to 40% of our total personnel are working remotely. Our corporate office has been and remains open. And all of our 70 manufacturing sites worldwide are operational, but we are maintaining social distancing, enhanced cleaning protocols and usage of personal protective equipment where appropriate.  Our businesses can remain open because they serve critical infrastructure sectors such as the defense industrial base, water and wastewater, health care and public health. 
Teledyne's business portfolio also remains exceptionally well-balanced across end markets and geographies. In addition, approximately 1/2 of our businesses are longer cycle, more predictable and supported by record ending -- quarter ending backlog. 
Looking back to the first quarter, we did not suffer any widespread reduction in customer demand. In fact, orders exceeded sales in each month, including March, and quarter end backlog was a record of -- at approximately $1.8 billion. Likewise, we did not incur any significant negative impact to our supply chain. Nevertheless, there were some first quarter operational challenges in manufacturing and chipping products due to our policy of maintaining appropriate employee density at the workplace, balancing employee absenteeism and the availability of our customers to accept product.  These operational and HR matters, along with some demand and supply chain issues, likely reduced our first quarter revenue by approximately $15 million. Nevertheless, organic sales growth was positive, and overall first quarter revenue increased 5.3% from last year. GAAP earnings increased 7.4%. And despite $10.4 million of pretax charges, GAAP operating margin also increased. Finally, revenue, earnings and operating margin were all records for any first quarter period. 
Now looking forward to the second quarter and the full year. The operational challenges encountered in the first quarter remain. However, there is now uncertainty regarding customer demand in the 50% of Teledyne's businesses that are shorter cycle and generally tied to corporate capital expenditures and the global economy as a whole. In addition, some end markets such as commercial aviation, although just 6% of sales in the first quarter, will be impacted beyond the next few quarters and 2020. 
While many other industrial companies have withdrawn 2020 earnings guidance, our total company has a relatively, and I emphasize relatively, high degree of predictability and stability. Nevertheless, in the current environment, we find it prudent to both lower and widen our prior expectations for revenue and earnings that we provided on January 22, 2020. 
Our current outlook is based on the following assumptions. First, at the lower end of our earnings range in the second quarter, we've assumed overall revenue contraction of approximately 6% as well as year-over-year declines in each of quarter 3 and quarter 4, although moderating by year-end. This would result in an overall full year-over-year revenue decline of approximately 2%. 
Second, at the high end of our earnings range, in the second quarter, we've assumed overall revenue contraction of approximately 4%, more modest contraction in Q3, but flat year-over-year sales in Q4. This would result in roughly flat year-over-year overall sales. And by segment, for instrumentation, which is our shortest-cycle business group, we expect an overall revenue change in the second quarter ranging from negative 5% to flat. At the midpoint of our outlook range, we expect full year segment sales to be flat, including incremental sales contribution of about $60 million from Gas and Flame and OakGate acquisitions. 
We expect Digital Imaging to be more resilient, as nearly half of the segment serves defense-based health care and scientific markets. This segment also has greater exposure to now ""back-at-work"" customers in Asia. Plus, given a weaker 2019 in those Digital Imaging businesses serving semiconductor inspection and factory automation, we have an easier comparison in 2020. Hence, we expect to achieve positive albeit low single-digit segment full year sales growth. 
In the other 2 segments, that is Aerospace and Defense Electronics and Engineered Systems, we continue to see our defense businesses in this segment growing at mid-single-digit rates, perhaps even high single digits, despite the ongoing operations-related challenges mentioned previously. However, we are forecasting a collapse in commercial aviation in the aerospace portion of our Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment. While less than 6% of our total sales in the first quarter, we're expecting a 40%-plus year-over-year decline in commercial aviation due to both significant air transport OEM and aftermarket declines. As a result, we expect total year-over-year segment sales to decrease approximately $90 million. 
Before turning to Al's report on the first quarter performance by segment, I want to emphasize the following. We do not know the debt and duration of the economical decline or the pace of the recovery. But as we have repeatedly shown in the past, we know how to be disciplined and perform well in challenging environment. We are aggressively managing variable costs, CapEx and cash flow, and quickly and permanently reducing costs where a prolonged down-cycle is anticipated such as in aviation. 
Finally, our balance sheet is exceptionally strong with over $230 million of cash and cash equivalents and more than $600 million available under our credit facility maturing in 2024. Given our ample liquidity and the resilience of our business portfolio, we continue to review and pursue acquisition opportunities. 
Al will now comment on the performance of our 4 business segments, followed by Sue Main, who will give further financial details and present our outlook. Al?"

Sales of marine instrumentation increased 3.9% organically in the quarter. Backlog continues to grow, and it was at the highest level since early 2015. In addition, operating profit improved significantly. 
As a reminder, while marine includes products sold in the energy industry, we expect this market to directly account for just over 1/3 of total marine sales in 2020, or approximately $150 million of annual revenue compared to almost $400 million in 2014. 
In the environmental domain, sales increased 26.5% as a result of our acquisition of the Gas and Flame Detection business. In addition, we received -- we achieved organic sales growth of certain laboratory instrumentation products, but this was offset by lower sales of other industrial instruments. 
Sales of electronic test and measurement systems increased 2.5% due to the acquisition of OakGate. Nevertheless, organic sales were flat, given continued strong demand for our protocol test instrumentation. 
Overall Instrumentation segment operating profit increased 27.3% in the first quarter, and margin increased 226 basis points, with margins increasing for test and measurement and marine instrumentation. Excluding the Gas and Flame Detection acquisition and related purchase accounting, margin was flat for environmental instrumentation. 
Turning to the Digital Imaging segment. First quarter sales increased 6.2% and included higher sales of infrared detectors for defense applications, MEMS products and X-ray detectors for life sciences. Sales of all machine vision products collectively decreased slightly, but nevertheless stabilized with improved orders and sales for advanced inspection camera systems. GAAP segment operating profit increased 19.7%, and margin increased 201 basis points, generally as a result of the increased sales volume. 
In the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, first quarter sales decreased 6.2% as positive 9% growth in sales of defense electronics was more than offset by a 35% decline in sales of commercial aerospace products. GAAP segment operating margin decreased due to lower aerospace sales, but also 525 basis points of charges for severance, facility consolidations and certain contract cost adjustments. 
In the Engineered Systems segment, first quarter revenue increased 7.6% with greater sales related to marine, space and nuclear programs as well as electronic manufacturing and turbine engines, partially offset by lower sales from missile defense programs. Segment operating profit increased 468 basis points largely due to higher sales and greater mix of our higher-margin manufacturing programs.

I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert and Al, and then I will discuss our second quarter and full year 2020 outlook. 
In the first quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $76.4 million compared with cash flow of $80.1 million for the same period of 2019. The cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of 2020 reflected the timing of accounts receivable collections partially offset by the impact of higher operating income, lower income tax payments and incremental cash flow from recent acquisitions. 
Free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, was $56.2 million in the first quarter of 2020 compared with $58.8 million in 2019. Capital expenditures were $20.2 million in the first quarter compared to $21.3 million for the same period of 2019. Depreciation and amortization expense was $29.3 million in the first quarter compared to $27.6 million for the same period of 2019. 
We ended the quarter with $618.3 million of net debt. That is $849.7 million of debt less cash of $231.4 million, or net debt-to-capital ratio of 18.3%. Stock option compensation expense was $7.4 million in the first quarter of 2020 compared with $8.9 million in the first quarter of 2019. 
Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the second quarter of 2020 will be in the range of $1.90 to $2.05 per share. And for the full year 2020, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $9.30 to $10. The 2020 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items, is expected to be 22.8%, a 220-basis-point increase compared to full year 2019, due in part to less R&D tax credits. In addition, we currently expect significantly less discrete tax items in 2020 compared with 2019. 
Please note that the estimate for second quarter and full year 2020 GAAP diluted earnings per share exclude any future potential charge related to Airbus OneWeb satellites.

The marine businesses today are really -- we expect in the midpoint to be over $425 million.

So most of our marine businesses, the other 65% is in defense, construction and other areas. 
Going back to the oil and gas, we do have good orders so far for the year. It's over 1. It's 1.1. And we don't see any cancellations yet. Having said that, that's in the oil production. In the oil exploration, we're seeing a little bit of softening, but within our orders. And considering the price of crude and what's happened to Brent, we think that -- we expect to have some softening later in the year. So we're taking that into consideration in our guidance. 
But the good part, if there is a good part to this for us, versus 2014 when oil collapsed in '15 and '16, is that at that time, the majority of our marine sales were in oil and gas. Today, it's only 35%."

We're doing a little cost takeout right now in the second quarter. And we expect that if things don't change, get worse, we'll have to take some more out. We think that overall for the year, including first quarter, can range between $0.40 and $0.50. $0.40 on the lower side. The margin effect is very interesting. We -- our margins, we -- on the midpoint. Let me just always work with the midpoint of our guidance, which would -- Greg, would be about $9.65 in earnings, in EPS, and about  [ 3 140 ]   in revenue. Let's stay with that.  With those numbers, I think instruments margin, in the instrument segment, should increase slightly, maybe as much as 15 basis points. Digital Imaging, year-over-year, we believe margins can go as high as 90 basis points above last year. 
In the Aerospace and Defense, we have a different issue. Defense is going to do okay, but aerospace is going to be down significantly, and that's one of our highest-margin businesses. So we think margins over -- year-over-year will go down as much as 700 basis points. Engineered Systems will go up probably 75 to 80 basis points. So overall, segments will go down because of aerospace primarily, a little over 100 basis points, maybe 110. But we have cost control in the corporate domain. So overall, in the midpoint, we think margins can go down as much as 80 basis points. But that, of course, is preliminary based on everything that we know right now."

There are -- we're seeing a little disruption right now, especially in our printed circuit board -- specialized printed circuit board supply chain.  The flip side of it is, while we have hiccups, we have a very strong procurement initiative underway that started 2 years ago actually to reduce procurement costs, and they're shifting their emphasis to working with our suppliers to ensure that we do have a reasonable supply chain. 
Hiccups. Yes, I expect that we'll have more. So far, nothing very serious. What's a little troubling on the defense side is the availability of some of our customers to approve product that we're delivering to them. For example, just a simple example, in our Shallow Water Combat Submersibles, which are the boats we make for the special ops, we have the boat ready to test. But because of the restrictions -- COVID restrictions, our divers and the government divers can't test them. So they can't take delivery completely, and we're not getting paid completely. So there are those kinds of things happening all over. 
But going back to something I said, Jim, earlier, we know how to deal with these issues. We've done it before. We did it in 2015, '16 when oil collapsed. We did it in 2008 and 2009 in the financial crisis. So we're taking this into consideration with our guidance."

Usually, we say things like, we have a tough comps with prior year. Last year, semiconductor and factory automation were, in general, relatively weak. So our comps this year against last year are better. Let me start there. 
We think machine vision, the vision systems part of our overall Digital Imaging, should be flat this year. We think overall, Digital Imaging will increase, but I think the vision system would be flat. And there's some gives and takes. Our flat panel display orders are pretty good right now. Our scientific cameras are doing well. Semi is catching up. We do have some incremental sales from acquisitions that we made, sci cam from Roper and Micralyne in Canada, which makes MEMS products. So we think some of the other stuff is going to do well. Our Aerospace and Defense businesses in machine vision are doing well, and we expect them to continue. 
So overall, I'm going to say the semi and factory automation, we're lucky because last year, we had such weak revenue, so the comps are easier. The others, we're doing okay."

In that market, the product that we make lag the overall market. That is our orders presently are good and will continue for the next 2 quarters, but we think it will soften in Q4. So while the primes are suffering today, I think our suffering will come a little later. 
The same happens with the recovery. If the recovery comes, which would obviously depend on the overall economy, we will lag in the recovery. Having said all of that, in the overall marine businesses, which we kind of look at it as our energy businesses, we have really strong programs in the defense area, both vehicles and other areas like mine countermeasures, et cetera. So we see some downside for us. 
Recovery, as to when it will bottom, I don't know. But I think recovery for us will come later, and we will suffer the consequences of the current downturn perhaps later in the year. 
Going to commercial aerospace, I can't guess. Right now, it's -- again, we're lucky. It's 6% of our sales. We have a $90 million decline that we're projecting from last year to this year, from about $211 million to $120 million or so. And again, we also, there, also lag the market. After the 9/11 in 2001, aviation didn't really recover until 2003. So that was a 2-year hiatus, and we suffered the consequences of that. 
So if you -- if that's an indication of how long probably  before things bottom -- start turning up, it'd be another 2 years before we see a recovery. And frankly, that's the way we're treating these businesses. We're taking cost out permanently and very -- we've taken almost 20% of our folks out in that business, plus the other people are on furlough and other things.  So the long answer is the recoveries in both segments -- the aerospace should be longer time frame than energy. In my view, we won't suffer much from the energy. We are taking hit from the aviation."

So our free cash should be a little lower than last year. Last year, we had about $400 million. We think this year, it'd be about $375 million, maybe even a little less. 
Having said that, we are taking very strong action now to reduce our inventories across our businesses. How successful we'll be will depend on how well we execute. If we do all of the things that we've laid out to do, we might keep last year's free cash flow. 
But the other thing that happened is, if you look at 2009 versus 2008, in 2008, our free cash flow was fairly low. It was like $111 million. In 2009, when we came out of it, our free cash flow grew -- almost doubles to $190 million. The same thing happened in the '15, '16 timeframe. Free cash flow went from $160 million in 2015 to $250 million in 2016. 
So the answer is this: I think we'll do okay this year. If we execute, we'll be around $375 million, maybe a little better. But if history is a lesson, we'll come out of this much stronger next year because of our ability to be disciplined. Our CapEx is going to be lower this year than last year. Al is kind of controlling that almost project-by-project justification. So I think we should be all right. And we do have cash in the bank."

So it might be down 3% or 4%. But China is not our problem. Our; really, right now, is Europe and North America. 
Moving to environment. That's a different story. We're seeing some compression there in China. 2 reasons: one, we make a lot of product that go in air quality monitoring and measurements of air quality, continuous monitoring as well as measurement. And we're seeing weaknesses there. The second thing, which is a little even more troubling, is the Chinese government emphasis that Chinese companies buy Chinese-made products. That's not as much discussed in the United States. We've had initiatives like buy America initiatives previously, but there's a strong emphasis there to do that.  And frankly, while I don't mind assembling products there, I don't want to manufacture products there because of other issues. So we're seeing some compression there. And that's a little worrisome, but we do have new products. And we'll compete with everybody, and we'll get our share of the market in that business."

The second part of their business, related, again, is in life sciences. But 80% of their business is in defense. Now what they do have is a very nice product, nice processes. But what they have lacked, because they've been supported in -- by private equity, what they've lacked is the ability to significantly invest or acquire digital imaging companies that would complement it. Almost everything we do in our Digital Imaging is complementary to what they have, including the in-product sensors I just mentioned. So we think we will -- and digitization is obviously the future of that domain as well. So we think we bring some significant capabilities to that product. 
Now where are we? Unfortunately, on March 31, we verbally -- we were verbally notified by the foreign investment office of France that they were going to have a negative opinion by the Minister of Economy, essentially saying they are going to veto the transaction. Everything has gone quiet since then. There are some indications that the Minister of Economy may be reconsidering. We don't know.  Ultimately, 1 or 2 scenarios can develop. They will reaffirm the verbal veto. We have to have a written response from them because our agreement with the people we're buying it from is such that everything is in escrow until a final decision has been made. So once we get a written agreement would be one of the following: either they'll reject it, which is same as their verbal; or they'll come back and agree to a transaction but put certain conditions on it. 
Now we are used to certain conditions because we bought 2 businesses in France or have operations in France. First, e2v, which we bought several years ago. And last year, we bought Gas and Flame Detection business from 3M. In both those cases, there were certain conditions in terms of because they were supplying product to the French government, et cetera; in terms of how long we kept the businesses, et cetera. And we agreed to those conditions because, frankly, they were also in our best interest.  So we have a really good relationship with the Ministry of Economy and his offices in that domain, and we have a good track record with them. So if the conditions are not onerous. They could be onerous. Then we could live with it. On the other hand, if the conditions are onerous, that would damage our ability to run the company, then we won't be able to complete the transaction. So that's a long way of giving you the best answer I have. And we expect to hear from them, I don't know, it could be shortly or it could be a couple of months."

Good morning, and thank you for joining our earnings call. Before discussing our results, I want to emphasize that all of our worldwide manufacturing sites as well as our corporate office and research laboratory have been and remain operational. However, because our priority remains the health and safety of our employees, we're continuing social distancing, enhanced cleaning protocols and usage of face masks and personal protective equipment. I shall now make a few comments about our performance in the current environment and our outlook for the remainder of 2020. 
Despite record economic contraction and a challenging operating environment for manufacturers, Teledyne performed extremely well in the second quarter. Our results reflect aggressive cost control and disciplined execution. In fact, although sales decreased approximately 5% compared to both last year and the first quarter of 2020, overall GAAP operating margin increased sequentially 150 basis points. 
Teledyne's business portfolio remains exceptionally well balanced across end markets and geographies. Also, our mix of long-cycle and short-cycle business provides a reasonable level of predictability and helped us and give us the confidence to provide our outlook in April. 
Looking back at the second quarter. The overall market and demand outlook played out as we had envisioned. In April, we predicted second quarter sales to decrease 5% year-over-year versus the actual results of negative 4.9%. That said, demand for instrumentation was better than forecast due to continued demand for test and measurement protocol analyzers and a record quarter for OakGate business which was acquired in January. These product lines serve technology markets related to solid-state storage and cloud networking, where capital spending remains relatively robust. 
On the other hand, digital imaging sales were slightly lower than forecast. Now totally in dental health care markets where weakness due to COVID-19 was expected. But we also saw temporary declines in surgery and cancer radiotherapy due to one: deferred patient treatment; two, our customers destocking; and 3, pure new OEM equipment installations in hospitals. Otherwise, everything else, from a sales perspective, essentially occurred as expected. 
More importantly, operating margin, earnings and cash flow, each exceeded our April expectations. Ongoing simplification of our processes and margin improvement actions, including aggressive cost-cutting in the first half of 2020 delivered superior results. 
Now looking forward to the balance of 2020. We remain positive overall. Just as commercial sales to Asia improved late in the first quarter, we expect a recovery in sales in Europe and the Americas later this year. However, in light of reinitiated shutdowns and travel restrictions, it is prudent to assume such recovery will begin in the fourth quarter. 
In other words, we expect the overall sales level in the third quarter to be very similar to Q2. As a result, we now expect 2020 full year sales could decline approximately 3% from 2019, with sales of instrumentation and imaging increasing sequentially in the fourth quarter and the first electronics and engineered system sales continuing to remain robust throughout the year. We're now forecasting a recovery in commercial -- we are not forecasting a recovery in commercial aerospace in 2020. However, this market will contribute less than 5% to our total revenue. Before turning to Al to report on the second quarter performance by segment, I want to emphasize the following. First, as we have repeatedly demonstrated in the past, we know how to be disciplined and perform well in challenging environments. Second, in prior cycles, where revenue was challenged, we protected earnings, while at the same time, increasing cash growth. For example, in 2009, where revenue declined 4%, GAAP earnings were flat, and free cash flow increased over 50% from 2008 and it was a record for Teledyne at the time. 
Likewise, in 2016, when total revenue declined 6%, GAAP earnings were flat, and free cash flow, again, increased over 50% from 2015, and was again a record for Teledyne at the time. 
More importantly, in subsequent years, we kept our lower cost structure, hence GAAP earnings nearly doubled over the subsequent 3 to 4 years. 
In addition, following some periods of general weakness due to Teledyne's strong balance sheet, we were able to complete our largest and best acquisitions. For example, we announced the acquisition of Teledyne Dalsa in 2010 and Teledyne Etwov in 2016, both of which were our largest acquisitions on those dates. 
Fast forward to 2020. We are aggressively managing variable costs as well as permanently reducing costs where appropriate. Our balance sheet is exceptionally strong with over $380 million of cash and cash equivalents and a borrowing capacity of over $1.2 billion. 
Al will now comment on the performance of our 4 business segments."

In our instrumentation segment, overall second quarter sales were flat versus last year. Sales of marine instrumentation decreased 1.3% in the quarter, however, operating profit improved due to business simplification initiatives and improved pricing and procurement activities. 
As a reminder, while marine includes products sold to the energy industry, we expect this market to directly account for just over 1/3 of total marine sales in 2020 or approximately $150 million of annual revenue compared to almost $400 million in 2014. 
In the environmental domain, sales increased 7.9% as a result of our acquisition of the Gas and Flame Detection Business, while sales of certain products, such as medical-grade oxygen sensors increased during the quarter, this could not offset declines in general industrial markets such as stack gas emissions monitoring and wastewater flow and sampling. 
Sales of electronic test and measurement systems decreased 9.8%. While there was strength in our Protocol Solutions Group, sales of general-purpose oscilloscopes declined year-over-year, especially in Europe and the U.S. Nevertheless, order trends and sales leads in Asia and Europe have improved in recent periods. Overall, instrumentation segment operating profit and margin were flat with last year despite $2.8 million in higher severance and facility consolidation costs. 
Turning to Digital Imaging segment. Second quarter sales decreased 4.3% and primarily reflected lower sales of x-ray detectors for dental and medical applications, partially offset by greater sales of infrared detectors for the defense market. Sales of industrial vision systems were largely flat with last year, as strength in semiconductor inspection and markets in Asia largely offset some weakness in Europe and North America. 
GAAP segment operating margin of 19.7% was the second highest quarterly margin ever achieved, but was 108 basis points below last year's all-time record of 20.8%. In the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, second quarter sales declined 18.7%, as greater defense sales were more than offset by a 49% decline in sales of commercial aerospace products as well as lower commercial space sales related to OneWeb. 
GAAP segment operating margin decreased due to lower sales, but also over 340 basis points of charges for severance and facility consolidations. In the Engineered Systems segment, second quarter revenue increased 6.4%, primarily due to greater sales from marine, nuclear and other manufacturing programs, as well as electronic manufacturing services. Segment operating profit increased 20%, with margin up 123 basis points. 
I will now turn the call to Sue, who will offer some additional commentary regarding the second quarter and our 2020 outlook."

I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert and Al, and then I will discuss our third quarter and full year 2020 outlook. 
In the second quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $155.8 million compared with cash flow of $83.2 million for the same period of 2019. The cash provided by operating activities in the second quarter of 2020 reflected improved collection of accounts receivable and $33.4 million of deferred tax payments partially offset by lower operating income. Free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, was $139.2 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared with $65.1 million in 2019. 
Capital expenditures were $16.6 million in the second quarter compared to $18.1 million for the same period of 2019. Depreciation and amortization expense was $29.0 million in the second quarter compared to $27.1 million for the same period of 2019. 
We ended the quarter with $468.6 million of net debt, that is $851.4 million of debt less cash of $382.8 million for a net debt-to-capital ratio of 14.0%. Stock option compensation expense was $5.7 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared with $5.8 million in the second quarter of 2019. 
Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the third quarter of 2020 will be in the range of $2.25 to $2.45 per share, and for the full year 2020, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $9.45 to $10 compared with the prior outlook of $9.30 to $10. The 2020 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items, is expected to be 22.8%, a 220 basis point increase compared to full year 2019, due in part to less R&D tax credits. 
In addition, we currently expect lead discrete tax items in 2020 compared with 2019. Please note that the estimates for third quarter and full year 2020 GAAP diluted earnings per share exclude any potential charge related to Airbus OneWeb satellites. 
I will now pass the call back to Robert."

Now having said that, we think that of Q3 would be relatively flat with Q2.

Now going back, as I mentioned in my comments, we have the capacity to buy things, excluding acquired EBITDA of the order of $1.2 billion. Anything we buy is going to obviously have some EBITDA associated with it. So it could be higher depending on what we buy. I'm going to hazard a guess, by the end of the year, we may have as much as capacity as $1.5 billion. Having said that, there's the one acquisition that's been sitting out there for Teledyne, which the situation is still undecided. That would take up about $550 million, maybe a little more because of the change in the currency. And then we have appetite for other acquisitions. I hope, significant ones in this environment. Just like we did with DALSA in 2010 and [indiscernible] in 2016.

And that is not saving because we find fee savings because we're buying them at a lower cost because we're signing contracts with our favorite suppliers. If we can get that done that will save us another $20 million. In terms of the 1,000 people that I mentioned, I'd say half of it was maybe because the market demand going down like it controls, where market [indiscernible] to 50% of what it was. And the other half is really proactive on our part in reducing complexity in our operations. But we intend to keep that. And we've done that in prior years. We've kept our lower cost as we move forward. How that answers your question."

Good morning, and thank you for joining our earnings call. Before discussing our results, I want to emphasize that all of our worldwide manufacturing sites as well as our corporate office and research laboratory have been and remain operational. However, because our priority remains the health and safety of our employees, we're continuing social distancing, enhanced cleaning protocols and usage of face masks and personal protective equipment. I shall now make a few comments about our performance in the current environment and our outlook for the remainder of 2020.  
Despite record economic contraction and a challenging operating environment for manufacturers, Teledyne performed extremely well in the second quarter. Our results reflect aggressive cost control and disciplined execution. In fact, although sales decreased approximately 5% compared to both last year and the first quarter of 2020, overall GAAP operating margin increased sequentially 150 basis points.  
Teledyne's business portfolio remains exceptionally well balanced across end markets and geographies. Also, our mix of long-cycle and short-cycle business provides a reasonable level of predictability and helped us give us the confidence to provide our outlook in April.  
Looking back at the second quarter. The overall market and demand outlook played out as we had envisioned. In April, we predicted second quarter sales to decrease 5% year-over-year versus the actual results of negative 4.9%. That said, demand for Instrumentation was better than forecast due to continued demand for test and measurement protocol analyzers and a record quarter for OakGate business which was acquired in January. These product lines serve technology markets related to solid-state storage and cloud networking, where capital spending remains relatively robust.  
On the other hand, digital imaging sales were slightly lower than forecast now, totally in dental health care markets where weakness due to COVID-19 was expected. But we also saw temporary declines in surgery and cancer radiotherapy due to: one, deferred patient treatment; two, our customers destocking; and three, pure new OEM equipment installations in hospitals. Otherwise, everything else, from a sales perspective, essentially occurred as expected.  
More importantly, operating margin, earnings and cash flow, each exceeded our April expectations. Ongoing simplification of our processes and margin improvement actions, including aggressive cost-cutting in the first half of 2020, delivered superior results.  
Now looking forward to the balance of 2020. We remain positive overall. Just as commercial sales to Asia improved late in the first quarter, we expect a recovery in sales in Europe and the Americas later this year. However, in light of reinitiated shutdowns and travel restrictions, it is prudent to assume such recovery will begin in the fourth quarter.  
In other words, we expect the overall sales level in the third quarter to be very similar to Q2. As a result, we now expect 2020 full year sales could be declined approximately 3% from 2019, with sales of Instrumentation and imaging increasing sequentially in the fourth quarter and the first electronics and engineered system sales continuing to remain robust throughout the year. We're now forecasting a recovery in commercial -- we are not forecasting a recovery in commercial aerospace in 2020. However, this market will contribute less than 5% to our total revenue. 
Before turning to Al to report on the second quarter performance by segment, I want to emphasize the following: First, as we have repeatedly demonstrated in the past, we know how to be disciplined and perform well in challenging environments. Second, in prior cycles, where revenue was challenged, we protected earnings, while at the same time, increasing cash growth. For example, in 2009, where revenue declined 4%, GAAP earnings were flat, and free cash flow increased over 50% from 2008 and it was a record for Teledyne at the time.  
Likewise, in 2016, when total revenue declined 6%, GAAP earnings were flat, and free cash flow, again, increased over 50% from 2015, and was again a record for Teledyne at the time.  
More importantly, in subsequent years, we kept our lower cost structure, hence GAAP earnings nearly doubled over the subsequent 3 to 4 years.  
In addition, following some periods of general market weakness, due to Teledyne's strong balance sheet, we were able to complete our largest and best acquisitions. For example, we announced the acquisition of Teledyne DALSA in 2010 and Teledyne e2v in 2016, both of which were our largest acquisitions on those dates. Fast forward to 2020. We are aggressively managing variable costs as well as permanently reducing costs where appropriate. Our balance sheet is exceptionally strong with over $380 million of cash and cash equivalents and a borrowing capacity of over $1.2 billion.  
Al will now comment on the performance of our 4 business segments."

In our Instrumentation segment, overall second quarter sales were flat versus last year. Sales of marine Instrumentation decreased 1.3% in the quarter, however, operating profit improved due to business simplification initiatives and improved pricing and procurement activities.  
As a reminder, while marine includes products sold to the energy industry, we expect this market to directly account for just over 1/3 of total marine sales in 2020 or approximately $150 million of annual revenue compared to almost $400 million in 2014. 
In the environmental domain, sales increased 7.9% as a result of our acquisition of the Gas and Flame Detection business, while sales of certain products, such as medical-grade oxygen sensors increased during the quarter. This could not offset declines in general industrial markets such as stack gas emissions monitoring and wastewater flow and sampling.  
Sales of electronic test and measurement systems decreased 9.8%. While there was strength in our Protocol Solutions Group, sales of general-purpose oscilloscopes declined year-over-year, especially in Europe and the U.S. Nevertheless, order trends and sales leads in Asia and Europe have improved in recent weeks. Overall, Instrumentation segment operating profit and margin were flat with last year despite $2.8 million in higher severance and facility consolidation costs.  
Turning to Digital Imaging segment. Second quarter sales decreased 4.3% and primarily reflected lower sales of X-ray detectors for dental and medical applications, partially offset by greater sales of infrared detectors for the defense market. Sales of industrial vision systems were largely flat with last year, as strength in semiconductor inspection and markets in Asia largely offset some weakness in Europe and North America.  
GAAP segment operating margin of 19.7%, was the second highest quarterly margin ever achieved, but was 108 basis points below last year's all-time record of 20.8%. 
In the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, second quarter sales declined 18.7%, as greater defense sales were more than offset by a 49% decline in sales of commercial aerospace products as well as lower commercial space sales related to OneWeb.  
GAAP segment operating margin decreased due to lower sales, but also over 340 basis points of charges for severance and facility consolidations. 
In the Engineered Systems segment, second quarter revenue increased 6.4%, primarily due to greater sales from marine, nuclear and other manufacturing programs, as well as electronic manufacturing services. Segment operating profit increased 20%, with margin up 123 basis points.  
I will now turn the call to Sue, who will offer some additional commentary regarding the second quarter and our 2020 outlook."

I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert and Al, and then I will discuss our third quarter and full year 2020 outlook.  
In the second quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $155.8 million compared with cash flow of $83.2 million for the same period of 2019. The cash provided by operating activities in the second quarter of 2020 reflected improved collection of accounts receivable and $33.4 million of deferred tax payments partially offset by lower operating income. Free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, was $139.2 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared with $65.1 million in 2019.  
Capital expenditures were $16.6 million in the second quarter compared to $18.1 million for the same period of 2019. Depreciation and amortization expense was $29.0 million in the second quarter compared to $27.1 million for the same period of 2019.  
We ended the quarter with $468.6 million of net debt, that is $851.4 million of debt less cash of $382.8 million for a net debt-to-capital ratio of 14.0%. Stock option compensation expense was $5.7 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared with $5.8 million in the second quarter of 2019.  
Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the third quarter of 2020 will be in the range of $2.25 to $2.45 per share, and for the full year 2020, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $9.45 to $10 compared with the prior outlook of $9.30 to $10. The 2020 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items, is expected to be 22.8%, a 220 basis point increase compared to full year 2019, due, in part, to less R&D tax credits.  
In addition, we currently expect lead discrete tax items in 2020 compared with 2019. Please note that the estimates for third quarter and full year 2020 GAAP diluted earnings per share exclude any potential charge related to Airbus, OneWeb satellites.

Q3 should improve over Q2 and Q4 should be a little over 1. We think we'll end the year by maybe 0.98 of that order. That includes pretty lumpy orders, especially in our Engineered Systems. So I think this -- you have to take into consideration that our aerospace business, the book-to-bill is pretty low because of the decline in that old domain. In T&M and instruments, I think instruments, in general, in Q2, we were just a little north of 1. And we think Q3 would be 1 and Q4 would be 1. So we should be okay there. Digital Imaging, we should end up a little over 1, with aerospace and defense, defense will pick up. So we should be just under 1, when end the year even with aerospace being down, and Engineered Systems is lumpy, so I think it doesn't matter. It's going to be around 1 in the end."

We spent approximately $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion, our people expense. What happened there is that we have a turnover and so we haven't been replacing those folks, except where we have really good strong orders. And then we've cut folks. And so the big change for the year is in people. And I think that savings rolling forward net of charges that we take could be as much as $40 million to $50 million.  
Now having said that, it is our full intention to keep that more cost structure into next year, as we've done previously. The other area of cost savings is we have very strong initiatives in procurement. And we have a target of saving over $25 million in procurement this year. And that is not savings because we find fewer [ cost ] savings, because we're buying them at a lower cost, because we're signing contracts with our favorite suppliers. If we can get that done that will save us another $20 million. In terms of the 1,000 people that I mentioned, I'd say half of it was maybe because the market demand going down like it controls, where market tanked to 50% of what it was. And the other half is really proactive on our part in reducing complexity in our operations. But we intend to keep that. And we've done that in prior years.

Good morning, and thank you for joining our earnings call. Before discussing our results, I want to emphasize that all of our worldwide manufacturing sites as well as our corporate office and research laboratory have been and remain operational. However, because our priority remains the health and safety of our employees, we're continuing social distancing, enhanced cleaning protocols and usage of face masks and personal protective equipment. I shall now make a few comments about our performance in the current environment and our outlook for the remainder of 2020.  
Despite record economic contraction and a challenging operating environment for manufacturers, Teledyne performed extremely well in the second quarter. Our results reflect aggressive cost control and disciplined execution. In fact, although sales decreased approximately 5% compared to both last year and the first quarter of 2020, overall GAAP operating margin increased sequentially 150 basis points.  
Teledyne's business portfolio remains exceptionally well balanced across end markets and geographies. Also, our mix of long-cycle and short-cycle business provides a reasonable level of predictability and helped us -- gave us the confidence to provide our outlook in April.  
Looking back at the second quarter. The overall market and demand outlook played out as we had envisioned. In April, we predicted second quarter sales to decrease 5% year-over-year versus the actual results of negative 4.9%. That said, demand for Instrumentation was better than forecast due to continued demand for test and measurement protocol analyzers and a record quarter for OakGate business which was acquired in January. These product lines serve technology markets related to solid-state storage and cloud networking, where capital spending remains relatively robust.  
On the other hand, digital imaging sales were slightly lower than forecast not only in dental health care markets where weakness due to COVID-19 was expected, but we also saw temporary declines in surgery and cancer radiotherapy due to: one, deferred patient treatment; two, our customers destocking; and three, pure new OEM equipment installations in hospitals. Otherwise, everything else, from a sales perspective, essentially occurred as expected.  
More importantly, operating margin, earnings and cash flow, each exceeded our April expectations. Ongoing simplification of our processes and margin improvement actions, including aggressive cost-cutting in the first half of 2020, delivered superior results.  
Now looking forward to the balance of 2020. We remain positive overall. Just as commercial sales to Asia improved late in the first quarter, we expect a recovery in sales in Europe and the Americas later this year. However, in light of the initiated shutdowns and travel restrictions, it is prudent to assume such recovery will begin in the fourth quarter.  
In other words, we expect the overall sales level in the third quarter to be very similar to Q2. As a result, we now expect 2020 full year sales could be declined approximately 3% from 2019, with sales of Instrumentation and imaging increasing sequentially in the fourth quarter and the first electronics and engineered system sales continuing to remain robust throughout the year. We're now forecasting a recovery in commercial -- we are not forecasting a recovery in commercial aerospace in 2020. However, this market will contribute less than 5% to our total revenue. 
Before turning to Al to report on the second quarter performance by segment, I want to emphasize the following: first, as we have repeatedly demonstrated in the past, we know how to be disciplined and perform well in challenging environments. Second, in prior cycles, where revenue was challenged, we protected earnings, while at the same time, increasing cash growth. For example, in 2009, where revenue declined 4%, GAAP earnings were flat, and free cash flow increased over 50% from 2008 and it was a record for Teledyne at the time.  
Likewise, in 2016, when total revenue declined 6%, GAAP earnings were flat, and free cash flow, again, increased over 50% from 2015, and was again a record for Teledyne at the time.  
More importantly, in subsequent years, we kept our lower cost structure, hence GAAP earnings nearly doubled over the subsequent 3 to 4 years.  
In addition, following some periods of general market weakness, due to Teledyne's strong balance sheet, we were able to complete our largest and best acquisitions. For example, we announced the acquisition of Teledyne DALSA in 2010 and Teledyne e2v in 2016, both of which were our largest acquisitions on those dates. Fast forward to 2020. We are aggressively managing variable costs as well as permanently reducing costs where appropriate. Our balance sheet is exceptionally strong with over $380 million of cash and cash equivalents and a borrowing capacity of over $1.2 billion.  
Al will now comment on the performance of our 4 business segments."

In our Instrumentation segment, overall second quarter sales were flat versus last year. Sales of marine Instrumentation decreased 1.3% in the quarter, however, operating profit improved due to business simplification initiatives and improved pricing and procurement activities.  
As a reminder, while marine includes products sold to the energy industry, we expect this market to directly account for just over 1/3 of total marine sales in 2020 or approximately $150 million of annual revenue compared to almost $400 million in 2014. 
In the environmental domain, sales increased 7.9% as a result of our acquisition of the Gas and Flame Detection business, while sales of certain products, such as medical-grade oxygen sensors increased during the quarter. This could not offset declines in general industrial markets such as stack gas emissions monitoring and wastewater flow and sampling.  
Sales of electronic test and measurement systems decreased 9.8%. While there was strength in our Protocol Solutions Group, sales of general-purpose oscilloscopes declined year-over-year, especially in Europe and the U.S. Nevertheless, order trends and sales leads in Asia and Europe have improved in recent weeks. Overall, Instrumentation segment operating profit and margin were flat with last year despite $2.8 million in higher severance and facility consolidation costs.  
Turning to Digital Imaging segment. Second quarter sales decreased 4.3% and primarily reflected lower sales of X-ray detectors for dental and medical applications, partially offset by greater sales of infrared detectors for the defense market. Sales of industrial vision systems were largely flat with last year, as strength in semiconductor inspection end markets in Asia largely offset some weakness in Europe and North America.  
GAAP segment operating margin of 19.7%, was the second highest quarterly margin ever achieved, but was 108 basis points below last year's all-time record of 20.8%. 
In the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, second quarter sales declined 18.7%, as greater defense sales were more than offset by a 49% decline in sales of commercial aerospace products as well as lower commercial space sales related to OneWeb.  
GAAP segment operating margin decreased due to lower sales, but also over 340 basis points of charges for severance and facility consolidations. 
In the Engineered Systems segment, second quarter revenue increased 6.4%, primarily due to greater sales from marine, nuclear and other manufacturing programs, as well as electronic manufacturing services. Segment operating profit increased 20%, with margin up 123 basis points.

I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert and Al, and then I will discuss our third quarter and full year 2020 outlook.  
In the second quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $155.8 million compared with cash flow of $83.2 million for the same period of 2019. The cash provided by operating activities in the second quarter of 2020 reflected improved collection of accounts receivable and $33.4 million of deferred tax payments partially offset by lower operating income. Free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, was $139.2 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared with $65.1 million in 2019.  
Capital expenditures were $16.6 million in the second quarter compared to $18.1 million for the same period of 2019. Depreciation and amortization expense was $29.0 million in the second quarter compared to $27.1 million for the same period of 2019.  
We ended the quarter with $468.6 million of net debt, that is $851.4 million of debt less cash of $382.8 million for a net debt-to-capital ratio of 14.0%. Stock option compensation expense was $5.7 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared with $5.8 million in the second quarter of 2019.  
Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the third quarter of 2020 will be in the range of $2.25 to $2.45 per share, and for the full year 2020, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $9.45 to $10 compared with the prior outlook of $9.30 to $10. The 2020 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items, is expected to be 22.8%, a 220 basis point increase compared to full year 2019, due, in part, to less R&D tax credits.  
In addition, we currently expect lead discrete tax items in 2020 compared with 2019. Please note that the estimates for third quarter and full year 2020 GAAP diluted earnings per share exclude any potential charge related to Airbus OneWeb satellites.

What we found out was that in the cancer therapy, really most of the downside was because of people that would be tested for cancer or colon cancer or various types, and that shrank quite a bit. Now having said that, we think that Q3 would be relatively flat with Q2.

In the current circumstances, that would be a record for us. Last year, we had $394 million. So if we can exceed that, that would be a record.  
Now going back, as I mentioned in my comments, we have the capacity to buy things, excluding acquired EBITDA of the order of $1.2 billion. Anything we buy is going to obviously have some EBITDA associated with it. So it could be higher depending on what we buy. I'm going to hazard a guess, by the end of the year, we may have as much as capacity as $1.5 billion. Having said that, there's the one acquisition that's been sitting out there for  a product, which the situation is still undecided. That would take up about $550 million, maybe a little more because of the change in the currency. And then we have appetite for other acquisitions, I hope, significant ones in this environment. Just like we did with DALSA in 2010 and e2v in 2016. Under those economic conditions of those businesses were not performing very well, and we were able to acquire them with a -- at a reasonable price.

In T&M and instruments, I think instruments, in general, in Q2, we were just a little north of 1. And we think Q3 would be 1 and Q4 would be 1. So we should be okay there.

What happened there is that we have a turnover and so we haven't been replacing those folks, except where we have really good strong orders. And then we've cut folks. And so the big change for the year is in people. And I think that savings rolling forward net of charges that we take could be as much as $40 million to $50 million.  
Now having said that, it is our full intention to keep that low cost structure into next year, as we've done previously. The other area of cost savings is we have very strong initiatives in procurement. And we have a target of saving over $25 million in procurement this year. And that is not savings because we find fewer stock for savings, because we're buying them at a lower cost, because we're signing contracts with our favorite suppliers. If we can get that done that will save us another $20 million. In terms of the 1,000 people that I mentioned, I'd say half of it was maybe because the market demand going down like it controls, where market tanked to 50% of what it was.

Good morning, and thank you for joining our earnings call. Before discussing our results, I want to emphasize that all of our worldwide manufacturing sites as well as our corporate office and research laboratory have been and remain operational. However, because our priority remains the health and safety of our employees, we're continuing social distancing, enhanced cleaning protocols and usage of face masks and personal protective equipment. I shall now make a few comments about our performance in the current environment and our outlook for the remainder of 2020.  
Despite record economic contraction and a challenging operating environment for manufacturers, Teledyne performed extremely well in the second quarter. Our results reflect aggressive cost control and disciplined execution. In fact, although sales decreased approximately 5% compared to both last year and the first quarter of 2020, overall GAAP operating margin increased sequentially 150 basis points.  
Teledyne's business portfolio remains exceptionally well balanced across end markets and geographies. Also, our mix of long-cycle and short-cycle business provides a reasonable level of predictability and helped us -- gave us the confidence to provide our outlook in April.  
Looking back at the second quarter. The overall market and demand outlook played out as we had envisioned. In April, we predicted second quarter sales to decrease 5% year-over-year versus the actual results of negative 4.9%. That said, demand for Instrumentation was better than forecast due to continued demand for test and measurement protocol analyzers and a record quarter for OakGate business which was acquired in January. These product lines serve technology markets related to solid-state storage and cloud networking, where capital spending remains relatively robust.  
On the other hand, digital imaging sales were slightly lower than forecast not only in dental health care markets where weakness due to COVID-19 was expected, but we also saw temporary declines in surgery and cancer radiotherapy due to: one, deferred patient treatment; two, our customers destocking; and three, pure new OEM equipment installations in hospitals. Otherwise, everything else, from a sales perspective, essentially occurred as expected.  
More importantly, operating margin, earnings and cash flow, each exceeded our April expectations. Ongoing simplification of our processes and margin improvement actions, including aggressive cost-cutting in the first half of 2020, delivered superior results.  
Now looking forward to the balance of 2020. We remain positive overall. Just as commercial sales to Asia improved late in the first quarter, we expect a recovery in sales in Europe and the Americas later this year. However, in light of the initiated shutdowns and travel restrictions, it is prudent to assume such recovery will begin in the fourth quarter.  
In other words, we expect the overall sales level in the third quarter to be very similar to Q2. As a result, we now expect 2020 full year sales could be declined approximately 3% from 2019, with sales of Instrumentation and imaging increasing sequentially in the fourth quarter and the first electronics and engineered system sales continuing to remain robust throughout the year. We're now forecasting a recovery in commercial -- we are not forecasting a recovery in commercial aerospace in 2020. However, this market will contribute less than 5% to our total revenue. 
Before turning to Al to report on the second quarter performance by segment, I want to emphasize the following: first, as we have repeatedly demonstrated in the past, we know how to be disciplined and perform well in challenging environments. Second, in prior cycles, where revenue was challenged, we protected earnings, while at the same time, increasing cash growth. For example, in 2009, where revenue declined 4%, GAAP earnings were flat, and free cash flow increased over 50% from 2008 and it was a record for Teledyne at the time.  
Likewise, in 2016, when total revenue declined 6%, GAAP earnings were flat, and free cash flow, again, increased over 50% from 2015, and was again a record for Teledyne at the time.  
More importantly, in subsequent years, we kept our lower cost structure, hence GAAP earnings nearly doubled over the subsequent 3 to 4 years.  
In addition, following some periods of general market weakness, due to Teledyne's strong balance sheet, we were able to complete our largest and best acquisitions. For example, we announced the acquisition of Teledyne DALSA in 2010 and Teledyne e2v in 2016, both of which were our largest acquisitions on those dates. Fast forward to 2020. We are aggressively managing variable costs as well as permanently reducing costs where appropriate. Our balance sheet is exceptionally strong with over $380 million of cash and cash equivalents and a borrowing capacity of over $1.2 billion.  
Al will now comment on the performance of our 4 business segments."

In our Instrumentation segment, overall second quarter sales were flat versus last year. Sales of marine Instrumentation decreased 1.3% in the quarter, however, operating profit improved due to business simplification initiatives and improved pricing and procurement activities.  
As a reminder, while marine includes products sold to the energy industry, we expect this market to directly account for just over 1/3 of total marine sales in 2020 or approximately $150 million of annual revenue compared to almost $400 million in 2014. 
In the environmental domain, sales increased 7.9% as a result of our acquisition of the Gas and Flame Detection business, while sales of certain products, such as medical-grade oxygen sensors increased during the quarter. This could not offset declines in general industrial markets such as stack gas emissions monitoring and wastewater flow and sampling.  
Sales of electronic test and measurement systems decreased 9.8%. While there was strength in our Protocol Solutions Group, sales of general-purpose oscilloscopes declined year-over-year, especially in Europe and the U.S. Nevertheless, order trends and sales leads in Asia and Europe have improved in recent weeks. Overall, Instrumentation segment operating profit and margin were flat with last year despite $2.8 million in higher severance and facility consolidation costs.  
Turning to Digital Imaging segment. Second quarter sales decreased 4.3% and primarily reflected lower sales of X-ray detectors for dental and medical applications, partially offset by greater sales of infrared detectors for the defense market. Sales of industrial vision systems were largely flat with last year, as strength in semiconductor inspection end markets in Asia largely offset some weakness in Europe and North America.  
GAAP segment operating margin of 19.7%, was the second highest quarterly margin ever achieved, but was 108 basis points below last year's all-time record of 20.8%. 
In the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, second quarter sales declined 18.7%, as greater defense sales were more than offset by a 49% decline in sales of commercial aerospace products as well as lower commercial space sales related to OneWeb.  
GAAP segment operating margin decreased due to lower sales, but also over 340 basis points of charges for severance and facility consolidations. 
In the Engineered Systems segment, second quarter revenue increased 6.4%, primarily due to greater sales from marine, nuclear and other manufacturing programs, as well as electronic manufacturing services. Segment operating profit increased 20%, with margin up 123 basis points.  
I will now turn the call to Sue, who will offer some additional commentary regarding the second quarter and our 2020 outlook."

I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert and Al, and then I will discuss our third quarter and full year 2020 outlook.  
In the second quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $155.8 million compared with cash flow of $83.2 million for the same period of 2019. The cash provided by operating activities in the second quarter of 2020 reflected improved collection of accounts receivable and $33.4 million of deferred tax payments partially offset by lower operating income. Free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, was $139.2 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared with $65.1 million in 2019.  
Capital expenditures were $16.6 million in the second quarter compared to $18.1 million for the same period of 2019. Depreciation and amortization expense was $29.0 million in the second quarter compared to $27.1 million for the same period of 2019.  
We ended the quarter with $468.6 million of net debt, that is $851.4 million of debt less cash of $382.8 million for a net debt-to-capital ratio of 14.0%. Stock option compensation expense was $5.7 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared with $5.8 million in the second quarter of 2019.  
Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the third quarter of 2020 will be in the range of $2.25 to $2.45 per share, and for the full year 2020, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $9.45 to $10 compared with the prior outlook of $9.30 to $10. The 2020 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items, is expected to be 22.8%, a 220 basis point increase compared to full year 2019, due, in part, to less R&D tax credits.  
In addition, we currently expect lead discrete tax items in 2020 compared with 2019. Please note that the estimates for third quarter and full year 2020 GAAP diluted earnings per share exclude any potential charge related to Airbus OneWeb satellites.  
I will now pass the call back to Robert."

In the current circumstances, that would be a record for us. Last year, we had $394 million. So if we can exceed that, that would be a record.  
Now going back, as I mentioned in my comments, we have the capacity to buy things, excluding acquired EBITDA of the order of $1.2 billion. Anything we buy is going to obviously have some EBITDA associated with it. So it could be higher depending on what we buy. I'm going to hazard a guess, by the end of the year, we may have as much as capacity as $1.5 billion. Having said that, there's the one acquisition that's been sitting out there for  a product, which the situation is still undecided. That would take up about $550 million, maybe a little more because of the change in the currency. And then we have appetite for other acquisitions, I hope, significant ones in this environment. Just like we did with DALSA in 2010 and e2v in 2016. Under those economic conditions of those businesses were not performing very well, and we were able to acquire them with a -- at a reasonable price.

In T&M and instruments, I think instruments, in general, in Q2, we were just a little north of 1. And we think Q3 would be 1 and Q4 would be 1. So we should be okay there.

And so the big change for the year is in people. And I think that savings rolling forward net of charges that we take could be as much as $40 million to $50 million.  
Now having said that, it is our full intention to keep that low cost structure into next year, as we've done previously. The other area of cost savings is we have very strong initiatives in procurement. And we have a target of saving over $25 million in procurement this year. And that is not savings because we find fewer stock for savings, because we're buying them at a lower cost, because we're signing contracts with our favorite suppliers. If we can get that done that will save us another $20 million. In terms of the 1,000 people that I mentioned, I'd say half of it was maybe because the market demand going down like it controls, where market tanked to 50% of what it was.

Good morning, and thank you for joining our earnings call. I want to open with the following comments. First, all of our 70 worldwide manufacturing sites, as well as our corporate office and research laboratory, remain operational, and o",504,"Thank you, Jason. Good morning, and thank you for joining our earnings call. I want to open with the following comments. First, all of our 70 worldwide manufacturing sites, as well as our corporate office and research laboratory, remain operational, and only 16% of total employees are working from home. Second, our short-cycle environmental and test and measurement instrumentation businesses rebounded from the trough in the second quarter, growing approximately 6% at 5%, respectively, quarter-over-quarter. Third, we believe our longer-cycle commercial markets, such as marine instrumentation and medical imaging bottomed in the third quarter. Fourth, our government businesses continued to grow and generally remain in attractive niches, such as space-based imaging, manned and autonomous subsea systems and electronic warfare. 
Despite the market turmoil and lower sales in 2020, we have successfully demonstrated GAAP margin improvement. For example, the second quarter GAAP operating margin increased sequentially over 150 basis points. Specifically, operating margin of 16.4% was the second highest in the company's history. In addition, we achieved greater margins compared to last year in nearly every major business category, except commercial aerospace, where sales have declined nearly 50%. We also achieved record third quarter free cash flow, an all-time record free cash flow for any first 9-months period. Finally, our balance sheet has never been stronger, and our acquisition pipeline is healthy. 
As the overall demand environment continues to improve, our substantially lower cost structure, for example, we are operating with 9.3% pure employees, our lower cost structure should provide significant operating leverage in future quarters. Coupled with acquisitions, we expect earnings and cash flow to continue compounding for years to come. 
Before turning to Al to report on the third quarter performance by segment, I want to comment briefly on 2 important items: first, the OneWeb satellite program; and second, the potential acquisition of Photonis. 
Over the last few weeks, the OneWeb situation has improved considerably. First, OneWeb parent of our customer, Airbus OneWeb satellite, secured $235 million of interim financing in late September. Second, we received a substantial advanced payment in the month of October. And third, we recently signed a new, more favorable contract for which we have resumed limited production. While some risk remains, including a successful exit by OneWeb from bankruptcy, we currently expect a modest charge of approximately $3 million in the fourth quarter versus the potential $40 million noted earlier during the work stoppage. 
Now regarding Photonis. On September 28, we paused our efforts to acquire the business and voluntarily withdrew our application for authorization by the Government of France. In summary, we determined at that time that an acquisition under the proposed conditions of the French government was not visible at the seller's valuation expectation communicated to Teledyne. However, in recent days, the seller's valuation expectations have significantly moderated, and we have renewed our acquisition efforts. At this time, we are hopeful to conclude the negotiations and announce the acquisition before the end of the year. Al will now comment on the performance of our 4 segments."

Sales of environmental instruments decreased 2.1% from last year. However, sales increased 6.5% sequentially from the trough in the second quarter. Compared with last year, sales of certain products, such as laboratory instrumentation for life science applications, increased. However, this was more than offset by year-over-year declines in sales of selected industrial products, such as ambient air monitoring instrumentation. Sales of electronic test and measurement system decreased 6.5% year-over-year. Again, however, sales increased 4.6% sequentially. Sales of protocol test instrumentation, in particular, for PCI Express and USB test solutions, increased from last year, but sales of general-purpose oscilloscopes declined. Sales of marine instrumentation decreased 11.3% in the quarter. However, operating margin was stable due to head count management and business simplification initiatives. Overall, instrumentation segment operating margin increased 86 basis points despite the lower year-over-year sales. 
Turning to Digital Imaging segment. Third quarter sales decreased 1.8% and primarily reflected lower sales of x-ray detectors for dental and medical applications partially offset by greater sales of infrared detectors for the defense market and 3D geospatial imaging systems. Sales of industrial and scientific cameras and sensors were largely flat with last year with continued strength in semiconductor inspection and markets in Asia, largely offsetting some weaknesses in Europe and North America. GAAP segment operating margin was 19%, an increase of 210 basis points year-over-year. 
In the aerospace and defense electronics market, third quarter sales declined 18.2% as greater defense sales were more than offset by a 49% decline in sales of commercial aerospace products, as well as lower commercial space sales related to OneWeb. GAAP segment operating margin decreased due to lower sales but increased 621 basis points sequentially, given a significant lower cost structure. 
In the Engineered Systems segment, third quarter revenue increased 2.9% primarily due to greater sales from space, nuclear and other manufacturing programs as well as electronic manufacturing services. Segment operating profits increased 17.9% with margin 158 basis points higher than last year. 
I will now turn the call to Sue, who will offer some additional commentary regarding the third quarter and our 2020 outlook."

I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert and Al, and then I will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2020 outlook. 
In the third quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $153.1 million compared with cash flow of $150.9 million for the same period of 2019. Record free cash -- record third quarter free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, was $135.1 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared with $125.8 million in 2019. Capital expenditures were $15.2 million in the third quarter compared to $25.1 million for the same period of 2019. Depreciation and amortization expense was $29.2 million in the third quarter compared to $27.9 million for the same period of 2019. 
We ended the quarter with $332.2 million of net debt, that is $786.7 million of debt less cash of $454.5 million for a net debt-to-capital ratio of 9.9%. Stock option compensation expense was $5.7 million for both the third quarter of 2020 and 2019. 
Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2020 will be in the range of $2.56 to $2.86 per share, and for the full year 2020, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $9.70 to $10 compared with the prior outlook of $9.45 to $10. The 2020 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items, is expected to be 22.7%, a 210 basis point increase compared to full year 2019 due in part to less R&D tax credits. In addition, we currently expect less discrete tax items in 2020 compared with 2019. I will now pass the call back to Robert."

While there are -- of course, as you said, there's a lot of interest in communications in space, like the programs that you mentioned, our involvement right now is OneWeb. The more interesting part to us is the defense imaging sector, where we've been winning contracts recently and where our programs are very healthy. For example, we are involved with the wide field of view program in the defense sector and the OPIR program, which is persistent overhead infrared classified program. I think going forward, let's see what the outcome is on the OneWeb program. They have ambitions, of course, to increase the number of satellites in the future, but right now, we're more focused on making sure that we make the products we promised to make and we get paid for them.

On -- the more important thing that has happened recently, Joe, is that there was a significant change in price that we asked for and received, about 15% on U.S. dollar's basis. And frankly, you can appreciate that. Owning 100% of an entity is very different than owning 90% of an entity, and that's why the price reduction.

Our job is really very simple regardless of which administration is in and which programs are supported. Our job is to be able to get our share of the market and gain market against the competition. So I feel very good about our defense programs because of the breadth of offerings we have, from special imaging to electronic warfare to communication, et cetera. 
Having said all of that, defense today is about 20% of our sales, our portfolio, and I would say, a little less than that, 20% of our operating income, consequently, really my attention going forward, our attention going forward, is to expand our commercial businesses where we enjoy much higher margins."

That -- the effect of that, maintaining that cost structure is that it will help our margins approximately 130 basis points or so. The other thing is that we also have a procurement initiatives which are helping us reduce our cost across the board as we procure. We buy about $1.2 billion worth of goods and services, and our procurement initiatives are aimed at reducing that. So we expect to get a little bit help from that domain as well.

I'll try and answer that. Let's start with our Digital Imaging sales for this year. They're about $985 million -- $983 million, $985 million.

Let's start with our Digital Imaging sales for this year. They're about $985 million -- $983 million, $985 million. Last year, they were about $990 million, so it's flat year-over-year. Now the big chunk of that is our cameras and vision systems and sensors. They're used both for flat panel displays. Just about any phone or any television that you look at has to be inspected and, a lot of those are done by our cameras. And also our cameras are used in semiconductor industry for inspection. Overall, we sell both sensors and cameras, now of course, 3-dimension views of things. And that sales in that business is about $340 million and it's a fairly stable business. With all the problems with the pandemic, that business has remained healthy. It's flat year-over-year. But having said that, the margins have improved. 
The area that has hit us a little bit harder is in the health care area. Net sales there are about $220 million. We make x-ray detectors, both for dental as well as for looking at human anatomy, and we also make some x-ray sources, but let's stay with the detectors. 
As you know, the detectors that we make in the -- for the dental industry, they're both interoral, intraoral and extra-oral. That's outside the mouth and inside the mouth. That has been very slow because dentists have not been very active up until very recently. Our intraoral detectors are picking up. Our extra-oral detectors will probably be a little while before they pick up. We think that business would start picking up at the end of the fourth quarter. The one area that surprised us, frankly, in health care is that we make sources. We make magnetrons that go into radiotherapy instruments that are instruments that are used for cancer treatment. A lot of those instruments are also used for looking for cancer, and because of the pandemic, that area has significantly slowed down. And so until that area comes back, we don't think our health care businesses would be as robust as they used to be, and we think that's going to happen, by the way, next year. 
The aerospace and defense, that includes both our imaging for classified programs here as well as studying space, both here and in Europe. That's been an increase for us this year. Year-over-year, I think we've got an 8% increase. We're about $270 million. That's pretty healthy. 
The last 2 items are the MEMS business, MEMS, microelectronic systems, micromechanical systems. The revenue there is about $95 million. It's up about 12% from last year primarily because we bought a small MEMS business. We are probably the largest independent MEMS foundry in the world today, and we're very positive about that business. The issue there is it's a fab, very capital-intensive. So we're always balancing our capital investments against what kind of market share we want to have. 
The last area, of course, is our geospatial, where we make LiDARs and other devices, and that's a healthy business but it's relatively small. It's of the order of $58 million. So I don't know if that answered your question directionally. I think we expect the Digital Imaging business to grow next year."

Having said that, that's a no-brainer that, that is going to take off. The issue is at what time our hospital is going to be allowing patients in for other than serious surgery or cancer treatments or other things. We think that's going to happen next year. We even think, overall, in Digital Imaging, we should have a little increase from this quarter to next quarter, I would say, as much as maybe $10 million. And we think for next year, we probably should see of the range of about 8% to 9% increase in revenue overall in Digital Imaging, which would be pretty good for us since it's one of our higher-margin businesses."

Of course, that's for the -- our Navy Seals, and we are the sole provider of that. That program is going really well. As you move to the unmanned vehicles, from a defense perspective, we really have 2 sets of vehicles that are being used today. One of them is really a vehicle that is a glider, that glides into the ocean. And in front of a battleship formation, they can use as many as 100 gliders in order to sample the salinity, density of the water, which, of course, affects sonar transmission and reception. In that area, we've had probably the largest programs from the Navy. 
Another area, of course, is that we make medium-sized autonomous vehicles, and we have an -- we have sold some of those, both to our military as well as overseas. And we're looking at more opportunities in that area, especially as a prime. 
Going back to the large displacement AUVs. We are going to bid on that program probably as a subcontract versus someone else. But frankly, if you were to come and look at -- if you were to look at the submarine, and say, ""Okay, what kind of vehicles are available today in the world to be able to exit, be housed in a submarine and exit a submarine,"" the only new vehicle is ours, and that's the shallow water submersible vehicle and, of course, coupled with our unmanned vehicles that I just mentioned and the technologies that go with it, we're fairly bullish in that -- for that area."

We've demonstrated both characteristics, both being very prudent, but also when opportunities are afforded to us to be able to be more aggressive. I'll just mention to you that when we went through the downturn in 2008 to '10 financial crisis, right",404,"Yes. We've demonstrated both characteristics, both being very prudent, but also when opportunities are afforded to us to be able to be more aggressive. I'll just mention to you that when we went through the downturn in 2008 to '10 financial crisis, right after we came out of that, we acquired 2 very strong companies. One was LeCroy and the second one was DALSA. Fast forward, to the crisis in 2014 to '16, which is the oil crisis for us, we lost about $200 million in revenue. We improved our cash flow, just like we are doing now. As soon as we came out of there, we acquired e2v, which was our largest acquisition to date. It's about $780 million, and that's done really well. We started with margins there of 7%, 8%. They're almost reaching 20% today. 
Now going back now to your observation and question. I said before our ability, we had $1 billion or a little more than that. Because of our cash flow, that has significantly increased today. So I think it's closer to $1.5 billion. I think it could go as hard as $2 billion, depending on whether -- how much of an EBITDA we acquire. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio limit is about 3.5. Today, we are sitting around 1.4. And with more cash generation in the fourth quarter, we should be a little better than that. So I would say $1.5 billion to $2 billion, $1.9 billion is the range that we are capable of doing. 
Now if you take Photonis, which is going to cost us at least, to our best estimates, closing costs, et cetera, it's going to be about $450 million, $460 million. If you subtract that out, that leaves us with $1 billion to $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion additional capability. So we're looking. We're looking very hard. As we come out of this year, I think people are having a difficult time. And some of the Boards -- obviously, Board and management, as I said before, are always looking in the rearview mirror saying how well their stock used to be, where our shareholders are always looking, at least my view of it is, they're always looking forward through the front window, saying where things are and what kind of an offer would be attractive. So having said all of that, I think we think this is a good environment for us to make acquisitions."

But we think -- I feel better about it because I think we can live with that enterprise as a minority shareholder for a number of years. 
The second part is that, that business seems to -- we have to yet do a final due diligence check. That business seems to have held up pretty well during this difficult period, just like our defense businesses, because, primarily, it provides non-ITAR image intensifiers for night vision systems. 
Now what we bring to it is all of our digital imaging capabilities, which are all complementary and not duplicative of that. That field is moving more towards digitization, which we are experts in. So we think we bring substantial synergistic value to the enterprise, which has been missing in the recent past because it's been owned by a private equity firm. Therefore, it didn't have sister companies to interact with. There's a small part of the business also that is -- has to do with commercial laboratory instrumentation and for very low light using photon multipliers and technology used for the night vision. That's attractive to us also because we bought the scientific camera businesses, which serve laboratories, instruments and academic instruments across the world. And we think that is  really attractive to us because they bring the best mass spectrometry detectors to the field, and it will be a very nice overlap with our existing businesses that we acquired last year in that area. So those are some of the specifics about that acquisition, Jim."

The book-to-bill in Q3 is about 0.95, maybe a little more than that, because our Engineered Systems is a very lumpy business that we get a big book-to-bill. But excluding that, it's a little over 0.95. We expect next quarter to exceed 1 in book-to-bill based on everything that we see so far in the quarter. And we expect to end the year just below 1, maybe 0.98, 0.97. Now Q4 revenue, which I talked about digital imaging being up somewhat, Q4 revenue should increase over Q3 by about 4% or so or $40 million. That's a little higher than 4%. That would be very attractive for us because in the -- in Q2, where we had, I think, about $743 million in revenue, I said I expected Q3 to be equal and very similar to that. It ended up the revenue was about $7 million, $6 million higher, and the income was about the same, the EPS, even though we didn't have many onetime benefits in the third quarter. 
Just to digress for a second, if you take the third quarter of this year versus the third quarter of last year, there's a $0.29 income difference from taxes, onetime tax items and against onetime charges to benefit last year's third quarter. So if you kind of do an apples to apples, which we never really do non-GAAP measures, but if you do that, we're only down about $0.07, $0.08 from last year's fourth -- third quarter. 
So going into the fourth quarter, I think if we can increase the revenue in various groups and achieve about $40 million of increase in overall revenue, coupled to what is now our better margin that we're achieving, our margin this quarter was 16.4%, and so we think what will happen is that we will have a better earnings as well, which is what Sue alluded to, as we have raised our midpoint of our earnings earlier today."

Let me -- I'm going to get some looks around the table from my various segment operatives and others. But let me go back for a second. If we do what we have just said we would in the fourth quarter, we should end the year with segment operating margins of about 17%, which is what you noted because, early in the year, of course, Q1, it was 15.2%, and we've continuously improved. If we do that, then the total company operating margin, which was about 15% in the end of Q2, which is what I thought it would be, should improve to about 15.2% to 15.3%. And now going forward into next year, because of the actions that we spoke about, both people and procurement and a whole bunch of other 80-20 programs that we have, we expect to bump that up 130 basis points next year, our operating margins. And frankly, if you put it on 17 and you put it on 15, it's the same thing because the percentage of corporate costs are fairly fixed. 
Having said that, going forward, I think that would moderate somewhat because we took a lot of cost out this year, and we're going to enjoy the fruits of that next year.

I would think that, kind of given the setup into 2021, you've had a couple of years of more muted growth. And specifically, machine vision seems to be -- there could be some optimism of some upside brewing there given the semis and tech cycle. I guess how are you thinking about that business?

But let's say, absent any acquisition, I think right now, I expect us to grow our top line in the higher single digits in the overall Digital Imaging domain. I will only put a caveat on it that this health care situation hit us pretty hard, and we are expecting that we'll improve. If that were to happen, I think high single digits growth in revenue for Digital Imaging overall should be expected. And of course, if -- as you said, if we make the Photonis acquisition, that will -- another $150 million or plus million worth of revenue. And we -- so the business is going to grow. That's for sure.

I would say, obviously, there's 2 parts to our marine businesses. There's the offshore energy, which is both production as well as exploration, and then the second part is construction science but, more importantly, defense, where we are a major player in making penetrators for our submarine fleet. And then we have, of course, all the sensors program that are used, whether in our autonomous vehicles or others. So I think the defense sector of that business is healthy and will remain so and probably grow in future years. I think for you throwing science and construction, et cetera, that's really going to be almost 60% of our business going forward. 
Now the overall segment, the subsegment, the marine subsegment has revenues of about $420 million to $425 million. So the rest of it is offshore oil production and exploration, let's say, about $150 million total. That is fairly stable for us primarily because there is still -- at $40 a barrel or for us, there's still developments going on. And we are winning because we have the best products plus we have standardized products which people can buy, and we think that's going to be very stable. 
The area that has not come back is the offshore exploration, where we provide streamer cables and sensors. That used to be a pretty healthy business for us even after the downturn in the oil industry. That has kind of not been that high recently. And if that comes back, if they put more vessels in the water for exploration, I think that will help generally our marine business. But looking forward, I'd say growth in the marine business is going to be relatively benign. Well, what we're going to do there, and we've done their continuously improve the margins, it's enjoying really good margins above the average margins of our segments right now."

Good morning, and thank you for joining our earnings call. I want to open with the following comments. First, all of our 70 worldwide manufacturing sites, as well as our corporate office and research laboratory, remain operational and on",504,"Thank you, Jason. Good morning, and thank you for joining our earnings call. I want to open with the following comments. First, all of our 70 worldwide manufacturing sites, as well as our corporate office and research laboratory, remain operational and only 16% of total employees are working from home. Second, our short-cycle environmental and test and measurement instrumentation businesses rebounded from the trough in the second quarter, growing approximately 6% and 5%, respectively, quarter-over-quarter. Third, we believe our longer-cycle commercial markets, such as marine instrumentation and medical imaging bottomed in the third quarter. Fourth, our government businesses continue to grow and generally remain in attractive niches, such as space-based imaging, manned and autonomous subsea systems and electronic warfare.  
Despite the market turmoil and lower sales in 2020, we have successfully demonstrated GAAP margin improvement. For example, the second quarter GAAP operating margin increased sequentially over 150 basis points. Specifically, operating margin of 16.4% was the second highest in the company's history. In addition, we achieved greater margins compared to last year in nearly every major business category, except commercial aerospace, where sales have declined nearly 50%.
We also achieved record third quarter free cash flow, an all-time record free cash flow for any first 9-months period. Finally, our balance sheet has never been stronger, and our acquisition pipeline is healthy. 
As the overall demand environment continues to improve, our substantially lower cost structure, for example, we are operating with 9.3% fewer employees, our lower cost structure should provide significant operating leverage in future quarters. Coupled with acquisitions, we expect earnings and cash flow to continue compounding for years to come.  
Before turning to Al to report on the third quarter performance by segment, I want to comment briefly on 2 important items: first, the OneWeb satellite program; and second, the potential acquisition of Photonis.  
Over the last few weeks, the OneWeb situation has improved considerably. First, OneWeb parent of our customer, Airbus OneWeb Satellites, secured $235 million of interim financing in late September. Second, we received a substantial advance payment in the month of October. And third, we recently signed a new, more favorable contract for which we have resumed limited production. While some risk remains, including a successful exit by OneWeb from bankruptcy, we currently expect a modest charge of approximately $3 million in the fourth quarter versus the potential $40 million noted earlier during the work stoppage.
Now regarding Photonis. On September 28, we paused our efforts to acquire the business and voluntarily withdrew our application for authorization by the Government of France. In summary, we determined at that time that an acquisition under the proposed conditions of the French government was not visible at the seller's valuation expectation communicated to Teledyne. However, in recent days, the seller's valuation expectations have significantly moderated, and we have renewed our acquisition efforts. At this time, we are hopeful to conclude the negotiations and announce the acquisition before the end of the year. 
Al will now comment on the performance of our 4 segments."

Sales of environmental instruments decreased 2.1% from last year. However, sales increased 6.5% sequentially from the trough in the second quarter. Compared with last year, sales of certain products such as laboratory instrumentation for life science applications, increased. However, this was more than offset by year-over-year declines in sales of selected industrial products, such as ambient air monitoring instrumentation. Sales of electronic test and measurement system decreased 6.5% year-over-year. Again, however, sales increased 4.6% sequentially. Sales of protocol test instrumentation, in particular, for PCI Express and USB test solutions, increased from last year, but sales of general-purpose oscilloscopes declined. Sales of marine instrumentation decreased 11.3% in the quarter. However, operating margin was stable due to head count management and business simplification initiatives. Overall, instrumentation segment operating margin increased 86 basis points despite the lower year-over-year sales.
Turning to Digital Imaging segment. Third quarter sales decreased 1.8% and primarily reflected lower sales of x-ray detectors for dental and medical applications, partially offset by greater sales of infrared detectors for the defense market and 3D geospatial imaging systems. Sales of industrial and scientific cameras and sensors were largely flat with last year with continued strength in semiconductor inspection and markets in Asia, largely offsetting some weaknesses in Europe and North America. GAAP segment operating margin was 19%, an increase of 210 basis points year-over-year.  
In the Aerospace and Defense Electronics market, third quarter sales declined 18.2% as greater defense sales were more than offset by a 49% decline in sales of commercial aerospace products, as well as lower commercial space sales related to OneWeb. GAAP segment operating margin decreased due to lower sales but increased 621 basis points sequentially, given a significant lower cost structure.
In the Engineered Systems segment, third quarter revenue increased 2.9% primarily due to greater sales from space, nuclear and other manufacturing programs as well as electronic manufacturing services. Segment operating profits increased 17.9% with margin 158 basis points higher than last year.  
I will now turn the call to Sue, who will offer some additional commentary regarding the third quarter and our 2020 outlook."

I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert and Al, and then I will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2020 outlook.
In the third quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $150.3 million compared with cash flow of $150.9 million for the same period of 2019. Record free cash -- record third quarter free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, was $135.1 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared with $125.8 million in 2019. Capital expenditures were $15.2 million in the third quarter compared to $25.1 million for the same period of 2019. Depreciation and amortization expense was $29.2 million in the third quarter compared to $27.9 million for the same period of 2019.
We ended the quarter with $332.2 million of net debt, that is $786.7 million of debt less cash of $454.5 million for a net debt-to-capital ratio of 9.9%. Stock option compensation expense was $5.7 million for both the third quarter of 2020 and 2019.  
Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2020 will be in the range of $2.56 to $2.86 per share, and for the full year 2020, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $9.70 to $10 compared with the prior outlook of $9.45 to $10. The 2020 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items, is expected to be 22.7%, a 210 basis point increase compared to full year 2019 due in part to less R&D tax credits. In addition, we currently expect less discrete tax items in 2020 compared with 2019.

While there are -- of course, as you said, there's a lot of interest in communications in space, like the programs that you mentioned, our involvement right now is OneWeb.
The more interesting part to us is the defense imaging sector, where we've been winning contracts recently and where our programs are very healthy. For example, we are involved with the wide field-of-view program in the defense sector and the OPIR program, which is persistent overhead infrared classified program. I think going forward, let's see what the outcome is on the OneWeb program. They have ambitions, of course, to increase the number of satellites in the future, but right now, we're more focused on making sure that we make the products we promised to make and we get paid for them promptly.

That -- the effect of that, maintaining that cost structure, is that it will help our margins approximately 130 basis points or so. 
The other thing is that we also have procurement initiatives which are helping us reduce our cost across the board as we procure. We buy about $1.2 billion worth of goods and services, and our procurement initiatives are aimed at reducing that. So we expect to get a little bit help from that domain as well.

Circling back on Digital Imaging, I'm hoping to better understand kind of roughly end market weighting across things like machine vision, semis, life sciences, aero, et cetera. It seems like life science demand could carry the segment into 4Q. What specific end market considerations are baked into the segment outlook through year-end? And what are some of the longer arc trends that you're focused on? We see a lot of product announcements and expansions, but it's tough to contextualize exactly where those fit across your end markets. So I guess just high level, how do you expect this motion evolution to evolve?"

I'll try and answer that. Let's start with our Digital Imaging sales for this year. They're about $985 million -- $983 million, $985 million. Last year, they were about $990 million, so it's flat year-over-year. Now the big chunk of that is our came",543,"Okay. I'll try and answer that. Let's start with our Digital Imaging sales for this year. They're about $985 million -- $983 million, $985 million. Last year, they were about $990 million, so it's flat year-over-year. Now the big chunk of that is our cameras and vision systems and sensors. They're used both for flat panel displays, just about any phone or any television that you look at has to be inspected and a lot of those are done by our cameras. And also our cameras are used in semiconductor industry for inspection. Overall, we sell both sensors and cameras, now of course, 3-dimension views of things. And that sales in that business is about $340 million and it's a fairly stable business. With all the problems with the pandemic, that business has remained healthy. It's flat year-over-year. But having said that, the margins have improved. 
The area that has hit us a little bit harder is in the health care area. Net sales there are about $220 million. We make x-ray detectors, both for dental as well as for looking at human anatomy. We also make some x-ray sources, but let's stay with the detectors. As you know, the detectors that we make in the -- for the dental industry, they're both inter-oral -- intraoral and extraoral. That's outside the mouth and inside the mouth. That has been very slow because dentists have not been very active up until very recently. Our intraoral detectors are picking up. Our extraoral detectors will probably be a little while before they pick up. We think that business would start picking up at the end of the fourth quarter. The one area that surprised us, frankly, in health care is that we make sources. We make magnetrons that go into radiotherapy instruments, that are instruments that are used for cancer treatment. A lot of those instruments are also used for looking for cancer. Because of the pandemic, that area has significantly slowed down. And so until that area comes back, we don't think our health care businesses would be as robust as they used to be, and we think that's going to happen, by the way, next year. 
The Aerospace and Defense, that includes both our imaging for classified programs here as well as studying space, both here and in Europe, that's been an increase for us this year. Year-over-year, I think we've got an 8% increase. We're about $270 million. That's pretty healthy. 
The last 2 items are the MEMS business, MEMS, microelectronic systems, micromechanical systems. The revenue there is about $95 million. It's up about 12% from last year primarily because we bought a small MEMS business. We are probably the largest independent MEMS foundry in the world today, and we're very positive about that business. The issue there is it's a fab, very capital-intensive. So we're always balancing our capital investments against what kind of market share we want to have.
The last area, of course, is our geospatial, where we make LiDARs and other devices. That's a healthy business but it's relatively small. It's of the order of $58 million. So I don't know if that answered your question. Directionally, I think we expect the Digital Imaging business to grow next year."

The issue is at what time our hospital is going to be allowing patients in for other than serious surgery or cancer treatments or other things. We think that's going to happen next year. We even think, overall, in Digital Imaging, we should have a little increase from this quarter to next quarter, I would say, as much as maybe $10 million. And we think for next year, we probably should see of the range of about 8% to 9% increase in revenue overall in Digital Imaging, which would be pretty good for us since it's one of our higher-margin businesses."

Of course, that's for the -- our Navy Seals, and we are the sole provider of that. That program is going really well. As you move to the unmanned vehicles, from a defense perspective, we really have 2 sets of vehicles that are being used today. One of them is really a vehicle that is a glider, that glides in the ocean. And in front of a battleship formation, they can use as many as 100 gliders in order to sample the salinity, density of the water, which, of course, affects sonar transmission and reception. In that area, we've had probably the largest programs from the Navy. 
Another area, of course, is that we make medium-sized autonomous vehicles. We have an -- we have sold some of those, both to our military as well as overseas. And we're looking at more opportunities in that area, especially as a prime.
Going back to the large displacement AUVs, we are going to bid on that program probably as a subcontractor to someone else. But frankly, if you were to come and look at -- if you were to look at a submarine, and say, ""Okay, what kind of vehicles are available today in the world to be able to exit, be housed in a submarine and exit a submarine,"" the only new vehicle is ours, and that's the shallow water submersible vehicle and, of course, coupled with our unmanned vehicles that I just mentioned and the technologies that go with it, we're fairly bullish in that -- for that area."

We've demonstrated both characteristics, both being very prudent, but also when opportunities are afforded to us to be able to be more aggressive. I'll just mention to you that when we went through the downturn in 2008 to '10 financial crisis, right",406,"Yes. We've demonstrated both characteristics, both being very prudent, but also when opportunities are afforded to us to be able to be more aggressive. I'll just mention to you that when we went through the downturn in 2008 to '10 financial crisis, right after we came out of that, we acquired 2 very strong companies. One was LeCroy and the second one was DALSA. Fast forward, to the crisis in 2014 to '16, which is the oil crisis for us, we lost about $200 million in revenue. We improved our cash flow, just like we are doing now. As soon as we came out of there, we acquired e2v, which was our largest acquisition to date, it's about $780 million, and that's done really well. We started with margins there of 7%, 8%. They're almost reaching 20% today. 
Now going back now to your observation and question. I said before our ability -- we had $1 billion or a little more than that. Because of our cash flow, that has significantly increased today. So I think it's closer to $1.5 billion. I think it could go as high as $2 billion, depending on whether -- how much of an EBITDA we acquire. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio limit is about 3.5. Today, we are sitting around 1.4. And with more cash generation in the fourth quarter, we should be a little better than that. So I would say $1.5 billion to $2 billion, $1.9 billion is the range that we are capable of doing.
Now if you take Photonis, which is going to cost us at least, to our best estimates, closing costs, et cetera, it's going to be about $450 million, $460 million. If you subtract that out, that leaves us with $1 billion to $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion additional capability. 
So we're looking. We're looking very hard. As we come out of this year, I think people are having a difficult time. And some of the Boards -- obviously, Board and management, as I said before, are always looking in the rearview mirror saying how well their stock used to be. Where our shareholders are always looking, at least my view of it is, they're always looking forward through the front window, saying where things are and what kind of an offer would be attractive. So having said all of that, I think -- we think this is a good environment for us to make acquisitions."

But we think -- I feel better about it because I think we can live with that enterprise as a minority shareholder for a number of years.
The second part is that, that business seems to, we have to yet do a final due diligence check, that business seems to have held up pretty well during this difficult period, just like our defense businesses because, primarily, it provides non-ITAR image intensifiers for night vision systems.
Now what we bring to it is all of our digital imaging capabilities, which are all complementary and not duplicative of that. That field is moving more towards digitization, which we are experts in. So we think we bring substantial synergistic value to the enterprise, which has been missing in the recent past because it's been owned by a private equity firm, therefore, it didn't have sister companies to interact with. There's a small part of the business also that is -- has to do with commercial laboratory instrumentation and for very low light using photomultipliers and technology used for the night vision. That's attractive to us also because we've got the scientific camera businesses, which serve laboratories, instruments and academic instruments across the world. And we think that is  really attractive to us because they bring the best mass spectrometry detectors to the field, and it will be a very nice overlap with our existing businesses that we acquired last year in that area.

The book-to-bill in Q3 is about 0.95, maybe a little more than that, because our Engineered Systems is a very lumpy business that we get a big book-to-bill. But excluding that, it's a little over 0.95. We expect next quarter to exceed 1 in book-to-bill based on everything that we see so far in the quarter. And we expect to end the year just below 1, maybe 0.98, 0.97. Now Q4 revenue, which I talked about Digital Imaging being up somewhat, Q4 revenue should increase over Q3 by about 4% or so or $40 million, let's say. That's a little higher than 4%. That would be very attractive for us because in the -- in Q2, where we had, I think, about [ $743 million ] in revenue, I said I expected Q3 to be equal and very similar to that. It ended up the revenue was about $7 million, $6 million higher, and the income was about the same, the EPS, even though we didn't have many onetime benefits in the third quarter.
Just to digress for a second, if you take the third quarter of this year versus the third quarter of last year, there's a $0.29 income difference from taxes, onetime tax items and against onetime charges to benefit last year's third quarter. So if you kind of do an apples to apples, which we never really do non-GAAP measures, but if you do that, we're only down about $0.07, $0.08 from last year's fourth -- third quarter.
So going into the fourth quarter, I think if we can increase the revenue in various groups and achieve about $40 million of increase in overall revenue, coupled to what is now our better margin that we're achieving, our margin this quarter was 16.4%, and so we think what will happen is that we will have a better earnings as well, which is what Sue alluded to, as we have raised our midpoint of our earnings earlier today."

In Digital Imaging, I think I've already spoken about, it could be as high as $10 million to $15 million to maybe even $20 million in Q4 versus Q3.

Let me -- I'm going to get some looks around the table from my various segment operatives and others. But let me go back for a second. If we do what we have just said we would in the fourth quarter, we should end the year with segment operating margins of about 17%, which is what you noted because, early in the year, of course, Q1, it was 15.2%, and we've continuously improved. If we do that, then the total company operating margin, which was about 15% in the end of Q2 which is what I thought it would be, should improve to about 15.2% to 15.3%. Now going forward into next year, because of the actions that we spoke about, both people and procurement and a whole bunch of other 80-20 programs that we have, we expect to bump that up 130 basis points next year, our operating margins.

So the $135 million is a really very healthy cash flow for a company like ours. If we can continue that momentum, we -- I expect that, by the end of the year, we will be over [ $400 million ].

And until the oil and gas markets -- even though they're okay now, until they come back, we don't expect revenue increases. Having said that, the marine businesses, if you look at the total instrumentation business, the marine businesses have lower margins in general, even though the margins are improving significantly, but they're still about 200 basis points lower than the others. Environmental is about 100 basis points above the average, so is test and measurement. Those are very healthy businesses. So combined together, it kind of flattens out, but I think we're encouraged that our higher margin businesses are the ones that we're looking forward to growing."

I will only put a caveat on it that this health care situation hit us pretty hard, and we are expecting that we'll improve. If that were to happen, I think high single digits growth in revenue for Digital Imaging overall should be expected.

I would say, obviously, there's 2 parts to our marine businesses. There's the offshore energy, which is both production as well as exploration, and then the second part is construction, science, hydrography, but more importantly, defense, where we are a major player in making penetrators for our submarine fleet. And then we have, of course, the [ motion ] sensors program that are used, whether in our autonomous vehicles or others. So I think the defense sector of that business is healthy and will remain so and probably grow in future years. I think when you throw in science and construction, et cetera, that's really going to be almost 60% of our business going forward.
Now the overall segment, the subsegment, the marine subsegment has revenues of about $420 million to $425 million. So the rest of it is offshore oil production and exploration, let's say, about $150 million total. That is fairly stable for us primarily because there is still -- at $40 a barrel of oil, there's still developments going on. And we are winning because we have the best products plus we have standardized products which people can buy, and we think that's going to be very stable.
The area that has not come back is the offshore exploration, where we provide streamer cables and sensors. That used to be a pretty healthy business for us even after the downturn in the oil industry. That has kind of not been that high recently. And if that comes back, if they put more vessels in the water for exploration, I think that will help generally our marine business. But looking forward, I'd say growth in the marine business is going to be relatively benign. Where -- what we're going to do there, and we've done there continuously is improve the margins. It's enjoying really good margins above the average margins of our segments right now. I don't know if that answered..."

406526,691681638,2161660,"Teledyne Technologies Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2020",2020-10-21,"Earnings Calls","Teledyne Technologies Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Jason. Good morning, and thank you for joining our earnings call. I want to open with the following comments. First, all of our 70 worldwide manufacturing sites, as well as our corporate office and research laboratory, remain operational and on",504,"Thank you, Jason. Good morning, and thank you for joining our earnings call. I want to open with the following comments. First, all of our 70 worldwide manufacturing sites, as well as our corporate office and research laboratory, remain operational and only 16% of total employees are working from home. Second, our short-cycle environmental and test and measurement instrumentation businesses rebounded from the trough in the second quarter, growing approximately 6% and 5%, respectively, quarter-over-quarter. Third, we believe our longer-cycle commercial markets, such as marine instrumentation and medical imaging bottomed in the third quarter. Fourth, our government businesses continue to grow and generally remain in attractive niches, such as space-based imaging, manned and autonomous subsea systems and electronic warfare. 
Despite the market turmoil and lower sales in 2020, we have successfully demonstrated GAAP margin improvement. For example, the second quarter GAAP operating margin increased sequentially over 150 basis points. Specifically, operating margin of 16.4% was the second highest in the company's history. In addition, we achieved greater margins compared to last year in nearly every major business category, except commercial aerospace, where sales have declined nearly 50%.
We also achieved record third quarter free cash flow, an all-time record free cash flow for any first 9-months period. Finally, our balance sheet has never been stronger, and our acquisition pipeline is healthy. 
As the overall demand environment continues to improve, our substantially lower cost structure, for example, we are operating with 9.3% fewer employees, our lower cost structure should provide significant operating leverage in future quarters. Coupled with acquisitions, we expect earnings and cash flow to continue compounding for years to come. 
Before turning to Al to report on the third quarter performance by segment, I want to comment briefly on 2 important items: first, the OneWeb satellite program; and second, the potential acquisition of Photonis. 
Over the last few weeks, the OneWeb situation has improved considerably. First, OneWeb parent of our customer, Airbus OneWeb Satellites, secured $235 million of interim financing in late September. Second, we received a substantial advance payment in the month of October. And third, we recently signed a new, more favorable contract for which we have resumed limited production. While some risk remains, including a successful exit by OneWeb from bankruptcy, we currently expect a modest charge of approximately $3 million in the fourth quarter versus the potential $40 million noted earlier during the work stoppage.
Now regarding Photonis. On September 28, we paused our efforts to acquire the business and voluntarily withdrew our application for authorization by the Government of France. In summary, we determined at that time that an acquisition under the proposed conditions of the French government was not visible at the seller's valuation expectation communicated to Teledyne. However, in recent days, the seller's valuation expectations have significantly moderated, and we have renewed our acquisition efforts. At this time, we are hopeful to conclude the negotiations and announce the acquisition before the end of the year. 
Al will now comment on the performance of our 4 segments."

Sales of environmental instruments decreased 2.1% from last year. However, sales increased 6.5% sequentially from the trough in the second quarter. Compared with last year, sales of certain products such as laboratory instrumentation for life science applications, increased. However, this was more than offset by year-over-year declines in sales of selected industrial products, such as ambient air monitoring instrumentation. Sales of electronic test and measurement system decreased 6.5% year-over-year. Again, however, sales increased 4.6% sequentially. Sales of protocol test instrumentation, in particular, for PCI Express and USB test solutions, increased from last year, but sales of general-purpose oscilloscopes declined. Sales of marine instrumentation decreased 11.3% in the quarter. However, operating margin was stable due to head count management and business simplification initiatives. Overall, instrumentation segment operating margin increased 86 basis points despite the lower year-over-year sales.
Turning to Digital Imaging segment. Third quarter sales decreased 1.8% and primarily reflected lower sales of x-ray detectors for dental and medical applications, partially offset by greater sales of infrared detectors for the defense market and 3D geospatial imaging systems. Sales of industrial and scientific cameras and sensors were largely flat with last year with continued strength in semiconductor inspection and markets in Asia, largely offsetting some weaknesses in Europe and North America. GAAP segment operating margin was 19%, an increase of 210 basis points year-over-year. 
In the Aerospace and Defense Electronics market, third quarter sales declined 18.2% as greater defense sales were more than offset by a 49% decline in sales of commercial aerospace products, as well as lower commercial space sales related to OneWeb. GAAP segment operating margin decreased due to lower sales but increased 621 basis points sequentially, given a significant lower cost structure.
In the Engineered Systems segment, third quarter revenue increased 2.9% primarily due to greater sales from space, nuclear and other manufacturing programs as well as electronic manufacturing services. Segment operating profits increased 17.9% with margin 158 basis points higher than last year. 
I will now turn the call to Sue, who will offer some additional commentary regarding the third quarter and our 2020 outlook."

I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert and Al, and then I will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2020 outlook.
In the third quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $150.3 million compared with cash flow of $150.9 million for the same period of 2019. Record free cash -- record third quarter free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, was $135.1 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared with $125.8 million in 2019. Capital expenditures were $15.2 million in the third quarter compared to $25.1 million for the same period of 2019. Depreciation and amortization expense was $29.2 million in the third quarter compared to $27.9 million for the same period of 2019.
We ended the quarter with $332.2 million of net debt, that is $786.7 million of debt less cash of $454.5 million for a net debt-to-capital ratio of 9.9%. Stock option compensation expense was $5.7 million for both the third quarter of 2020 and 2019. 
Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2020 will be in the range of $2.56 to $2.86 per share, and for the full year 2020, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $9.70 to $10 compared with the prior outlook of $9.45 to $10. The 2020 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items, is expected to be 22.7%, a 210 basis point increase compared to full year 2019 due in part to less R&D tax credits. In addition, we currently expect less discrete tax items in 2020 compared with 2019.

While there are -- of course, as you said, there's a lot of interest in communications in space, like the programs that you mentioned, our involvement right now is OneWeb.
The more interesting part to us is the defense imaging sector, where we've been winning contracts recently and where our programs are very healthy. For example, we are involved with the wide field-of-view program in the defense sector and the OPIR program, which is persistent overhead infrared classified program. I think going forward, let's see what the outcome is on the OneWeb program. They have ambitions, of course, to increase the number of satellites in the future, but right now, we're more focused on making sure that we make the products we promised to make and we get paid for them promptly.

If there is a change in administration, as you indicated, then I think in the future years, in the out-years, we think things will remain relatively flat. Our job is really very simple regardless of which administration is in and which programs are supported. Our job is to be able to get our share of the market and gain market against the competition. So I feel very good about our defense programs because of the breadth of offerings we have, from space imaging to electronic warfare to communication, et cetera.
Having said all of that, defense today is about 20% of our sales, our portfolio, and I would say, a little less than that, 20% of our operating income. Consequently, really my attention going forward, our attention going forward, is to expand our commercial businesses where we enjoy much higher margins."

The first and the most important one is the lower number of employees. In general, we're down about 9.3%.

That -- the effect of that, maintaining that cost structure, is that it will help our margins approximately 130 basis points or so. 
The other thing is that we also have procurement initiatives which are helping us reduce our cost across the board as we procure. We buy about $1.2 billion worth of goods and services, and our procurement initiatives are aimed at reducing that. So we expect to get a little bit help from that domain as well. But by and large, I'd say, the 130 basis points for next year is a good number that I gave you. I'm hoping that it will be higher than that."

I'll try and answer that. Let's start with our Digital Imaging sales for this year. They're about $985 million -- $983 million, $985 million. Last year, they were about $990 million, so it's flat year-over-year. Now the big chunk of that is our came",543,"Okay. I'll try and answer that. Let's start with our Digital Imaging sales for this year. They're about $985 million -- $983 million, $985 million. Last year, they were about $990 million, so it's flat year-over-year. Now the big chunk of that is our cameras and vision systems and sensors. They're used both for flat panel displays, just about any phone or any television that you look at has to be inspected and a lot of those are done by our cameras. And also our cameras are used in semiconductor industry for inspection. Overall, we sell both sensors and cameras, now of course, 3-dimension views of things. And that sales in that business is about $340 million and it's a fairly stable business. With all the problems with the pandemic, that business has remained healthy. It's flat year-over-year. But having said that, the margins have improved. 
The area that has hit us a little bit harder is in the health care area. Net sales there are about $220 million. We make x-ray detectors, both for dental as well as for looking at human anatomy. We also make some x-ray sources, but let's stay with the detectors. As you know, the detectors that we make in the -- for the dental industry, they're both inter-oral -- intraoral and extraoral. That's outside the mouth and inside the mouth. That has been very slow because dentists have not been very active up until very recently. Our intraoral detectors are picking up. Our extraoral detectors will probably be a little while before they pick up. We think that business would start picking up at the end of the fourth quarter. The one area that surprised us, frankly, in health care is that we make sources. We make magnetrons that go into radiotherapy instruments, that are instruments that are used for cancer treatment. A lot of those instruments are also used for looking for cancer. Because of the pandemic, that area has significantly slowed down. And so until that area comes back, we don't think our health care businesses would be as robust as they used to be, and we think that's going to happen, by the way, next year. 
The Aerospace and Defense, that includes both our imaging for classified programs here as well as studying space, both here and in Europe, that's been an increase for us this year. Year-over-year, I think we've got an 8% increase. We're about $270 million. That's pretty healthy. 
The last 2 items are the MEMS business, MEMS, microelectronic systems, micromechanical systems. The revenue there is about $95 million. It's up about 12% from last year primarily because we bought a small MEMS business. We are probably the largest independent MEMS foundry in the world today, and we're very positive about that business. The issue there is it's a fab, very capital-intensive. So we're always balancing our capital investments against what kind of market share we want to have.
The last area, of course, is our geospatial, where we make LiDARs and other devices. That's a healthy business but it's relatively small. It's of the order of $58 million. So I don't know if that answered your question. Directionally, I think we expect the Digital Imaging business to grow next year."

Of course, that's for the -- our Navy Seals, and we are the sole provider of that. That program is going really well. As you move to the unmanned vehicles, from a defense perspective, we really have 2 sets of vehicles that are being used today. One of them is really a vehicle that is a glider, that glides in the ocean. And in front of a battleship formation, they can use as many as 100 gliders in order to sample the salinity, density of the water, which, of course, affects sonar transmission and reception. In that area, we've had probably the largest programs from the Navy. 
Another area, of course, is that we make medium-sized autonomous vehicles. We have an -- we have sold some of those, both to our military as well as overseas. And we're looking at more opportunities in that area, especially as a prime.
Going back to the large displacement AUVs, we are going to bid on that program probably as a subcontractor to someone else. But frankly, if you were to come and look at -- if you were to look at a submarine, and say, ""Okay, what kind of vehicles are available today in the world to be able to exit, be housed in a submarine and exit a submarine,"" the only new vehicle is ours, and that's the shallow water submersible vehicle and, of course, coupled with our unmanned vehicles that I just mentioned and the technologies that go with it, we're fairly bullish in that -- for that area."

We've demonstrated both characteristics, both being very prudent, but also when opportunities are afforded to us to be able to be more aggressive. I'll just mention to you that when we went through the downturn in 2008 to '10 financial crisis, right after we came out of that, we acquired 2 very strong companies. One was LeCroy and the second one was DALSA. Fast forward, to the crisis in 2014 to '16, which is the oil crisis for us, we lost about $200 million in revenue. We improved our cash flow, just like we are doing now. As soon as we came out of there, we acquired e2v, which was our largest acquisition to date, it's about $780 million, and that's done really well. We started with margins there of 7%, 8%. They're almost reaching 20% today. 
Now going back now to your observation and question. I said before our ability -- we had $1 billion or a little more than that. Because of our cash flow, that has significantly increased today. So I think it's closer to $1.5 billion. I think it could go as high as $2 billion, depending on whether -- how much of an EBITDA we acquire. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio limit is about 3.5. Today, we are sitting around 1.4. And with more cash generation in the fourth quarter, we should be a little better than that. So I would say $1.5 billion to $2 billion, $1.9 billion is the range that we are capable of doing.
Now if you take Photonis, which is going to cost us at least, to our best estimates, closing costs, et cetera, it's going to be about $450 million, $460 million. If you subtract that out, that leaves us with $1 billion to $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion additional capability. 
So we're looking. We're looking very hard. As we come out of this year, I think people are having a difficult time. And some of the Boards -- obviously, Board and management, as I said before, are always looking in the rearview mirror saying how well their stock used to be. Where our shareholders are always looking, at least my view of it is, they're always looking forward through the front window, saying where things are and what kind of an offer would be attractive. So having said all of that, I think -- we think this is a good environment for us to make acquisitions."

But we think -- I feel better about it because I think we can live with that enterprise as a minority shareholder for a number of years.
The second part is that, that business seems to, we have to yet do a final due diligence check, that business seems to have held up pretty well during this difficult period, just like our defense businesses because, primarily, it provides non-ITAR image intensifiers for night vision systems.
Now what we bring to it is all of our digital imaging capabilities, which are all complementary and not duplicative of that. That field is moving more towards digitization, which we are experts in. So we think we bring substantial synergistic value to the enterprise, which has been missing in the recent past because it's been owned by a private equity firm, therefore, it didn't have sister companies to interact with. There's a small part of the business also that is -- has to do with commercial laboratory instrumentation and for very low light using photomultipliers and technology used for the night vision. That's attractive to us also because we've got the scientific camera businesses, which serve laboratories, instruments and academic instruments across the world. And we think that is really attractive to us because they bring the best mass spectrometry detectors to the field, and it will be a very nice overlap with our existing businesses that we acquired last year in that area.

The book-to-bill in Q3 is about 0.95, maybe a little more than that, because our Engineered Systems is a very lumpy business that we get a big book-to-bill. But excluding that, it's a little over 0.95. We expect next quarter to exceed 1 in book-to-bill based on everything that we see so far in the quarter. And we expect to end the year just below 1, maybe 0.98, 0.97. Now Q4 revenue, which I talked about Digital Imaging being up somewhat, Q4 revenue should increase over Q3 by about 4% or so or $40 million, let's say. That's a little higher than 4%. That would be very attractive for us because in the -- in Q2, where we had, I think, about [ $743 million ] in revenue, I said I expected Q3 to be equal and very similar to that. It ended up the revenue was about $7 million, $6 million higher, and the income was about the same, the EPS, even though we didn't have many onetime benefits in the third quarter.
Just to digress for a second, if you take the third quarter of this year versus the third quarter of last year, there's a $0.29 income difference from taxes, onetime tax items and against onetime charges to benefit last year's third quarter. So if you kind of do an apples to apples, which we never really do non-GAAP measures, but if you do that, we're only down about $0.07, $0.08 from last year's fourth -- third quarter.
So going into the fourth quarter, I think if we can increase the revenue in various groups and achieve about $40 million of increase in overall revenue, coupled to what is now our better margin that we're achieving, our margin this quarter was 16.4%, and so we think what will happen is that we will have a better earnings as well, which is what Sue alluded to, as we have raised our midpoint of our earnings earlier today."

We expect some marginal sale improvements in our total instrumentation business, maybe as much as $15 million or so. But more importantly, I think we're seeing some -- of course, China is coming out of their downturn and doing well, but we also see some new products that we are offering in the pharmaceutical area as well as water sampling area that are encouraging for us. So in instrumentation, it would be 1. 
In Digital Imaging, I think I've already spoken about, it could be as high as $10 million to $15 million to maybe even $20 million in Q4 versus Q3.

And then are you -- is the -- are the comments that you made earlier sort of officially targeting 130 basis points of improvement in that next year? And then I can't quite tell if you've provided a long-term 20% target or not, but it certainly sounds like you expect more improvement beyond that.

Let me -- I'm going to get some looks around the table from my various segment operatives and others. But let me go back for a second. If we do what we have just said we would in the fourth quarter, we should end the year with segment operating margins of about 17%, which is what you noted because, early in the year, of course, Q1, it was 15.2%, and we've continuously improved. If we do that, then the total company operating margin, which was about 15% in the end of Q2 which is what I thought it would be, should improve to about 15.2% to 15.3%. Now going forward into next year, because of the actions that we spoke about, both people and procurement and a whole bunch of other 80-20 programs that we have, we expect to bump that up 130 basis points next year, our operating margins. And frankly, if you put it on 17% and we put it on 15%, it's the same thing because the percentage of corporate costs are fairly fixed.
Having said that, going forward, I think that would moderate somewhat because we took a lot of cost out this year, and we're going to enjoy the fruits of that next year. But I would be disappointed if we can't continuously improve our margins somewhere between 80 to 100 basis points in the next few years."

Now going to the cash flow for the year. In Q2, I said it'd be a little over $400 million. In Q3, where we enjoyed the $135 million of free cash flow, that also included $15.8 million that we had to repay the government for the CARES Act. So the $135 million is a really very healthy cash flow for a company like ours. If we can continue that momentum, we -- I expect that, by the end of the year, we will be over [ $400 million ]. [ $425 million ], I think that's within reach, maybe a little higher than that. And I expect if we can do all of that, then our net debt should drop around $200 million, a little north or south of $200 million, which puts us in a really good position for the future in terms of acquisitions."

I would say, obviously, there's 2 parts to our marine businesses. There's the offshore energy, which is both production as well as exploration, and then the second part is construction, science, hydrography, but more importantly, defense, where we are a major player in making penetrators for our submarine fleet. And then we have, of course, the [ motion ] sensors program that are used, whether in our autonomous vehicles or others. So I think the defense sector of that business is healthy and will remain so and probably grow in future years. I think when you throw in science and construction, et cetera, that's really going to be almost 60% of our business going forward.
Now the overall segment, the subsegment, the marine subsegment has revenues of about $420 million to $425 million. So the rest of it is offshore oil production and exploration, let's say, about $150 million total. That is fairly stable for us primarily because there is still -- at $40 a barrel of oil, there's still developments going on. And we are winning because we have the best products plus we have standardized products which people can buy, and we think that's going to be very stable.
The area that has not come back is the offshore exploration, where we provide streamer cables and sensors. That used to be a pretty healthy business for us even after the downturn in the oil industry. That has kind of not been that high recently. And if that comes back, if they put more vessels in the water for exploration, I think that will help generally our marine business. But looking forward, I'd say growth in the marine business is going to be relatively benign. Where -- what we're going to do there, and we've done there continuously is improve the margins. It's enjoying really good margins above the average margins of our segments right now. I don't know if that answered..."

Good morning, and thank you for joining our earnings call. I want to open with the following comments. First, all of our 70 worldwide manufacturing sites, as well as our corporate office and research laboratory, remain operational and on",504,"Thank you, Jason. Good morning, and thank you for joining our earnings call. I want to open with the following comments. First, all of our 70 worldwide manufacturing sites, as well as our corporate office and research laboratory, remain operational and only 16% of total employees are working from home. Second, our short-cycle environmental and test and measurement instrumentation businesses rebounded from the trough in the second quarter, growing approximately 6% and 5%, respectively, quarter-over-quarter. Third, we believe our longer-cycle commercial markets, such as marine instrumentation and medical imaging bottomed in the third quarter. Fourth, our government businesses continue to grow and generally remain in attractive niches, such as space-based imaging, manned and autonomous subsea systems and electronic warfare. 
Despite the market turmoil and lower sales in 2020, we have successfully demonstrated GAAP margin improvement. For example, the second quarter GAAP operating margin increased sequentially over 150 basis points. Specifically, operating margin of 16.4% was the second highest in the company's history. In addition, we achieved greater margins compared to last year in nearly every major business category, except commercial aerospace, where sales have declined nearly 50%.
We also achieved record third quarter free cash flow, an all-time record free cash flow for any first 9-months period. Finally, our balance sheet has never been stronger, and our acquisition pipeline is healthy. 
As the overall demand environment continues to improve, our substantially lower cost structure, for example, we are operating with 9.3% fewer employees, our lower cost structure should provide significant operating leverage in future quarters. Coupled with acquisitions, we expect earnings and cash flow to continue compounding for years to come. 
Before turning to Al to report on the third quarter performance by segment, I want to comment briefly on 2 important items: first, the OneWeb satellite program; and second, the potential acquisition of Photonis. 
Over the last few weeks, the OneWeb situation has improved considerably. First, OneWeb parent of our customer, Airbus OneWeb Satellites, secured $235 million of interim financing in late September. Second, we received a substantial advance payment in the month of October. And third, we recently signed a new, more favorable contract for which we have resumed limited production. While some risk remains, including a successful exit by OneWeb from bankruptcy, we currently expect a modest charge of approximately $3 million in the fourth quarter versus the potential $40 million noted earlier during the work stoppage.
Now regarding Photonis. On September 28, we paused our efforts to acquire the business and voluntarily withdrew our application for authorization by the Government of France. In summary, we determined at that time that an acquisition under the proposed conditions of the French government was not visible at the seller's valuation expectation communicated to Teledyne. However, in recent days, the seller's valuation expectations have significantly moderated, and we have renewed our acquisition efforts. At this time, we are hopeful to conclude the negotiations and announce the acquisition before the end of the year. 
Al will now comment on the performance of our 4 segments."

Sales of environmental instruments decreased 2.1% from last year. However, sales increased 6.5% sequentially from the trough in the second quarter. Compared with last year, sales of certain products such as laboratory instrumentation for life science applications, increased. However, this was more than offset by year-over-year declines in sales of selected industrial products, such as ambient air monitoring instrumentation. Sales of electronic test and measurement system decreased 6.5% year-over-year. Again, however, sales increased 4.6% sequentially. Sales of protocol test instrumentation, in particular, for PCI Express and USB test solutions, increased from last year, but sales of general-purpose oscilloscopes declined. Sales of marine instrumentation decreased 11.3% in the quarter. However, operating margin was stable due to head count management and business simplification initiatives. Overall, instrumentation segment operating margin increased 86 basis points despite the lower year-over-year sales.
Turning to Digital Imaging segment. Third quarter sales decreased 1.8% and primarily reflected lower sales of x-ray detectors for dental and medical applications, partially offset by greater sales of infrared detectors for the defense market and 3D geospatial imaging systems. Sales of industrial and scientific cameras and sensors were largely flat with last year with continued strength in semiconductor inspection and markets in Asia, largely offsetting some weaknesses in Europe and North America. GAAP segment operating margin was 19%, an increase of 210 basis points year-over-year. 
In the Aerospace and Defense Electronics market, third quarter sales declined 18.2% as greater defense sales were more than offset by a 49% decline in sales of commercial aerospace products, as well as lower commercial space sales related to OneWeb. GAAP segment operating margin decreased due to lower sales but increased 621 basis points sequentially, given a significant lower cost structure.
In the Engineered Systems segment, third quarter revenue increased 2.9% primarily due to greater sales from space, nuclear and other manufacturing programs as well as electronic manufacturing services. Segment operating profits increased 17.9% with margin 158 basis points higher than last year. 
I will now turn the call to Sue, who will offer some additional commentary regarding the third quarter and our 2020 outlook."

I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert and Al, and then I will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2020 outlook.
In the third quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $150.3 million compared with cash flow of $150.9 million for the same period of 2019. Record free cash -- record third quarter free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, was $135.1 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared with $125.8 million in 2019. Capital expenditures were $15.2 million in the third quarter compared to $25.1 million for the same period of 2019. Depreciation and amortization expense was $29.2 million in the third quarter compared to $27.9 million for the same period of 2019.
We ended the quarter with $332.2 million of net debt, that is $786.7 million of debt less cash of $454.5 million for a net debt-to-capital ratio of 9.9%. Stock option compensation expense was $5.7 million for both the third quarter of 2020 and 2019. 
Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2020 will be in the range of $2.56 to $2.86 per share, and for the full year 2020, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $9.70 to $10 compared with the prior outlook of $9.45 to $10. The 2020 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items, is expected to be 22.7%, a 210 basis point increase compared to full year 2019 due in part to less R&D tax credits. In addition, we currently expect less discrete tax items in 2020 compared with 2019.

In the commercial sector, a lot of our instruments are used both for studying the universe as well as looking down at the earth for environmental measurements. On the defense side, on the other hand, we do have a large number of programs that address the needs for looking at weapons through satellites. While there are -- of course, as you said, there's a lot of interest in communications in space, like the programs that you mentioned, our involvement right now is OneWeb.
The more interesting part to us is the defense imaging sector, where we've been winning contracts recently and where our programs are very healthy. For example, we are involved with the wide field-of-view program in the defense sector and the OPIR program, which is persistent overhead infrared classified program. I think going forward, let's see what the outcome is on the OneWeb program. They have ambitions, of course, to increase the number of satellites in the future, but right now, we're more focused on making sure that we make the products we promised to make and we get paid for them promptly.

So I feel very good about our defense programs because of the breadth of offerings we have, from space imaging to electronic warfare to communication, et cetera.
Having said all of that, defense today is about 20% of our sales, our portfolio, and I would say, a little less than that, 20% of our operating income.

The first and the most important one is the lower number of employees. In general, we're down about 9.3%.

That -- the effect of that, maintaining that cost structure, is that it will help our margins approximately 130 basis points or so. 
The other thing is that we also have procurement initiatives which are helping us reduce our cost across the board as we procure. We buy about $1.2 billion worth of goods and services, and our procurement initiatives are aimed at reducing that. So we expect to get a little bit help from that domain as well. But by and large, I'd say, the 130 basis points for next year is a good number that I gave you. I'm hoping that it will be higher than that."

I'll try and answer that. Let's start with our Digital Imaging sales for this year. They're about $985 million -- $983 million, $985 million. Last year, they were about $990 million, so it's flat year-over-year. Now the big chunk of that is our came",543,"Okay. I'll try and answer that. Let's start with our Digital Imaging sales for this year. They're about $985 million -- $983 million, $985 million. Last year, they were about $990 million, so it's flat year-over-year. Now the big chunk of that is our cameras and vision systems and sensors. They're used both for flat panel displays, just about any phone or any television that you look at has to be inspected and a lot of those are done by our cameras. And also our cameras are used in semiconductor industry for inspection. Overall, we sell both sensors and cameras, now of course, 3-dimension views of things. And that sales in that business is about $340 million and it's a fairly stable business. With all the problems with the pandemic, that business has remained healthy. It's flat year-over-year. But having said that, the margins have improved. 
The area that has hit us a little bit harder is in the health care area. Net sales there are about $220 million. We make x-ray detectors, both for dental as well as for looking at human anatomy. We also make some x-ray sources, but let's stay with the detectors. As you know, the detectors that we make in the -- for the dental industry, they're both inter-oral -- intraoral and extraoral. That's outside the mouth and inside the mouth. That has been very slow because dentists have not been very active up until very recently. Our intraoral detectors are picking up. Our extraoral detectors will probably be a little while before they pick up. We think that business would start picking up at the end of the fourth quarter. The one area that surprised us, frankly, in health care is that we make sources. We make magnetrons that go into radiotherapy instruments, that are instruments that are used for cancer treatment. A lot of those instruments are also used for looking for cancer. Because of the pandemic, that area has significantly slowed down. And so until that area comes back, we don't think our health care businesses would be as robust as they used to be, and we think that's going to happen, by the way, next year. 
The Aerospace and Defense, that includes both our imaging for classified programs here as well as studying space, both here and in Europe, that's been an increase for us this year. Year-over-year, I think we've got an 8% increase. We're about $270 million. That's pretty healthy. 
The last 2 items are the MEMS business, MEMS, microelectronic systems, micromechanical systems. The revenue there is about $95 million. It's up about 12% from last year primarily because we bought a small MEMS business. We are probably the largest independent MEMS foundry in the world today, and we're very positive about that business. The issue there is it's a fab, very capital-intensive. So we're always balancing our capital investments against what kind of market share we want to have.
The last area, of course, is our geospatial, where we make LiDARs and other devices. That's a healthy business but it's relatively small. It's of the order of $58 million. So I don't know if that answered your question. Directionally, I think we expect the Digital Imaging business to grow next year."

Of course, that's for the -- our Navy Seals, and we are the sole provider of that. That program is going really well. As you move to the unmanned vehicles, from a defense perspective, we really have 2 sets of vehicles that are being used today. One of them is really a vehicle that is a glider, that glides in the ocean. And in front of a battleship formation, they can use as many as 100 gliders in order to sample the salinity, density of the water, which, of course, affects sonar transmission and reception. In that area, we've had probably the largest programs from the Navy. 
Another area, of course, is that we make medium-sized autonomous vehicles. We have an -- we have sold some of those, both to our military as well as overseas. And we're looking at more opportunities in that area, especially as a prime.
Going back to the large displacement AUVs, we are going to bid on that program probably as a subcontractor to someone else. But frankly, if you were to come and look at -- if you were to look at a submarine, and say, ""Okay, what kind of vehicles are available today in the world to be able to exit, be housed in a submarine and exit a submarine,"" the only new vehicle is ours, and that's the shallow water submersible vehicle and, of course, coupled with our unmanned vehicles that I just mentioned and the technologies that go with it, we're fairly bullish in that -- for that area."

We've demonstrated both characteristics, both being very prudent, but also when opportunities are afforded to us to be able to be more aggressive. I'll just mention to you that when we went through the downturn in 2008 to '10 financial crisis, right after we came out of that, we acquired 2 very strong companies. One was LeCroy and the second one was DALSA. Fast forward, to the crisis in 2014 to '16, which is the oil crisis for us, we lost about $200 million in revenue. We improved our cash flow, just like we are doing now. As soon as we came out of there, we acquired e2v, which was our largest acquisition to date, it's about $780 million, and that's done really well. We started with margins there of 7%, 8%. They're almost reaching 20% today. 
Now going back now to your observation and question. I said before our ability -- we had $1 billion or a little more than that. Because of our cash flow, that has significantly increased today. So I think it's closer to $1.5 billion. I think it could go as high as $2 billion, depending on whether -- how much of an EBITDA we acquire. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio limit is about 3.5. Today, we are sitting around 1.4. And with more cash generation in the fourth quarter, we should be a little better than that. So I would say $1.5 billion to $2 billion, $1.9 billion is the range that we are capable of doing.
Now if you take Photonis, which is going to cost us at least, to our best estimates, closing costs, et cetera, it's going to be about $450 million, $460 million. If you subtract that out, that leaves us with $1 billion to $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion additional capability. 
So we're looking. We're looking very hard. As we come out of this year, I think people are having a difficult time. And some of the Boards -- obviously, Board and management, as I said before, are always looking in the rearview mirror saying how well their stock used to be. Where our shareholders are always looking, at least my view of it is, they're always looking forward through the front window, saying where things are and what kind of an offer would be attractive. So having said all of that, I think -- we think this is a good environment for us to make acquisitions."

But we think -- I feel better about it because I think we can live with that enterprise as a minority shareholder for a number of years.
The second part is that, that business seems to, we have to yet do a final due diligence check, that business seems to have held up pretty well during this difficult period, just like our defense businesses because, primarily, it provides non-ITAR image intensifiers for night vision systems.
Now what we bring to it is all of our digital imaging capabilities, which are all complementary and not duplicative of that. That field is moving more towards digitization, which we are experts in. So we think we bring substantial synergistic value to the enterprise, which has been missing in the recent past because it's been owned by a private equity firm, therefore, it didn't have sister companies to interact with. There's a small part of the business also that is -- has to do with commercial laboratory instrumentation and for very low light using photomultipliers and technology used for the night vision. That's attractive to us also because we've got the scientific camera businesses, which serve laboratories, instruments and academic instruments across the world. And we think that is really attractive to us because they bring the best mass spectrometry detectors to the field, and it will be a very nice overlap with our existing businesses that we acquired last year in that area.

The book-to-bill in Q3 is about 0.95, maybe a little more than that, because our Engineered Systems is a very lumpy business that we get a big book-to-bill. But excluding that, it's a little over 0.95. We expect next quarter to exceed 1 in book-to-bill based on everything that we see so far in the quarter. And we expect to end the year just below 1, maybe 0.98, 0.97. Now Q4 revenue, which I talked about Digital Imaging being up somewhat, Q4 revenue should increase over Q3 by about 4% or so or $40 million, let's say. That's a little higher than 4%. That would be very attractive for us because in the -- in Q2, where we had, I think, about [ $743 million ] in revenue, I said I expected Q3 to be equal and very similar to that. It ended up the revenue was about $7 million, $6 million higher, and the income was about the same, the EPS, even though we didn't have many onetime benefits in the third quarter.
Just to digress for a second, if you take the third quarter of this year versus the third quarter of last year, there's a $0.29 income difference from taxes, onetime tax items and against onetime charges to benefit last year's third quarter. So if you kind of do an apples to apples, which we never really do non-GAAP measures, but if you do that, we're only down about $0.07, $0.08 from last year's fourth -- third quarter.
So going into the fourth quarter, I think if we can increase the revenue in various groups and achieve about $40 million of increase in overall revenue, coupled to what is now our better margin that we're achieving, our margin this quarter was 16.4%, and so we think what will happen is that we will have a better earnings as well, which is what Sue alluded to, as we have raised our midpoint of our earnings earlier today."

And we think -- as a consequence, we think that those businesses are going to do okay going forward. We expect some marginal sale improvements in our total instrumentation business, maybe as much as $15 million or so. But more importantly, I think we're seeing some -- of course, China is coming out of their downturn and doing well, but we also see some new products that we are offering in the pharmaceutical area as well as water sampling area that are encouraging for us. So in instrumentation, it would be 1. 
In Digital Imaging, I think I've already spoken about, it could be as high as $10 million to $15 million to maybe even $20 million in Q4 versus Q3. I think -- in Aerospace and Defense, I think we're going to be fairly flat primarily because I don't think there's going to be any much movement in the aerospace domain, and our defense is already pretty healthy. In the Engineered System, we may have some uptick in revenue, but we'll have some pressure on our margins. But generally, we think if you add all of that up, we could have about $40 million increase quarter-over-quarter because of the things that I mentioned."

Let me -- I'm going to get some looks around the table from my various segment operatives and others. But let me go back for a second. If we do what we have just said we would in the fourth quarter, we should end the year with segment operating margins of about 17%, which is what you noted because, early in the year, of course, Q1, it was 15.2%, and we've continuously improved. If we do that, then the total company operating margin, which was about 15% in the end of Q2 which is what I thought it would be, should improve to about 15.2% to 15.3%. Now going forward into next year, because of the actions that we spoke about, both people and procurement and a whole bunch of other 80-20 programs that we have, we expect to bump that up 130 basis points next year, our operating margins. And frankly, if you put it on 17% and we put it on 15%, it's the same thing because the percentage of corporate costs are fairly fixed.
Having said that, going forward, I think that would moderate somewhat because we took a lot of cost out this year, and we're going to enjoy the fruits of that next year. But I would be disappointed if we can't continuously improve our margins somewhere between 80 to 100 basis points in the next few years."

Over 100% conversion? Yes. And we anticipate that, that will continue because of all the programs that we have, introducing managed working capital and reducing costs in general. Now going to the cash flow for the year. In Q2, I said it'd be a little over $400 million. In Q3, where we enjoyed the $135 million of free cash flow, that also included $15.8 million that we had to repay the government for the CARES Act. So the $135 million is a really very healthy cash flow for a company like ours. If we can continue that momentum, we -- I expect that, by the end of the year, we will be over [ $400 million ]. [ $425 million ], I think that's within reach, maybe a little higher than that. And I expect if we can do all of that, then our net debt should drop around $200 million, a little north or south of $200 million, which puts us in a really good position for the future in terms of acquisitions."

I would say, obviously, there's 2 parts to our marine businesses. There's the offshore energy, which is both production as well as exploration, and then the second part is construction, science, hydrography, but more importantly, defense, where we are a major player in making penetrators for our submarine fleet. And then we have, of course, the [ motion ] sensors program that are used, whether in our autonomous vehicles or others. So I think the defense sector of that business is healthy and will remain so and probably grow in future years. I think when you throw in science and construction, et cetera, that's really going to be almost 60% of our business going forward.
Now the overall segment, the subsegment, the marine subsegment has revenues of about $420 million to $425 million. So the rest of it is offshore oil production and exploration, let's say, about $150 million total. That is fairly stable for us primarily because there is still -- at $40 a barrel of oil, there's still developments going on. And we are winning because we have the best products plus we have standardized products which people can buy, and we think that's going to be very stable.
The area that has not come back is the offshore exploration, where we provide streamer cables and sensors. That used to be a pretty healthy business for us even after the downturn in the oil industry. That has kind of not been that high recently. And if that comes back, if they put more vessels in the water for exploration, I think that will help generally our marine business. But looking forward, I'd say growth in the marine business is going to be relatively benign. Where -- what we're going to do there, and we've done there continuously is improve the margins.
