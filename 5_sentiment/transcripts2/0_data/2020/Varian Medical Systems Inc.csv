As you all know, Mike Bruff formally assumed the role of CFO for the company on December 1. And this will be his first earnings call in that capacity. And as announced in the first quarter, Anshul is now leading our Investor Relations function. 
With that, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I'll share the key milestones we achieved this past quarter and how they contributed to our long-term growth and value creation strategy. 
Our first quarter results reflect continued momentum, driven by our expanding and industry-leading product portfolio and innovation cycle. Now let me touch on our first quarter performance. Total company revenues of $829 million increased 12%. Oncology revenues grew 11% to $782 million. Proton revenues were $28 million, down 28% and other revenues were $19 million. 
Operating earnings of $135 million, or 16.2% of revenues, grew 13%. This includes planned investments to drive growth as well as project mix and updated project costs in our Proton Solutions business. 
GAAP earnings per share of $0.96 declined 14% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.16 grew 10%. Cash flows from operations were $113 million, down $28 million due to investment in working capital to support our growth. 
Now let me provide some additional color on the quarter. Our progress toward becoming the global leader in multidisciplinary cancer care solutions is powered by executing on our 4 strategic enablers for customers and their patients: First, innovating in radiation therapy; second, leveraging artificial intelligence, machine learning and cloud-based solutions; third, growing emerging businesses, geographies and technologies; and fourth, improving operational, financial and capital efficiency. 
First, let's review our progress on innovating in radiation therapy. We continue to extend our global market share leadership and expand our addressable market with our product innovation, comprehensive portfolio and services offerings. In the oncology business, orders grew 8% in the quarter and the trailing 12 months. Based on public filings, we continue to be the market share leader for both orders and revenues. 
We signed an agreement with Massachusetts General Hospital for 7 Varian radiotherapy systems. 5 will be -- 5 will replace non-Varian systems, one will replace an existing Varian system and one will be placed in a new vault. Installation is expected to begin in 2020. 
In December 2019, we received an order for 7 tubing machines with 6 identified systems at the National Cancer Center in Singapore. Subsequent to quarter close, we were ordered an order for 1 Edge system and 2 VitalBeam systems at the National University Hospital of Singapore. In Brazil, we received 8 orders for Halcyon in the quarter. And in China, we continue to see issuance of category B licenses as well as market share leadership in the country. 
Hardware revenues grew 2% for the quarter. Our worldwide net installed base of 8,561 units grew 363 units or 4%. This continued growth in our installed base drives future recurring revenue from upgrades, software and services. 
In Africa, we continue to expand access to quality cancer care with the installation of 3 Halcyon systems at the [indiscernible] Oncology in Mauritania, [indiscernible] in Congo, and the Lagos Teaching University Hospital in Nigeria. 
On the software front, revenues grew 13%, driven by continued adoption of our software solutions. We remain focused on investing innovation in innovation around efficient clinical workflow, systems integration and treatment planning quality to help close the current resource and skills gap around the globe. 
Orders for HyperArc, our high-definition radiotherapy solution for stereotactic radiosurgery brain metastases, grew double digits in the quarter. With less than 14% penetration, this continues to be a sizable opportunity across our TrueBeam installed base. 
Our services revenues grew 22% in the quarter, including the benefit from CTSI in a 14-week quarter excluding these benefits, services revenue grew 8%. CTSI, which is integrated into our Oncology Systems business, continues to perform in line with our expectations. We're investing in infrastructure for new technology-enabled services to drive mature market productivity and accelerate emerging market adoption. 
In our Proton Solutions business, we took 1 new order in the quarter. Our pipeline in the Proton business remains strong, and we continue to gain market -- global market share with customer interest driven by our smaller footprint ProBeam 360, and the preclinical research we are doing with the FlashForward consortium. As highlighted in our fourth quarter earnings call in October, we were selected by Penn Medicine to install an additional ProBeam 360 system in a single-room configuration at the Lancaster General Health and [indiscernible] Cancer Institute. The center is expected to treat its first patient in 2021. 
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we were selected by China Medical University Hospital in Taiwan to install a ProBeam 360 system in a single-room configuration with the ability to add a second gantry. The center will also use our Re Information Management System and Eclipse Treatment Planning System and is scheduled for completion in 2024. 
We have 78 Proton rooms under contract across 26 sites globally, 38 rooms are operational, including 1 room that was handed over to clinical operations this quarter. 
In November, the South Florida Proton Therapy Institute, or SFPTI on the campus of Delray Medical Center treated its first patient on our ProBeam compact single-room system. SFPTI is now treating more than 30 patients per day, making it the fastest ramp of patient treatments per gantry in the world. 
Turning our attention to flash, preclinical research and product development is progressing per plan, and we are encouraged by the results we continue to see from the FlashForward consortium efforts. As our global ProBeam footprint continues to expand. The FlashForward consortium now has representation from all geographies, enabling future research across different regional populations. 
Second, let's turn to our progress in leveraging artificial intelligence, machine learning and cloud solutions. Since the launch of the artificial intelligence powered Ethos Therapy System in September of 2019, reception and excitement for the platform has been extremely strong. During the quarter, we received 3 orders for Ethos. Two of the orders were from Australia, including a second order from the Icon Group and 1 order from Israel. Ethos is CE marked and 510(k) pending in the U.S. Treatments at our first clinical site in Herlev Hospital, Denmark, continued to progress well, while initial focus has been on bladder cancer. The team is preparing to start adaptive therapy for new disease sites in the pelvis. Additionally our second center, Midish Spectrum '20 and Netherlands went live in December, and our third and fourth installations are underway in Australia at the Icon Group center in Waroonga and Royal North Shore Hospital, respectively. Install time has been about 2 weeks at the initial sites, and we expect the number of installs to increase in the second half. 
Our adaptive intelligence consortium efforts are on track for both clinical and technical publications throughout 2020. We expect to see significant publications on several disease sites. Early evaluation results show that full adaptive sessions are practical in a typical 15-minute treatment time slot. 
In Europe in 2019 we launched RapidPlan PT, our individualized machine learning, treatment planning software for Proton therapy and plan to expand the offering in other regions in the future. Consistent with RapidPlan for conventional radiotherapy, Rapidplan PT reduces the treatment planning time for Proton therapy from several hours to approximately 10 minutes without compromising the quality of the plan. This is extraordinary, particularly when you think about the skilled resources gap in proton therapy and creates significant clinical efficiency for our customers. 
Third, let's discuss emerging businesses, geographies and technologies. In November, we established a direct sales and service operation in the Republic of Kenya to better serve the growing cancer population in the country and the East Africa region. Africa continues to be a sizable opportunity for us given the minimal access to radiation therapy and the estimated 2.1 million new cancer cases diagnosed per year by 2040. Our installed base in Africa has increased approximately 30% over the last 2 fiscal years. 
We continue to execute and grow our Interventional Solutions business with revenues of $19 million, which are reported under the Other segment. We had solid performance in China and continue to invest in global distribution capacity and our software platform to support this global business. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Mike, who will discuss our fourth strategic enabler and provide more context on the first quarter financial results."

Company-wide revenue",712,"Thanks, Dow, and hello, everyone. Our fourth strategic enabler is improving financial, operational and capital efficiency by maintaining a balanced focus across growth, profitability and liquidity. 
So let me first start with growth. Company-wide revenues were $829 million, up 12% in dollars and 13% in constant currency. Organic revenues grew 8%. 
In Oncology Systems, revenues were $782 million, up 11% in dollars and 12% in constant currency, driven by strong growth in software and services. On a trailing 12-month basis, revenues grew 11% in dollars and 13% in constant currency. 
Orders were $774 million, up 8% and in dollars and 9% in constant currency in both the quarter and the trailing 12 months. Geographic orders mix was 46% in the Americas, 31% in EMEA, and 23% in APAC. 
We ended the quarter with $3.1 billion in backlog, up 4%. Taking a closer look at our Oncology business results, in the Americas, revenues grew 15% in the geography and in our North America region. Orders were $360 million, up 7%. On a trailing 12-month basis, orders grew 6%, driven by continued market demand for our integrated, value-based care solutions. 
In our Europe, Middle East, India and Africa geography, revenues grew 11%. Orders were $237 million, up 8%. On a trailing 12-month basis, orders grew 11%. 
Asia Pacific revenues grew 5% and orders were $178 million, up 9%, led by double-digit growth in our China and our Southeast Asia, Korea region, partially offset by softness in Japan. On a trailing 12-month basis, orders grew 6% for the Asia Pacific geography. 
Our Proton Solutions business posted revenues of $28 million, a decline of 28%, primarily driven by project mix. Service revenues of $8 million grew 54%. During the quarter, we reduced our proton therapy backlog by $19 million to reflect an Indian customer's decision to cancel the order that we booked in the fourth quarter of 2017. No revenue had been recognized on this order. 
Turning to profitability. Total company gross margin was $369 million, up 16% and 44.5% of revenues, an increase of 160 basis points, driven by product mix, acquisitions and tariff exclusions. This was partially offset by Proton business project mix and the $4 million of updated project costs. Oncology gross margin of 45.4% of revenues increased 100 basis points. 
Investing in R&D to drive innovation remains core to our long-term growth and value creation strategy. We invested $67 million in R&D, up 10%, which is 8.1% of revenues. SG&A expenses were $167 million, up 21%, which is 20.2% of revenue. Excluding the acquisitions of CTSI, EndoCare, Alicon and the Boston Scientific B portfolio, SG&A was up 13%. 
Company operating earnings were $135 million, up 13%, which is 16.2% of revenues, up 15 basis points driven by the gross margin expansion and planned investments to drive future growth. The $4 million updated project cost in the proton business impacted operating earnings in the quarter by 50 basis points. 
GAAP EPS was $0.96 and non-GAAP EPS was $1.16. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 21% and diluted share count was 91.7 million shares. This quarter, our GAAP operating earnings and GAAP EPS included an $8.8 million change in fair value of the contingent consideration related to our acquisitions of EndoCare and Alicon. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 GAAP net earnings and GAAP EPS included a $22 million gain on the sale of our equity investment in Augmenix. 
Turning to the balance sheet and liquidity. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $722 million and $544 million in debt. Certain proceeds from borrowings in the quarter were used to fund U.S. operations in the short term. 
Cash flows from operations were $113 million, down 20% due to investment in working capital to support continued growth. Oncology DSO was flat versus last year at 111 days. 
Other investments in the quarter include $23 million in CapEx and $46 million used to repurchase shares of our stock. As of the end of the quarter, we had 1.9 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization. 
In summary, we are pleased with the solid operating performance in the first quarter, which delivered double-digit growth in both revenues and non-GAAP operating earnings. I will now turn it back over to Dow."

Starting at a high level, you saw the overall 9% constant currency growth in the quarter, 9% trailing 12 months. The America was 7% in the quarter, trailing constant currency growth is $6 million. EMEA was still on a constant currency basis, a double digit quarter, 11% in the quarter, 14% trailing 12 months. And if APAC was 9% in the quarter, 7% trailing 12 months. As it relates to China, I would say we are seeing an uptick in the incremental licenses being released. As you know, applications for the remaining category A licenses ended late December. Category B licenses continue to roll out. We -- as we said last quarter, we're really kind of starting to see that roll. I think still, though, the best way to think about this is in the past 5 years, our revenue CAGR has been 17%. If anything, we've seen that accelerate a little bit. So the market remains very good. 
We don't guide our China orders, as you know. But funnel looks good, and our win rate for public tenders remains high. I think maybe the other thing I'd add about China is the strength of our portfolio is very strong. We have 3 Proton orders in China we're executing on in Gary's business, Interventional Solutions. We also have a nice presence in China. 
As it relates to the virus, we're not seeing anything yet. The good news is our priority is to make sure we're doing everything to protect and support our employees and customers during this time. We haven't seen any impact in either of those situations at this point. 
I think from a business perspective, it's too early to call. We're continuing to monitor the impact on our factory and customers surrounding activity. Of course, we're trying to be a very responsible local citizen. We've made a pretty significant contribution to the local Red Cross, and like everybody watching it carefully. 
Maybe just one other thing I'd add on the kind of China momentum, the Halcyon product is doing very well in China. We have over 20 orders now. So that's flowing and seeing -- it's only kind of starting to see after all the regulatory weight, starting to see that uptick."

The tariff did have roughly around 70 basis points of impact to our gross margin. That was planned in our guidance based on the events and the exclusions that we got back in Q4. But the real story here on the gross margin expansion is the product and geo mix that's playing into that expansion. We about had 160 basis points of expansion at the company level, 100 of that was product and geo expansion. So think about the strong software and services growth rates that we had. 
Acquisitions, as we expected, improved the gross margin rate by around 45 bps. And then the unexpected thing that we had in the quarter, which we called out, was the unexpected costs in our Proton business. And that impacted around 60 basis points on a gross margin perspective. But on the operating margin, it impacted about 50 basis points. 
But what I'd like to say about that is, while it was unexpected in the quarter it was something that the team identified early in the quarter. We got our heads around it. It was isolated to a project and some very specific retrofit cost triggered a review of all the other projects that we have in process. And at the end of the day, after that deep dive, the $4 million cost, we believe, is well within our tolerance range on the year. And again, I just kind of go back to our top line and bottom line growth rates, we are set up in a very good position to achieve our full year commitments."

We had a very strong quarter in China, so we continue to like very much what we see. We're seeing strong equipment demand across the portfolio, frankly. I highlighted Halcyon, but we're also seeing very good traction on Edge, on TrueBeam and on VitalBeam. And believe that when Ethos comes to market, eventually, in that market, we'll also have a strong position there. So the portfolio is well set up. 
As it kind of relates to each contract and whether it was part of the quota or not, what I can tell you is the best way we track it is it was strong double-digit growth on a tough comp. We were also strong double-digit growth last year. And that's probably the best way to characterize it."

I think that as we're really thinking about it, clearly, the portfolio we've been designing to a value-based world for many years. So I think the portfolio was well set up for the transition. And with the CTSI acquisition, we are particularly excited about having a technology-enabled services play, as we believe customers will look to more outsourcing of all kinds of activities. And we'll be well set up for that growth. 
So we're seeing both in the quarter. As I mentioned a minute ago, our total Americas trailing 12 to 6, and on the quarter, it was 7. So we're not seeing it impact the order rate at this point in time, not seeing any acceleration of cancellations or anything else that would cause us to worry. And in fact, when you look at the way the backlog is flowing, the Americas revenue number, as we said in the script, was up 15% on the quarter. So we're seeing a nice flow in the geography."

As you know, it got out of the gate late in Q4, launch in basically September of Q4. Between Q4 and Q1, we've taken out 20 orders. Frankly, when we look at the ramp versus Halcyon, kind of right on. So that looks pretty good. The orders are a little lumpy, maybe a little bit of pent-up demand and waiting for regulatory approval last quarter. We do not have, as I said in the script, we do not have yet U.S. regulatory approval. We expect that 510(k) this quarter. So in the next 30 to 60 days, we should have it. Customer feedback remains outstanding. And frankly, one of the things that we really like is how it positions across our portfolio and gives us, again, something in the high end of the product mix from a pricing and margin rate point of view. 
So it's still early. We do expect 510(k) approval in this quarter. We do think that this shift to adaptive radiotherapy is on the order of the kind of shifts we saw with IMRT and IGRT. So we're -- at this point, I'd say we've seen nothing that discourages us from that, and we're bullish about Ethos."

They love the multimodality image integration of the product. I'd say right at the top of the list, they love the fact that our workflow is superior to everything else out there. As I mentioned in the script, we haven't seen anything yet, that we really can't envision in a 15-minute time slot, and that's kind of sacred to our customers and sacred to patients. It leverages all the Halcyon technology for ease of use. I think it's very well positioned for the APM environment that's coming, has an outstanding ROI with that kind of throughput. So I think it's going to win on that basis. We're seeing a lot of people engage with us on the product, a lot of enthusiasm. Clearly, we got to get through the 510(k) in the U.S. before we can market and sell it here. But we are, I think, early out of the gate here. We're very much perceived as the AI leader with our previous introductions with machine learning and RapidPlan, the other technologies that we have on the software side in the market. And now Ethos, I think, we're very much perceived as the AI leader in the market."

And frankly, in the long term, kind of combination of this agreement with the position that we have on CTSI for enabling customers to get in to radiation therapy with the services approach we have, we're very encouraged by what we see in India.

As you all know, Mike Bruff formally assumed the role of CFO for the company on December 1. And this will be his first earnings call in that capacity. And as announced in the first quarter, Anshul is now leading our Investor Relations function. 
With that, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I'll share the key milestones we achieved this past quarter and how they contributed to our long-term growth and value creation strategy. 
Our first quarter results reflect continued momentum, driven by our expanding and industry-leading product portfolio and innovation cycle. Now let me touch on our first quarter performance. Total company revenues of $829 million increased 12%. Oncology revenues grew 11% to $782 million. Proton revenues were $28 million, down 28% and other revenues were $19 million. 
Operating earnings of $135 million, or 16.2% of revenues, grew 13%. This includes planned investments to drive growth as well as project mix and updated project costs in our Proton Solutions business. 
GAAP earnings per share of $0.96 declined 14% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.16 grew 10%. Cash flows from operations were $113 million, down $28 million due to investment in working capital to support our growth. 
Now let me provide some additional color on the quarter. Our progress toward becoming the global leader in multidisciplinary cancer care solutions is powered by executing on our 4 strategic enablers for customers and their patients: First, innovating in radiation therapy; second, leveraging artificial intelligence, machine learning and cloud-based solutions; third, growing emerging businesses, geographies and technologies; and fourth, improving operational, financial and capital efficiency. 
First, let's review our progress on innovating in radiation therapy. We continue to extend our global market share leadership and expand our addressable market with our product innovation, comprehensive portfolio and services offerings. In the oncology business, orders grew 8% in the quarter and the trailing 12 months. Based on public filings, we continue to be the market share leader for both orders and revenues. 
We signed an agreement with Massachusetts General Hospital for 7 Varian radiotherapy systems. 5 will be -- 5 will replace non-Varian systems, one will replace an existing Varian system and one will be placed in a new vault. Installation is expected to begin in 2020. 
In December 2019, we received an order for 7 TrueBeam machines with 6 identified systems at the National Cancer Center in Singapore. Subsequent to quarter close, we were ordered an order for 1 Edge system and 2 VitalBeam systems at the National University Hospital Singapore. In Brazil, we received 8 orders for Halcyon in the quarter. And in China, we continue to see issuance of category B licenses as well as market share leadership in the country. 
Hardware revenues grew 2% for the quarter. Our worldwide net installed base of 8,561 units grew 363 units or 4%. This continued growth in our installed base drives future recurring revenue from upgrades, software and services. 
In Africa, we continue to expand access to quality cancer care with the installation of 3 Halcyon systems at the Centre National d'Oncologie in Mauritania, Centre Hospitalier Nganda in Congo, and the Lagos Teaching University Hospital in Nigeria. 
On the software front, revenues grew 13%, driven by continued adoption of our software solutions. We remain focused on investing innovation -- in innovation around efficient clinical workflow, systems integration and treatment planning quality to help close the current resource and skills gap around the globe. 
Orders for HyperArc, our high-definition radiotherapy solution for stereotactic radiosurgery brain metastases, grew double digits in the quarter. With less than 14% penetration, this continues to be a sizable opportunity across our TrueBeam installed base. 
Our services revenues grew 22% in the quarter, including the benefit from CTSI in a 14-week quarter. Excluding these benefits, services revenue grew 8%. CTSI, which is integrated into our Oncology Systems business, continues to perform in line with our expectations. We're investing in infrastructure for new technology-enabled services to drive mature market productivity and accelerate emerging market adoption. 
In our Proton Solutions business, we took 1 new order in the quarter. Our pipeline in the Proton business remains strong, and we continue to gain market -- global market share with customer interest driven by our smaller footprint ProBeam 360, and the preclinical research we are doing with the FlashForward consortium. As highlighted in our fourth quarter earnings call in October, we were selected by Penn Medicine to install an additional ProBeam 360 system in a single-room configuration at the Lancaster General Health Ann B. Barshinger Cancer Institute. The center is expected to treat its first patient in 2021. 
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we were selected by China Medical University Hospital in Taiwan to install a ProBeam 360 system in a single-room configuration with the ability to add a second gantry. The center will also use our Re Information Management System and Eclipse Treatment Planning System and is scheduled for completion in 2024. 
We have 78 Proton rooms under contract across 26 sites globally, 38 rooms are operational, including 1 room that was handed over to clinical operations this quarter. 
In November, the South Florida Proton Therapy Institute, or SFPTI on the campus of Delray Medical Center treated its first patient on our ProBeam compact single-room system. SFPTI is now treating more than 30 patients per day, making it the fastest ramp of patient treatments per gantry in the world. 
Turning our attention to FLASH, preclinical research and product development is progressing per plan, and we are encouraged by the results we continue to see from the FlashForward Consortium efforts. As our global ProBeam footprint continues to expand, the FlashForward Consortium now has representation from all geographies, enabling future research across different regional populations. 
Second, let's turn to our progress in leveraging artificial intelligence, machine learning and cloud solutions. Since the launch of the artificial intelligence powered Ethos Therapy System in September of 2019, reception and excitement for the platform has been extremely strong. During the quarter, we received 3 orders for Ethos. Two of the orders were from Australia, including a second order from the Icon Group and 1 order from Israel. Ethos is CE marked and 510(k) pending in the U.S. Treatments at our first clinical site in Herlev Hospital, Denmark, continued to progress well, while initial focus has been on bladder cancer, the team is preparing to start adaptive therapy for new disease sites in the pelvis. Additionally, our second center, Medische Spectrum Twente in the Netherlands went live in December, and our third and fourth installations are underway in Australia at the Icon Group center in Wahroonga and Royal North Shore Hospital, respectively. Install time has been about 2 weeks at the initial sites, and we expect the number of installs to increase in the second half. 
Our adaptive intelligence consortium efforts are on track for both clinical and technical publications throughout 2020. We expect to see significant publications on several disease sites. Early evaluation results show that full adaptive sessions are practical in a typical 15-minute treatment time slot. 
In Europe in 2019 we launched RapidPlan PT, our individualized machine learning, treatment planning software for Proton therapy and plan to expand the offering in other regions in the future. Consistent with RapidPlan for conventional radiotherapy, RapidPlan PT reduces the treatment planning time for Proton therapy from several hours to approximately 10 minutes without compromising the quality of the plan. This is extraordinary, particularly when you think about the skilled resources gap in proton therapy and creates significant clinical efficiency for our customers. 
Third, let's discuss emerging businesses, geographies and technologies. In November, we established a direct sales and service operation in the Republic of Kenya to better serve the growing cancer population in the country and the East Africa region. Africa continues to be a sizable opportunity for us given the minimal access to radiation therapy and the estimated 2.1 million new cancer cases diagnosed per year by 2040. Our installed base in Africa has increased approximately 30% over the last 2 fiscal years. 
We continue to execute and grow our Interventional Solutions business with revenues of $19 million, which are reported under the Other segment. We had solid performance in China and continue to invest in global distribution capacity and our software platform to support this global business. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Mike, who will discuss our fourth strategic enabler and provide more context on the first quarter financial results."

Company-wide revenue",711,"Thanks, Dow, and hello, everyone. Our fourth strategic enabler is improving financial, operational and capital efficiency by maintaining a balanced focus across growth, profitability and liquidity. 
So let me first start with growth. Company-wide revenues were $829 million, up 12% in dollars and 13% in constant currency. Organic revenues grew 8%. 
In Oncology Systems, revenues were $782 million, up 11% in dollars and 12% in constant currency, driven by strong growth in software and services. On a trailing 12-month basis, revenues grew 11% in dollars and 13% in constant currency. 
Orders were $774 million, up 8% in dollars and 9% in constant currency in both the quarter and the trailing 12 months. Geographic orders mix was 46% in the Americas, 31% in EMEA, and 23% in APAC. 
We ended the quarter with $3.1 billion in backlog, up 4%. Taking a closer look at our Oncology business results, in the Americas, revenues grew 15% in the geography and in our North America region. Orders were $360 million, up 7%. On a trailing 12-month basis, orders grew 6%, driven by continued market demand for our integrated, value-based care solutions. 
In our Europe, Middle East, India and Africa geography, revenues grew 11%. Orders were $237 million, up 8%. On a trailing 12-month basis, orders grew 11%. 
Asia Pacific revenues grew 5% and orders were $178 million, up 9%, led by double-digit growth in our China and our Southeast Asia, Korea region, partially offset by softness in Japan. On a trailing 12-month basis, orders grew 6% for the Asia Pacific geography. 
Our Proton Solutions business posted revenues of $28 million, a decline of 28%, primarily driven by project mix. Service revenues of $8 million grew 54%. During the quarter, we reduced our proton therapy backlog by $19 million to reflect an Indian customer's decision to cancel the order that we booked in the fourth quarter of 2017. No revenue had been recognized on this order. 
Turning to profitability. Total company gross margin was $369 million, up 16% and 44.5% of revenues, an increase of 160 basis points, driven by product mix, acquisitions and tariff exclusions. This was partially offset by proton business project mix and the $4 million of updated project cost. Oncology gross margin of 45.4% of revenues increased 100 basis points. 
Investing in R&D to drive innovation remains core to our long-term growth and value creation strategy. We invested $67 million in R&D, up 10%, which is 8.1% of revenue. SG&A expenses were $167 million, up 21%, which is 20.2% of revenue. Excluding the acquisitions of CTSI, Endocare, Alicon and the Boston Scientific bead portfolio, SG&A was up 13%. 
Company operating earnings were $135 million, up 13%, which is 16.2% of revenues, up 15 basis points driven by the gross margin expansion and planned investments to drive future growth. The $4 million updated project cost in the proton business impacted operating earnings in the quarter by 50 basis points. 
GAAP EPS was $0.96 and non-GAAP EPS was $1.16. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 21% and diluted share count was 91.7 million shares. This quarter, our GAAP operating earnings and GAAP EPS included an $8.8 million change in fair value of the contingent consideration related to our acquisitions of Endocare and Alicon. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 GAAP net earnings and GAAP EPS included a $22 million gain on the sale of our equity investment in Augmenix. 
Turning to the balance sheet and liquidity. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $722 million and $544 million in debt. Certain proceeds from borrowings in the quarter were used to fund U.S. operations in the short term. 
Cash flows from operations were $113 million, down 20% due to investment in working capital to support continued growth. Oncology DSO was flat versus last year at 111 days. 
Other investments in the quarter include $23 million in CapEx and $46 million used to repurchase shares of our stock. As of the end of the quarter, we had 1.9 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization. 
In summary, we are pleased with the solid operating performance in the first quarter, which delivered double-digit growth in both revenues and non-GAAP operating earnings. I will now turn it back over to Dow."

Starting at a high level, you saw the overall 9% constant currency growth on the quarter, 9% trailing 12 months. The America was 7% on the quarter, trailing constant currency growth is $6 million. EMEA was still on a constant currency basis, a double digit quarter, 11% in the quarter, 14% trailing 12 months. And if APAC was 9% in the quarter, 7% trailing 12 months. As it relates to China, I would say we are seeing an uptick in the incremental licenses being released. As you know, applications for the remaining category A licenses ended late December. Category B licenses continue to roll out. We -- as we said last quarter, we're really kind of starting to see that roll. I think still, though, the best way to think about this is in the past 5 years, our revenue CAGR has been 17%. If anything, we've seen that accelerate a little bit. So the market remains very good. 
We don't guide our China orders, as you know. But funnel looks good, and our win rate for public tenders remains high. I think maybe the other thing I'd add about China is the strength of our portfolio is very strong. We have 3 Proton orders in China we're executing on in Gary's business, Interventional Solutions. We also have a nice presence in China. 
As it relates to the virus, we're not seeing anything yet. The good news is our priority is to make sure we're doing everything to protect and support our employees and customers during this time. We haven't seen any impact in either of those situations at this point. 
I think from a business perspective, it's too early to call. We're continuing to monitor the impact on our factory and customers. Surrounding activity, of course, we're trying to be a very responsible local citizen. We've made a pretty significant contribution to the local Red Cross, and like everybody, watching it carefully. 
Maybe just one other thing I'd add on the kind of China momentum, the Halcyon product is doing very well in China. We have over 20 orders now. So that's flowing and seeing -- it's only kind of starting to see after all the regulatory weight, starting to see that uptick."

The tariff did have roughly around 70 basis points of impact to our gross margin. That was planned in our guidance, based on the events and the exclusions that we got back in Q4. But the real story here on the gross margin expansion is the product and geo mix that's playing into that expansion. We've about had -- 160 basis points of expansion at the company level, 100 of that was product and geo expansion. So think about the strong software and services growth rates that we had. 
Acquisitions, as we expected, improved the gross margin rate by around 45 bps. And then the unexpected thing that we had in the quarter which we called out, was the unexpected costs in our proton business. And that impacted around 60 basis points on gross margin perspective. But on the operating margin, it impacted about 50 basis points. 
But what I'd like to say about that is, while it was unexpected in the quarter it was something that the team identified early in the quarter. We got our heads around it. It was isolated to a project and some very specific retrofit cost, it triggered a review of all the other projects that we have in process. And at the end of the day, after that deep dive, the $4 million cost we believe, is well within our tolerance range on the year. And again, I just kind of go back to our top line and bottom line growth rates, we are set up in a very good position to achieve our full year commitment."

We had a very strong quarter in China, so we continue to like very much what we see. We're seeing strong equipment demand across the portfolio, frankly. I highlighted Halcyon, but we're also seeing very good traction on Edge, on TrueBeam and on VitalBeam. And believe that when Ethos comes to market, eventually, in that market, we'll also have a strong position there. So the portfolio's well set up. 
As it kind of relates to each contract and whether it was part of the quota or not, what I can tell you is the best way we track it is it was strong double-digit growth on a tough comp. We were also strong double-digit growth last year. And that's probably the best way to characterize it."

And it's not going to be delayed to 2022 as some time is out there. 
I think that as we're really thinking about it, clearly, the portfolio we've been designing to a value-based world for many years. So I think the portfolio was well set up for the transition. And with the CTSI acquisition, we are particularly excited about having a technology-enabled services play, as we believe customers will look to more outsourcing of all kinds of activities. And we'll be well set up for that growth. 
So we're seeing both in the quarter. As I mentioned a minute ago, our total Americas, trailing 12 to 6, and on the quarter, it was 7. So we're not seeing it impact the order rate at this point in time, not seeing any acceleration of cancellations or anything else that would cause us to worry. And in fact, when you look at the way the backlog's flowing, the Americas revenue number, as we said in the script, was up 15% on the quarter. So we're seeing a nice flow in the geography."

Customer feedback remains outstanding.

As you all know, Mike Bruff formally assumed the role of CFO for the company on December 1, and this will be his first earnings call in that capacity. And as announced in the first quarter, Anshul is now leading our Investor Relations function. 
With that, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I'll share the key milestones we achieved this past quarter and how they contributed to our long-term growth and value creation strategy.
Our first quarter results reflect continued momentum, driven by our expanding and industry-leading product portfolio and innovation cycle. Now let me touch on our first quarter performance. Total company revenues of $829 million increased 12%. Oncology revenues grew 11% to $782 million. Proton revenues were $28 million, down 28% and other revenues were $19 million. 
Operating earnings of $135 million, or 16.2% of revenues, grew 13%. This includes planned investments to drive growth as well as project mix and updated project costs in our Proton Solutions business. 
GAAP earnings per share of $0.96 declined 14% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.16 grew 10%. Cash flows from operations were $113 million, down $28 million due to investment in working capital to support our growth. 
Now let me provide some additional color on the quarter. Our progress toward becoming the global leader in multidisciplinary cancer care solutions is powered by executing on our 4 strategic enablers for customers and their patients. First, innovating in radiation therapy; second, leveraging artificial intelligence, machine learning and cloud-based solutions; third, growing emerging businesses, geographies and technologies; and fourth, improving operational, financial and capital efficiency.
First, let's review our progress on innovating in radiation therapy. We continue to extend our global market share leadership and expand our addressable market with our product innovation, comprehensive portfolio and services offerings. In the oncology business, orders grew 8% in the quarter and the trailing 12 months. Based on public filings, we continue to be the market share leader for both orders and revenues.
We signed an agreement with Massachusetts General Hospital for 7 Varian radiotherapy systems. 5 will be -- 5 will replace non-Varian systems, one will replace an existing Varian system and one will be placed in a new vault. Installation is expected to begin in 2020. 
In December 2019, we received an order for 7 TrueBeam machines with 6 IDENTIFY systems at the National Cancer Center in Singapore. Subsequent to quarter close, we were ordered an order for 1 Edge system and 2 VitalBeam systems at the National University Hospital Singapore. In Brazil, we received 8 orders for Halcyon in the quarter. And in China, we continue to see issuance of category B licenses as well as market share leadership in the country. 
Hardware revenues grew 2% for the quarter. Our worldwide net installed base of 8,561 units grew 363 units or 4%. This continued growth in our installed base drives future recurring revenue from upgrades, software and services.
In Africa, we continue to expand access to quality cancer care with the installation of 3 Halcyon systems at the Centre National d'Oncologie in Mauritania, Centre Hospitalier Nganda in Congo, and the Lagos Teaching University Hospital in Nigeria. 
On the software front, revenues grew 13%, driven by continued adoption of our software solutions. We remain focused on investing innovation -- in innovation around efficient clinical workflow, systems integration and treatment planning quality to help close the current resource and skills gap around the globe.
Orders for HyperArc, our high-definition radiotherapy solution for stereotactic radiosurgery brain metastases, grew double digits in the quarter. With less than 14% penetration, this continues to be a sizable opportunity across our TrueBeam installed base. 
Our services revenues grew 22% in the quarter, including the benefit from CTSI in a 14-week quarter. Excluding these benefits, services revenue grew 8%. CTSI, which is integrated into our Oncology Systems business, continues to perform in line with our expectations. We're investing in infrastructure for new technology-enabled services to drive mature market productivity and accelerate emerging market adoption.
In our Proton Solutions business, we took 1 new order in the quarter. Our pipeline in the Proton business remains strong, and we continue to gain market -- global market share with customer interest driven by our smaller footprint ProBeam 360, and the preclinical research we are doing with the FlashForward consortium. As highlighted in our fourth quarter earnings call in October, we were selected by Penn Medicine to install an additional ProBeam 360 system in a single-room configuration at the Lancaster General Health Ann B. Barshinger Cancer Institute. The center is expected to treat its first patient in 2021.
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we were selected by China Medical University Hospital in Taiwan to install a ProBeam 360 system in a single-room configuration with the ability to add a second gantry. The center will also use our Re Information Management System and Eclipse Treatment Planning System and is scheduled for completion in 2024. 
We have 78 Proton rooms under contract across 26 sites globally, 38 rooms are operational, including 1 room that was handed over to clinical operations this quarter.
In November, the South Florida Proton Therapy Institute or SFPTI on the campus of Delray Medical Center treated its first patient on our ProBeam compact single-room system. SFPTI is now treating more than 30 patients per day, making it the fastest ramp of patient treatments per gantry in the world.
Turning our attention to FLASH. Preclinical research and product development is progressing per plan, and we are encouraged by the results we continue to see from the FlashForward Consortium efforts. As our global ProBeam footprint continues to expand, the FlashForward Consortium now has representation from all geographies, enabling future research across different regional populations. 
Second, let's turn to our progress in leveraging artificial intelligence, machine learning and cloud solutions. Since the launch of the artificial intelligence powered Ethos Therapy System in September of 2019, reception and excitement for the platform has been extremely strong. During the quarter, we received 3 orders for Ethos. Two of the orders were from Australia, including a second order from the Icon Group and 1 order from Israel. Ethos is CE marked and 510(k) pending in the U.S. Treatments at our first clinical site in Herlev Hospital, Denmark, continued to progress well. While initial focus has been on bladder cancer, the team is preparing to start adaptive therapy for new disease sites in the pelvis. Additionally, our second center, Medische Spectrum Twente in the Netherlands went live in December, and our third and fourth installations are underway in Australia at the Icon Group center in Wahroonga and Royal North Shore Hospital, respectively. Install time has been about 2 weeks at the initial sites, and we expect the number of installs to increase in the second half. 
Our adaptive intelligence consortium efforts are on track for both clinical and technical publications throughout 2020. We expect to see significant publications on several disease sites. Early evaluation results show that full adaptive sessions are practical in a typical 15-minute treatment time slot.
In Europe in 2019 we launched RapidPlan PT, our individualized machine learning, treatment planning software for Proton therapy and plan to expand the offering in other regions in the future. Consistent with RapidPlan for conventional radiotherapy, RapidPlan PT reduces the treatment planning time for Proton therapy from several hours to approximately 10 minutes without compromising the quality of the plan. This is extraordinary, particularly when you think about the skilled resources gap in proton therapy and creates significant clinical efficiency for our customers.
Third, let's discuss emerging businesses, geographies and technologies. In November, we established a direct sales and service operation in the Republic of Kenya to better serve the growing cancer population in the country and the East Africa region. Africa continues to be a sizable opportunity for us given the minimal access to radiation therapy and the estimated 2.1 million new cancer cases diagnosed per year by 2040. Our installed base in Africa has increased approximately 30% over the last 2 fiscal years. 
We continue to execute and grow our Interventional Solutions business with revenues of $19 million, which are reported under the Other segment. We had solid performance in China and continue to invest in global distribution capacity and our software platform to support this global business.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mike, who will discuss our fourth strategic enabler and provide more context on the first quarter financial results."

Company-wide revenue",711,"Thanks, Dow, and hello, everyone. Our fourth strategic enabler is improving financial, operational and capital efficiency by maintaining a balanced focus across growth, profitability and liquidity. 
So let me first start with growth. Company-wide revenues were $829 million, up 12% in dollars and 13% in constant currency. Organic revenues grew 8%. 
In Oncology Systems, revenues were $782 million, up 11% in dollars and 12% in constant currency, driven by strong growth in software and services. On a trailing 12-month basis, revenues grew 11% in dollars and 13% in constant currency. 
Orders were $774 million, up 8% in dollars and 9% in constant currency in both the quarter and the trailing 12 months. Geographic orders mix was 46% in the Americas, 31% in EMEA, and 23% in APAC. 
We ended the quarter with $3.1 billion in backlog, up 4%. Taking a closer look at our Oncology business results, in the Americas, revenues grew 15% in the geography and in our North America region. Orders were $360 million, up 7%. On a trailing 12-month basis, orders grew 6%, driven by continued market demand for our integrated, value-based care solutions.
In our Europe, Middle East, India and Africa geography, revenues grew 11%. Orders were $237 million, up 8%. On a trailing 12-month basis, orders grew 11%. 
Asia Pacific revenues grew 5% and orders were $178 million, up 9%, led by double-digit growth in our China and our Southeast Asia, Korea region, partially offset by softness in Japan. On a trailing 12-month basis, orders grew 6% for the Asia Pacific geography.
Our Proton Solutions business posted revenues of $28 million, a decline of 28%, primarily driven by project mix. Service revenues of $8 million grew 54%. During the quarter, we reduced our proton therapy backlog by $19 million to reflect an Indian customer's decision to cancel the order that we booked in the fourth quarter of 2017. No revenue had been recognized on this order. 
Turning to profitability. Total company gross margin was $369 million, up 16% and 44.5% of revenues, an increase of 160 basis points, driven by product mix, acquisitions and tariff exclusions. This was partially offset by Proton business project mix and the $4 million of updated project cost. Oncology gross margin of 45.4% of revenues increased 100 basis points. 
Investing in R&D to drive innovation remains core to our long-term growth and value creation strategy. We invested $67 million in R&D, up 10%, which is 8.1% of revenue. SG&A expenses were $167 million, up 21%, which is 20.2% of revenue. Excluding the acquisitions of CTSI, Endocare, Alicon and the Boston Scientific bead portfolio, SG&A was up 13%. 
Company operating earnings were $135 million, up 13%, which is 16.2% of revenues, up 15 basis points driven by the gross margin expansion and planned investments to drive future growth. The $4 million updated project cost in the proton business impacted operating earnings in the quarter by 50 basis points. 
GAAP EPS was $0.96 and non-GAAP EPS was $1.16. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 21% and diluted share count was 91.7 million shares. This quarter, our GAAP operating earnings and GAAP EPS included an $8.8 million change in fair value of the contingent consideration related to our acquisitions of Endocare and Alicon. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 GAAP net earnings and GAAP EPS included a $22 million gain on the sale of our equity investment in Augmenix.
Turning to the balance sheet and liquidity. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $722 million and $544 million in debt. Certain proceeds from borrowings in the quarter were used to fund U.S. Operations in the short term. 
Cash flows from operations were $113 million, down 20% due to investment in working capital to support continued growth. Oncology DSO was flat versus last year at 111 days. 
Other investments in the quarter include $23 million in CapEx and $46 million used to repurchase shares of our stock. As of the end of the quarter, we had 1.9 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization. 
In summary, we are pleased with the solid operating performance in the first quarter, which delivered double-digit growth in both revenues and non-GAAP operating earnings. I will now turn it back over to Dow."

Starting at a high level, you saw the overall 9% constant currency growth on the quarter, 9% trailing 12 months. The America was 7% on the quarter, trailing constant currency growth is 6%. EMEA was still on a constant currency basis, a double digit quarter, 11% in the quarter, 14% trailing 12 months. And if APAC was 9% in the quarter, 7% trailing 12 months. As it relates to China, I would say we are seeing an uptick in the incremental licenses being released. As you know, applications for the remaining category A licenses ended late December. Category B licenses continue to roll out. We -- as we said last quarter, we're really kind of starting to see that roll. I think still, though, the best way to think about this is, in the past 5 years, our revenue CAGR has been 17%. If anything, we've seen that accelerate a little bit. So the market remains very good.
We don't guide our China orders, as you know. But funnel looks good, and our win rate for public tenders remains high. I think maybe the other thing I'd add about China is the strength of our portfolio is very strong. We have 3 Proton orders in China we're executing on in Gary's business, Interventional Solutions. We also have a nice presence in China. 
As it relates to the virus, we're not seeing anything yet. The good news is our priority is to make sure we're doing everything to protect and support our employees and customers during this time. We haven't seen any impact in either of those situations at this point. 
I think from a business perspective, it's too early to call. We're continuing to monitor the impact on our factory and customers' surrounding activity, of course. We're trying to be a very responsible local citizen. We've made a pretty significant contribution to the local Red Cross, and like everybody, watching it carefully. 
Maybe just one other thing I'd add on the kind of China momentum, the Halcyon product is doing very well in China. We have over 20 orders now. So that's flowing and seeing -- it's only kind of starting to see -- after all the regulatory wait, starting to see that uptick."

The tariff did have roughly around 70 basis points of impact to our gross margin. That was planned in our guidance, based on the events and the exclusions that we got back in Q4. But the real story here on the gross margin expansion is the product and geo mix that's playing into that expansion. We've about had -- the 160 basis points of expansion at the company level, 100 of that was product and geo expansion. So think about the strong software and services growth rates that we had. 
Acquisitions, as we expected, improved the gross margin rate by around 45 bps. And then the unexpected thing that we had in the quarter, which we called out, was the unexpected costs in our Proton business. And that impacted around 60 basis points on gross margin perspective. But on the operating margin, it impacted about 50 basis points. 
But what I'd like to say about that is, while it was unexpected in the quarter, it was something that the team identified early in the quarter. We got our heads around it. It was isolated to a project and some very specific retrofit cost. It triggered a review of all the other projects that we have in process. And at the end of the day, after that deep dive, the $4 million cost we believe, is well within our tolerance range on the year. And again, I just kind of go back to our top line and bottom line growth rates, we are set up in a very good position to achieve our full year commitment."

We had a very strong quarter in China, so we continue to like very much what we see. We're seeing strong equipment demand across the portfolio, frankly. I highlighted Halcyon, but we're also seeing very good traction on Edge, on TrueBeam and on VitalBeam. And believe that when Ethos comes to market, eventually, in that market, we'll also have a strong position there. So the portfolio's well set up. 
As it kind of relates to each contract and whether it was part of the quota or not, what I can tell you is the best way we track it is it was strong double-digit growth on a tough comp. We were also strong double-digit growth last year, and that's probably the best way to characterize it."

I think that as we're really thinking about it, clearly, the portfolio we've been designing to a value-based world for many years. So I think the portfolio was well set up for the transition. And with the CTSI acquisition, we are particularly excited about having a technology-enabled services play, as we believe customers will look to more outsourcing of all kinds of activities. And we'll be well set up for that growth. 
So we're seeing both in the quarter. As I mentioned a minute ago, our total Americas, trailing 12 is 6% and on the quarter, it was 7%.

As you know, it got out of the gate late in Q4, launch in basically September of Q4. Between Q4 and Q1, we've taken out 20 orders. Frankly, when we look at the ramp versus Halcyon, kind of right on. So that's -- that looks pretty good. The orders are a little lumpy, maybe a little bit of pent-up demand and waiting for regulatory approval last quarter. We do not have, as I said in the script, we do not have yet U.S. regulatory approval. We expect that 510(k) this quarter. So the next 30 to 60 days, we should have it. Customer feedback remains outstanding. And frankly, one of the things that we really like is how it positions across our portfolio and gives us, again, something in the high end of the product mix from a pricing and margin rate point of view. 
So it's still early. We do expect 510(k) approval in this quarter. We do think that this shift to adaptive radiotherapy is on the order of the kind of shifts we saw with IMRT and IGRT. So we're -- at this point, I'd say we've seen nothing that discourages us from that, and we're bullish about Ethos."

They love the multimodality image integration of the product. I'd say right at the top of the list, they love the fact that our workflow is superior to everything else out there. As I mentioned in the script, we haven't seen anything yet that we really can't envision in a 15-minute time slot, and that's kind of sacred to our customers and sacred to patients. It leverages all the Halcyon technology for ease of use. I think it's very well positioned for the APM environment that's coming, has an outstanding ROI with that kind of throughput. So I think it's going to win on that basis. We're seeing a lot of people engage with us on the product, a lot of enthusiasm. Clearly, we got to get through the 510(k) in the U.S. before we can market and sell it here. But we are, I think, early out of the gate here. We're very much perceived as the AI leader with our previous introductions with machine learning, in RapidPlan, the other technologies that we have on the software side in the market. And now Ethos, I think, we're very much perceived as the AI leader in the market."

As you all know, Mike Bruff formally assumed the role of CFO for the company on December 1, and this will be his first earnings call in that capacity. And as announced in the first quarter, Anshul is now leading our Investor Relations function. 
With that, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I'll share the key milestones we achieved this past quarter and how they contributed to our long-term growth and value creation strategy.
Our first quarter results reflect continued momentum driven by our expanding and industry-leading product portfolio and innovation cycle. Now let me touch on our first quarter performance. Total company revenues of $829 million increased 12%. Oncology revenues grew 11% to $782 million. Proton revenues were $28 million, down 28% and other revenues were $19 million. 
Operating earnings of $135 million, or 16.2% of revenues, grew 13%. This includes planned investments to drive growth as well as project mix and updated project costs in our Proton Solutions business. 
GAAP earnings per share of $0.96 declined 14% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.16 grew 10%. Cash flows from operations were $113 million, down $28 million due to investment in working capital to support our growth. 
Now let me provide some additional color on the quarter. Our progress toward becoming the global leader in multidisciplinary cancer care solutions is powered by executing on our 4 strategic enablers for customers and their patients. First, innovating in radiation therapy; second, leveraging artificial intelligence, machine learning and cloud-based solutions; third, growing emerging businesses, geographies and technologies; and fourth, improving operational, financial and capital efficiency.
First, let's review our progress on innovating in radiation therapy. We continue to extend our global market share leadership and expand our addressable market with our product innovation, comprehensive portfolio and services offerings. In the oncology business, orders grew 8% in the quarter and the trailing 12 months. Based on public filings, we continue to be the market share leader for both orders and revenues.
We signed an agreement with Massachusetts General Hospital for 7 Varian radiotherapy systems. 5 will be -- 5 will replace non-Varian systems, one will replace an existing Varian system and one will be placed in a new vault. Installation is expected to begin in 2020. 
In December 2019, we received an order for 7 TrueBeam machines with 6 IDENTIFY systems at the National Cancer Center in Singapore. Subsequent to quarter close, we were ordered an order for 1 Edge system and 2 VitalBeam systems at the National University Hospital Singapore. In Brazil, we received 8 orders for Halcyon in the quarter. And in China, we continue to see issuance of category B licenses as well as market share leadership in the country. 
Hardware revenues grew 2% for the quarter. Our worldwide net installed base of 8,561 units grew 363 units or 4%. This continued growth in our installed base drives future recurring revenue from upgrades, software and services.
In Africa, we continue to expand access to quality cancer care with the installation of 3 Halcyon systems at the Centre National d'Oncologie in Mauritania, Centre Hospitalier Nganda in Congo, and the Lagos Teaching University Hospital in Nigeria. 
On the software front, revenues grew 13% driven by continued adoption of our software solutions. We remain focused on investing innovation -- in innovation around efficient clinical workflow, systems integration and treatment planning quality to help close the current resource and skills gap around the globe.
Orders for HyperArc, our high-definition radiotherapy solution for stereotactic radiosurgery brain metastases, grew double digits in the quarter. With less than 14% penetration, this continues to be a sizable opportunity across our TrueBeam installed base. 
Our services revenues grew 22% in the quarter, including the benefit from CTSI in a 14-week quarter. Excluding these benefits, services revenue grew 8%. CTSI, which is integrated into our Oncology Systems business, continues to perform in line with our expectations. We're investing in infrastructure for new technology-enabled services to drive mature market productivity and accelerate emerging market adoption.
In our Proton Solutions business, we took 1 new order in the quarter. Our pipeline in the Proton business remains strong, and we continue to gain market -- global market share with customer interest driven by our smaller footprint ProBeam 360, and the preclinical research we are doing with the FlashForward consortium. As highlighted in our fourth quarter earnings call in October, we were selected by Penn Medicine to install an additional ProBeam 360 system in a single-room configuration at the Lancaster General Health Ann B. Barshinger Cancer Institute. The center is expected to treat its first patient in 2021.
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we were selected by China Medical University Hospital in Taiwan to install a ProBeam 360 system in a single-room configuration with the ability to add a second gantry. The center will also use our Re Information Management System and Eclipse Treatment Planning System and is scheduled for completion in 2024. 
We have 78 Proton rooms under contract across 26 sites globally, 38 rooms are operational, including 1 room that was handed over to clinical operations this quarter.
In November, the South Florida Proton Therapy Institute or SFPTI on the campus of Delray Medical Center treated its first patient on our ProBeam compact single-room system. SFPTI is now treating more than 30 patients per day, making it the fastest ramp of patient treatments per gantry in the world.
Turning our attention to FLASH. Preclinical research and product development is progressing per plan, and we are encouraged by the results we continue to see from the FlashForward Consortium efforts. As our global ProBeam footprint continues to expand, the FlashForward Consortium now has representation from all geographies, enabling future research across different regional populations. 
Second, let's turn to our progress in leveraging artificial intelligence, machine learning and cloud solutions. Since the launch of the artificial intelligence powered Ethos Therapy System in September of 2019, reception and excitement for the platform has been extremely strong. During the quarter, we received 3 orders for Ethos. Two of the orders were from Australia, including a second order from the Icon Group and 1 order from Israel. Ethos is CE marked and 510(k) pending in the U.S. Treatments at our first clinical site in Herlev Hospital, Denmark, continued to progress well. While initial focus has been on bladder cancer, the team is preparing to start adaptive therapy for new disease sites in the pelvis. Additionally, our second center, Medische Spectrum Twente in the Netherlands went live in December, and our third and fourth installations are underway in Australia at the Icon Group center in Wahroonga and Royal North Shore Hospital, respectively. Install time has been about 2 weeks at the initial sites, and we expect the number of installs to increase in the second half. 
Our adaptive intelligence consortium efforts are on track for both clinical and technical publications throughout 2020. We expect to see significant publications on several disease sites. Early evaluation results show that full adaptive sessions are practical in a typical 15-minute treatment time slot.
In Europe in 2019 we launched RapidPlan PT, our individualized machine learning, treatment planning software for Proton therapy and plan to expand the offering in other regions in the future. Consistent with RapidPlan for conventional radiotherapy, RapidPlan PT reduces the treatment planning time for Proton therapy from several hours to approximately 10 minutes without compromising the quality of the plan. This is extraordinary, particularly when you think about the skilled resources gap in proton therapy and creates significant clinical efficiency for our customers.
Third, let's discuss emerging businesses, geographies and technologies. In November, we established a direct sales and service operation in the Republic of Kenya to better serve the growing cancer population in the country and the East Africa region. Africa continues to be a sizable opportunity for us given the minimal access to radiation therapy and the estimated 2.1 million new cancer cases diagnosed per year by 2040. Our installed base in Africa has increased approximately 30% over the last 2 fiscal years. 
We continue to execute and grow our Interventional Solutions business with revenues of $19 million, which are reported under the Other segment. We had solid performance in China and continue to invest in global distribution capacity and our software platform to support this global business.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mike, who will discuss our fourth strategic enabler and provide more context on the first quarter financial results."

Company-wide revenue",711,"Thanks, Dow, and hello, everyone. Our fourth strategic enabler is improving financial, operational and capital efficiency by maintaining a balanced focus across growth, profitability and liquidity. 
So let me first start with growth. Company-wide revenues were $829 million, up 12% in dollars and 13% in constant currency. Organic revenues grew 8%. 
In Oncology Systems, revenues were $782 million, up 11% in dollars and 12% in constant currency, driven by strong growth in software and services. On a trailing 12-month basis, revenues grew 11% in dollars and 13% in constant currency. 
Orders were $774 million, up 8% in dollars and 9% in constant currency in both the quarter and the trailing 12 months. Geographic orders mix was 46% in the Americas, 31% in EMEA, and 23% in APAC. 
We ended the quarter with $3.1 billion in backlog, up 4%. Taking a closer look at our Oncology business results, in the Americas, revenues grew 15% in the geography and in our North America region. Orders were $360 million, up 7%. On a trailing 12-month basis, orders grew 6%, driven by continued market demand for our integrated, value-based care solutions.
In our Europe, Middle East, India and Africa geography, revenues grew 11%. Orders were $237 million, up 8%. On a trailing 12-month basis, orders grew 11%. 
Asia Pacific revenues grew 5% and orders were $178 million, up 9%, led by double-digit growth in our China and our Southeast Asia, Korea region, partially offset by softness in Japan. On a trailing 12-month basis, orders grew 6% for the Asia Pacific geography.
Our Proton Solutions business posted revenues of $28 million, a decline of 28%, primarily driven by project mix. Service revenues of $8 million grew 54%. During the quarter, we reduced our proton therapy backlog by $19 million to reflect an Indian customer's decision to cancel the order that we booked in the fourth quarter of 2017. No revenue had been recognized on this order. 
Turning to profitability. Total company gross margin was $369 million, up 16% and 44.5% of revenues, an increase of 160 basis points, driven by product mix, acquisitions and tariff exclusions. This was partially offset by Proton business project mix and the $4 million of updated project cost. Oncology gross margin of 45.4% of revenues increased 100 basis points. 
Investing in R&D to drive innovation remains core to our long-term growth and value creation strategy. We invested $67 million in R&D, up 10%, which is 8.1% of revenue. SG&A expenses were $167 million, up 21%, which is 20.2% of revenue. Excluding the acquisitions of CTSI, Endocare, Alicon and the Boston Scientific bead portfolio, SG&A was up 13%. 
Company operating earnings were $135 million, up 13%, which is 16.2% of revenues, up 15 basis points driven by the gross margin expansion and planned investments to drive future growth. The $4 million updated project cost in the proton business impacted operating earnings in the quarter by 50 basis points. 
GAAP EPS was $0.96 and non-GAAP EPS was $1.16. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 21% and diluted share count was 91.7 million shares. This quarter, our GAAP operating earnings and GAAP EPS included an $8.8 million change in fair value of the contingent consideration related to our acquisitions of Endocare and Alicon. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 GAAP net earnings and GAAP EPS included a $22 million gain on the sale of our equity investment in Augmenix.
Turning to the balance sheet and liquidity. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $722 million and $544 million in debt. Certain proceeds from borrowings in the quarter were used to fund U.S. operations in the short term. 
Cash flows from operations were $113 million, down 20% due to investment in working capital to support continued growth. Oncology DSO was flat versus last year at 111 days. 
Other investments in the quarter include $23 million in CapEx and $46 million used to repurchase shares of our stock. As of the end of the quarter, we had 1.9 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization. 
In summary, we are pleased with the solid operating performance in the first quarter, which delivered double-digit growth in both revenues and non-GAAP operating earnings. I will now turn it back over to Dow."

Starting at a high level, you saw the overall 9% constant currency growth on the quarter, 9% trailing 12 months. The America was 7% on the quarter, trailing constant currency growth is 6%. EMEA was still on a constant currency basis, a double digit quarter, 11% in the quarter, 14% trailing 12 months. And if APAC was 9% in the quarter, 7% trailing 12 months. As it relates to China, I would say we are seeing an uptick in the incremental licenses being released. As you know, applications for the remaining category A licenses ended late December. Category B licenses continue to roll out. We -- as we said last quarter, we're really kind of starting to see that roll. I think still, though, the best way to think about this is, in the past 5 years, our revenue CAGR has been 17%. If anything, we've seen that accelerate a little bit. So the market remains very good.
We don't guide our China orders, as you know. But funnel looks good, and our win rate for public tenders remains high. I think maybe the other thing I'd add about China is the strength of our portfolio is very strong. We have 3 Proton orders in China we're executing on in Gary's business, Interventional Solutions. We also have a nice presence in China. 
As it relates to the virus, we're not seeing anything yet. The good news is our priority is to make sure we're doing everything to protect and support our employees and customers during this time. We haven't seen any impact in either of those situations at this point. 
I think from a business perspective, it's too early to call. We're continuing to monitor the impact on our factory and customers' surrounding activity, of course. We're trying to be a very responsible local citizen. We've made a pretty significant contribution to the local Red Cross, and like everybody, watching it carefully. 
Maybe just one other thing I'd add on the kind of China momentum, the Halcyon product is doing very well in China. We have over 20 orders now. So that's flowing and seeing -- it's only kind of starting to see -- after all the regulatory wait, starting to see that uptick."

The tariff did have roughly around 70 basis points of impact to our gross margin. That was planned in our guidance, based on the events and the exclusions that we got back in Q4. But the real story here on the gross margin expansion is the product and geo mix that's playing into that expansion. We've about had -- the 160 basis points of expansion at the company level, 100 of that was product and geo expansion. So think about the strong software and services growth rates that we had. 
Acquisitions, as we expected, improved the gross margin rate by around 45 bps. And then the unexpected thing that we had in the quarter, which we called out, was the unexpected costs in our Proton business. And that impacted around 60 basis points on gross margin perspective. But on the operating margin, it impacted about 50 basis points. 
But what I'd like to say about that is, while it was unexpected in the quarter, it was something that the team identified early in the quarter. We got our heads around it. It was isolated to a project and some very specific retrofit cost. It triggered a review of all the other projects that we have in process. And at the end of the day, after that deep dive, the $4 million cost we believe, is well within our tolerance range on the year. And again, I just kind of go back to our top line and bottom line growth rates, we are set up in a very good position to achieve our full year commitment."

We had a very strong quarter in China, so we continue to like very much what we see. We're seeing strong equipment demand across the portfolio, frankly. I highlighted Halcyon, but we're also seeing very good traction on Edge, on TrueBeam and on VitalBeam. And believe that when Ethos comes to market, eventually, in that market, we'll also have a strong position there. So the portfolio's well set up. 
As it kind of relates to each contract and whether it was part of the quota or not, what I can tell you is the best way we track it is it was strong double-digit growth on a tough comp. We were also strong double-digit growth last year, and that's probably the best way to characterize it."

And it's not going to be delayed to 2022 as some time is out there. 
I think that as we're really thinking about it, clearly, the portfolio we've been designing to a value-based world for many years. So I think the portfolio was well set up for the transition. And with the CTSI acquisition, we are particularly excited about having a technology-enabled services play, as we believe customers will look to more outsourcing of all kinds of activities. And we'll be well set up for that growth. 
So we're seeing both in the quarter. As I mentioned a minute ago, our total Americas, trailing 12 is 6% and on the quarter, it was 7%. So we're not seeing it impact the order rate at this point in time, not seeing any acceleration of cancellations or anything else that would cause us to worry. And in fact, then when you look at the way the backlog's flowing, the Americas revenue number, as we said in the script, was up 15% on the quarter. So we're seeing a nice flow in the geography."

Customer feedback remains outstanding.

Before we get into the details for the quarter, I want to express our gratitude to everyone on the front line fighting this global pandemic and hope everyone is staying safe and feeling well from our 10,000-plus employees all over the world, we say thank you. Furthermore, I want to thank our valuable employees, customers, suppliers and distributors for their hard work, support and partnership during this extraordinary period. Your efforts have ensured that cancer patients, globally, continue to receive vital treatment. 
Our fiscal second quarter performance reflects the escalation of COVID-19 and our global response. On this call, we will share our experience in the quarter, our framework for engaging those who rely on us and our priorities and actions in these challenging times. 
The pandemic has created some unique operational challenges around delivery of our products and solutions as well as open new opportunities. The impact in the quarter, which was driven by timing delays around installation and acceptance of our products, has varied by region based on the stage of containment and government actions. China and South Korea seem to be ahead of other countries in controlling the pandemic and progressing towards normalcy. Conversely, the rest of APAC, Americas and EMEA geographies continue to take actions to stem the outbreak. While we're cautiously encouraged by the recovery in China, we remain sensitive to future uncertainties, including continued spread or recurrence of the pandemic, which could slow progress towards recovery. 
Our focus now, as it's always been, is keeping our employees safe, supporting our customers and their patients, ensuring supply chain stability and maintaining business continuity. Our employees are crucial to our mission and as we saw this outbreak shift into a pandemic, we took several actions to ensure their safety and well-being. We instituted work from home policies and workplace safety measures and protocols. To support our workforce, we implemented additional employee benefits in March that will continue as needed through fiscal 2020. 
We also implemented new programs aimed at educating our employees on how to operate in this new virtual, physical distancing environment. We recognize the challenge for health care resources to manage COVID-19 and non-COVID-19-related care. Since radiation oncology is not considered an elective for seizure, our teams are taking actions on a customer-by-customer basis to ensure they can deliver therapy to patients. 
Furthermore, during this pandemic, we have seen, in some clinics across the globe, a shift from surgical intervention to radiation oncology, further underscoring its importance. We are actively deploying remote tools across our training, installation and field service teams to ensure continued access to our products and solutions. 
We have secured and stabilized our global supply chain with ongoing efforts in place to continue to monitor and mitigate any new risks that emerge. After being closed for a limited period in the quarter, our essential manufacturing facilities in Beijing and Palo Alto are now fully operational. We continue to ship our products and on our customer commitments during the factory shutdown. 
Finally, we're taking steps to bolster our already strong financial position. In view of the possible continued impact of COVID-19, we're taking prudent actions to manage costs, while continuing to make planned investments that will allow us to execute our growth plan. 
Mike will to discuss these later. 
I believe our long-term fundamentals remain strong, and our business is well positioned financially and organizationally to weather this environment as well as extend our global leadership in oncology. With that, Mike will discuss our financial performance and liquidity and in more details."

Total company revenues were $794 million, up 2% in dollars and 3% in constant currency. Organic revenues declined 1%. Looking at oncology systems, orders were $773 million, up 1% in dollars and 2% in constant currency, and over the trailing 12 months, 5% in dollars and 6% in constant currency. 
We ended the quarter with a robust backlog of $3 billion, up 3%. To date, we have not seen any COVID-19 related order cancellations. 
Revenues were $761 million, up 2% in dollars and 3% in constant currency, driven by strong growth in software and services. On a trailing 12-month basis, revenues grew 10% in dollars and 11% in constant currency. 
Now let me share some insights into the timing of the impact of COVID-19 in the second quarter. In the first 2 months, revenues were up approximately 8% year-over-year. As COVID-19 spread globally, our March revenues declined 4% year-over-year, driven by the Americas and EMEA geographies, which, combined, declined 7%, partially offset by improved performance in China and South Korea. 
Moving into hardware, software and services. Hardware revenues were down 7%. Our worldwide net installed base of 8,634 units grew 342 units, or 4%. This continued growth in our installed base drives future recurring revenues from upgrades, software and services. 
Software revenues grew 6%, driven by continued adoption of our software solutions. We remain focused on investing in innovation around efficient clinical workflow, systems integration and treatment planning. 
Our services revenue grew 11%, and net of acquisitions, services revenue grew 4%. 
Let me provide some insights by geography. In the Americas, revenues grew 4%, and was up 4% in our North America region. Orders were $355 million, down 3%. On a trailing 12-month basis, orders grew 4%. In EMEA, revenues declined 2%. Orders were $259 million, up 11%. On a trailing 12-month basis, orders grew 9%. In APAC, revenues grew 4%. Orders were $159 million, down 5%. And on a trailing 12-month basis, orders declined 2%. The Proton Solutions business posted revenues of $22 million, a decline of 32%, primarily driven by a slower order run rate in prior years, partially offset by continued growth in services revenues, which was up 61%. 
In the quarter, we were awarded 2 proton orders in our APAC geography. Total company gross margins were $339 million, up 6% and 42.7% of revenues, an increase of 150 basis points, driven by our portfolio mix and the benefits from tariff exclusions and acquisitions, partially offset by factory costs. 
Investing in R&D to drive innovation remains core to our growth strategy. In the quarter, we invested $71 million in R&D, up 19%, which is 8.9% of revenues. SG&A expenses were $166 million, up 16%, which is 20.8% of revenues. 
Excluding the acquisitions of CTSI, Endocare, Alicon and the Boston Scientific Bead portfolio, SG&A was up 5%. 
In March, we began to take cost mitigation actions in response to the impact of COVID-19. While we did realize some benefit in the second quarter from slower hiring and travel, we expect the benefit will be more significant in the back half of the year. 
Company operating earnings were $103 million, down 14%, which is 12.9% of revenues, down 230 basis points. The lower operating earnings were a direct result of COVID-19 impact on revenues. 
GAAP EPS was $0.47, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.85. This quarter, our GAAP operating earnings and GAAP EPS included a $41 million impairment of our loan receivables from California Proton Therapy center due to their operational and market challenges. It also includes a benefit of $9 million from the reversal of acquisition-related earnouts. 
Our tax rate was 23% and diluted share count was 91.4 million shares. Cash flows from operations were $22 million, up $35 million, driven by working capital usage and timing of certain tax payments in both years. Oncology DSO was 110 days, flat from last year. 
As part of our regular review of counterparty credit, to date, we have not seen any material decline in customer credit quality or payment terms due to COVID-19. 
Let's turn to the balance sheet and liquidity. We ended the quarter in a strong position, with $1.3 billion in available liquidity, including $668 million in cash and equivalents and $661 million available under our $1.2 billion revolving credit facility that matures in 2024. 
Our debt balance at the end of the quarter was $521 million, and our net leverage ratio, as defined under our credit agreement, was 0.2x trailing 12 months earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA. 
Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. While we plan to continue investing in our growth initiatives, we are taking proactive precautionary actions to enhance our financial flexibility. For example, we have paused share buybacks to preserve liquidity. Additionally, in the back half of the fiscal year, we will be focused on reducing costs, but with the discipline necessary to ensure we continue to prioritize key R&D and productivity programs to support our long-term growth goals. 
We believe our current liquidity position, combined with the precautionary actions being taken, leave us well positioned to navigate through this economic environment and continue to advance our long-term strategy. 
I will now turn it back over to Dow."

First, let's review our progress on innovating in radiation therapy. We continue to extend our market leadership and expand our addressable market with our innovation, comprehensive portfolio and services offerings. In our oncology business, we've gained market share over the trailing 12 months on both an orders and revenues basis. In February, during the peak of the pandemic in China, we received approval for Halcyon 2.0. The approval reaffirms the government's commitment to provide patients access to high-quality radiation therapy technology. 
The system incorporates imaging technologies such as Killer voltage [indiscernible] CT and iterative reconstructive [indiscernible] CT for better soft tissue definition. As order activity in China resumed in March, we received 3 new system orders and 5 system upgrade orders for Halcyon 2.0, and we have a strong second half funnel. 
We signed an agreement with National Health Service Trust for 15 truebeam machines and 5 Halcyon systems to equip centers across England. We closed the ProBeam 360 system purchase contract in the APAC geography. This was our second award in the quarter in APAC. As highlighted in our first quarter earnings call in January, we were selected by China Medical University Hospital in Taiwan to install a ProBeam 360 system in a single room configuration with the ability to add a second [indiscernible] later. University of Alabama Birmingham Proton Therapy center treated its first patient on our ProBeam compact system. We currently have 78 proton rooms under core, including 39 rooms that are operational across 26 sites globally. 
Second, let's turn to our progress in leveraging artificial intelligence, machine learning and cloud solutions. In February, we received FDA 510 clearance for our Ethos therapy solution in the U.S. customer engagement remains strong, and there continues to be excitement around the technology. In the quarter, we received 15 Ethos orders, including 11 in the Americas, 3 in EMEA and 1 in APAC. We now have 5 centers treating clinically with ethos. 
Treatments at our first clinical site in Herlev Hospital, Denmark, continue to progress well. The center has already delivered 100 adaptive fractions for bladder cancer patients and are seeing impressive treatment margin reductions of up to 50%. 
in March, [indiscernible] 20 Hospital in the Netherlands treated their first 2 patients for prostate cancer. And in Australia, both Icon Cancer Center and Royal Northshore Hospital treated their first patients for prostate cancer and head and neck cancer. 
Building on our leadership position in hypofractionation and radiosurgery, demand for HyperArc, our high-definition radiotherapy solution for stereotactic radiosurgery, has continued to grow. 33% of our TrueBeam installed base now has HyperArc capability, and we're receiving exceptional feedback from the clinical community. 
Third, let's discuss emerging businesses, geographies and technologies. We received an order for 12 TrueBeam machines, 22 Halcyon systems and 1 VitalBeam from Pharma Standard in Russia. Pharma Standard currently operates diagnostic imaging centers across the country and is expanding into cancer care. We're excited for this first phase of what is a multiple year plan for expansion into cancer treatment. 
CTSI was recently awarded a $15 million 5-year contract with Memorial Herman Health System to provide on-site and remote physics and dosimetry services. Memorial Herman is the largest not-for-profit health system in Southeast Texas, and consists of 17 hospitals, 8 cancer centers and 3 heart and vascular institutes. 
Since the acquisition of CTSI in May of 2019, the annual run rate for treatment plans has doubled to greater than 16,000 per year. Our pipeline in the United States and globally is strong and continues to expand. 
While we had some challenges in the quarter, given the current operating environment and logistical barriers created by the pandemic, I'm very pleased with the team's execution during the quarter. 
Now moving to guidance. Since our March 9 press release, the severity of the pandemic has expanded globally and has resulted in a dramatic shift in the macroeconomic environment. While our long-term fundamentals remain strong, the uncertainty around the severity and duration of COVID-19 has impacted our ability to reliably quantify the impact of the pandemic for the balance of our fiscal year. As a result, we will be withdrawing guidance for our fiscal 2020. 
In lieu of that, I would like Chris Toth, President of our Oncology Systems business, to share with you the trends that we are seeing in the market. Chris?"

As Mike mentioned, our second quarter performance wa",986,"Thank you, Dow, and hello, everyone. These are indeed unprecedented times, and the uncertainty from COVID-19 will have an impact for some time on the health care market in capital equipment purchases. 
As Mike mentioned, our second quarter performance was ahead of last year until March, when we started to see the impact of COVID-19 in the Americas and EMEA. Based on our current visibility, we believe orders and revenues will be stressed in the second half of our fiscal year due to lockdowns restricting access to sites and delaying vault construction. We believe this will have higher impact in our fiscal third quarter, followed by a sequential improvement in our fiscal fourth quarter, assuming no second wave of infections or lockdowns. 
Let me share the overarching trends we see, and how we are positioned as the market leader in radiation oncology and across oncology with an expanding cancer care portfolio. Let's start with the market. While delays in elective procedures, such as mammograms, prostate cancer screenings and radiological exams, have slowed new cancer patient treatment starts, treatment itself is not considered an elective procedure. As such, it can only be delayed for a short period of time without significant negative consequences to the patient. 
To this end, the criticality of radiation therapy for cancer treatment in the United States has increased since the pandemic began, and this was illustrated in the April 2020 field report published by the advisory group. Of the respondents in the study, 60% saw a marginal increase or no change in radiation oncology patient volumes compared to surgery, where only 10% saw a marginal increase or no change in patient volumes. 
As the pandemic stabilizes and cancer screening procedures resume in the U.S. and other markets, we expect to see a catch-up period, during which, new average daily volumes of radiation therapy treatments will increase significantly in the short term. 
Moving to customers. Based on our interactions with customers, access to the latest radiation oncology solutions remains a priority. And Varian continues to have the best portfolio of solutions in the market. Orders trends from late March have continued through April, and we expect budget limitations, foreign currency headwinds, lockdowns and uncertainty around the pandemic to drive delays in orders. I will walk you through some of what we are seeing in each geography. 
In the Americas, during late March, we saw a delay in new orders of approximately $40 million due to COVID-19. North America had the largest portion of these order delays. While order activity resumed in April, it is too early to estimate when it will return to pre pandemic levels. 
We are currently monitoring closely the removal of lockdown restrictions as a critical first step, along with capital budget allocations of hospitals. We believe the recovery in Latin America will follow that of North America. 
In EMEA, where we've had strong orders growth over the last 12 quarters, customer behavior has varied by country and by the severity of the pandemic. For example, in Germany, activity remains strong. However, in Spain and Italy, we believe that the impact from COVID-19 will affect tenders and new equipment orders. 
In India, while demand for our equipment and expansion of cancer care remains strong, the extension of the lockdown has momentarily impacted activity substantially over the past 30 days. 
Within Asia Pacific, China's new tender issuances have resumed close to pre pandemic levels, indicating stabilization. Further in China, where average daily treatment volumes were most affected globally due to radiation oncology being an inpatient procedure, we are seeing, on remotely monitored systems, average treatment volumes return to pre pandemic levels. China recovery is being tracked closely, and we are cautiously optimistic that it is sustainable. 
In Japan, post the state of emergency, we have seen some new tenders slow, while many active tenders and customer conversations continue towards order placement. 
Turning to backlog conversion, with some geographic variation, customer site readiness and access remains challenging. These logistical challenges will be a moderate headwind and will impact timing of certain installations in the second half of fiscal 2020. Our teams around the globe have navigated exceedingly well to continue installations and trainings where possible, including leveraging remote technologies. For example, in China, of the 12 accelerator installs delayed in our second fiscal quarter, 6 were completed in April. This experience leads us to believe that as the pandemic is contained, these challenges will dissipate. 
We believe services are reasonably insulated from COVID-19, driven by our large installed base and long-term service contracts as well as the criticality of radiation oncology treatments. Our service engineers globally continue to access sites to provide critical service to our customers. 
Our team's great customer focus is evidenced by an increase in our Net Promoter Score in all major markets. 
CTSI technology-enabled services have also positioned us well during this time through our ability to support treatment planning, quality assurance and other services remotely. 
In Proton Solutions, due to the high upfront capital outlay, purchase decision delays will likely be more pronounced. We will continue to execute on projects in our backlog and expect services to be stable and grow over time. 
Finally, in Interventional Solutions, decreased access to hospitals has impacted treatment volumes. In many cases, ablation procedures for early-stage cancer patients have been deferred, while advanced stage cancer patients have continued with their local regional treatments, including embolization. We believe these trends will drive near-term pressure across our interventional portfolio. 
We are encouraged by the resumption of procedure in the Americas and EMEA geographies. 
In summary, there are near-term headwinds that will impact us. However, as the market and innovation leader, in a market which will see total new cancer patients increase from an estimated $18 million in 2020 to 25 million in 2030, we believe we are well positioned for long-term growth and patient care impact.

We had about $30 million of that in the quarter. 
When we gave you the May 9 update for guidance, we had seen that already in China, so that was in our revenue guidance at that point in time. And incremental to that guide, what we saw as we made very clear at that time, it didn't include the impact of Americas and EMEA pandemic spread, and that's what we saw over the course of March.

So our portfolio is much broader now than back then as well as, when we look at our position in the market, we really feel that we've never been in a stronger position competitively."

As it initially occurred, it had to do with hospitals focusing on COVID-19 for patient management, needing as many inpatient beds available as possible. Some indicators we're seeing is that this is not just a U.S. phenomenon. In discussions with the NHS in the U.K., specifically looking at centers in England, the feedback came that they saw the same shift, and we got that input from a surgical oncologist at the NHS, who's in a leadership position. 
From a long-term perspective, I think this continues to move towards the increase in hypofractionation, of which we're best positioned in terms of portfolio in the market and total number of patients with well over 1 million patients treated in a hypofractionate environment. So I do see elements of it sustainable. Time will tell, but more than anything, it just underscores hypofractionation."

The reality is there's still major gaps in access to care.

It's a -- we are seeing recovery to China. It is more centrally mandated. It's not so much susceptible to kind of the free market, so to speak. It's -- one of the big differences, though, is that radiation therapy in China is an inpatient treatment. As such, really the short-term impact was much steeper in China. 
So we didn't see the U.S., in a sample of the 1,000-ish customers that we looked at, we didn't see a -- we didn't see much of a -- that stake of a fall-off in the U.S. compared to China. Because in China, the patients were having to go into a hospital, into a more of a COVID environment, it's more outpatient, whether hospital or nonhospital based here in the U.S. and a little more COVID-friendly, so to speak. So we didn't see the treatment volumes in the U.S. move down. 
As we kind of model it, it's a really good question. I'd say our base case is that it's an environment that's described as recession with economic slowdown and geopolitical stability, that North America would open by the end of May, that EMEA countries open variably in the next few months, china continues to recover, I think we'll still see some ongoing Southeast Asia, Korea, Japan, locked down in Australia, locked down into the summer. So that's kind of our base case. But the reason not to give guidance is there is a reasonable probability of a high-impact case, which is, does it switch from recession to more severe economic outlook? Are there geopolitical instabilities as recovery delayed into '21? And do we see a second surge of the disease? So that would be kind of the high level macro environment from a scenario planning that we're looking at. Chris, you want to talk a little bit about some of the U.S. market stuff?"

So first on the conversations with customers, as we've been going through with customers the activity and their planned or proposed purchases, what we've seen is the larger health systems with more spread out networks are continuing their plans. Some community hospitals, who've been more impacted with COVID-19 in their local or regional area, have looked at assessments around timing to proceed forward. We have not heard feedback from them at this point that they have stopped their plans around specific projects, more of a timing conversation. 
And then within the freestanding segment, a little bit of a mix depending upon geographic position of the institution. As we do look at the mix, I know I've said it a few times, but in North America, greater than 50% of our base is services, which is a really important part of the business, and it keeps strong continuity with each of those sites. So it's still too early to really make a call with respect to North America, and we're continuing to stay close to our customers. 
On the second point, regarding APM, really as we've seen APM since the inception and discussion around it, value-based care is where the market has been heading towards. We have the best portfolio for a value-based care environment. We have not seen any impact on purchase decisions from APM. In fact, if you go back to Q1, you saw solid North America orders growth. You also heard our commentary around some of the pushouts in March and related to COVID-19 and really tieing to North America. So if anything, we've just seen the consistent focus as folks have been preparing for APM, and thus, we don't really see it as a big net impact one way or another with respect to a slightly longer delay."

The CTSI acquisition that we made positions us well in those growth opportunities. 
Those are geographies where you see a smaller or reduced number of clinical personnel to perform treatment planning or other services.

But from a higher level, Dow, just what where do you think conversations are going to go over the next 6 to 12 months with various hospitals and other service providers on the hierarchy of radiation oncology versus other hospital CapEx that could happen? I think back in the 2009, '10 period, radiation oncology, given its returns, did have a high priority in where hospitals would spend. I think Chris has mentioned in the past, there's some 5,500 C series probably down to 5,000 C series linacs out there now that could really get a nice throughput advantage. So just how to think about the hierarchy of spend next year at the hospital level?"

Anything, at all, on that part of the business? Can that 50% really continue to grow here in the next few quarters and really protect the hardware downside that we'll see maybe in the near term?"

As Chris stated in his prepared comments, we believe that our services business is relatively insulated. And that business has been built up over many years as we've grown our installed base and invested in software. And software investments also give us the opportunity to obtain software service agreements over time. So those growth elements have delivered very strong services growth over the last couple of years. 
Now the services growth this quarter is 11%. Organically, from an oncology perspective, that's around 4% growth. So that's a little bit more in line with our installed base. We did have some revenue that we took last year, which depresses the growth rate year-on-year. But for all intents and purposes, we're in that mid-single-digit services growth rate year-on-year, and that tracks very well with the installed base, plus the innovations that we've driven on our software. 
And Jeff, as well, the other thing I I know that you took a look at this about 12 to 18 months ago. But it's not to be overlooked at the Proton Services is growing 61%. We continue to hand over rooms operationally. And as we do and they move through the warranty period, we're able to generate services revenue there. So that's a really good story from an economic perspective in that business."

We've gone from 8,000 -- a run rate of 8,000 treatment plans a year to 16,000 treatment plans a year. So you can see the kind of confidence that our customers are putting in us. 
And yes, there was -- we saw a bigger falloff in China. We don't have much CTSI in China. We did see a drop off, as Chris said, here in the U.S., but we've also seen that rebound pretty quickly to a historical level. So CTSI is -- at least, in the U.S. piece of CTSI is  not that big impacted. The piece of CTSI that is impacted is the care businesses that we're in, in India, and we have seen the lockdown there. And it has impacted the CTSI's revenues there. But we're also seeing that rebound and believe that, that should come back pretty quickly."

Anyway, for costs, let me just say, I wanted to reiterate from a liquidity perspective, the financial flexibility that we've built. Mike emphasized that. And having said that, we're considering a broad range of options as a precautionary measure, just to make sure we can maintain our flexibility in all scenarios, in both those scenarios that I talked about. So our focus will be on reducing costs without impacting key R&D and productivity programs. We started some of those in March, slowing down hiring, replacement, hiring and travel. But we'll have some incremental stuff that we do here soon as well. Just as a reminder, as we think about that, new cancer patients are going from 18 million this year to 25 million in 2030. So we're going to prioritize investments to focus on our long-term growth strategy. We'll take some costs out of second half. We'll be thoughtful and disciplined about how we do that with the recovery in place. We will say that our cost mitigation options range on both the OpEx side, operating expense side as well as our product cost side as we work through the volumes that the market is going to demand for both workplace and workforce considerations.

I think that we've seen a general trend in the last 5 years of consolidation and the strong remains strong. And those are the -- frankly, those are the ones that we've seen investing in radiation oncology. Our Americas growth rate, the last 2.5 years, has been very strong, strong mid-single digit, 5%, 6%.

But the inventory is roughly in line with where we thought. And our accounts payable are in line as well. I think we'll continue to see how this plays out. But as you mentioned, kind of in the beginning of your question, we do have $1.3 billion in liquidity.

China and South Korea seem to be ahead of other countries in controlling the pandemic and progressing towards normalcy. Conversely, the rest of APAC, Americas and EMEA geographies continue to take actions to stem the outbreak. While we're cautiously encouraged by the recovery in China, we remain sensitive to future uncertainties, including continued spread or recurrence of the pandemic, which could slow progress towards recovery.
Our focus now, as it's always been, is keeping our employees safe, supporting our customers and their patients, ensuring supply chain stability and maintaining business continuity. Our employees are crucial to our mission and as we saw this outbreak shift into a pandemic, we took several actions to ensure their safety and well-being. We instituted work-from-home policies and workplace safety measures and protocols. To support our workforce, we implemented additional employee benefits in March that will continue as needed through fiscal 2020. We also implemented new programs aimed at educating our employees on how to operate in this new virtual, physical distancing environment. We recognize the challenge for health care resources to manage COVID-19 and non-COVID-19-related Care. Since radiation oncology is not considered an elective procedure, our teams are taking actions on a customer-by-customer basis to ensure they can deliver therapy to patients.
Furthermore, during this pandemic, we have seen, in some clinics across the globe, a shift from surgical intervention to radiation oncology, further underscoring its importance. We are actively deploying remote tools across our training, installation and field service teams to ensure continued access to our products and solutions.
We have secured and stabilized our global supply chain with ongoing efforts in place to continue to monitor and mitigate any new risks that emerge. After being closed for a limited period in the quarter, our essential manufacturing facilities in Beijing and Palo Alto are now fully operational. We continue to ship our products and on our customer commitments during the factory shutdown.
Finally, we're taking steps to bolster our already strong financial position, in view of the possible continued impact of COVID-19, we're taking prudent actions to manage costs, while continuing to make planned investments that will allow us to execute our growth plan. Mike will discuss these later.
I believe our long-term fundamentals remain strong, and our business is well positioned financially and organizationally to weather this environment as well as extend our global leadership in oncology. With that, Mike will discuss our financial performance and liquidity and in more details."

Total company revenues were $794 million, up 2% in dollars and 3% in constant currency. Organic revenues declined 1%.
Looking at Oncology Systems, orders were $773 million, up 1% in dollars and 2% in constant currency, and over the trailing 12 months, 5% in dollars and 6% in constant currency. We ended the quarter with a robust backlog of $3 billion, up 3%. To date, we have not seen any COVID-19 related order cancellations.
Revenues were $761 million, up 2% in dollars and 3% in constant currency, driven by strong growth in software and services. On a trailing 12-month basis, revenues grew 10% in dollars and 11% in constant currency.
Now let me share some insights into the timing of the impact of COVID-19 in the second quarter. In the first 2 months, revenues were up approximately 8% year-over-year. As COVID-19 spread globally, our March revenues declined 4% year-over-year, driven by the Americas and EMEA geographies, which, combined, declined 7%, partially offset by improved performance in China and South Korea.
Moving into hardware, software and services. Hardware revenues were down 7%. Our worldwide net installed base of 8,634 units grew 342 units, or 4%. This continued growth in our installed base drives future recurring revenues from upgrades, software and services. Software revenues grew 6%, driven by continued adoption of our software solutions. We remain focused on investing in innovation around efficient clinical workflow, systems integration and treatment planning. Our services revenue grew 11%, and net of acquisitions, services revenue grew 4%.
Let me provide some insights by geography. In the Americas, revenues grew 4%, and was up 4% in our North America region. Orders were $355 million, down 3%. On a trailing 12-month basis, orders grew 4%. In EMEA, revenues declined 2%. Orders were $259 million, up 11%. On a trailing 12-month basis, orders grew 9%. In APAC, revenues grew 4%. Orders were $159 million, down 5%. And on a trailing 12-month basis, orders declined 2%.
The Proton Solutions business posted revenues of $22 million, a decline of 32%, primarily driven by a slower order run rate in prior years, partially offset by continued growth in services revenues, which was up 61%. In the quarter, we were awarded 2 proton orders in our APAC geography. Total company gross margins were $339 million, up 6% and 42.7% of revenues, an increase of 150 basis points, driven by our portfolio mix and the benefits from tariff exclusions and acquisitions, partially offset by factory costs.
Investing in R&D to drive innovation remains core to our growth strategy. In the quarter, we invested $71 million in R&D, up 19%, which is 8.9% of revenues.
SG&A expenses were $166 million, up 16%, which is 20.8% of revenues. Excluding the acquisitions of CTSI, Endocare, Alicon and the Boston Scientific Bead portfolio, SG&A was up 5%.
In March, we began to take cost mitigation actions in response to the impact of COVID-19. While we did realize some benefit in the second quarter from slower hiring and travel, we expect the benefit will be more significant in the back half of the year.
Company operating earnings were $103 million, down 14%, which is 12.9% of revenues, down 230 basis points. The lower operating earnings were a direct result of COVID-19 impact on revenues.
GAAP EPS was $0.47, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.85. This quarter, our GAAP operating earnings and GAAP EPS included a $41 million impairment of our loan receivables from California Proton Therapy Center due to their operational and market challenges. It also includes a benefit of $9 million from the reversal of acquisition-related earnouts.
Our tax rate was 23% and diluted share count was 91.4 million shares.
Cash flows from operations were $22 million, up $35 million, driven by working capital usage and timing of certain tax payments in both years. Oncology DSO was 110 days, flat from last year.
As part of our regular review of counterparty credit, to date, we have not seen any material decline in customer credit quality or payment terms due to COVID-19.
Let's turn to the balance sheet and liquidity. We ended the quarter in a strong position, with $1.3 billion in available liquidity, including $668 million in cash and equivalents and $661 million available under our $1.2 billion revolving credit facility that matures in 2024.
Our debt balance at the end of the quarter was $521 million, and our net leverage ratio, as defined under our credit agreement, was 0.2x trailing 12 months earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA.
Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. While we plan to continue investing in our growth initiatives, we are taking proactive precautionary actions to enhance our financial flexibility. For example, we have paused share buybacks to preserve liquidity. Additionally, in the back half of the fiscal year, we will be focused on reducing costs. But with the discipline necessary to ensure we continue to prioritize key R&D and productivity programs to support our long-term growth goals.
We believe our current liquidity position, combined with the precautionary actions being taken, leave us well positioned to navigate through this economic environment and continue to advance our long-term strategy.
I will now turn it back over to Dow."

First, let's review our progress on innovating in radiation therapy. We continue to extend our market leadership and expand our addressable market with our innovation, comprehensive portfolio and services offerings.
In our Oncology business, we've gained market share over the trailing 12 months on both an orders and revenues basis. In February, during the peak of the pandemic in China, we received approval for Halcyon 2.0. The approval reaffirms the government's commitment to provide patients access to high-quality radiation therapy technology.
The system incorporates imaging technologies such as kilovoltage cone-beam CT and iterative reconstructive cone-beam CT for better soft tissue definition. As order activity in China resumed in March, we received 3 new system orders and 5 system upgrade orders for Halcyon 2.0, and we have a strong second half funnel.
We signed an agreement with National Health Service Trust for 15 TrueBeam machines and 5 Halcyon systems to equip centers across England. We closed the ProBeam 360 system purchase contract in the APAC geography. This was our second award in the quarter in APAC as highlighted in our first quarter earnings call in January, we were selected by China Medical University Hospital in Taiwan to install a ProBeam 360 system in a single room configuration with the ability to add a second gantry later. University of Alabama at Birmingham Proton Therapy Center treated its first patient on our ProBeam Compact system. We currently have 78 proton rooms [indiscernible], including 39 rooms that are operational across 26 sites globally.
Second, let's turn to our progress in leveraging artificial intelligence, machine learning and cloud solutions. In February, we received FDA 510 clearance for our Ethos therapy solution in the U.S. Customer engagement remains strong, and there continues to be excitement around the technology. In the quarter, we received 15 Ethos orders, including 11 in the Americas, 3 in EMEA and 1 in APAC. We now have 5 centers treating clinically with Ethos.
Treatments at our first clinical site in Herlev Hospital, Denmark, continue to progress well. The center has already delivered 100 adaptive fractions for bladder cancer patients and are seeing impressive treatment margin reductions of up to 50%.
In March, Medische Spectrum Twente Hospital in the Netherlands treated their first 2 patients for prostate cancer. And in Australia, both Icon Cancer Center and Royal North Shore Hospital treated their first patients for prostate cancer and head and neck cancer.
Building on our leadership position in hypofractionation and radiosurgery, demand for HyperArc, our high-definition radiotherapy solution for stereotactic radiosurgery, has continued to grow. 33% of our TrueBeam installed base now has HyperArc capability, and we're receiving exceptional feedback from the clinical community.
Third, let's discuss emerging businesses, geographies and technologies. We received an order for 12 TrueBeam machines, 22 Halcyon systems and 1 VitalBeam from Pharmstandard in Russia. Pharmstandard currently operates diagnostic imaging centers across the country and is expanding into cancer care. We're excited for this first phase of what is a multiple year plan for expansion into cancer treatment.
CTSI was recently awarded a $15 million 5-year contract with Memorial Hermann Health System to provide on-site and remote physics and dosimetry services. Memorial Hermann is the largest not-for-profit health system in Southeast Texas, and consists of 17 hospitals, 8 cancer centers and 3 heart and vascular institutes.
Since the acquisition of CTSI in May of 2019, the annual run rate for treatment plans has doubled to greater than 16,000 per year. Our pipeline in the United States and globally is strong and continues to expand.
While we had some challenges in the quarter, given the current operating environment and logistical barriers created by the pandemic, I'm very pleased with the team's execution during the quarter.
Now moving to guidance. Since our March 9 press release, the severity of the pandemic has expanded globally and has resulted in a dramatic shift in the macroeconomic environment. While our long-term fundamentals remain strong, the uncertainty around the severity and duration of COVID-19 has impacted our ability to reliably quantify the impact of the pandemic for the balance of our fiscal year. As a result, we will be withdrawing guidance for our fiscal 2020.
In lieu of that, I would like Chris Toth, President of our Oncology Systems business, to share with you the trends that we are seeing in the market. Chris?"
311907,664413151,1969794,"Varian Medical Systems, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, May 04, 2020",2020-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dow, and hello, everyone. These are indeed unprecedented times, and the uncertainty from COVID-19 will have an impact for some time on the health care market in capital equipment purchases.As Mike mentioned, our second quarter performance was",982,"Thank you, Dow, and hello, everyone. These are indeed unprecedented times, and the uncertainty from COVID-19 will have an impact for some time on the health care market in capital equipment purchases.
As Mike mentioned, our second quarter performance was ahead of last year until March, when we started to see the impact of COVID-19 in the Americas and EMEA. Based on our current visibility, we believe orders and revenues will be stressed in the second half of our fiscal year due to lockdowns restricting access to sites and delaying vault construction. We believe this will have higher impact in our fiscal third quarter, followed by a sequential improvement in our fiscal fourth quarter, assuming no second wave of infections or lockdowns.
Let me share the overarching trends we see, and how we are positioned as the market leader in radiation oncology and across oncology with an expanding cancer care portfolio. Let's start with the market. While delays in elective procedures, such as mammograms, prostate cancer screenings and radiological exams have slowed new cancer patient treatment starts, treatment itself is not considered an elective procedure. As such, it can only be delayed for a short period of time without significant negative consequences to the patient.
To this end, the criticality of radiation therapy for cancer treatment in the United States has increased since the pandemic began, and this was illustrated in the April 2020 field report published by the advisory group. Of the respondents in the study, 60% saw a marginal increase or no change in radiation oncology patient volumes compared to surgery, where only 10% saw a marginal increase or no change in patient volumes.
As the pandemic stabilizes and cancer screening procedures resume in the U.S. and other markets, we expect to see a catch-up period, during which, new average daily volumes of radiation therapy treatments will increase significantly in the short term.
Moving to customers. Based on our interactions with customers, access to the latest radiation oncology solutions remains a priority. And Varian continues to have the best portfolio of solutions in the market. Orders trends from late March have continued through April, and we expect budget limitations, foreign currency headwinds, lockdowns and uncertainty around the pandemic to drive delays in orders.
I will walk you through some of what we are seeing in each geography. In the Americas, during late March, we saw a delay in new orders of approximately $40 million due to COVID-19. North America had the largest portion of these order delays. While order activity resumed in April, it is too early to estimate when it will return to pre-pandemic levels. We are currently monitoring closely the removal of lockdown restrictions as a critical first step, along with capital budget allocations of hospitals. We believe the recovery in Latin America will follow that of North America.
In EMEA, where we've had strong orders growth over the last 12 quarters, customer behavior has varied by country and by the severity of the pandemic. For example, in Germany, activity remains strong. However, in Spain and Italy, we believe that the impact from COVID-19 will affect tenders and new equipment orders.
In India, while demand for our equipment and expansion of cancer care remains strong, the extension of the lockdown has momentarily impacted activity substantially over the past 30 days.
Within Asia Pacific, China's new tender issuances have resumed close to pre-pandemic levels, indicating stabilization. Further in China, where average daily treatment volumes were most affected globally due to radiation oncology being an inpatient procedure, we are seeing, on remotely monitored systems, average treatment volumes return to pre-pandemic levels. China recovery is being tracked closely, and we are cautiously optimistic that it is sustainable.
In Japan, post the state of emergency, we have seen some new tenders slow, while many active tenders and customer conversations continue towards order placement.
Turning to backlog conversion, with some geographic variation, customer site readiness and access remains challenging. These logistical challenges will be a moderate headwind and will impact timing of certain installations in the second half of fiscal 2020. Our teams around the globe have navigated exceedingly well to continue installations and trainings where possible, including leveraging remote technologies. For example, in China, of the 12 accelerator installs delayed in our second fiscal quarter, 6 were completed in April. This experience leads us to believe that as the pandemic is contained, these challenges will dissipate.
We believe services are reasonably insulated from COVID-19, driven by our large installed base and long-term service contracts as well as the criticality of radiation oncology treatments. Our service engineers globally continue to access sites to provide critical service to our customers.
Our team's great customer focus is evidenced by an increase in our Net Promoter Score in all major markets.
CTSI technology-enabled services have also positioned us well during this time through our ability to support treatment planning, quality assurance and other services remotely.
In Proton Solutions, due to the high upfront capital outlay, purchase decision delays will likely be more pronounced. We will continue to execute on projects in our backlog and expect services to be stable and grow over time.
Finally, in Interventional Solutions, decreased access to hospitals has impacted treatment volumes. In many cases, ablation procedures for early-stage cancer patients have been deferred. while advanced-stage cancer patients have continued with their local regional treatments, including embolization. We believe these trends will drive near-term pressure across our interventional portfolio.
We are encouraged by the resumption of procedure in the Americas and EMEA geographies.
In summary, there are near-term headwinds that will impact us. However, as the market and innovation leader, in a market which will see total new cancer patients increase from an estimated 18 million in 2020 to 25 million in 2030, we believe we are well positioned for long-term growth and patient care impact.

I think the other thing to offset that is, there was some unexpected good news in the Asia-Pac geography. It did recover faster than we anticipated when we gave the March 9 update so that provided us some upside to offset a portion of that $30 million."

As it initially occurred, it had to do with hospitals focusing on COVID-19 for patient management, needing as many inpatient beds available as possible. Some indicators we're seeing is that this is not just a U.S. phenomenon. In discussions with the NHS in the U.K., specifically looking at centers in England, the feedback came that they saw the same shift, and we got that input from a surgical oncologist at the NHS, who's in a leadership position. 
From a long-term perspective, I think this continues to move towards the increase in hypofractionation, of which we're best positioned in terms of portfolio in the market and total number of patients with well over 1 million patients treated in a hypofractionate environment. So I do see elements of it sustainable. Time will tell, but more than anything, it just underscores hypofractionation."

And so as there was some loosening or returning to normalcy, there was a desire to resume installations as quickly as possible. Saw that in both China and South Korea. This really does continue to reinforce as you think about globally the reference to in 2020, an estimated 18 million new cancer diagnoses moving in 2030 to 25 million. The reality is there's still major gaps in access to care. So we foresee with our backlog, which is greater than $3 billion of product, that as we get to a place for lockdowns release, we will be able to resume installations, pending vault construction, completion and other preparatory requirements."

It's a -- we are seeing recovery to China. It is more centrally mandated. It's not so much susceptible to kind of the free market, so to speak. It's -- one of the big differences, though, is that radiation therapy in China is an inpatient treatment. As such, really the short-term impact was much steeper in China.
So we didn't see the U.S., in a sample of the 1,000-ish customers that we looked at, we didn't see a -- we didn't see much of that steep of a fall-off in the U.S. compared to China. Because in China, the patients were having to go into a hospital, into a more of a COVID environment, it's more outpatient, whether hospital or nonhospital based here in the U.S. and a little more COVID-friendly, so to speak. So we didn't see the treatment volumes in the U.S. move down.
As we kind of model it, it's a really good question. I'd say our base case is that it's an environment that's described as recession with economic slowdown and geopolitical stability, that North America would open by the end of May, that EMEA countries open variably in the next few months, china continues to recover, I think we'll still see some ongoing Southeast Asia, Korea, Japan, locked down in Australia, locked down into the summer. So that's kind of our base case. But the reason not to give guidance is there is a reasonable probability of a high-impact case, which is, does it switch from recession to more severe economic outlook? Are there geopolitical instabilities as recovery delayed into '21? And do we see a second surge of the disease? So that would be kind of the high-level macro environment from a scenario planning that we're looking at. Chris, you want to talk a little bit about some of the U.S. market stuff?"

So first on the conversations with customers. As we've been going through with customers the activity and their planned or proposed purchases, what we've seen is the larger health systems with more spread out networks are continuing their plans. Some community hospitals, who've been more impacted with COVID-19 in their local or regional area, have looked at assessments around timing to proceed forward. We have not heard feedback from them at this point that they have stopped their plans around specific projects, more of a timing conversation. 
And then within the freestanding segment, a little bit of a mix depending upon geographic position of the institution. As we do look at the mix, I know I've said it a few times, but in North America, greater than 50% of our base is services, which is a really important part of the business, and it keeps strong continuity with each of those sites. So it's still too early to really make a call with respect to North America, and we're continuing to stay close to our customers.
On the second point, regarding APM, really as we've seen APM since the inception and discussion around it, value-based care is where the market has been heading towards. We have the best portfolio for a value-based care environment. We have not seen any impact on purchase decisions from APM. In fact, if you go back to Q1, you saw solid North America orders growth. You also heard our commentary around some of the pushouts in March and related to COVID-19 and really tieing to North America. So if anything, we've just seen the consistent focus as folks have been preparing for APM, and thus, we don't really see it as a big net impact one way or another with respect to a slightly longer delay."

In addition to that, as you think about Africa, with a population of over 1 billion and very restricted access to care across the continent. So when we think long-term about the region, we have both the replacement cycle in the developed market, where we have a very robust installed base, and then a lot of growth opportunities throughout the emerging areas. The CTSI acquisition that we made positions us well in those growth opportunities. Those are geographies where you see a smaller or reduced number of clinical personnel to perform treatment planning or other services.

We did have some revenue that we took last year, which depresses the growth rate year-on-year. But for all intents and purposes, we're in that mid-single-digit services growth rate year-on-year, and that tracks very well with the installed base, plus the innovations that we've driven on our software. 
And Jeff, as well, the other thing I know that you took a look at this about 12 to 18 months ago. But it's not to be overlooked at the Proton Services is growing 61%. We continue to hand over rooms operationally. And as we do and they move through the warranty period, we're able to generate services revenue there. So that's a really good story from an economic perspective in that business."

We've gone from 8,000 -- a run rate of 8,000 treatment plans a year to 16,000 treatment plans a year. So you can see the kind of confidence that our customers are putting in us.
And yes, there was -- we saw a bigger falloff in China. We don't have much CTSI in China. We did see a drop off, as Chris said, here in the U.S., but we've also seen that rebound pretty quickly to a historical level. So CTSI is -- at least, in the U.S. piece of CTSI is not that big impacted. The piece of CTSI that is impacted is the care businesses that we're in, in India, and we have seen the lockdown there. And it has impacted the CTSI's revenues there. But we're also seeing that rebound and believe that, that should come back pretty quickly."

Mike emphasized that. And having said that, we're considering a broad range of options as a precautionary measure, just to make sure we can maintain our flexibility in all scenarios, in both those scenarios that I talked about. So our focus will be on reducing costs without impacting key R&D and productivity programs. We started some of those in March, slowing down hiring, replacement, hiring and travel. But we'll have some incremental stuff that we do here soon as well. Just as a reminder, as we think about that, new cancer patients are going from 18 million this year to 25 million in 2030. So we're going to prioritize investments to focus on our long-term growth strategy. We'll take some costs out of second half. We'll be thoughtful and disciplined about how we do that with the recovery in place. We will say that our cost mitigation options range on both the OpEx side, operating expense side as well as our product cost side as we work through the volumes that the market is going to demand for both workplace and workforce considerations.

And it's fairly on our expectations I think the makeup of the inventory is a little different. We have a little increased finished goods and lower raw materials, but that's simply due to some of the factory shutdown and timing of revenues. But the inventory is roughly in line with where we thought. And our accounts payable are in line as well. I think we'll continue to see how this plays out. But as you mentioned, kind of in the beginning of your question, we do have $1.3 billion in liquidity.

Before we get into the details for the quarter, I want to express our gratitude to everyone on the front line fighting this global pandemic and hope everyone is staying safe and feeling well, from our 10,000-plus employees all over the world, we say thank you. 
Furthermore, I want to thank our valuable employees, customers, suppliers and distributors for their hard work, support and partnership during this extraordinary period. Your efforts have ensured that cancer patients, globally, continue to receive vital treatment.
Our fiscal second quarter performance reflects the escalation of COVID-19 and our global response. On this call, we will share our experience in the quarter, our framework for engaging those who rely on us and our priorities and actions in these challenging times.
The pandemic has created some unique operational challenges around delivery of our products and solutions as well as open new opportunities. The impact in the quarter, which was driven by timing delays around installation and acceptance of our products, has varied by region based on the stage of containment and government actions. 
China and South Korea seem to be ahead of other countries in controlling the pandemic and progressing towards normalcy. Conversely, the rest of APAC, Americas and EMEA geographies continue to take actions to stem the outbreak. While we're cautiously encouraged by the recovery in China, we remain sensitive to future uncertainties, including continued spread or recurrence of the pandemic, which could slow progress towards recovery.
Our focus now, as it's always been, is keeping our employees safe, supporting our customers and their patients, ensuring supply chain stability and maintaining business continuity. Our employees are crucial to our mission and as we saw this outbreak shift into a pandemic, we took several actions to ensure their safety and well-being. We instituted work-from-home policies and workplace safety measures and protocols. 
To support our workforce, we implemented additional employee benefits in March that will continue as needed through fiscal 2020. We also implemented new programs aimed at educating our employees on how to operate in this new virtual, physical distancing environment. 
We recognize the challenge for health care resources to manage COVID-19 and non-COVID-19-related Care. Since radiation oncology is not considered an elective procedure, our teams are taking actions on a customer-by-customer basis to ensure they can deliver therapy to patients.
Furthermore, during this pandemic, we have seen, in some clinics across the globe, a shift from surgical intervention to radiation oncology, further underscoring its importance. We are actively deploying remote tools across our training, installation and field service teams to ensure continued access to our products and solutions.
We have secured and stabilized our global supply chain with ongoing efforts in place to continue to monitor and mitigate any new risks that emerge. After being closed for a limited period in the quarter, our essential manufacturing facilities in Beijing and Palo Alto are now fully operational. We continue to ship our products and honor our customer commitments during the factory shutdown.
Finally, we're taking steps to bolster our already strong financial position. In view of the possible continued impact of COVID-19, we're taking prudent actions to manage costs, while continuing to make planned investments that will allow us to execute our growth plan. Mike will discuss these later.
I believe our long-term fundamentals remain strong, and our business is well positioned financially and organizationally to weather this environment as well as extend our global leadership in oncology. With that, Mike will discuss our financial performance and liquidity and in more details."

Looking at Oncology Systems, orders were $773 million, up 1% in dollars and 2% in constant currency, and over the trailing 12 months, 5% in dollars and 6% in constant currency. We ended the quarter with a robust backlog of $3 billion, up 3%. To date, we have not seen any COVID-19 related order cancellations.
Revenues were $761 million, up 2% in dollars and 3% in constant currency, driven by strong growth in software and services. On a trailing 12-month basis, revenues grew 10% in dollars and 11% in constant currency.
Now let me share some insights into the timing of the impact of COVID-19 in the second quarter. In the first 2 months, revenues were up approximately 8% year-over-year. As COVID-19 spread globally, our March revenues declined 4% year-over-year, driven by the Americas and EMEA geographies, which, combined, declined 7%, partially offset by improved performance in China and South Korea.
Moving into hardware, software and services. Hardware revenues were down 7%. Our worldwide net installed base of 8,634 units grew 342 units, or 4%. This continued growth in our installed base drives future recurring revenues from upgrades, software and services. Software revenues grew 6%, driven by continued adoption of our software solutions. We remain focused on investing in innovation around efficient clinical workflow, systems integration and treatment planning. Our services revenue grew 11%, and net of acquisitions, services revenue grew 4%.
Let me provide some insights by geography. In the Americas, revenues grew 4%, and was up 4% in our North America region. Orders were $355 million, down 3%. On a trailing 12-month basis, orders grew 4%. In EMEA, revenues declined 2%. Orders were $259 million, up 11%. On a trailing 12-month basis, orders grew 9%. In APAC, revenues grew 4%. Orders were $159 million, down 5%. And on a trailing 12-month basis, orders declined 2%.
The Proton Solutions business posted revenues of $22 million, a decline of 32%, primarily driven by a slower order run rate in prior years, partially offset by continued growth in services revenues, which was up 61%. In the quarter, we were awarded 2 proton orders in our APAC geography. Total company gross margins were $339 million, up 6% and 42.7% of revenues, an increase of 150 basis points, driven by our portfolio mix and the benefits from tariff exclusions and acquisitions, partially offset by factory costs.
Investing in R&D to drive innovation remains core to our growth strategy. In the quarter, we invested $71 million in R&D, up 19%, which is 8.9% of revenues.
SG&A expenses were $166 million, up 16%, which is 20.8% of revenues. Excluding the acquisitions of CTSI, Endocare, Alicon and the Boston Scientific Bead portfolio, SG&A was up 5%.
In March, we began to take cost mitigation actions in response to the impact of COVID-19. While we did realize some benefit in the second quarter from slower hiring and travel, we expect the benefit will be more significant in the back half of the year.
Company operating earnings were $103 million, down 14%, which is 12.9% of revenues, down 230 basis points. The lower operating earnings were a direct result of COVID-19 impact on revenues.
GAAP EPS was $0.47, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.85. This quarter, our GAAP operating earnings and GAAP EPS included a $41 million impairment of our loan receivables from California Proton Therapy Center due to their operational and market challenges. It also includes a benefit of $9 million from the reversal of acquisition-related earnouts. Our tax rate was 23% and diluted share count was 91.4 million shares.
Cash flows from operations were $22 million, up $35 million, driven by working capital usage and timing of certain tax payments in both years. Oncology DSO was 110 days, flat from last year.
As part of our regular review of counterparty credit, to date, we have not seen any material decline in customer credit quality or payment terms due to COVID-19.
Let's turn to the balance sheet and liquidity. We ended the quarter in a strong position, with $1.3 billion in available liquidity, including $668 million in cash and equivalents and $661 million available under our $1.2 billion revolving credit facility that matures in 2024.
Our debt balance at the end of the quarter was $521 million, and our net leverage ratio, as defined under our credit agreement, was 0.2x trailing 12 months earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA.
Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. While we plan to continue investing in our growth initiatives, we are taking proactive precautionary actions to enhance our financial flexibility. For example, we have paused share buybacks to preserve liquidity. Additionally, in the back half of the fiscal year, we will be focused on reducing costs, but with the discipline necessary to ensure we continue to prioritize key R&D and productivity programs to support our long-term growth goals.
We believe our current liquidity position, combined with the precautionary actions being taken, leave us well positioned to navigate through this economic environment and continue to advance our long-term strategy.
I will now turn it back over to Dow."

First, let's review our progress on innovating in radiation therapy. We continue to extend our market leadership and expand our addressable market with our innovation, comprehensive portfolio and services offerings.
In our Oncology business, we've gained market share over the trailing 12 months on both in orders and revenues basis. In February, during the peak of the pandemic in China, we received approval for Halcyon 2.0. The approval reaffirms the government's commitment to provide patients access to high-quality radiation therapy technology.
The system incorporates imaging technologies, such as kilovoltage cone-beam CT and iterative reconstructive cone-beam CT, for better soft tissue definition. As order activity in China resumed in March, we received 3 new system orders and 5 system upgrade orders for Halcyon 2.0, and we have a strong second half funnel.
We signed an agreement with National Health Service Trust for 15 TrueBeam machines and 5 Halcyon systems to equip centers across England. We closed the ProBeam 360 system purchase contract in the APAC geography. This was our second award in the quarter in APAC, as highlighted in our first quarter earnings call in January, we were selected by China Medical University Hospital in Taiwan to install a ProBeam 360 system in a single room configuration with the ability to add a second gantry later. University of Alabama at Birmingham Proton Therapy Center treated its first patient on our ProBeam Compact system. We currently have 78 proton rooms [indiscernible], including 39 rooms that are operational across 26 sites globally.
Second, let's turn to our progress in leveraging artificial intelligence, machine learning and cloud solutions. In February, we received FDA 510 clearance for our Ethos therapy solution in the U.S. Customer engagement remains strong, and there continues to be excitement around the technology. In the quarter, we received 15 Ethos orders, including 11 in the Americas, 3 in EMEA and 1 in APAC. We now have 5 centers treating clinically with Ethos.
Treatments at our first clinical site in Herlev Hospital, Denmark, continue to progress well. The center has already delivered 100 adaptive fractions for bladder cancer patients and are seeing impressive treatment margin reductions of up to 50%.
In March, Medische Spectrum Twente Hospital in the Netherlands treated their first 2 patients for prostate cancer. And in Australia, both Icon Cancer Center and Royal North Shore Hospital treated their first patients for prostate cancer and head and neck cancer.
Building on our leadership position in hypofractionation and radiosurgery, demand for HyperArc, our high-definition radiotherapy solution for stereotactic radiosurgery, has continued to grow. 33% of our TrueBeam installed base now has HyperArc capability, and we're receiving exceptional feedback from the clinical community.
Third, let's discuss emerging businesses, geographies and technologies. We received an order for 12 TrueBeam machines, 22 Halcyon systems and 1 VitalBeam from Pharmstandard in Russia. Pharmstandard currently operates diagnostic imaging centers across the country and is expanding into cancer care. We're excited for this first phase of what is a multiple year plan for expansion into cancer treatment.
CTSI was recently awarded a $15 million 5-year contract with Memorial Hermann Health System to provide on-site and remote physics and dosimetry services. Memorial Hermann is the largest not-for-profit health system in Southeast Texas, and consists of 17 hospitals, 8 cancer centers and 3 heart and vascular institutes.
Since the acquisition of CTSI in May of 2019, the annual run rate for treatment plans has doubled to greater than 16,000 per year. Our pipeline in the United States and globally is strong and continues to expand.
While we had some challenges in the quarter, given the current operating environment and logistical barriers created by the pandemic, I'm very pleased with the team's execution during the quarter.
Now moving to guidance. Since our March 9 press release, the severity of the pandemic has expanded globally and has resulted in a dramatic shift in the macroeconomic environment. While our long-term fundamentals remain strong, the uncertainty around the severity and duration of COVID-19 has impacted our ability to reliably quantify the impact of the pandemic for the balance of our fiscal year. As a result, we will be withdrawing guidance for our fiscal 2020.
In lieu of that, I would like Chris Toth, President of our Oncology Systems business, to share with you the trends that we are seeing in the market. Chris?"

These are indeed unprecedented times, and the uncertainty from COVID-19 will have an impact for some time on the health care market in capital equipment purchases.As Mike mentioned, our second quarter performance was",982,"Thank you, Dow, and hello, everyone. These are indeed unprecedented times, and the uncertainty from COVID-19 will have an impact for some time on the health care market in capital equipment purchases.
As Mike mentioned, our second quarter performance was ahead of last year until March, when we started to see the impact of COVID-19 in the Americas and EMEA. Based on our current visibility, we believe orders and revenues will be stressed in the second half of our fiscal year due to lockdowns restricting access to sites and delaying vault construction. We believe this will have higher impact in our fiscal third quarter, followed by a sequential improvement in our fiscal fourth quarter, assuming no second wave of infections or lockdowns.
Let me share the overarching trends we see, and how we are positioned as the market leader in radiation oncology and across oncology with an expanding cancer care portfolio. Let's start with the market. While delays in elective procedures, such as mammograms, prostate cancer screenings and radiological exams have slowed new cancer patient treatment starts, treatment itself is not considered an elective procedure. As such, it can only be delayed for a short period of time without significant negative consequences to the patient.
To this end, the criticality of radiation therapy for cancer treatment in the United States has increased since the pandemic began, and this was illustrated in the April 2020 field report published by the advisory group. Of the respondents in the study, 60% saw a marginal increase or no change in radiation oncology patient volumes compared to surgery, where only 10% saw a marginal increase or no change in patient volumes.
As the pandemic stabilizes and cancer screening procedures resume in the U.S. and other markets, we expect to see a catch-up period, during which, new average daily volumes of radiation therapy treatments will increase significantly in the short term.
Moving to customers. Based on our interactions with customers, access to the latest radiation oncology solutions remains a priority and Varian continues to have the best portfolio of solutions in the market. Orders trends from late March have continued through April, and we expect budget limitations, foreign currency headwinds, lockdowns and uncertainty around the pandemic to drive delays in orders.
I will walk you through some of what we are seeing in each geography. In the Americas, during late March, we saw a delay in new orders of approximately $40 million due to COVID-19. North America had the largest portion of these order delays. While order activity resumed in April, it is too early to estimate when it will return to pre-pandemic levels. We are currently monitoring closely the removal of lockdown restrictions as a critical first step, along with capital budget allocations of hospitals. We believe the recovery in Latin America will follow that of North America.
In EMEA, where we've had strong orders growth over the last 12 quarters, customer behavior has varied by country and by the severity of the pandemic. For example, in Germany, activity remains strong. However, in Spain and Italy, we believe that the impact from COVID-19 will affect tenders and new equipment orders.
In India, while demand for our equipment and expansion of cancer care remains strong, the extension of the lockdown has momentarily impacted activity substantially over the past 30 days.
Within Asia Pacific, China's new tender issuances have resumed close to pre-pandemic levels, indicating stabilization. Further in China, where average daily treatment volumes were most affected globally due to radiation oncology being an inpatient procedure, we are seeing on remotely monitored systems, average treatment volumes return to pre-pandemic levels. China recovery is being tracked closely, and we are cautiously optimistic that it is sustainable.
In Japan, post the state of emergency, we have seen some new tenders slow, while many active tenders and customer conversations continue towards order placement.
Turning to backlog conversion, with some geographic variation, customer site readiness and access remains challenging. These logistical challenges will be a moderate headwind and will impact timing of certain installations in the second half of fiscal 2020. Our teams around the globe have navigated exceedingly well to continue installations and trainings where possible, including leveraging remote technologies. For example, in China, of the 12 accelerator installs delayed in our second fiscal quarter, 6 were completed in April. This experience leads us to believe that as the pandemic is contained, these challenges will dissipate.
We believe services are reasonably insulated from COVID-19, driven by our large installed base and long-term service contracts as well as the criticality of radiation oncology treatments. Our service engineers globally continue to access sites to provide critical service to our customers.
Our team's great customer focus is evidenced by an increase in our Net Promoter Score in all major markets.
CTSI technology-enabled services have also positioned us well during this time through our ability to support treatment planning, quality assurance and other services remotely.
In Proton Solutions, due to the high upfront capital outlay, purchase decision delays will likely be more pronounced. We will continue to execute on projects in our backlog and expect services to be stable and grow over time.
Finally, in Interventional Solutions, decreased access to hospitals has impacted treatment volumes. In many cases, ablation procedures for early-stage cancer patients have been deferred, while advanced-stage cancer patients have continued with their local regional treatments, including embolization. We believe these trends will drive near-term pressure across our interventional portfolio.
We are encouraged by the resumption of procedure in the Americas and EMEA geographies.
In summary, there are near-term headwinds that will impact us. However, as the market and innovation leader, in a market which will see total new cancer patients increase from an estimated 18 million in 2020 to 25 million in 2030, we believe we are well positioned for long-term growth and patient care impact.
With that, let's go to Q&A. Operator?"

When we gave you the main update for guidance, we had seen that already in China, so that was in our revenue guidance at that point in time and incremental to that guide, what we saw, as we made very clear at that time, it didn't include the impact of Americas and EMEA pandemic spread, and that's what we saw over the course of March.
Mike, you wanna say anything about margin impact of that?"

I think the other thing to offset that is, there was some unexpected good news in the Asia-Pac geography. It did recover faster than we anticipated when we gave the March 9 update, so that provided us some upside to offset a portion of that $30 million."

So -- and that's probably down 10 to 15 points from where it was in 2009 or '10. So the company is much more resilient, much more diverse.

And the market reception on Ethos, with the 11 orders in the quarter in North America, and the overall market reaction that we've got something that really leapfrogs utilizing artificial intelligence, has been strong. 
So our portfolio is much broader now than back then as well as when we look at our position in the market, we really feel that we've never been in a stronger position competitively."

As it initially occurred, it had to do with hospitals focusing on COVID-19 for patient management, needing as many inpatient beds available as possible. Some indicators we're seeing is that this is not just a U.S. phenomenon. In discussions with the NHS in the U.K., specifically looking at centers in England, the feedback came that they saw the same shift, and we got that input from a surgical oncologist at the NHS, who's in a leadership position. 
From a long-term perspective, I think this continues to move towards the increase in hypofractionation, of which we're best positioned in terms of portfolio in the market and total number of patients, with well over 1 million patients treated in a hypofractionate environment. So I do see elements of it sustainable. Time will tell, but more than anything, it just underscores hypofractionation."

It's a -- we are seeing recovery to China. It is more centrally mandated. It's not so much susceptible to kind of the free market, so to speak. It's -- one of the big differences, though, is that radiation therapy in China is an inpatient treatment. As such, really the short-term impact was much steeper in China.
So we didn't see the U.S., in a sample of the 1,000-ish customers that we looked at, we didn't see a -- we didn't see much of that steep of a fall-off in the U.S. compared to China, because in China, the patients were having to go into a hospital, into a more of a COVID environment. It's more outpatient, whether hospital or nonhospital-based here in the U.S., and a little more COVID-friendly, so to speak. So we didn't see the treatment volumes in the U.S. move down.
As we kind of model it, it's a really good question. I'd say our base case is that it's an environment that's described as recession, with economic slowdown and geopolitical stability, that North America would open by the end of May, that EMEA countries open variably in the next few months, China continues to recover, I think we'll still see some ongoing Southeast Asia, Korea, Japan, locked down in Australia, locked down into the summer. 
So that's kind of our base case. But the reason not to give guidance is there is a reasonable probability of a high-impact case, which is, does it switch from recession to more severe economic outlook? Are there geopolitical instabilities as recovery delayed into '21 and do we see a second surge of the disease? So that would be kind of the high-level macro environment from a scenario planning that we're looking at. Chris, you want to talk a little bit about some of the U.S. market stuff?"

So first on the conversations with customers. As we've been going through with customers, the activity and their planned or proposed purchases, what we've seen is the larger health systems with more spread out networks are continuing their plans. Some community hospitals, who've been more impacted with COVID-19 in their local or regional area, have looked at assessments around timing to proceed forward. We have not heard feedback from them at this point that they have stopped their plans around specific projects, more of a timing conversation. 
And then within the freestanding segment, a little bit of a mix, depending upon geographic position of the institution. As we do look at the mix, I know I've said it a few times, but in North America, greater than 50% of our base is services, which is a really important part of the business, and it keeps strong continuity with each of those sites. So it's still too early to really make a call with respect to North America, and we're continuing to stay close to our customers.
On the second point, regarding APM, really as we've seen APM since the inception and discussion around it, value-based care is where the market has been heading towards. We have the best portfolio for a value-based care environment. We have not seen any impact on purchase decisions from APM. In fact, if you go back to Q1, you saw solid North America orders growth. You also heard our commentary around some of the pushouts in March and related to COVID-19 and really tying to North America. So if anything, we've just seen the consistent -- obviously, as folks have been preparing for APM, and thus, we don't really see it as a big net impact one way or another with respect to a slightly longer delay."

So when we think long-term about the region, we have both the replacement cycle in the developed market, where we have a very robust installed base, and then a lot of growth opportunities throughout the emerging areas. The CTSI acquisition that we made positions us well in those growth opportunities. Those are geographies where you see a smaller or reduced number of clinical personnel to perform treatment planning or other services. And so CTSI can augment nicely and makes for another addition to our portfolio of solutions. 
So in net, we will see some areas which were harder hit by the pandemic that do slow down, but it's a very diverse geographic platform, and we remain positive from a longer-term perspective."

I said 20% to 25%. It was 22%. So 22% U.S. hardware on that number. Anyway, for costs, let me just say, I wanted to reiterate from a liquidity perspective, the financial flexibility that we've built. Mike emphasized that. 
And having said that, we're considering a broad range of options as a precautionary measure, just to make sure we can maintain our flexibility in all scenarios, in both those scenarios that I talked about. So our focus will be on reducing costs without impacting key R&D and productivity programs. We started some of those in March, slowing down hiring, replacement hiring and travel. But we'll have some incremental stuff that we do here soon as well. Just as a reminder, as we think about that, new cancer patients are going from 18 million this year to 25 million in 2030. 
So we're going to prioritize investments that focus on our long-term growth strategy. We'll take some costs out of second half. We'll be thoughtful and disciplined about how we do that with the recovery in place. We will say that our cost mitigation options range on both the OpEx side, operating expense side, as well as our product cost side, as we work through the volumes that the market is going to demand for both workplace and workforce considerations.
So that's as much, as at least at this point, that we're going to talk publicly about."

And those are the -- frankly, those are the ones that we've seen investing in radiation oncology. Our Americas' growth rate, the last 2.5 years, has been very strong, strong mid-single digit, 5%, 6%. And that's been the market that we've seen in the last 3, 4 years. 
The -- we have gone out and touched our backlog to make sure that they're secure. We haven't seen any cancellations in our backlog.

So we are piloting that. I'd say most of our customers -- the thing to remember is our cost of equity is much, much more -- much higher than the cost of capital for a U.S. 501(c)(3) not-for-profit customer, they're looking at a cost of capital of 2% or as ours is, 8-ish and so I don't think we can get down there at that level. And people who are doing this on capital can do it because they have a large amount of consumables or something else that they're flowing through. So I think our business model doesn't -- we will continue to kind of push these pilots and see where they go.

I think the makeup of the inventory is a little different. We have a little increased finished goods and lower raw materials, but that's simply due to some of the factory shutdown and timing of revenues. But the inventory is roughly in line with where we thought. And our accounts payable are in line as well. I think we'll continue to see how this plays out. But as you mentioned, kind of in the beginning of your question, we do have $1.3 billion in liquidity. 
It is a very strong position, from our perspective, to weather the different types of scenarios that we've been modeling out.

Before we get into the details for the quarter, I want to express our gratitude to everyone on the front line fighting this global pandemic and hope everyone is staying safe and feeling well, from our 10,000-plus employees all over the world, we say thank you. 
Furthermore, I want to thank our valuable employees, customers, suppliers and distributors for their hard work, support and partnership during this extraordinary period. Your efforts have ensured that cancer patients, globally, continue to receive vital treatment.
Our fiscal second quarter performance reflects the escalation of COVID-19 and our global response. On this call, we will share our experience in the quarter, our framework for engaging those who rely on us and our priorities and actions in these challenging times.
The pandemic has created some unique operational challenges around delivery of our products and solutions as well as open new opportunities. The impact in the quarter, which was driven by timing delays around installation and acceptance of our products, has varied by region based on the stage of containment and government actions. 
China and South Korea seem to be ahead of other countries in controlling the pandemic and progressing towards normalcy. Conversely, the rest of APAC, Americas and EMEA geographies continue to take actions to stem the outbreak. While we're cautiously encouraged by the recovery in China, we remain sensitive to future uncertainties, including continued spread or recurrence of the pandemic, which could slow progress towards recovery.
Our focus now, as it's always been, is keeping our employees safe, supporting our customers and their patients, ensuring supply chain stability and maintaining business continuity. Our employees are crucial to our mission and as we saw this outbreak shift into a pandemic, we took several actions to ensure their safety and well-being. We instituted work-from-home policies and workplace safety measures and protocols. 
To support our workforce, we implemented additional employee benefits in March that will continue as needed through fiscal 2020. We also implemented new programs aimed at educating our employees on how to operate in this new virtual, physical distancing environment. 
We recognize the challenge for health care resources to manage COVID-19 and non-COVID-19-related Care. Since radiation oncology is not considered an elective procedure, our teams are taking actions on a customer-by-customer basis to ensure they can deliver therapy to patients.
Furthermore, during this pandemic, we have seen, in some clinics across the globe, a shift from surgical intervention to radiation oncology, further underscoring its importance. We are actively deploying remote tools across our training, installation and field service teams to ensure continued access to our products and solutions.
We have secured and stabilized our global supply chain with ongoing efforts in place to continue to monitor and mitigate any new risks that emerge. After being closed for a limited period in the quarter, our essential manufacturing facilities in Beijing and Palo Alto are now fully operational. We continue to ship our products and honor our customer commitments during the factory shutdown.
Finally, we're taking steps to bolster our already strong financial position. In view of the possible continued impact of COVID-19, we're taking prudent actions to manage costs, while continuing to make planned investments that will allow us to execute our growth plan. Mike will discuss these later. I believe our long-term fundamentals remain strong, and our business is well positioned financially and organizationally to weather this environment as well as extend our global leadership in oncology. 
With that, Mike will discuss our financial performance and liquidity and in more details."

Total company revenues were $794 million, up 2% in dollars and 3% in constant currency. Organic revenues declined 1%.
Looking at Oncology Systems. Orders were $773 million, up 1% in dollars and 2% in constant currency, and over the trailing 12 months, 5% in dollars and 6% in constant currency. We ended the quarter with a robust backlog of $3 billion, up 3%. To date, we have not seen any COVID-19 related order cancellations. Revenues were $761 million, up 2% in dollars and 3% in constant currency, driven by strong growth in software and services. On a trailing 12-month basis, revenues grew 10% in dollars and 11% in constant currency.
Now let me share some insights into the timing of the impact of COVID-19 in the second quarter. In the first 2 months, revenues were up approximately 8% year-over-year. As COVID-19 spread globally, our March revenues declined 4% year-over-year, driven by the Americas and EMEA geographies, which, combined, declined 7%, partially offset by improved performance in China and South Korea.
Moving into hardware, software and services. Hardware revenues were down 7%. Our worldwide net installed base of 8,634 units grew 342 units, or 4%. This continued growth in our installed base drives future recurring revenues from upgrades, software and services. Software revenues grew 6%, driven by continued adoption of our software solutions. We remain focused on investing in innovation around efficient clinical workflow, systems integration and treatment planning. Our services revenue grew 11%, and net of acquisitions, services revenue grew 4%.
Let me provide some insights by geography. In the Americas, revenues grew 4%, and was up 4% in our North America region. Orders were $355 million, down 3%. On a trailing 12-month basis, orders grew 4%. In EMEA, revenues declined 2%. Orders were $259 million, up 11%. On a trailing 12-month basis, orders grew 9%. In APAC, revenues grew 4%. Orders were $159 million, down 5%. And on a trailing 12-month basis, orders declined 2%.
The Proton Solutions business posted revenues of $22 million, a decline of 32%, primarily driven by a slower order run rate in prior years, partially offset by continued growth in services revenues, which was up 61%. In the quarter, we were awarded 2 proton orders in our APAC geography. Total company gross margins were $339 million, up 6% and 42.7% of revenues, an increase of 150 basis points, driven by our portfolio mix and the benefits from tariff exclusions and acquisitions, partially offset by factory costs.
Investing in R&D to drive innovation remains core to our growth strategy. In the quarter, we invested $71 million in R&D, up 19%, which is 8.9% of revenues. SG&A expenses were $166 million, up 16%, which is 20.8% of revenues. Excluding the acquisitions of CTSI, Endocare, Alicon and the Boston Scientific Bead portfolio, SG&A was up 5%.
In March, we began to take cost mitigation actions in response to the impact of COVID-19. While we did realize some benefit in the second quarter from slower hiring and travel, we expect the benefit will be more significant in the back half of the year.
Company operating earnings were $103 million, down 14%, which is 12.9% of revenues, down 230 basis points. The lower operating earnings were a direct result of COVID-19 impact on revenues.
GAAP EPS was $0.47, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.85. This quarter, our GAAP operating earnings and GAAP EPS included a $41 million impairment of our loan receivables from California Proton Therapy Center due to their operational and market challenges. It also includes a benefit of $9 million from the reversal of acquisition-related earnouts. Our tax rate was 23% and diluted share count was 91.4 million shares.
Cash flows from operations were $22 million, up $35 million, driven by working capital usage and timing of certain tax payments in both years. Oncology DSO was 110 days, flat from last year.
As part of our regular review of counterparty credit, to date, we have not seen any material decline in customer credit quality or payment terms due to COVID-19.
Let's turn to the balance sheet and liquidity. We ended the quarter in a strong position, with $1.3 billion in available liquidity, including $668 million in cash and equivalents and $661 million available under our $1.2 billion revolving credit facility that matures in 2024.
Our debt balance at the end of the quarter was $521 million, and our net leverage ratio, as defined under our credit agreement, was 0.2x trailing 12 months earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA.
Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. While we plan to continue investing in our growth initiatives, we are taking proactive precautionary actions to enhance our financial flexibility. For example, we have paused share buybacks to preserve liquidity. Additionally, in the back half of the fiscal year, we will be focused on reducing costs, but with the discipline necessary to ensure we continue to prioritize key R&D and productivity programs to support our long-term growth goals.
We believe our current liquidity position, combined with the precautionary actions being taken, leave us well positioned to navigate through this economic environment and continue to advance our long-term strategy.
I will now turn it back over to Dow."

First, let's review our progress on innovating in radiation therapy. We continue to extend our market leadership and expand our addressable market with our innovation, comprehensive portfolio and services offerings.
In our Oncology business, we've gained market share over the trailing 12 months on both in orders and revenues basis. In February, during the peak of the pandemic in China, we received approval for Halcyon 2.0. The approval reaffirms the government's commitment to provide patients access to high-quality radiation therapy technology.
The system incorporates imaging technologies, such as kilovoltage cone-beam CT and iterative reconstructive cone-beam CT, for better soft tissue definition. As order activity in China resumed in March, we received 3 new system orders and 5 system upgrade orders for Halcyon 2.0, and we have a strong second half funnel.
We signed an agreement with National Health Service Trust for 15 TrueBeam machines and 5 Halcyon systems to equip centers across England. We closed the ProBeam 360 system purchase contract in the APAC geography. This was our second award in the quarter in APAC, as highlighted in our first quarter earnings call in January, we were selected by China Medical University Hospital in Taiwan to install a ProBeam 360 system in a single room configuration with the ability to add a second gantry later. University of Alabama at Birmingham Proton Therapy Center treated its first patient on our ProBeam Compact system. We currently have 78 proton rooms, including 39 rooms that are operational across 26 sites globally.
Second, let's turn to our progress in leveraging artificial intelligence, machine learning and cloud solutions. In February, we received FDA 510 clearance for our Ethos therapy solution in the U.S. Customer engagement remains strong, and there continues to be excitement around the technology. In the quarter, we received 15 Ethos orders, including 11 in the Americas, 3 in EMEA and 1 in APAC. We now have 5 centers treating clinically with Ethos.
Treatments at our first clinical site in Herlev Hospital, Denmark, continue to progress well. The center has already delivered 100 adaptive fractions for bladder cancer patients and are seeing impressive treatment margin reductions of up to 50%.
In March, Medische Spectrum Twente Hospital in the Netherlands treated their first 2 patients for prostate cancer. And in Australia, both Icon Cancer Center and Royal North Shore Hospital treated their first patients for prostate cancer and head and neck cancer.
Building on our leadership position in hypofractionation and radiosurgery, demand for HyperArc, our high-definition radiotherapy solution for stereotactic radiosurgery, has continued to grow. 33% of our TrueBeam installed base now has HyperArc capability, and we're receiving exceptional feedback from the clinical community.
Third, let's discuss emerging businesses, geographies and technologies. We received an order for 12 TrueBeam machines, 22 Halcyon systems and 1 VitalBeam from Pharmstandard in Russia. Pharmstandard currently operates diagnostic imaging centers across the country and is expanding into cancer care. We're excited for this first phase of what is a multiple year plan for expansion into cancer treatment.
CTSI was recently awarded a $15 million 5-year contract with Memorial Hermann Health System to provide on-site and remote physics and dosimetry services. Memorial Hermann is the largest not-for-profit health system in Southeast Texas, and consists of 17 hospitals, 8 cancer centers and 3 heart and vascular institutes.
Since the acquisition of CTSI in May of 2019, the annual run rate for treatment plans has doubled to greater than 16,000 per year. Our pipeline in the United States and globally is strong and continues to expand.
While we had some challenges in the quarter, given the current operating environment and logistical barriers created by the pandemic, I'm very pleased with the team's execution during the quarter.
Now moving to guidance. Since our March 9 press release, the severity of the pandemic has expanded globally and has resulted in a dramatic shift in the macroeconomic environment. While our long-term fundamentals remain strong, the uncertainty around the severity and duration of COVID-19 has impacted our ability to reliably quantify the impact of the pandemic for the balance of our fiscal year. As a result, we will be withdrawing guidance for our fiscal 2020.
In lieu of that, I would like Chris Toth, President of our Oncology Systems business, to share with you the trends that we are seeing in the market. Chris?"

These are indeed unprecedented times, and the uncertainty from COVID-19 will have an impact for some time on the health care market in capital equipment purchases.As Mike mentioned, our second quarter performance was",982,"Thank you, Dow, and hello, everyone. These are indeed unprecedented times, and the uncertainty from COVID-19 will have an impact for some time on the health care market in capital equipment purchases.
As Mike mentioned, our second quarter performance was ahead of last year until March, when we started to see the impact of COVID-19 in the Americas and EMEA. Based on our current visibility, we believe orders and revenues will be stressed in the second half of our fiscal year due to lockdowns restricting access to sites and delaying vault construction. We believe this will have higher impact in our fiscal third quarter, followed by a sequential improvement in our fiscal fourth quarter, assuming no second wave of infections or lockdowns.
Let me share the overarching trends we see, and how we are positioned as the market leader in radiation oncology and across oncology with an expanding cancer care portfolio. Let's start with the market. While delays in elective procedures, such as mammograms, prostate cancer screenings and radiological exams have slowed new cancer patient treatment starts, treatment itself is not considered an elective procedure. As such, it can only be delayed for a short period of time without significant negative consequences to the patient.
To this end, the criticality of radiation therapy for cancer treatment in the United States has increased since the pandemic began, and this was illustrated in the April 2020 field report published by the advisory group. Of the respondents in the study, 60% saw a marginal increase or no change in radiation oncology patient volumes compared to surgery, where only 10% saw a marginal increase or no change in patient volumes.
As the pandemic stabilizes and cancer screening procedures resume in the U.S. and other markets, we expect to see a catch-up period, during which, new average daily volumes of radiation therapy treatments will increase significantly in the short term.
Moving to customers. Based on our interactions with customers, access to the latest radiation oncology solutions remains a priority and Varian continues to have the best portfolio of solutions in the market. Orders trends from late March have continued through April, and we expect budget limitations, foreign currency headwinds, lockdowns and uncertainty around the pandemic to drive delays in orders.
I will walk you through some of what we are seeing in each geography. In the Americas, during late March, we saw a delay in new orders of approximately $40 million due to COVID-19. North America had the largest portion of these order delays. While order activity resumed in April, it is too early to estimate when it will return to pre-pandemic levels. We are currently monitoring closely the removal of lockdown restrictions as a critical first step, along with capital budget allocations of hospitals. We believe the recovery in Latin America will follow that of North America.
In EMEA, where we've had strong orders growth over the last 12 quarters, customer behavior has varied by country and by the severity of the pandemic. For example, in Germany, activity remains strong. However, in Spain and Italy, we believe that the impact from COVID-19 will affect tenders and new equipment orders.
In India, while demand for our equipment and expansion of cancer care remains strong, the extension of the lockdown has momentarily impacted activity substantially over the past 30 days.
Within Asia Pacific, China's new tender issuances have resumed close to pre-pandemic levels, indicating stabilization. Further in China, where average daily treatment volumes were most affected globally due to radiation oncology being an inpatient procedure, we are seeing on remotely monitored systems, average treatment volumes return to pre-pandemic levels. China recovery is being tracked closely, and we are cautiously optimistic that it is sustainable.
In Japan, post the state of emergency, we have seen some new tenders slow, while many active tenders and customer conversations continue towards order placement.
Turning to backlog conversion, with some geographic variation, customer site readiness and access remains challenging. These logistical challenges will be a moderate headwind and will impact timing of certain installations in the second half of fiscal 2020. Our teams around the globe have navigated exceedingly well to continue installations and trainings where possible, including leveraging remote technologies. For example, in China, of the 12 accelerator installs delayed in our second fiscal quarter, 6 were completed in April. This experience leads us to believe that as the pandemic is contained, these challenges will dissipate.
We believe services are reasonably insulated from COVID-19, driven by our large installed base and long-term service contracts as well as the criticality of radiation oncology treatments. Our service engineers globally continue to access sites to provide critical service to our customers.
Our team's great customer focus is evidenced by an increase in our Net Promoter Score in all major markets.
CTSI technology-enabled services have also positioned us well during this time through our ability to support treatment planning, quality assurance and other services remotely.
In Proton Solutions, due to the high upfront capital outlay, purchase decision delays will likely be more pronounced. We will continue to execute on projects in our backlog and expect services to be stable and grow over time.
Finally, in Interventional Solutions, decreased access to hospitals has impacted treatment volumes. In many cases, ablation procedures for early-stage cancer patients have been deferred, while advanced-stage cancer patients have continued with their local regional treatments, including embolization. We believe these trends will drive near-term pressure across our interventional portfolio.
We are encouraged by the resumption of procedure in the Americas and EMEA geographies.
In summary, there are near-term headwinds that will impact us. However, as the market and innovation leader, in a market which will see total new cancer patients increase from an estimated 18 million in 2020 to 25 million in 2030, we believe we are well positioned for long-term growth and patient care impact.

And the market reception on Ethos, with the 11 orders in the quarter in North America, and the overall market reaction that we've got something that really leapfrogs utilizing artificial intelligence, has been strong. 
So our portfolio is much broader now than back then as well as when we look at our position in the market, we really feel that we've never been in a stronger position competitively."

As it initially occurred, it had to do with hospitals focusing on COVID-19 for patient management, needing as many inpatient beds available as possible. Some indicators we're seeing is that this is not just a U.S. phenomenon. In discussions with the NHS in the U.K., specifically looking at centers in England, the feedback came that they saw the same shift, and we got that input from a surgical oncologist at the NHS, who's in a leadership position. 
From a long-term perspective, I think this continues to move towards the increase in hypofractionation, of which we're best positioned in terms of portfolio in the market and total number of patients, with well over 1 million patients treated in a hypofractionate environment.

It's a -- we are seeing recovery to China. It is more centrally mandated. It's not so much susceptible to kind of the free market, so to speak. It's -- one of the big differences, though, is that radiation therapy in China is an inpatient treatment. As such, really the short-term impact was much steeper in China.
So we didn't see the U.S., in a sample of the 1,000-ish customers that we looked at, we didn't see a -- we didn't see much of that steep of a fall-off in the U.S. compared to China, because in China, the patients were having to go into a hospital, into a more of a COVID environment. It's more outpatient, whether hospital or nonhospital-based here in the U.S., and a little more COVID-friendly, so to speak. So we didn't see the treatment volumes in the U.S. move down.
As we kind of model it, it's a really good question. I'd say our base case is that it's an environment that's described as recession, with economic slowdown and geopolitical stability, that North America would open by the end of May, that EMEA countries open variably in the next few months, China continues to recover, I think we'll still see some ongoing Southeast Asia, Korea, Japan, locked down in Australia, locked down into the summer. 
So that's kind of our base case. But the reason not to give guidance is there is a reasonable probability of a high-impact case, which is, does it switch from recession to more severe economic outlook? Are there geopolitical instabilities as recovery delayed into '21 and do we see a second surge of the disease?

So first on the conversations with customers. As we've been going through with customers, the activity and their planned or proposed purchases, what we've seen is the larger health systems with more spread out networks are continuing their plans. Some community hospitals, who've been more impacted with COVID-19 in their local or regional area, have looked at assessments around timing to proceed forward. We have not heard feedback from them at this point that they have stopped their plans around specific projects, more of a timing conversation. 
And then within the freestanding segment, a little bit of a mix, depending upon geographic position of the institution. As we do look at the mix, I know I've said it a few times, but in North America, greater than 50% of our base is services, which is a really important part of the business, and it keeps strong continuity with each of those sites. So it's still too early to really make a call with respect to North America, and we're continuing to stay close to our customers.
On the second point, regarding APM, really as we've seen APM since the inception and discussion around it, value-based care is where the market has been heading towards. We have the best portfolio for a value-based care environment. We have not seen any impact on purchase decisions from APM. In fact, if you go back to Q1, you saw solid North America orders growth. You also heard our commentary around some of the pushouts in March and related to COVID-19 and really tying to North America. So if anything, we've just seen the consistent -- obviously, as folks have been preparing for APM, and thus, we don't really see it as a big net impact one way or another with respect to a slightly longer delay."

So when we think long-term about the region, we have both the replacement cycle in the developed market, where we have a very robust installed base, and then a lot of growth opportunities throughout the emerging areas. The CTSI acquisition that we made positions us well in those growth opportunities. Those are geographies where you see a smaller or reduced number of clinical personnel to perform treatment planning or other services. And so CTSI can augment nicely and makes for another addition to our portfolio of solutions. 
So in net, we will see some areas which were harder hit by the pandemic that do slow down, but it's a very diverse geographic platform, and we remain positive from a longer-term perspective."

We still feel very good about the strategy. We think it's -- the overall, strategic direction of the company is right on. We're going to continue to invest in our R&D initiatives. It's a heavy organic growth, with some M&A. We'll continue to look at our Interventional Solutions business, how we can enhance it.

Now the services growth this quarter is 11%. Organically, from an oncology perspective, that's around 4% growth. So that's a little bit more in line with our installed base. We did have some revenue that we took last year, which depresses the growth rate year-on-year. But for all intents and purposes, we're in that mid-single-digit services growth rate year-on-year, and that tracks very well with the installed base, plus the innovations that we've driven on our software. 
And Jeff, as well, the other thing, I know that you took a look at this about 12 to 18 months ago, but it's not to be overlooked that the Proton Services is growing 61%.

I did say that the Americas represents 22% of our -- America product represents 22% of our portfolio now, services is now half. 
So it's not the barometer it was 10 years ago when it was probably 40% of our -- 40% of our number. I'd say, in the U.S., we -- with the services portfolio we have, we're much more resilient than we used to be, growing CTSI business, growing services business. I think that we've seen a general trend in the last 5 years of consolidation and the strong remains strong. 
And those are the -- frankly, those are the ones that we've seen investing in radiation oncology. Our Americas' growth rate, the last 2.5 years, has been very strong, strong mid-single digit, 5%, 6%. And that's been the market that we've seen in the last 3, 4 years. 
The -- we have gone out and touched our backlog to make sure that they're secure. We haven't seen any cancellations in our backlog. As I said, we have seen some pushes, but that's ability to get a vault constructed because of construction shutdowns in the lockdown, or access to vaults. So we've touched hundreds of customers in the process of doing that, maybe even thousands of customers. And I don't know, Chris, you want to add any color there?"

That looks really interesting, where we go in and kind of do an operating cost and capital cost play. 
So we are piloting that. I'd say most of our customers -- the thing to remember is our cost of equity is much, much more -- much higher than the cost of capital for a U.S. 501(c)(3) not-for-profit customer, they're looking at a cost of capital of 2% or as ours is, 8-ish and so I don't think we can get down there at that level. And people who are doing this on capital can do it because they have a large amount of consumables or something else that they're flowing through. So I think our business model doesn't -- we will continue to kind of push these pilots and see where they go. 
We like what we're seeing so far. Oh, by the way, the Memorial Hermann is not that, that's a pure services play, $3 million a year for 5 years. We can do, ""Hurry up, Chris, let's do a whole bunch more of those."" And that's what we want to do."

We haven't seen any COVID-related impact to terms or the quality of our AR. The inventory that we have, we had expected, actually, at the beginning of the year, for our first half inventory to be a little elevated, and it's fairly on our expectations. 
I think the makeup of the inventory is a little different. We have a little increased finished goods and lower raw materials, but that's simply due to some of the factory shutdown and timing of revenues. But the inventory is roughly in line with where we thought. And our accounts payable are in line as well. I think we'll continue to see how this plays out. But as you mentioned, kind of in the beginning of your question, we do have $1.3 billion in liquidity. 
It is a very strong position, from our perspective, to weather the different types of scenarios that we've been modeling out. And in those scenarios, we model out different impacts on cash conversion. And again, we can weather these types of scenarios fairly well. But the cost mitigation actions that we are driving today will just continue to give us the flexibility that we want and the cushion that we want in that flexibility that we built up over time."

This pandemic is a reminder of the importance of health and the relevance of our mission, to help patients fight an insidious disease, cancer. 
Our solid orders growth over the last several years has resulted in a strong product backlog. And currently, our growing installed base has allowed us to build a stable and predictable services revenue stream. And finally, our conservative fiscal philosophy has enabled us to have a very strong balance sheet, all of which position us well as we navigate this unique environment.
Looking forward, we'll continue to invest in our strategic enablers and remain committed to innovating and investing in new technologies to drive towards the ultimate victory, a world without fear of cancer. Thanks for joining us today."
