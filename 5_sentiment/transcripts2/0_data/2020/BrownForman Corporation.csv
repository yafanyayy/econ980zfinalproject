Back in 1870, our founding brand,",1710,"Thank you, Leanne, and good morning, everyone. Before I comment on our year-to-date performance, I do want to test a short moment to recognize what a special time it is to be part of our as we enter our 150th of the year. Back in 1870, our founding brand, Old Forester was first introduced into the U.S. Today, we now have a portfolio of over 40 premium and super premium brands sold around the globe. Since our founding, the company's been agile and resilient in navigating through many challenges, including things like prohibition, world wars and economic recessions, just to name a few historical events. 
Today, we find ourselves a mid- trade wars, resulting in tariffs that are weighing on our industry, geopolitical events that are disrupting many countries around the world and now a virus that is threatening the global economy. While headwinds feel pretty strong right now, Brown-Forman has continued to grow throughout our history and remains a strong, healthy company, supported by the commitment of our long-term shareholders, and importantly, our dedicated and talented employees around the world. 
So now on to the performance of the company. Jane is going to take us through the company's financial results in a moment. But first, I'd like to provide an update on our progress toward our strategic ambitions. As you've heard me discuss on previous calls, we continue to evaluate our performance, both on a geographic and through a portfolio lens. From a geographic perspective, 18 of our 20 largest markets are delivering underlying net sales growth this year, highlighting the strong benefits of our geographic diversification. As a side note, this does not include Travel Retail, which actually is in decline, and we can talk a little bit about later. However, the growth rates of plus 3% underlying net sales year-to-date for the company are below historical norms and they're also below expectations, but we believe going forward, these rates will return to more historical numbers and we will talk about that throughout the rest of this call. 
From a portfolio perspective, our premium and our super-premium brands are well positioned to continue to deliver accelerated top line momentum with leading positions in some of the most attractive and fastest-growing spirits categories, such as whiskey and tequila. In particular, the super premium brands in our portfolio are propelling the company's growth, both in the U.S. and increasingly our international markets, becoming a more powerful growth driver for the company. So to get into a couple of the specific brand performance issues. Look, the Jack Daniel's family brands underlying net sales was up 3% year-to-date, essentially in line with the company's growth rate. We've encountered some near-term challenges for Jack Daniel's Tennessee whiskey, which is the core of the Black Label brand in some of our international markets. Jane is going to talk more about this in her remarks when we get into the market-by-market analysis. But from a strategic perspective, we believe we still have the right strategy in place to deliver long-term profitable growth, and we are investing behind the opportunities. 
The Jack Daniel's RTD business is now over 9 million bases globally and continues to deliver solid growth as the increasingly popular RTD format provides Jack Daniel's consumers with convenience in their drinking We continue also to focus on the versatility of our portfolio through innovation, which has resulted in the creation of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey and Fire over the last 9 years. These 2 brands now contribute 2.4 million cases at very attractive margins and are connecting new consumers to the Jack Daniel's trademark. With the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple, which is off to a strong start in the United States, we are continuing to drive innovation and diversifying the portfolio. And for our international consumers, we're gearing up the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple, and it should begin to appear on retail shelves in the next few months. In Gentleman Jack, which we don't talk about quite as often, one of our super-premium family members is now nearly 700,000 cases and continues to deliver strong international growth. 
We've also made notable progress towards our strategic ambition of increasing the scale of our super-premium portfolio, which would reserve the leader in the super premium bourbon category and has been consistently growing strong double digits since its introduction 20 years ago or more -- 22 years ago. Supported by its excellent track record along with innovations such as Double Oaked, Woodford Reserve has eclipsed 1,000,009 liter cases and is one of the largest growth contributors to the company. Looking ahead, we'll be focusing on the international development of this incredible brand, with incremental resources being invested in a number of key markets around the world. 
As I mentioned a few minutes ago, Old Forester is celebrating its 150th anniversary this year. It continues to present itself as a leader in American whiskey. The brand is steeped in a reputation of quality and innovation with the core expressions and has increasing popularity with its Whiskey Row series. This brand has been registering impressive gains in the bourbon category and is becoming an increasingly meaningful growth driver for the company. Like Brown-Forman, coincidentally, Herradura was also founded in 1870 and is also celebrating its 150th anniversary. Since we purchased the brands over 12 years ago, the super premium tequila category in the U.S. has shown dramatic growth. Herradura's underlying net sales are up 20% year-to-date, and it's grown to over 600,000 cases with nearly half its volume outside of Mexico. However, the unprecedented cost of externally sourced is putting pressure on gross margins. To help mitigate, we've been able to increase prices and accelerate the growth of Ultra, are higher-priced innovation, which is now nearly 20% of the business. We expect cost pressure to continue, however, through fiscal '21 and -- but continuing our strong sales trends. 
Forward-looking, Herradura and are well positioned in the fast-growing super premium and ultra-premium segments. Our Single Malt Scotches portfolio is also performing very well, led by GlenDronach, which has been experienced considerable growth and has a very promising future. In our other emerging brands, things like Slane Irish whiskey, Coopers and newer in their development continue to show potential for very meaningful growth. 
So generally speaking, we feel very confident across the different brands in our portfolio and the many levers of growth that we can pull upon. Geographically, I'm very pleased with the success of our U.S. business this fiscal year date. U.S. is not only our largest market, but it is leading our growth in our 150th year. In the most global spirits market in the world, Brown-Forman takeaway trends are outpaced in TDS, driven largely by our American whiskey and flavored whiskey portfolios as well as our brands. The launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple is also, as I said, going very smoothly and is accelerating growth to our overall plan. However, we recognize we need better performance on Jack Daniel's Tennessee whiskey in the U.S. But it is worth noting that we can outpace TDS with essentially flat to low single-digit performance on our biggest brand. We could not have said that even a few years ago, but our bourbon and tequila brands have gotten big enough that they actually have a meaningful impact on the overall trends in the U.S. business. 
Developed international are having a relatively weak fiscal '20 is the U.K., Australia and Japan are weighing on performance. Where we have made investments in our places such as France and Spain and Germany, our business is healthy, and we've been able to broaden our portfolio of brands. In the U.K., which is the second largest market in the world for Brown-Forman, we're in the final stages of investing in a highly talented team and we'll assume full control over our route to consumer, which, we believe, will reaccelerate growth in this market into the next fiscal year, and expectations are that this will be a strong market for us into the future. 
Our emerging markets are being led by BRIC this year. All 4 are providing strong underlying net sales growth, largely driven by Jack Daniel's Tennessee whiskey. Also worth pointing out, is Southeast Asia is producing strong underlying double-digit growth. For the first time in a while, Asia really has been delivering solid growth this year. However, the markets are likely to suffer in the near-term as a result of the impacts from coronavirus. I am, however, very encouraged that how our brands are resonating with consumers. And looking into the future, I do think that Asia is a part of the world, where we are relatively small, but fast growing, what I do think bodes well for the future opportunity we have there. 
To the coronavirus situation, just briefly, I do want to pause and take a moment, see the health and safety of our employees is paramount like other companies, we've taken steps to limit our employees' risk on limiting travel, canceling certain meetings, providing up-to-date information from the CDC and World Health Organization and ensuring our flexible work policies are being utilized. There's so many unknowns right now, and it's difficult to quantify the financial impact. Jane will try to walk you through our thinking on this difficult topic. 
So in summary, we're expanding the breadth of our premium and super premium portfolio due both geographically and diversifying our revenue base in categories with the strongest momentum. We continue to have confidence in our long-term global growth potential. Currently, our overall growth rate is a bit below historical trends and our expectations. These are largely driven by multiple short-term disruptions coming together in 1 fiscal year. We believe through continuing to execute our long-term growth strategy; focused on portfolio, geography, investments in our people will continue to extend our leadership in premium American whiskey around the world and continue our track record of consistently delivering profitable growth. While the near-term challenges remain, we will weather the storm as we have throughout our 150 years as we relentlessly focus on creating value for our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jane to review more detail in our financial performance that we released this morning."

First, our third quarter and year-to-date results, which is Lawson just said a moment ago, are a bit lower than we had expected at t",2414,"Thank you, Lawson, and good morning, everyone. Over the next several minutes or so, I plan on walking you through 2 items. First, our third quarter and year-to-date results, which is Lawson just said a moment ago, are a bit lower than we had expected at this point in the year, driven largely by our international markets. I'll discuss that in more detail as I go throughout last question this morning. And then secondly, I'm going to review our full year outlook to reflect 2 things: one, a tempered expectations in some of our international markets; and two, the increasingly uncertain global economic outlook, which includes an estimate of the effect the coronavirus may have on our business globally, including our global Travel Retail business in Asia. 
So let's begin with our actual performance. First, our underlying net sales grew 3% in the quarter, lower than we had anticipated, but consistent with the company's first half results. Second, while the impact of retaliatory tariffs, particularly from Europe, will continue to weigh on our margins and profits for the full year. The year-over-year effect began to ease a bit in our quarter 3. In fact, our underlying gross profit grew for the quarter for the first time since the cost of tariffs began effectiveness, up 3%, consistent with our top line. The cycling of tariffs also helped to boost our underlying operating income growth in the quarter, up 5%. Consistent with our third quarter performance, our year-to-date underlying net sales grew 3% on top of 5% growth in the same period last year, but again lower than we had anticipated we would be at this point in our fiscal year. We're breaking down our underlying net sales performance by geography, just there's a bit more color on what Lawson just provided. 
Again, the U.S., our largest market, representing nearly half our sales continue to lead our growth, growing 6% underlying net sales year-to-date, the market's strongest rate of growth registered in 4 years. This growth was fueled by the launch of Jack Daniel's Apple and sustained double-digit underlying net sales go from our premium bourbon brands, notably Woodford Reserve, Old Forester and our tequila brands in aggregate. This strong growth, again, as Lawson said, in the world's most valuable spirits market was also supported by improving takeaway trends, which accelerated over the past quarter and are now growing ahead of our -- the healthy total distilled spirits, mid single-digit growth for the first time in over 18 months. In our emerging markets, we also experienced another quarter of sequential improvement in growth, with underlying net sales up 6% year-to-date on top of last year's double digit gains. The acceleration was less than expected at this point in the year, due in part to route to market disruptions in Africa and macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges which have begun to weigh more heavily on certain markets in the CIS and Latin America. 
One of our largest emerging markets are actually our largest emerging markets, Mexico, where we grew underlying net sales double digits last year is now growing in the low single digits through the third quarter, reflecting a weakening economy. We work to exclude Mexico and the rest of Latin America, CIS and Africa, our emerging markets grew underlying net sales double digits. So despite seeing some pockets of slowdown, strong double-digit underlying net sales growth was delivered across a number of emerging markets, including Turkey, Russia, China and parts of Southeast Asia, led by strong volume growth of Jack Daniel's Tennessee whiskey. Poland also returned to mid-single-digit underlying growth year-to-date, following a very strong quarter for Jack Daniel's Tennessee whiskey. And I thought I'd pause for a moment and discuss our performance in Asia. 
Over the past nearly 2 years, we've been quite pleased with the momentum and increasing contribution we've been experiencing from this part of the world. Specifically, our base in China has been growing underlying net sales at a double-digit rate since fiscal 2018, led in large part by our growing e-premise business where we have been focusing our investment in this market. Our performance through January had essentially not been affected by the coronavirus. So understandably, we do expect a marked slowdown in our fourth quarter in this market in other parts of Asia and have already experienced this in February. Despite this near-term headwind, we remain optimistic about the long-term growth potential for our portfolio throughout Asia. 
Similar to the first half of the year, our developed international markets delivered 2% growth in underlying net sales year-to-date. This growth was led by Germany, France, Spain and Korea, reflecting strong growth of Jack Danier's RTDs, Jack Daniels Tennessee Apple Honey and our super-premium American whiskey portfolio, Woodford Reserve and Gentleman Jack. In the U.K., our largest market outside the U.S., underlying net sales declined in the first 9 months. You may recall that we are navigating through multiple challenges in this market this year, including: first, the upcoming consumer change in May; two, changes in our promotional strategy; and three, softness in the cash and carry channel. So all combined, we experienced what we believe is some short-term disruption. We expect the negative trends in this market to ease as we move into next fiscal year. In addition to some softer planned results in the U.K., the devastating fires in Australia have also contributed to our developed international markets growing less than expected. Our global Travel Retail business which had declined in the first and second quarter of this fiscal year, grew underlying net sales single -- grew net sales high single digits in the third quarter, due in part to easy comparisons to the same quarter a year ago. Despite the improvement in the trend, global Travel Retail remains a drag on our top line, with underlying net sales down 3% year-to-date. While we experienced some improvement in the quarter and had anticipated further improvement in the fourth quarter, resulting from the phasing of certain customer purchases, we now estimate that as a result of the coronavirus, our Travel Retail business for the full year will be down similar to year-to-date performance. Our declined significantly in the third quarter. The decline in business reflects both a reduction in demand due in part to the U.S. tariff impact on Single Malt Scotch whiskey; and secondly, softening prices driven by the increased supply of the market. This business and our other non-branded business, which includes contract bottling and bulk whiskey and bulk wine sales have negatively affected our underlying net sales year-to-date by about 1 percentage point. 
Now looking at our business to our portfolio lens. Consistent with the drivers of our growth through the first half of the year, our premium whiskey brand, Jack Daniel RTD, Jack Daniel's flavors and tequilas remain the key contributors. As Lawson mentioned, Woodford Reserve continued its consistent double-digit underlying net sales gains, fueled by strong consumer momentum in the United States, and is now over 1 million case super premium brand globally. With only 20% of its volume outside of the United States, growing at an even faster rate, we believe the brand has a significant run rate for geographic expansion. Tequila has delivered underlying net sales growth of 10% year-to-date, pulled down modestly by our pricing on the brand in the U.S. Our consumer takeaway trends in the U.S. remain very strong. For Herradura specifically, in addition to the strong takeaway trends in the U.S. and increasing volumes in Mexico, higher prices and a favorable product mix in both the U.S. and Mexico helped to deliver the 20% growth in underlying net sales year-to-date. Jack Daniel's RTDs grew underlying net sales mid-single digits on a year-to-date basis, driven by volumetric gains in Germany and the U.S. and the introduction and launch in France. 
flavors continued its broad-based geographic growth, most notably in the U.S., France, Poland, and Brazil. As it relates to the successful of Jack Daniel's Tennessee, Apple in the U.S., the brand remains on track to deliver about 1 percentage point of growth for the company this year. 
Jack Daniel's Tennessee whiskey underlying net sales were essentially flat as year-to-date growth in emerging markets were offset by declines for the brand in the U.K. and our Travel Retail channel. 
Moving down the P&L to gross margins. Year-to-date gross margins declined 220 basis points year-over-year, reflecting -- resulting in flat underlying gross profit growth through the first 9 months. The reduction in gross margin was driven by the same 2 factors we've highlighted for the last 3 earnings call. First, our input cost reflecting and inflation; and secondly, tariff related costs. As I mentioned earlier, while the impact of tariff-related costs will continue to impact the full year margin, as we begin to cycle prior year periods that were affected by tariffs, the year-over-year effect began to ease in the quarter was a 100 basis point compression for the first 9 months compared to 200 basis points through the first half. We continue to invest behind our brands, with underlying A&P, spending up 3% year-to-date, in line with our top line growth. As we've discussed on previous calls, the effective increase in our spend is much higher given the significant reallocation we took this fiscal year to increase our efficiencies from spend to broad reach media and digital investments, along with our increase in activations and promotion activities. 
On the SG&A front, we remain committed to a disciplined approach to our investment, looking for opportunities to continue to gain efficiency including productivity initiatives that ultimately result in operating leverage. It is important to note, however, that while we continue to leverage prior investments, we've also increased our SG&A in markets where we see opportunity to heighten our focus upon building our brands and accelerating our growth. For example, a key element of this can be seen in our third quarter of this fiscal year as we began to invest in the U.K., opening a new office, and creating informing the team and capabilities that we believe will support building our broader portfolio of brands in our new route to market structure that will begin on May 1. 
In the aggregate, both our reported and underlying operating income declined modestly year-to-date, driven in part by an approximate 3 percentage point drag related to tariff related costs. An effective tax rate of just over 17%, which includes a couple of discrete items year-to-date, drove 4% growth and diluted earnings per share to $1.45. Now turning to my final topic this morning, an update on our fiscal 2020 full year outlook. There are really 2 sets of factors weighing on our outlook, which I will describe in turn that has led us to revising our full year underlying net sales growth from 5% to 7% to low single digits. 
First,  expectations from some international markets, reflecting short-term disruptions and macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds. Specifically, to discuss the U.K., our largest international market is experiencing short-term changes and disruptions, including the transition to our own route to market in just a few months. The economy of our largest emerging markets, Mexico, continues to weakening. The strengthening U.S. dollar has made our brands more expensive to our customers and consumers and certain other emerging markets, such as Latin America and CIS, further exacerbating the uncertainty and unpredictability of demand. And finally, unplanned destocking in Travel Retail. 
Now turning to the second factor weighing on our outlook. The uncertainty and unpredictability, the effect the coronavirus may have on our business globally, including the current most effective areas Travel Retail in Asia, most notably China. Included in our outlook is an estimate of some additional deterioration that is likely if this continues to evolve globally. We continue to expect gross margins will be down around 200 basis points for the year against split between tariff-related costs and higher input costs. Regarding our operating costs for the full year, despite the volatile and uncertain markets, we continue to build our brands, investing behind them roughly in line with our net sales growth. We're expecting SG&A to now be flat for the year, continue to provide leverage to operating income. We've reduced our underlying operating income outlook from a range of 2% to 4% to flat to modestly down, driven by lower top line expectations that I just discussed. We narrowed our earnings per share outlook from $1.75 to $1.85 to -- $1.75 to $1.8 still benefiting from a lower effective tax rate. So lastly, while our expectations for growth this year are now below our initial range, we continue to believe there is a long runway of opportunities ahead for our brand. Our teams are experienced, as Lawson said, weathering these uncertain times and are focused on accelerating our business back towards our consistent historic rates of growth. However, we are cognizant of the current market dynamics that may limit our near term improvement. In the meantime, we believe our business remains very attractive with nice margins resulting from the efficiency and historic consistency in our revenue growth, return on invested capital and ample free cash flow. 
Over many years, we have followed a systematic approach to our capital allocation that has served us well. First, reinvesting back into the business to meet future demand; second, growing our cash dividends; and in the absence of meaningful M&A opportunities, we return excess cash to shareholders through special dividends and share repurchases. Currently, we continue to invest behind the business and expanding our production capabilities, increasing whiskey inventories, meet future growth expectations, investing in technology to not only improve our efficiencies throughout all of our functions of the company, but also to drive growth based analytic insights, such as our revenue management platform. We continue to return cash to shareholders as we always have, thoughtfully, disciplined and consistently, including increasing cash dividend for this calendar year by 5%. While we have been navigating near-term challenges, including tariffs and the increasingly uncertain and volatile world, we continue to manage our business as we always have for the long term. 
Strong support from our shareholders, as Lawson also said, including the Brown family enables this long horizon, which is essential to the company's and aged spirits. We believe our portfolio of premium super premium whiskey and tequila brands position us well to continue creating value for all of our shareholders. 
And with that, this concludes our prepared remarks. Dorothy, please open the call for questions."

Look, I mean, I think obviously we're not giving out guidance yet for next fiscal year. I think as you look at our business in general, we feel pretty confident on the U.S. business these days as it is sort of above TDS, and I would expect that to continue. As I said in my prepared remarks, even with Jack, it's sort of subdued rates, we're able to grow above the TDS number. So -- and believe me, there are a lot of plans, and there's a lot of action, a lot of activity going around to try to improve the growth rates on Tennessee whiskey. If that happens, or even I would call it, more confident in the U.S. market. So that feels pretty good. The developed international side of things is subdued, but it largely, as Jane said, that's largely the U.K., there are other markets that are not kicking on all cylinders these days. But I think we'll get that category of markets that developed international back into what its traditional range would be mid- to even a little bit better than mid single-digit growth. But I'll take mid-single digits out of that part of the world. And emerging is a volatile one. It's always been the volatile one. It's been growing at a rate above our company average now for a number of years. It has slowed this year, as we said, largely because of Mexico. Asia is a wild card in this. And I don't know how to tell you -- we're trying to think about what is the growth rate for that part of the world is going to be, because right now it's solid. But we're going to be a little more subdued. And I think at the end of the day, we're going to be -- we use the word around here agility a lot. You're going to have to be agile next year because while things do have a tough outlook, the comps are going to be a little bit easier next year, and I can see some bounce backs and some other things that make it -- they turn it into a pretty good year. So not directly answering your question is, we have not provided that guidance yet, but I think we generally feel pretty good on the top line, that thing will return to what I call a more normalized growth rate."

With that being said, we had -- as we've talked about the Travel Retail business before, it's quite lumpy and volatile anyhow from quarter-to-quarter and when people purchase. And so we had the strong growth at the beginning of last year, first half and network cycle, and again, some softer growth in the second half with Travel Retail. We still do expect some improvement, but that will be offset by this coronavirus on our business and the global just people less traveling internationally.

We just -- was more precise thing, cash and carry  increased promotional strategy, you're right. It was planned. And it's something that we're doing as we get ready to own our own distribution come May. And that's why when we look ahead to this market and the optimism we have going forward versus what we have had this year, we will be in control of a lot of our decisions of working with the grocers and determining the pricing strategies. And right now that doesn't always happen. And so that's important for us as we go forward. Just a reminder why we made this decision to go on our own around the consumer in the U.K. This relationship is probably served us quite well. It started in 2002, serve both companies quite well, but we had very limited portfolio at that time. I don't know, 10, 12, 15 brands. And now combined, we have over 100 brands. So you can only imagine the lack of attention, focused prioritization, understanding the consumer and focus on our own portfolio. And so we haven't transitioned yet. That, again, is May 1. But we believe the focus, the prioritization, the understanding the consumers, the more direct contact with our customers, if you will, will allow us to not only accelerate our business there, but get our rest of our portfolio growing quite nicely."

So on the pricing of the promotional question you asked a little bit earlier, I mean, the -- totally honest, the amount of promotion in the U.K. market got too big. And so we're trying to reduce that a little bit and get some pricing up, and we're working on that slowly. It's not a -- you have to slowly with the European retail world, but we're paying the price necessarily. We're just seeing short-term disruption with some of our customers as we do a little bit less promoting. We do think in the long run, it's the smart thing to do.

But let me just pause for a minute, we want to be super clear here with what we have in our forecast. So again, if you looked at what we did, we took our overall forecast down, as you saw, we reduced our underlying forecast with 2 factors. First, it was the tempering of the growth and contribution from some of our international markets, again reflecting some short-term disruptions as well these macro and economic and geopolitical challenges. So when we look at our base business, but we would estimate now that our base business is doing is probably growing in the 3.5% to 4.5% range. It is, therefore, a couple of points less than what our expectations were just 3 months ago. But the second factor that we built into our forecast, and this is what you're asking specifically about Vivian, that led to a reduction in our top line outlook, and again not surprising, is this unpredictability and uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus and what it may have on our business globally. So we've estimated at this point, there's about a point drag including those markets that are currently affected. So to your point, directly from the Asian markets, including China and other parts of Asia, Travel Retail and we haven't Italy in there. So collectively, that's about 8% of our business. And as I said earlier, yes, we've already seen areas -- many of these areas already affected in results. But that being said, we also have, in that 1%, some additional downside impact. And we don't know, none of us knows that's going to be enough, too much we're learning daily as this situation and So we're really only looking at our fourth quarter. We haven't had to estimating downstream, secondary effects on anything beyond the demand we see in an expectation for perhaps it some other markets. We don't know about the economy and the consumer confidence and sentiment and how they may linger into our first quarter and summer months. So we'll obviously come back in June, we will guidance on that for next year. So as I know I went into a little bit more detail, but I thought it was important to phrase it for you or put it in perspective in terms of where we are in the -- why we did reduce our guidance into the 2 buckets."

Some of that -- I mean, as most companies do, we took a hard look at our competitors are doing and where we are relative to that and try to pick our spots, and we've done that. In the last year, we had gotten above and the competitors were going down, and that our volumes have been. So at the beginning of this fiscal year, we got a little more aggressive, and our volumes have reacted. Our volume growth this year is as good as it's been, I don't know how many years as -- I mean, it's a number of years.

That it's tiny. I mean, it's almost -- truly on what we've done so far year-to-date on the impact on Black Label, it's imperceptible. I mean, literally a few thousand cases kind of thing, but it's not the reason that the Tennessee whiskey brand in the U.S. has slowed down like Another piece of it is on a volumetric basis, Black Label is up nearly 3% at the same time that we've released Apple. So I think that also gives us some confidence that just the cannibalization is not there."

Back in 1870, our founding brand,",1710,"Thank you, Leanne, and good morning, everyone. Before I comment on our year-to-date performance, I do want to test a short moment to recognize what a special time it is to be part of our as we enter our 150th of the year. Back in 1870, our founding brand, Old Forester was first introduced into the U.S. Today, we now have a portfolio of over 40 premium and super premium brands sold around the globe. Since our founding, the company's been agile and resilient in navigating through many challenges, including things like prohibition, world wars and economic recessions, just to name a few historical events. 
Today, we find ourselves a mid- trade wars, resulting in tariffs that are weighing on our industry, geopolitical events that are disrupting many countries around the world and now a virus that is threatening the global economy. While headwinds feel pretty strong right now, Brown-Forman has continued to grow throughout our history and remains a strong, healthy company, supported by the commitment of our long-term shareholders, and importantly, our dedicated and talented employees around the world. 
So now on to the performance of the company. Jane is going to take us through the company's financial results in a moment. But first, I'd like to provide an update on our progress toward our strategic ambitions. As you've heard me discuss on previous calls, we continue to evaluate our performance, both on a geographic and through a portfolio lens. From a geographic perspective, 18 of our 20 largest markets are delivering underlying net sales growth this year, highlighting the strong benefits of our geographic diversification. As a side note, this does not include Travel Retail, which actually is in decline, and we can talk a little bit about later. However, the growth rates of plus 3% underlying net sales year-to-date for the company are below historical norms and they're also below expectations, but we believe going forward, these rates will return to more historical numbers and we will talk about that throughout the rest of this call. 
From a portfolio perspective, our premium and our super-premium brands are well positioned to continue to deliver accelerated top line momentum with leading positions in some of the most attractive and fastest-growing spirits categories, such as whiskey and tequila. In particular, the super premium brands in our portfolio are propelling the company's growth, both in the U.S. and increasingly our international markets, becoming a more powerful growth driver for the company. So to get into a couple of the specific brand performance issues. Look, the Jack Daniel's family brands underlying net sales was up 3% year-to-date, essentially in line with the company's growth rate. We've encountered some near-term challenges for Jack Daniel's Tennessee whiskey, which is the core of the Black Label brand in some of our international markets. Jane is going to talk more about this in her remarks when we get into the market-by-market analysis. But from a strategic perspective, we believe we still have the right strategy in place to deliver long-term profitable growth, and we are investing behind the opportunities. 
The Jack Daniel's RTD business is now over 9 million bases globally and continues to deliver solid growth as the increasingly popular RTD format provides Jack Daniel's consumers with convenience in their drinking We continue also to focus on the versatility of our portfolio through innovation, which has resulted in the creation of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey and Fire over the last 9 years. These 2 brands now contribute 2.4 million cases at very attractive margins and are connecting new consumers to the Jack Daniel's trademark. With the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple, which is off to a strong start in the United States, we are continuing to drive innovation and diversifying the portfolio. And for our international consumers, we're gearing up the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple, and it should begin to appear on retail shelves in the next few months. In Gentleman Jack, which we don't talk about quite as often, one of our super-premium family members is now nearly 700,000 cases and continues to deliver strong international growth. 
We've also made notable progress towards our strategic ambition of increasing the scale of our super-premium portfolio, which would reserve the leader in the super premium bourbon category and has been consistently growing strong double digits since its introduction 20 years ago or more -- 22 years ago. Supported by its excellent track record along with innovations such as Double Oaked, Woodford Reserve has eclipsed 1,000,009 liter cases and is one of the largest growth contributors to the company. Looking ahead, we'll be focusing on the international development of this incredible brand, with incremental resources being invested in a number of key markets around the world. 
As I mentioned a few minutes ago, Old Forester is celebrating its 150th anniversary this year. It continues to present itself as a leader in American whiskey. The brand is steeped in a reputation of quality and innovation with the core expressions and has increasing popularity with its Whiskey Row series. This brand has been registering impressive gains in the bourbon category and is becoming an increasingly meaningful growth driver for the company. Like Brown-Forman, coincidentally, Herradura was also founded in 1870 and is also celebrating its 150th anniversary. Since we purchased the brands over 12 years ago, the super premium tequila category in the U.S. has shown dramatic growth. Herradura's underlying net sales are up 20% year-to-date, and it's grown to over 600,000 cases with nearly half its volume outside of Mexico. However, the unprecedented cost of externally sourced is putting pressure on gross margins. To help mitigate, we've been able to increase prices and accelerate the growth of Ultra, are higher-priced innovation, which is now nearly 20% of the business. We expect cost pressure to continue, however, through fiscal '21 and -- but continuing our strong sales trends. 
Forward-looking, Herradura and are well positioned in the fast-growing super premium and ultra-premium segments. Our Single Malt Scotches portfolio is also performing very well, led by GlenDronach, which has been experienced considerable growth and has a very promising future. In our other emerging brands, things like Slane Irish whiskey, Coopers and newer in their development continue to show potential for very meaningful growth. 
So generally speaking, we feel very confident across the different brands in our portfolio and the many levers of growth that we can pull upon. Geographically, I'm very pleased with the success of our U.S. business this fiscal year date. U.S. is not only our largest market, but it is leading our growth in our 150th year. In the most global spirits market in the world, Brown-Forman takeaway trends are outpaced in TDS, driven largely by our American whiskey and flavored whiskey portfolios as well as our brands. The launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple is also, as I said, going very smoothly and is accelerating growth to our overall plan. However, we recognize we need better performance on Jack Daniel's Tennessee whiskey in the U.S. But it is worth noting that we can outpace TDS with essentially flat to low single-digit performance on our biggest brand. We could not have said that even a few years ago, but our bourbon and tequila brands have gotten big enough that they actually have a meaningful impact on the overall trends in the U.S. business. 
Developed international are having a relatively weak fiscal '20 is the U.K., Australia and Japan are weighing on performance. Where we have made investments in our places such as France and Spain and Germany, our business is healthy, and we've been able to broaden our portfolio of brands. In the U.K., which is the second largest market in the world for Brown-Forman, we're in the final stages of investing in a highly talented team and we'll assume full control over our route to consumer, which, we believe, will reaccelerate growth in this market into the next fiscal year, and expectations are that this will be a strong market for us into the future. 
Our emerging markets are being led by BRIC this year. All 4 are providing strong underlying net sales growth, largely driven by Jack Daniel's Tennessee whiskey. Also worth pointing out, is Southeast Asia is producing strong underlying double-digit growth. For the first time in a while, Asia really has been delivering solid growth this year. However, the markets are likely to suffer in the near-term as a result of the impacts from coronavirus. I am, however, very encouraged that how our brands are resonating with consumers. And looking into the future, I do think that Asia is a part of the world, where we are relatively small, but fast growing, what I do think bodes well for the future opportunity we have there. 
To the coronavirus situation, just briefly, I do want to pause and take a moment, see the health and safety of our employees is paramount like other companies, we've taken steps to limit our employees' risk on limiting travel, canceling certain meetings, providing up-to-date information from the CDC and World Health Organization and ensuring our flexible work policies are being utilized. There's so many unknowns right now, and it's difficult to quantify the financial impact. Jane will try to walk you through our thinking on this difficult topic. 
So in summary, we're expanding the breadth of our premium and super premium portfolio due both geographically and diversifying our revenue base in categories with the strongest momentum. We continue to have confidence in our long-term global growth potential. Currently, our overall growth rate is a bit below historical trends and our expectations. These are largely driven by multiple short-term disruptions coming together in 1 fiscal year. We believe through continuing to execute our long-term growth strategy; focused on portfolio, geography, investments in our people will continue to extend our leadership in premium American whiskey around the world and continue our track record of consistently delivering profitable growth. While the near-term challenges remain, we will weather the storm as we have throughout our 150 years as we relentlessly focus on creating value for our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jane to review more detail in our financial performance that we released this morning."

First, our third quarter and year-to-date results, which is Lawson just said a moment ago, are a bit lower than we had expected at t",2414,"Thank you, Lawson, and good morning, everyone. Over the next several minutes or so, I plan on walking you through 2 items. First, our third quarter and year-to-date results, which is Lawson just said a moment ago, are a bit lower than we had expected at this point in the year, driven largely by our international markets. I'll discuss that in more detail as I go throughout last question this morning. And then secondly, I'm going to review our full year outlook to reflect 2 things: one, a tempered expectations in some of our international markets; and two, the increasingly uncertain global economic outlook, which includes an estimate of the effect the coronavirus may have on our business globally, including our global Travel Retail business in Asia. 
So let's begin with our actual performance. First, our underlying net sales grew 3% in the quarter, lower than we had anticipated, but consistent with the company's first half results. Second, while the impact of retaliatory tariffs, particularly from Europe, will continue to weigh on our margins and profits for the full year. The year-over-year effect began to ease a bit in our quarter 3. In fact, our underlying gross profit grew for the quarter for the first time since the cost of tariffs began effectiveness, up 3%, consistent with our top line. The cycling of tariffs also helped to boost our underlying operating income growth in the quarter, up 5%. Consistent with our third quarter performance, our year-to-date underlying net sales grew 3% on top of 5% growth in the same period last year, but again lower than we had anticipated we would be at this point in our fiscal year. We're breaking down our underlying net sales performance by geography, just there's a bit more color on what Lawson just provided. 
Again, the U.S., our largest market, representing nearly half our sales continue to lead our growth, growing 6% underlying net sales year-to-date, the market's strongest rate of growth registered in 4 years. This growth was fueled by the launch of Jack Daniel's Apple and sustained double-digit underlying net sales go from our premium bourbon brands, notably Woodford Reserve, Old Forester and our tequila brands in aggregate. This strong growth, again, as Lawson said, in the world's most valuable spirits market was also supported by improving takeaway trends, which accelerated over the past quarter and are now growing ahead of our -- the healthy total distilled spirits, mid single-digit growth for the first time in over 18 months. In our emerging markets, we also experienced another quarter of sequential improvement in growth, with underlying net sales up 6% year-to-date on top of last year's double digit gains. The acceleration was less than expected at this point in the year, due in part to route to market disruptions in Africa and macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges which have begun to weigh more heavily on certain markets in the CIS and Latin America. 
One of our largest emerging markets are actually our largest emerging markets, Mexico, where we grew underlying net sales double digits last year is now growing in the low single digits through the third quarter, reflecting a weakening economy. We work to exclude Mexico and the rest of Latin America, CIS and Africa, our emerging markets grew underlying net sales double digits. So despite seeing some pockets of slowdown, strong double-digit underlying net sales growth was delivered across a number of emerging markets, including Turkey, Russia, China and parts of Southeast Asia, led by strong volume growth of Jack Daniel's Tennessee whiskey. Poland also returned to mid-single-digit underlying growth year-to-date, following a very strong quarter for Jack Daniel's Tennessee whiskey. And I thought I'd pause for a moment and discuss our performance in Asia. 
Over the past nearly 2 years, we've been quite pleased with the momentum and increasing contribution we've been experiencing from this part of the world. Specifically, our base in China has been growing underlying net sales at a double-digit rate since fiscal 2018, led in large part by our growing e-premise business where we have been focusing our investment in this market. Our performance through January had essentially not been affected by the coronavirus. So understandably, we do expect a marked slowdown in our fourth quarter in this market in other parts of Asia and have already experienced this in February. Despite this near-term headwind, we remain optimistic about the long-term growth potential for our portfolio throughout Asia. 
Similar to the first half of the year, our developed international markets delivered 2% growth in underlying net sales year-to-date. This growth was led by Germany, France, Spain and Korea, reflecting strong growth of Jack Danier's RTDs, Jack Daniels Tennessee Apple Honey and our super-premium American whiskey portfolio, Woodford Reserve and Gentleman Jack. In the U.K., our largest market outside the U.S., underlying net sales declined in the first 9 months. You may recall that we are navigating through multiple challenges in this market this year, including: first, the upcoming consumer change in May; two, changes in our promotional strategy; and three, softness in the cash and carry channel. So all combined, we experienced what we believe is some short-term disruption. We expect the negative trends in this market to ease as we move into next fiscal year. In addition to some softer planned results in the U.K., the devastating fires in Australia have also contributed to our developed international markets growing less than expected. Our global Travel Retail business which had declined in the first and second quarter of this fiscal year, grew underlying net sales single -- grew net sales high single digits in the third quarter, due in part to easy comparisons to the same quarter a year ago. Despite the improvement in the trend, global Travel Retail remains a drag on our top line, with underlying net sales down 3% year-to-date. While we experienced some improvement in the quarter and had anticipated further improvement in the fourth quarter, resulting from the phasing of certain customer purchases, we now estimate that as a result of the coronavirus, our Travel Retail business for the full year will be down similar to year-to-date performance. Our declined significantly in the third quarter. The decline in business reflects both a reduction in demand due in part to the U.S. tariff impact on Single Malt Scotch whiskey; and secondly, softening prices driven by the increased supply of the market. This business and our other non-branded business, which includes contract bottling and bulk whiskey and bulk wine sales have negatively affected our underlying net sales year-to-date by about 1 percentage point. 
Now looking at our business to our portfolio lens. Consistent with the drivers of our growth through the first half of the year, our premium whiskey brand, Jack Daniel RTD, Jack Daniel's flavors and tequilas remain the key contributors. As Lawson mentioned, Woodford Reserve continued its consistent double-digit underlying net sales gains, fueled by strong consumer momentum in the United States, and is now over 1 million case super premium brand globally. With only 20% of its volume outside of the United States, growing at an even faster rate, we believe the brand has a significant run rate for geographic expansion. Tequila has delivered underlying net sales growth of 10% year-to-date, pulled down modestly by our pricing on the brand in the U.S. Our consumer takeaway trends in the U.S. remain very strong. For Herradura specifically, in addition to the strong takeaway trends in the U.S. and increasing volumes in Mexico, higher prices and a favorable product mix in both the U.S. and Mexico helped to deliver the 20% growth in underlying net sales year-to-date. Jack Daniel's RTDs grew underlying net sales mid-single digits on a year-to-date basis, driven by volumetric gains in Germany and the U.S. and the introduction and launch in France. 
flavors continued its broad-based geographic growth, most notably in the U.S., France, Poland, and Brazil. As it relates to the successful of Jack Daniel's Tennessee, Apple in the U.S., the brand remains on track to deliver about 1 percentage point of growth for the company this year. 
Jack Daniel's Tennessee whiskey underlying net sales were essentially flat as year-to-date growth in emerging markets were offset by declines for the brand in the U.K. and our Travel Retail channel. 
Moving down the P&L to gross margins. Year-to-date gross margins declined 220 basis points year-over-year, reflecting -- resulting in flat underlying gross profit growth through the first 9 months. The reduction in gross margin was driven by the same 2 factors we've highlighted for the last 3 earnings call. First, our input cost reflecting and inflation; and secondly, tariff related costs. As I mentioned earlier, while the impact of tariff-related costs will continue to impact the full year margin, as we begin to cycle prior year periods that were affected by tariffs, the year-over-year effect began to ease in the quarter was a 100 basis point compression for the first 9 months compared to 200 basis points through the first half. We continue to invest behind our brands, with underlying A&P, spending up 3% year-to-date, in line with our top line growth. As we've discussed on previous calls, the effective increase in our spend is much higher given the significant reallocation we took this fiscal year to increase our efficiencies from spend to broad reach media and digital investments, along with our increase in activations and promotion activities. 
On the SG&A front, we remain committed to a disciplined approach to our investment, looking for opportunities to continue to gain efficiency including productivity initiatives that ultimately result in operating leverage. It is important to note, however, that while we continue to leverage prior investments, we've also increased our SG&A in markets where we see opportunity to heighten our focus upon building our brands and accelerating our growth. For example, a key element of this can be seen in our third quarter of this fiscal year as we began to invest in the U.K., opening a new office, and creating informing the team and capabilities that we believe will support building our broader portfolio of brands in our new route to market structure that will begin on May 1. 
In the aggregate, both our reported and underlying operating income declined modestly year-to-date, driven in part by an approximate 3 percentage point drag related to tariff related costs. An effective tax rate of just over 17%, which includes a couple of discrete items year-to-date, drove 4% growth and diluted earnings per share to $1.45. Now turning to my final topic this morning, an update on our fiscal 2020 full year outlook. There are really 2 sets of factors weighing on our outlook, which I will describe in turn that has led us to revising our full year underlying net sales growth from 5% to 7% to low single digits. 
First,  expectations from some international markets, reflecting short-term disruptions and macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds. Specifically, to discuss the U.K., our largest international market is experiencing short-term changes and disruptions, including the transition to our own route to market in just a few months. The economy of our largest emerging markets, Mexico, continues to weakening. The strengthening U.S. dollar has made our brands more expensive to our customers and consumers and certain other emerging markets, such as Latin America and CIS, further exacerbating the uncertainty and unpredictability of demand. And finally, unplanned destocking in Travel Retail. 
Now turning to the second factor weighing on our outlook. The uncertainty and unpredictability, the effect the coronavirus may have on our business globally, including the current most effective areas Travel Retail in Asia, most notably China. Included in our outlook is an estimate of some additional deterioration that is likely if this continues to evolve globally. We continue to expect gross margins will be down around 200 basis points for the year against split between tariff-related costs and higher input costs. Regarding our operating costs for the full year, despite the volatile and uncertain markets, we continue to build our brands, investing behind them roughly in line with our net sales growth. We're expecting SG&A to now be flat for the year, continue to provide leverage to operating income. We've reduced our underlying operating income outlook from a range of 2% to 4% to flat to modestly down, driven by lower top line expectations that I just discussed. We narrowed our earnings per share outlook from $1.75 to $1.85 to -- $1.75 to $1.8 still benefiting from a lower effective tax rate. So lastly, while our expectations for growth this year are now below our initial range, we continue to believe there is a long runway of opportunities ahead for our brand. Our teams are experienced, as Lawson said, weathering these uncertain times and are focused on accelerating our business back towards our consistent historic rates of growth. However, we are cognizant of the current market dynamics that may limit our near term improvement. In the meantime, we believe our business remains very attractive with nice margins resulting from the efficiency and historic consistency in our revenue growth, return on invested capital and ample free cash flow. 
Over many years, we have followed a systematic approach to our capital allocation that has served us well. First, reinvesting back into the business to meet future demand; second, growing our cash dividends; and in the absence of meaningful M&A opportunities, we return excess cash to shareholders through special dividends and share repurchases. Currently, we continue to invest behind the business and expanding our production capabilities, increasing whiskey inventories, meet future growth expectations, investing in technology to not only improve our efficiencies throughout all of our functions of the company, but also to drive growth based analytic insights, such as our revenue management platform. We continue to return cash to shareholders as we always have, thoughtfully, disciplined and consistently, including increasing cash dividend for this calendar year by 5%. While we have been navigating near-term challenges, including tariffs and the increasingly uncertain and volatile world, we continue to manage our business as we always have for the long term. 
Strong support from our shareholders, as Lawson also said, including the Brown family enables this long horizon, which is essential to the company's and aged spirits. We believe our portfolio of premium super premium whiskey and tequila brands position us well to continue creating value for all of our shareholders. 
And with that, this concludes our prepared remarks. Dorothy, please open the call for questions."

Look, I mean, I think obviously we're not giving out guidance yet for next fiscal year. I think as you look at our business in general, we feel pretty confident on the U.S. business these days as it is sort of above TDS, and I would expect that to continue. As I said in my prepared remarks, even with Jack, it's sort of subdued rates, we're able to grow above the TDS number. So -- and believe me, there are a lot of plans, and there's a lot of action, a lot of activity going around to try to improve the growth rates on Tennessee whiskey. If that happens, or even I would call it, more confident in the U.S. market. So that feels pretty good. The developed international side of things is subdued, but it largely, as Jane said, that's largely the U.K., there are other markets that are not kicking on all cylinders these days. But I think we'll get that category of markets that developed international back into what its traditional range would be mid- to even a little bit better than mid single-digit growth. But I'll take mid-single digits out of that part of the world. And emerging is a volatile one. It's always been the volatile one. It's been growing at a rate above our company average now for a number of years. It has slowed this year, as we said, largely because of Mexico. Asia is a wild card in this. And I don't know how to tell you -- we're trying to think about what is the growth rate for that part of the world is going to be, because right now it's solid. But we're going to be a little more subdued. And I think at the end of the day, we're going to be -- we use the word around here agility a lot. You're going to have to be agile next year because while things do have a tough outlook, the comps are going to be a little bit easier next year, and I can see some bounce backs and some other things that make it -- they turn it into a pretty good year. So not directly answering your question is, we have not provided that guidance yet, but I think we generally feel pretty good on the top line, that thing will return to what I call a more normalized growth rate."

And it's something that we're doing as we get ready to own our own distribution come May. And that's why when we look ahead to this market and the optimism we have going forward versus what we have had this year, we will be in control of a lot of our decisions of working with the grocers and determining the pricing strategies. And right now that doesn't always happen. And so that's important for us as we go forward. Just a reminder why we made this decision to go on our own around the consumer in the U.K. This relationship is probably served us quite well. It started in 2002, serve both companies quite well, but we had very limited portfolio at that time. I don't know, 10, 12, 15 brands. And now combined, we have over 100 brands. So you can only imagine the lack of attention, focused prioritization, understanding the consumer and focus on our own portfolio. And so we haven't transitioned yet. That, again, is May 1. But we believe the focus, the prioritization, the understanding the consumers, the more direct contact with our customers, if you will, will allow us to not only accelerate our business there, but get our rest of our portfolio growing quite nicely."

So on the pricing of the promotional question you asked a little bit earlier, I mean, the -- totally honest, the amount of promotion in the U.K. market got too big. And so we're trying to reduce that a little bit and get some pricing up, and we're working on that slowly. It's not a -- you have to slowly with the European retail world, but we're paying the price necessarily. We're just seeing short-term disruption with some of our customers as we do a little bit less promoting. We do think in the long run, it's the smart thing to do.

But let me just pause for a minute, we want to be super clear here with what we have in our forecast. So again, if you looked at what we did, we took our overall forecast down, as you saw, we reduced our underlying forecast with 2 factors. First, it was the tempering of the growth and contribution from some of our international markets, again reflecting some short-term disruptions as well these macro and economic and geopolitical challenges. So when we look at our base business, but we would estimate now that our base business is doing is probably growing in the 3.5% to 4.5% range. It is, therefore, a couple of points less than what our expectations were just 3 months ago. But the second factor that we built into our forecast, and this is what you're asking specifically about Vivian, that led to a reduction in our top line outlook, and again not surprising, is this unpredictability and uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus and what it may have on our business globally. So we've estimated at this point, there's about a point drag including those markets that are currently affected. So to your point, directly from the Asian markets, including China and other parts of Asia, Travel Retail and we haven't Italy in there. So collectively, that's about 8% of our business. And as I said earlier, yes, we've already seen areas -- many of these areas already affected in results. But that being said, we also have, in that 1%, some additional downside impact. And we don't know, none of us knows that's going to be enough, too much we're learning daily as this situation and So we're really only looking at our fourth quarter. We haven't had to estimating downstream, secondary effects on anything beyond the demand we see in an expectation for perhaps it some other markets. We don't know about the economy and the consumer confidence and sentiment and how they may linger into our first quarter and summer months. So we'll obviously come back in June, we will guidance on that for next year. So as I know I went into a little bit more detail, but I thought it was important to phrase it for you or put it in perspective in terms of where we are in the -- why we did reduce our guidance into the 2 buckets."

Some of that -- I mean, as most companies do, we took a hard look at our competitors are doing and where we are relative to that and try to pick our spots, and we've done that. In the last year, we had gotten above and the competitors were going down, and that our volumes have been. So at the beginning of this fiscal year, we got a little more aggressive, and our volumes have reacted. Our volume growth this year is as good as it's been, I don't know how many years as -- I mean, it's a number of years. So I think if we -- that's a good thing, and that means consumers are still taking the product away and we feel pretty good about that.

First of all, we look at it about 16 different ways, trying to figure out how -- what is actually happening out there because to be honest, we were a little more concerned about the cannibalization of Honey and Fire necessarily than we were on Black Label. But when we've done the work, and it's the same thing that we've said sort of on prior -- when this has come up in prior conversations around Fire and Honey, there's been almost no cannibalization, to be honest, probably surprises a little bit, but it just hasn't been there, there's -- it really has been successful in bringing in new consumers in different occasions, and it just feels -- it feels like it is showing through the analysis that we do. That it's tiny. I mean, it's almost -- truly on what we've done so far year-to-date on the impact on Black Label, it's imperceptible. I mean, literally a few thousand cases kind of thing, but it's not the reason that the Tennessee whiskey brand in the U.S. has slowed down like Another piece of it is on a volumetric basis, Black Label is up nearly 3% at the same time that we've released Apple. So I think that also gives us some confidence that just the cannibalization is not there."

This morning's conference call contains forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Numerous risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected in these statements. Many of the factors that will determine future results are beyond the company's ability to control or predict. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, and the company undertakes no obligation to update any of these statements, whether due to new information, future events or otherwise.
This morning, we released a press release containing our results for the third quarter fiscal 2020 in addition to posting presentation materials that Jane will walk through momentarily. Both the release and the presentation can be found on our website under the section titled Investors, Events & Presentations. In the press release, we have listed a number of risk factors that you should consider in conjunction with our forward-looking statements. Other significant risk factors are described in our Form 10-K and Form 10-Q reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
During this call, we will be delivering certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures, a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the reasons management believes they provide useful information to investors regarding the company's financial conditions and results of operations are contained in the press release and investor presentation. 
One last note this morning. The state of Kentucky will be conducting a statewide tornado drill at 10:07 this morning. We are not certain if this will create any disruption to our call. If necessarily, we may need to mute the line for a moment, and we apologize in advance for any potential disruption.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Lawson."
256839,654649398,1929272,"Brown-Forman Corporation, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Mar 04, 2020",2020-03-04,"Earnings Calls","Brown-Forman Corporation","Executives","All right. Good. Thank you, Leanne, and good morning, everyone. Before I comment on our year-to-date performance, I do want to take just a short moment to recognize what a special time it is to be part of Brown-Forman as we enter our 150th year. Back in 1",1727,"All right. Good. Thank you, Leanne, and good morning, everyone. Before I comment on our year-to-date performance, I do want to take just a short moment to recognize what a special time it is to be part of Brown-Forman as we enter our 150th year. Back in 1870, our founding brand, Old Forester, was first introduced into the U.S. Today, we now have a portfolio of over 40 premium and super-premium brands sold around the globe. Since our founding, the company's been agile and resilient in navigating through many challenges, including things like prohibition, world wars and economic recessions, just to name a few historical events.
Today, we find ourselves amid trade wars resulting in tariffs that are weighing on our industry, geopolitical events that are disrupting many countries around the world and now a virus that is threatening the global economy. While the headwinds feel pretty strong right now, Brown-Forman has continued to grow throughout our history and remains a strong, healthy company, supported by the commitment of our long-term shareholders and, importantly, our dedicated and talented employees around the world.
So now on to the performance of the company. Jane is going to take us through the company's financial results in a moment. But first, I'd like to provide an update on our progress toward our strategic ambitions. As you've heard me discuss on previous calls, we continue to evaluate our performance, both on a geographic and through a portfolio lens. From a geographic perspective, 18 of our 20 largest markets are delivering underlying net sales growth this year, highlighting the strong benefits of our geographic diversification. As a side note, this does not include Travel Retail, which actually is in decline, and we can talk a little bit about later. However, the growth rates of plus 3% underlying net sales year-to-date for the company are below historical norms and they're also below expectations, but we believe going forward these rates will return to more historical numbers and we will talk about that throughout the rest of this call.
From a portfolio perspective, our premium and our super-premium brands are well positioned to continue to deliver accelerated top line momentum with leading positions in some of the most attractive and fastest-growing spirits categories, such as whiskey and tequila. In particular, the super-premium brands in our portfolio are propelling the company's growth, both in the U.S. and increasingly our international markets becoming a more powerful growth driver for the company. So to get into a couple of the specific brand performance issues. Look, the Jack Daniel's family of brands underlying net sales, plus 3% year-to-date, essentially in line with the company's growth rate. We've encountered some near-term challenges for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, which is the core, the Black Label brand, in some of our international markets. Jane is going to talk more about this in her remarks when we get into the market-by-market analysis. But from a strategic perspective, we believe we still have the right strategy in place to deliver long-term profitable growth, and we are investing behind the opportunities. 
Jack Daniel's RTD business is now over 9 million cases globally and continues to deliver solid growth as the increasingly popular RTD format provides Jack Daniel's consumers with convenience in their drinking occasions. We continue also to focus on the versatility of our portfolio through innovation, which has resulted in the creation of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey and Fire over the last 9 years. These 2 brands now contribute 2.4 million 9-liter cases at very attractive margins and are connecting new consumers to the Jack Daniel's trademark. With the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple, which is off to a strong start in the United States, we are continuing to drive innovation and diversifying the portfolio. And for our international consumers, we're gearing up for the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple, and it should begin to appear on retail shelves in the next few months.
In Gentleman Jack, which we don't talk about quite as often, one of our super-premium family members, is now nearly 700,000 cases and continues to deliver strong international growth. We've also made notable progress towards our strategic ambition of increasing the scale of our super-premium portfolio. Woodford Reserve remain the leader in the super-premium bourbon category and has been consistently growing strong double digits since its introduction 20 years ago or more -- 22 years ago. Supported by its excellent track record along with innovations such as Double Oaked, Woodford Reserve has eclipsed 1 million 9-liter cases and is one of the largest growth contributors to the company. Looking ahead, we'll be focusing on the international development of this incredible brand with incremental resources being invested in a number of key markets around the world.
As I mentioned a few minutes ago, Old Forester is celebrating its 150th anniversary this year. It continues to present itself as a leader in American whiskey. The brand is steeped in a reputation of quality and innovation with its core expressions and has increasing popularity with its Whiskey Row series. This brand has been registering impressive gains in the bourbon category and is becoming an increasingly meaningful growth driver for the company. Like Brown-Forman, coincidentally, Herradura was also founded in 1870 and is also celebrating its 150th anniversary. Since we purchased the brands over 12 years ago, the super-premium tequila category in the U.S. has shown dramatic growth. To note, Herradura's underlying net sales are up 20% year-to-date and it's grown to over 600,000 cases with nearly half of its volume outside of Mexico. However, the unprecedented cost of externally sourced agave is putting pressure on gross margins.
To help mitigate, we've been able to increase prices and accelerate the growth of Ultra, our higher-priced innovation, which is now nearly 20% of the business. We expect cost pressure to continue, however, through fiscal '21 and continuing -- but continuing our strong sales trends. Forward-looking Herradura and el Jimador are well positioned in the fast-growing super-premium and ultra-premium segments. Our Single Malt Scotch portfolio is also performing very well led by GlenDronach, which has been -- experienced considerable growth and has a very promising future. In our other emerging brands, things like Slane Irish Whiskey, Coopers bourbon and Fords Gin, while newer in their development, continue to show potential for very meaningful growth. So generally speaking, we feel very confident across the different brands in our portfolio and the many levers of growth that we can pull upon.
Geographically, I'm very pleased with the success of our U.S. business this fiscal year-to-date. U.S. is not only our largest market, but it is leading our growth in our 150th year. In the most valuable global spirits market in the world, Brown-Forman takeaway trends are outpacing TDS, driven largely by our American whiskey and flavored whiskey portfolios as well as our tequila brands. The launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple has also, as I said, gone very smoothly and is accelerating growth to our overall plan. However, we recognize we need better performance on Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey in the U.S. But it is worth noting that we can outpace TDS with essentially flat to low single-digit performance on our biggest brand. We could not have said that even a few years ago, but our bourbon and tequila brands have gotten big enough that they actually have a meaningful impact on the overall trends in the U.S. business.
Developed international are having a relatively weak fiscal '20 as the U.K., Australia and Japan are weighing on performance. Where we have made investments in our route-to-consumer, places such as France and Spain and Germany, our business is healthy, and we've been able to broaden our portfolio of brands. In the U.K., which is the second largest market in the world for Brown-Forman, we're in the final stages of investing in a highly talented team and we'll soon assume full control over our route-to-consumer, which, we believe, will reaccelerate growth in this market into the next fiscal year, and expectations are that this will be a strong market for us into the future.
Our emerging markets are being led by BRIC this year. All 4 are providing strong underlying net sales growth, largely driven by Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey. Also worth pointing out is Southeast Asia is producing strong underlying double-digit growth. For the first time in a while, Asia really has been delivering solid growth this year. However, these markets are likely to suffer in the near-term as a result of the impacts from coronavirus. I am, however, very encouraged that our brands are -- how our brands are resonating with consumers. And looking into the future, I do think that Asia is a part of the world where we are relatively small, but fast growing, which I do think bodes well for the future opportunity we have there.
To the coronavirus situation, just briefly, I do want to pause and take a moment, say the health and safety of our employees is paramount. Like other companies, we've taken steps to limit our employees' risk by limiting travel, canceling certain meetings, providing up-to-date information from the CDC and the World Health Organization and ensuring our flexible work policies are being utilized. There's so many unknowns right now, and it's difficult to quantify the financial impact. Jane will try to walk you through our thinking on this difficult topic.
So in summary, we're expanding the breadth of our premium and super-premium portfolio both geographically and diversifying our revenue base in categories with the strongest momentum. We continue to have confidence in our long-term global growth potential. Currently -- although currently our overall growth rate is a bit below historical trends and our expectations, these are largely driven by multiple short-term disruptions coming together in 1 fiscal year. We believe through continuing to execute our long-term growth strategy, focused on portfolio, geography, investments in our people will continue to extend our leadership in premium American whiskey around the world and continue our track record of consistently delivering profitable growth. While the near-term challenges remain, we will weather the storm as we have throughout our 150 years as we relentlessly focus on creating value for our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jane to review more detail in our financial performance that we released this morning."
256839,654649398,1929272,"Brown-Forman Corporation, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Mar 04, 2020",2020-03-04,"Earnings Calls","Brown-Forman Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Lawson, and good morning, everyone. Over the next several minutes or so, I plan on walking you through 2 items. First, our third quarter and year-to-date results, which, as Lawson just said a moment ago, are a bit lower than we had expected at",2453,"Thank you, Lawson, and good morning, everyone. Over the next several minutes or so, I plan on walking you through 2 items. First, our third quarter and year-to-date results, which, as Lawson just said a moment ago, are a bit lower than we had expected at this point in the year, driven largely by performance in some of our international markets. I'll discuss that in more detail as I go throughout my [ presentation ] this morning. And then, secondly, I'm going to review our full year outlook, which we revised to reflect 2 things: one, a tempered expectations in some of our international markets; and two, the increasingly uncertain global economic outlook, which includes an estimate of the effect the coronavirus may have on our business globally, including our global Travel Retail business in Asia.
So let's begin with our actual performance. First, our underlying net sales grew 3% in the quarter, slower than we had anticipated, but consistent with the company's first half results. Second, while the impact of retaliatory tariffs, particularly from Europe, will continue to weigh on our margins and profits for the full year, the year-over-year effect began to ease a bit in our quarter 3. In fact, our underlying gross profit grew for the quarter for the first time since the cost of tariffs began affecting us, up 3%, consistent with our top line. The cycling of tariffs also helped to boost our underlying operating income growth in the quarter, up 5%. Consistent with our third quarter performance, our year-to-date underlying net sales grew 3% on top of 5% growth in the same period last year, but again slower than we had anticipated we would be at this point in our fiscal year.
So breaking down our underlying net sales performance by geography, just there's a bit more color on what Lawson just provided. Again, the U.S., our largest market, representing nearly half our sales, continue to lead our growth, growing 6% underlying net sales year-to-date, the market's strongest rate of growth registered in 4 years. This growth was fueled by the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple and sustained double-digit underlying net sales growth from our premium bourbon brands, notably Woodford Reserve and Old Forester, and our tequila brands in aggregate. This strong growth, again, as Lawson said, in the world's most valuable spirits market was also supported by improving takeaway trends, which accelerated over the past quarter and are now growing ahead of our -- the healthy total distilled spirits mid single-digit growth for the first time in over 18 months.
In our emerging markets, we also experienced another quarter of sequential improvement in growth, with underlying net sales up 6% year-to-date on top of last year's double digit gains. The acceleration was less than expected at this point in the year, due in part to route to market disruptions in Africa and macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges, which have begun to weigh more heavily on certain markets in the CIS and Latin America. One of our largest emerging markets are actually our largest emerging markets, Mexico, where we grew underlying net sales double digits last year at this time is now growing in the low single digits through the third quarter, reflecting a weakening economy.
If we were to exclude Mexico and the rest of Latin America, CIS and Africa, our emerging markets grew underlying net sales double digits. So despite seeing some pockets of slowdown, strong double-digit underlying net sales growth was delivered across a number of emerging markets, including Turkey, Russia, China and parts of Southeast Asia, led by strong volume growth of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey. Poland also returned to mid-single-digit underlying growth year-to-date, following a very strong quarter for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey. And I thought I'd pause for a moment and discuss our performance in Asia.
Over the past nearly 2 years, we've been quite pleased with the momentum and increasing contribution we've been experiencing from this part of the world. Specifically, our business in China has been growing underlying net sales at a double-digit rate since fiscal 2018, led in large part by our growing e-premise business where we have been focusing our investment in this market. Our performance through January had essentially not been affected by the coronavirus. So understandably, we do expect a marked slowdown in our fourth quarter in this market and other parts of Asia and have already experienced this in February. Despite this near-term headwind, we remain optimistic about the long-term growth potential for our portfolio throughout Asia. 
Similar to the first half of the year, our developed international markets delivered 2% growth in underlying net sales year-to-date. This growth was led by Germany, Czechia, France, Spain and Korea, reflecting strong growth of Jack Daniel's RTDs, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey and our super-premium American whiskey portfolio, Woodford Reserve and Gentleman Jack. In the U.K., our largest market outside the U.S., underlying net sales declined in the first 9 months. You may recall that we are navigating through multiple challenges in this market this year, including: first, the upcoming route-to-consumer change in May; two, changes in our promotional strategy; and three, softness in the cash and carry channel. So all combined, we experienced what we believe is some short-term disruption. We expect the negative trends in this market to ease as we move into next fiscal year.
In addition to some softer than planned results in the U.K., the devastating fires in Australia have also contributed to our developed international markets growing less than expected. Our global Travel Retail business, which had declined in the first and second quarter of this fiscal year, grew underlying net sales single -- grew net sales high single digits in the third quarter, due in part to easy comparisons to the same quarter a year ago. Despite improvement in the trend, global Travel Retail remains a drag on our top line, with underlying net sales down 3% year-to-date.
While we experienced some improvement in the quarter and had anticipated further improvement in the fourth quarter, resulting from the phasing of certain customer purchases, we now estimate that as a result of the coronavirus, our Travel Retail business for the full year will be down similar to year-to-date performance. Our used barrel business declined significantly in the third quarter. The decline in this business reflects both a reduction in demand due in part to the U.S. tariff impact on Single Malt Scotch Whisky; and secondly, softening prices driven by the increased supply of the used barrels in the market. This business and our other non-branded business, which includes contract bottling and bulk whiskey and bulk wine sales, have negatively affected our underlying net sales year-to-date by about 1 percentage point.
Now looking at our business through a portfolio lens. Consistent with the drivers of our growth for the first half of the year, our premium whiskey brands, Jack Daniel's RTD, Jack Daniel's flavors and tequilas, remain the key contributors. As Lawson mentioned, Woodford Reserve continued its consistent double-digit underlying net sales gains, fueled by strong consumer momentum in the United States and is now over 1 million case super-premium brand globally. With only 20% of its volume outside of the United States, growing at an even faster rate, we believe the brand has a significant run rate for geographic expansion.
Tequila has delivered underlying net sales growth of 10% year-to-date, pulled down modestly by our pricing actions on the Pepe Lopez [ mix fill ] brand in the U.S. Our consumer takeaway trends in the U.S. remain very strong. For Herradura specifically, in addition to the strong takeaway trends in the U.S. and increasing volumes in Mexico, higher prices and a favorable product mix in both the U.S. and Mexico helped to deliver the 20% growth in underlying net sales year-to-date. Jack Daniel's RTDs grew underlying net sales mid-single digits on a year-to-date basis, driven by volumetric gains in Germany and the U.S. and introduction and launch in France. 
JD flavors continued its broad-based geographic growth, most notably in the U.S., France, Poland, Czechia and Brazil. As it relates to the successful launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple in the U.S., the brand remains on track to deliver about 1 percentage point of growth for the company this year. Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey underlying net sales were essentially flat as year-to-date growth in emerging markets were offset by declines for the brand in the U.K. and our Travel Retail channel.
Moving down the P&L to gross margins. Year-to-date gross margins declined 220 basis points year-over-year reflecting -- resulting in flat underlying gross profit growth through the first 9 months. The reduction in gross margin was driven by the same 2 factors we've highlighted for the last 3 earnings call: first, our input cost reflecting agave and wood inflation; and secondly, tariff related costs. As I mentioned earlier, while the impact of tariff-related costs will continue to impact the full year margin, as we began to cycle prior year periods that were affected by tariffs, the year-over-year effect began to ease in the quarter with a 100 basis point compression for the first 9 months compared to 200 basis points through the first half. We continue to invest behind our brands with underlying A&P spending up 3% year-to-date, in line with our top line growth. As we've discussed on previous calls, the effective increase in our spend is much higher given the significant reallocation we took this fiscal year to increase our efficiencies from high touch spend to broad reach media and digital investments, along with our increase in activations and promotion activities. 
On the SG&A front, we remain committed to a disciplined approach to our investment, looking for opportunities to continue to gain efficiencies, including productivity initiatives that ultimately results in operating leverage. It is important to note, however, that while we continue to leverage prior investments, we've also increased our SG&A in markets where we see opportunity to heighten our focus on building our brands and accelerating our growth. For example, a key element of this can be seen in our third quarter of this fiscal year as we began to invest in the U.K., opening a new office and creating and forming the team and capabilities that we believe will support building our broader portfolio of brands in our new route to market structure that will begin on May 1. In the aggregate, both our reported and underlying operating income declined modestly year-to-date, driven in part by an approximate 3 percentage point drag related to tariff related costs. An effective tax rate of just over 17%, which includes a couple of discrete items year-to-date, drove 4% growth in diluted earnings per share to $1.45.
Now turning to my final topic this morning, an update on our fiscal 2020 full year outlook. There are really 2 sets of factors weighing on our outlook, which I will describe in turn that has led us to revising our full year underlying net sales growth from 5% to 7% to low single digits. First,  tempered expectations from some international markets, reflecting short-term disruptions and macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds. Specifically, to discuss, the U.K., our largest international market, is experiencing short-term changes and disruptions, including the transition to our own route to market in just a few months. The economy of our largest emerging market, Mexico, continues to weakening. The strengthening U.S. dollar has made our brands more expensive to our customers and consumers in certain other emerging markets, such as Latin America and CIS, further exacerbating the uncertainty and unpredictability of demand. And finally, unplanned destocking in Travel Retail. 
Now turning to the second factor weighing on our outlook, the uncertainty and unpredictability, the effect the coronavirus may have on our business globally, including the current, most effective areas, Travel Retail in Asia, most notably China. Included in our outlook is an estimate of some additional deterioration that is likely if this continues to evolve globally. We continue to expect gross margins will be down around 200 basis points for the year, again, split between tariff-related costs and higher input costs. Regarding our operating costs for the full year, despite the volatile and uncertain markets, we continue to build our brands, investing behind them roughly in line with our net sales growth. We're expecting SG&A to now be flat for the year, continuing to provide leverage to operating income.
We've reduced our underlying operating income outlook from a range of 2% to 4% to flat to modestly down, driven by lower top line expectations that I just discussed. We narrowed our earnings per share outlook from $1.75 to $1.85 to $1.75 to $1.80, still benefiting from a lower effective tax rate. So lastly, while our expectations for growth this year are now below our initial range, we continue to believe there is a long runway of opportunities ahead for our brand. Our teams are experienced, as Lawson said, weathering these uncertain times and are focused on accelerating our business back towards our consistent historic rates of growth. However, we are cognizant of the current market dynamics that may limit our near-term improvement.
In the meantime, we believe our business remains very attractive with nice margins resulting from the efficiency and historic consistency in our revenue growth, industry-leading return on invested capital and ample free cash flow. Over many years, we have followed a systematic approach to our capital allocation that has served us well: first, reinvesting back into the business to meet future demand; second, growing our cash dividends; and in the absence of meaningful M&A opportunities we return excess cash to shareholders through special dividends and share repurchases. Currently, we continue to invest behind the business and expanding our production capabilities, increasing whiskey inventories to meet future growth expectations, investing in technology to not only improve our efficiencies throughout all of our functions of the company but also to drive growth-based analytic insights such as our revenue management platform.
We continue to return cash to shareholders as we always have, thoughtfully, disciplined and consistently, including increasing our cash dividend for this calendar year by 5%. While we have been navigating near-term challenges, including tariffs and the increasingly uncertain and volatile world, we continue to manage our business as we always have for the long term. Strong support from our shareholders, as Lawson also said, including the Brown family, enables this long horizon, which is essential to the company's steeped and aged spirits.

And it would be helpful to try and understand how you are thinking about the impacts of the virus and weaker international growth beyond just next quarter. I guess, what I'm really trying to get at is if top line growth remains below historical levels, input costs are still a headwind and your tax rate moves back into the 20% to 21% range, what are the levers you can pull in order to deliver earnings growth in fiscal '21?"

Look, I mean, I think obviously we're not giving out guidance yet for next fiscal year. But I think as you look at our business in general, we feel pretty confident on the U.S. business these days as it is sort of above TDS, and I would expect that to continue. As I said in my prepared remarks, even with Jack at sort of subdued rates, we're able to grow above the TDS number. So -- and believe me, there are a lot of plans and there's a lot of action, a lot of activity going around to try to improve the growth rates on Tennessee Whiskey. And if that happens, we're even, I would call it, more confident in the U.S. market. So that feels pretty good. The developed international side of things is subdued, but it largely -- as Jane said, that's largely the U.K. There are other markets that are not kicking on all cylinders these days.
But I think we can get that -- we'll get that category of markets, the developed international, back into what its traditional range would be mid to even a little bit better than mid single-digit growth. But I'll take mid-single digits out of that part of the world. And emerging is a volatile one. It's always been the volatile one. It's been growing at a rate above our company average now for a number of years. It has slowed this year, as we said, largely because of Mexico. Asia is the wild card in this. And I don't know how to tell you to -- we're trying to think about what is the growth rate for that part of the world going to be, because right now it's solid. But we're going to be a little more subdued. And I think at the end of the day, we're going to be -- we use the word around here agility a lot. You're going to have to be agile next year because while things do have a tough outlook, the comps are going to be a little bit easier next year, and I can see some bounce backs and some other things that make it -- that turn it into a pretty good year. So not directly answering your question because we have not provided that guidance yet, but I think we generally feel pretty good on the top line, that things will return to what I call a more normalized growth rate."

With that being said, we had -- as we've talked about the Travel Retail business before, it's quite lumpy and volatile anyhow from quarter-to-quarter and when people purchase. And so we had the strong growth at the beginning of last year first half and now we're cycling against some softer growth in the second half for Travel Retail. We still do expect some improvement, but that will be offset by this coronavirus on our business and the global -- just people less traveling internationally. So we -- but that's what I would answer your question in terms of why they are so different than our smaller and as where they're concentrated."

The cash and carry is limited to a couple customer -- 1 customer really, and so that business, we talked about last time, so that really hasn't changed from our third quarter what we were referring to what was going on there. We just have a bit more precise thing cash and carry this time. Increased promotional strategy, you're right. It was planned. And it's something that we're doing as we get ready to own our own distribution come May. And that's why when we look ahead to this market and the optimism we have going forward versus what we have had this year, we will be in control of a lot of our decisions of working with the grocers and determining the pricing strategies. And right now that doesn't always happen. And so that's important for us as we go forward. Just a reminder why we made this decision to go on our own route-to-consumer in the U.K. This relationship has probably served us quite well. It started in 2002, served both companies quite well, but we had very limited portfolio at that time, I don't know, 10, 12, 15 brands. And now combined, we have over 100 brands. So you can only imagine the lack of attention, focused prioritization, understanding the consumer and focus on our own portfolio. And so we haven't transitioned yet. That, again, is May 1. But we believe the focus, the prioritization, the understanding the consumers, the more direct contact with our customers, if you will, will allow us to not only accelerate our business there, but get our rest of our portfolio growing quite nicely."

We've -- as Jane said, our portfolio has got bigger, the concepts got bigger, and we've moved on. So on the pricing or the promotional question you asked a little bit earlier, I mean, the -- look, if we're totally honest, the amount of promotion in the U.K. market got too big. And so we're trying to reduce that a little bit and get some pricing up, and we're working on that slowly. It's not a -- I mean you have to do it slowly with the European retail world, but we're paying the price necessarily. We're just seeing short-term disruption with some of our customers as we do a little bit less promoting. We do think in the long run it's the smart thing to do.

Let me just pause for a minute, as we want to be super clear here with what we have in our forecast. So again, if you looked at what we did, we took our overall forecast down, as you saw. We reduced our underlying forecast with 2 factors. First, it was the tempering of the growth and contribution from some of our international markets, again reflecting some short-term disruptions as well these macro and economic and geopolitical challenges. So when we look at our base business, what we would estimate now that our base business is doing is probably growing in the 3.5% to 4.5% range. It is, therefore, a couple of points less than what our expectations were just 3 months ago. But the second factor that we built into our forecast -- and this is what you're asking specifically about, Vivien -- led to our reduction in our top line outlook. And again not surprising is this unpredictability and uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus and what it may have on our business globally.
So we've estimated at this point, there's about a point drag, including those markets that are currently affected. So to your point directly from the Asian markets, including China and other parts of Asia, Travel Retail and we have in -- Italy in there. So collectively, that's about 8% of our business. And as I said earlier, yes, we've already seen areas -- many of these areas already affected in our February results. But that being said, we also have, in that 1%, some additional downside impact. And we don't know, none of us knows, that's going to be enough, too much. We're learning daily as this situation, and so we're really only looking at our fourth quarter. We haven't tried estimating downstream, secondary effects on anything beyond the demand we see and then an expectation for perhaps it spreading to some other markets. We don't know about the economy and the consumer confidence and sentiment and how they may linger into our first quarter and summer months. So we'll obviously come back in June with more guidance on that for next year. So Vivien, I know I went into a little bit more detail, but I thought it was important to just to phrase it for you or put it in perspective in terms of where we are and that why we did reduce our guidance into the 2 buckets."

Really for the last -- I'll say last decade, it's been low single digit. Some of that -- I mean, as most companies do, we take a hard look at how our competitors are doing and where we are relative to that and try to pick our spots, and we've done that. In the last year, we had gotten above and the competitors were going down, and that hurt our volumes a bit. And so at the beginning of this fiscal year, we got a little more aggressive, and our volumes have reacted. Our volume growth this year is as good as it's been -- I don't know how many years. It's a number of years. So I think if we -- that's a good thing, and that means consumers are still taking the product away, and we feel pretty good about that.

I'll talk about -- we did talk about tequila, the agave cost a bit. And just as a reminder on that, we've been consistently saying that we expect agave cost to continue to increase through calendar year -- most of calendar '21. So in other words, we won't start seeing any easing to the back half of calendar '21, early calendar '22, so just as a reminder. I mean, we've got that information based upon what is publicly available from the CRT. So we can see when planting started to accelerate and we kind of know what the demand is. And so we can see, by the way, tons of plantings more recently. So we know 6 or 7 years from now we'll have -- there probably will be lots of pressure on pricing at that point in time. But in the near term, again, it's going to be late calendar '21, early calendar '22 before we see cost pressures. But now with that being said, Bryan, it's important to note that what we're seeing in the market, where we had seen like a fivefold increase from 2015 in the price of the agave, it really -- and it rapidly increased during 2016 through mid last year we have seen some slowing. It's still growing, but not at the -- and still at unprecedented dollar -- I guess peso cost, if you will, but it's not growing just rapidly. So that perhaps is a bit of a good news there, if you will. As it relates to the cost of wood, we have seen some moderation in that. But again, you're not going to start to see that come through our P&L because of our aged products 4 years from now. And coupled with that, we have capital investments that we've made. So all of that's got to factor in. That will come through our P&L for 4 years because of our aged products."

Because, to be honest, we were a little more concerned about the cannibalization of Honey and Fire necessarily than we were on Black Label. But when we've done the work, and it's the same thing that we've said sort of on prior -- when this has come up in prior conversations around Fire and Honey, there's been almost no cannibalization, to be honest, I think it probably surprises a little bit, but it just hasn't been there. There's -- it really has been successful in bringing in new consumers in different occasions, and it just feels -- it feels like it is showing through the analysis that we do that it's tiny. I mean, it's almost -- truly on what we've done so far year-to-date on the impact on Black Label, it's imperceptible, I mean, literally a few thousand cases kind of thing, but it's not the reason that the Tennessee Whiskey brand in the U.S. has slowed down like you'd asked. Another piece of it, I guess, on a volumetric basis, Black Label is up nearly 3% at the same time that we've released Apple. So I think that also gives us some confidence that just the cannibalization is not there."

This morning's conference call contains forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Numerous risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected in these statements. Many of the factors that will determine future results are beyond the company's ability to control or predict. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, and the company undertakes no obligation to update any of these statements, whether due to new information, future events or otherwise.
This morning, we released a press release containing our results for the third quarter fiscal 2020 in addition to posting presentation materials that Jane will walk through momentarily. Both the release and the presentation can be found on our website under the section titled Investors, Events & Presentations. In the press release, we have listed a number of risk factors that you should consider in conjunction with our forward-looking statements. Other significant risk factors are described in our Form 10-K and Form 10-Q reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
During this call, we will be delivering certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures, a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the reasons management believes they provide useful information to investors regarding the company's financial conditions and results of operations are contained in the press release and investor presentation.
One last note this morning. The state of Kentucky will be conducting a statewide tornado drill at 10:07 this morning. We are not certain if this will create any disruption to our call. If necessarily, we may need to mute the line for a moment, and we apologize in advance for any potential disruption.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Lawson."
256839,654649398,1932374,"Brown-Forman Corporation, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Mar 04, 2020",2020-03-04,"Earnings Calls","Brown-Forman Corporation","Executives","All right. Good. Thank you, Leanne, and good morning, everyone. Before I comment on our year-to-date performance, I do want to take just a short moment to recognize what a special time it is to be part of Brown-Forman as we enter our 150th year. Back in 1",1731,"All right. Good. Thank you, Leanne, and good morning, everyone. Before I comment on our year-to-date performance, I do want to take just a short moment to recognize what a special time it is to be part of Brown-Forman as we enter our 150th year. Back in 1870, our founding brand, Old Forester, was first introduced into the U.S. Today, we now have a portfolio of over 40 premium and super-premium brands sold around the globe. Since our founding, the company's been agile and resilient in navigating through many challenges, including things like prohibition, world wars and economic recessions, just to name a few historical events.
Today, we find ourselves amid trade wars resulting in tariffs that are weighing on our industry, geopolitical events that are disrupting many countries around the world and now a virus that is threatening the global economy. While the headwinds feel pretty strong right now, Brown-Forman has continued to grow throughout our history and remains a strong, healthy company, supported by the commitment of our long-term shareholders and, importantly, our dedicated and talented employees around the world.
So now on to the performance of the company. Jane is going to take us through the company's financial results in a moment. But first, I'd like to provide an update on our progress toward our strategic ambitions. As you've heard me discuss on previous calls, we continue to evaluate our performance, both on a geographic and through a portfolio lens. From a geographic perspective, 18 of our 20 largest markets are delivering underlying net sales growth this year, highlighting the strong benefits of our geographic diversification. As a side note, this does not include Travel Retail, which actually is in decline, and we can talk a little bit about later. However, the growth rates of plus 3% underlying net sales year-to-date for the company are below historical norms and they're also below our expectations, but we believe going forward these rates will return to more historical numbers and we will talk about that throughout the rest of this call.
From a portfolio perspective, our premium and our super-premium brands are well positioned to continue to deliver accelerating top line momentum with leading positions in some of the most attractive and fastest-growing spirits categories, such as whiskey and tequila. In particular, the super-premium brands in our portfolio are propelling the company's growth, both in the U.S. and increasingly on international markets, becoming a more powerful growth driver for the company. So to get into a couple of the specific brand performance issues. Look, the Jack Daniel's family of brands underlying net sales is plus 3% year-to-date, essentially in line with the company's growth rate. We've encountered some near-term challenges for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, which is the core, the Black Label brand, in some of our international markets. Jane is going to talk more about this in her remarks when we get into the market-by-market analysis. But from a strategic perspective, we believe we still have the right strategy in place to deliver long-term profitable growth, and we are investing behind the opportunities.
Jack Daniel's RTD business is now over 9 million cases globally and continues to deliver solid growth as the increasingly popular RTD format provides Jack Daniel's consumers with convenience in their drinking occasions. We continue also to focus on the versatility of our portfolio through innovation, which has resulted in the creation of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey and Fire over the last 9 years. These 2 brands now contribute 2.4 million 9-liter cases at very attractive margins and are connecting new consumers to the Jack Daniel's trademark. With the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple, which is off to a strong start in the United States, we are continuing to drive innovation and diversifying the portfolio. And for our international consumers, we're gearing up for the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple, and it should begin to appear on retail shelves in the next few months.
In Gentleman Jack, which we don't talk about quite as often, one of our super-premium family members, is now nearly 700,000 cases and continues to deliver strong international growth. We've also made notable progress towards our strategic ambition of increasing the scale of our super-premium portfolio. Woodford Reserve remain the leader in the super-premium bourbon category and has been consistently growing strong double digits since its introduction 20 years ago or more -- 22 years ago. Supported by its excellent track record along with innovations such as Double Oaked, Woodford Reserve has eclipsed 1 million 9-liter cases and is one of the largest growth contributors to the company. Looking ahead, we'll be focusing on the international development of this incredible brand with incremental resources being invested in a number of key markets around the world.
And as I mentioned a few minutes ago, Old Forester is celebrating its 150th anniversary this year. It continues to present itself as a leader in American whiskey. The brand is steeped in a reputation of quality and innovation with its core expressions and has increasing popularity with its Whiskey Row series. This brand has been registering impressive gains in the bourbon category and is becoming an increasingly meaningful growth driver for the company. Like Brown-Forman, coincidentally, Herradura was also founded in 1870 and is also celebrating its 150th anniversary. Since we purchased the brands over 12 years ago, the super-premium tequila category in the U.S. has shown dramatic growth. To note, Herradura's underlying net sales are up 20% year-to-date and it's grown to over 600,000 cases with nearly half of its volume outside of Mexico. However, the unprecedented cost of externally sourced agave is putting pressure on gross margins.
To help mitigate, we've been able to increase prices and accelerate the growth of ultra, our higher-priced innovation, which is now nearly 20% of the business. We expect cost pressure to continue, however, through fiscal '21 and continuing -- but continuing our strong sales trends. Forward-looking, Herradura and el Jimador are well positioned in the fast-growing super-premium and ultra-premium segments. Our Single Malt Scotch portfolio is also performing very well led by GlenDronach, which has been -- experienced considerable growth and has a very promising future. In our other emerging brands, things like Slane Irish Whiskey and Coopers bourbon and Fords Gin, while newer in their development, continue to show potential for very meaningful growth. So generally speaking, we feel very confident across the different brands in our portfolio and the many levers of growth that we can pull upon.
Geographically, I'm very pleased with the success of our U.S. business this fiscal year-to-date. U.S. is not only our largest market, but it is leading our growth in our 150th year. In the most valuable global spirits market in the world, Brown-Forman takeaway trends are outpacing TDS, driven largely by our American whiskey and flavored whiskey portfolios as well as our tequila brands. The launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple has also, as I said, gone very smoothly and is accelerating growth to our overall plan. However, we recognize we need better performance on Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey in the U.S. But it is worth noting that we can outpace TDS with essentially flat to low single-digit performance on our biggest brand. We could not have said that even a few years ago, but our bourbon and tequila brands have gotten big enough that they actually have a meaningful impact on the overall trends in the U.S. business.
Developed international are having a relatively weak fiscal '20 as the U.K., Australia and Japan are weighing on performance. Where we have made investments in our route-to-consumer, places such as France and Spain and Germany, our business is healthy, and we've been able to broaden our portfolio of brands. In the U.K., which is the second largest market in the world for Brown-Forman, we're in the final stages of investing in a highly talented team and we'll soon assume full control over our route-to-consumer, which, we believe, will reaccelerate growth in this market into the next fiscal year, and expectations are that this will be a strong market for us into the future.
Our emerging markets are being led by BRIC this year. All 4 are providing strong underlying net sales growth, largely driven by Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey. Also worth pointing out is Southeast Asia is producing strong underlying double-digit growth. For the first time in a while, Asia really has been delivering solid growth this year. However, these markets are likely to suffer in the near-term as a result of the impacts from coronavirus. I am, however, very encouraged that our brands are -- how our brands are resonating with consumers. And looking into the future, I do think that Asia is a part of the world where we are relatively small, but fast growing, which I do think bodes well for the future opportunity we have there.
To the coronavirus situation, just briefly, I do want to pause and take a moment, say the health and safety of our employees is paramount. Like other companies, we've taken steps to limit our employees' risk by limiting travel, canceling certain meetings, providing up-to-date information from the CDC and the World Health Organization and ensuring our flexible work policies are being utilized. There's so many unknowns right now, and it's difficult to quantify the financial impact. Jane will try to walk you through our thinking on this difficult topic.
So in summary, we're expanding the breadth of our premium and super-premium portfolio both geographically and diversifying our revenue base in categories with the strongest momentum. We continue to have confidence in our long-term global growth potential. Currently -- although currently our overall growth rate is a bit below historical trends and our expectations, these are largely driven by multiple short-term disruptions coming together in 1 fiscal year. We believe through continuing to execute our long-term growth strategy, focused on portfolio, geography, investments in our people will continue to extend our leadership in premium American whiskey around the world and continue our track record of consistently delivering profitable growth. While the near-term challenges remain, we will weather the storm as we have throughout our 150 years as we relentlessly focus on creating value for our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jane to review more detail in our financial performance that we released this morning."
256839,654649398,1932374,"Brown-Forman Corporation, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Mar 04, 2020",2020-03-04,"Earnings Calls","Brown-Forman Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Lawson, and good morning, everyone. Over the next several minutes or so, I plan on walking you through 2 items. First, our third quarter and year-to-date results, which, as Lawson just said a moment ago, are a bit lower than we had expected at",2446,"Thank you, Lawson, and good morning, everyone. Over the next several minutes or so, I plan on walking you through 2 items. First, our third quarter and year-to-date results, which, as Lawson just said a moment ago, are a bit lower than we had expected at this point in the year, driven largely by performance in some of our international markets. I'll discuss that in more detail as I go throughout my presentation this morning. And then, secondly, I'm going to review our full year outlook, which we revised to reflect 2 things: one, a tempered expectations in some of our international markets; and two, the increasingly uncertain global economic outlook, which includes an estimate of the effect the coronavirus may have on our business globally, including our Global Travel Retail business in Asia.
So let's begin with our actual performance. First, our underlying net sales grew 3% in the quarter, slower than we had anticipated, but consistent with the company's first half results. Second, while the impact of retaliatory tariffs, particularly from Europe, will continue to weigh on our margins and profits for the full year, the year-over-year effect began to ease a bit in our quarter 3. In fact, our underlying gross profit grew for the quarter for the first time since the cost of tariffs began affecting us, up 3%, consistent with our top line. The cycling of tariffs also helped to boost our underlying operating income growth in the quarter, up 5%. Consistent with our third quarter performance, our year-to-date underlying net sales grew 3% on top of 5% growth in the same period last year, but again slower than we had anticipated we would be at this point in our fiscal year.
So breaking down our underlying net sales performance by geography, just there's a bit more color on what Lawson just provided. Again, the U.S., our largest market, representing nearly half our sales, continued to lead our growth, growing 6% underlying net sales year-to-date, the market's strongest rate of growth registered in 4 years. This growth was fueled by the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple and sustained double-digit underlying net sales growth from our premium bourbon brands, notably Woodford Reserve and Old Forester, and our tequila brands in aggregate. This strong growth, again, as Lawson said, in the world's most valuable spirits market was also supported by improving takeaway trends, which accelerated over the past quarter and are now growing ahead of our -- the healthy total distilled spirits mid single-digit growth for the first time in over 18 months.
In our emerging markets, we also experienced another quarter of sequential improvement in growth, with underlying net sales up 6% year-to-date on top of last year's double-digit gains. The acceleration was less than expected at this point in the year, due in part to route-to-market disruptions in Africa and macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges, which have begun to weigh more heavily on certain markets in the CIS and Latin America. One of our largest emerging markets are -- actually our largest emerging market, Mexico, where we grew underlying net sales double digits last year at this time is now growing in the low single digits through the third quarter, reflecting a weakening economy.
If we were to exclude Mexico and the rest of Latin America, CIS and Africa, our emerging markets grew underlying net sales double digits. So despite seeing some pockets of slowdown, strong double-digit underlying net sales growth was delivered across a number of emerging markets, including Turkey, Russia, China and parts of Southeast Asia, led by strong volume growth of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey. Poland also returned to mid-single-digit underlying growth year-to-date, following a very strong quarter for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey. And I thought I'd pause for a moment and discuss our performance in Asia.
Over the past nearly 2 years, we've been quite pleased with the momentum and increasing contribution we've been experiencing from this part of the world. Specifically, our business in China has been growing underlying net sales at a double-digit rate since fiscal 2018, led in large part by our growing e-premise business where we have been focusing our investment in this market. Our performance through January had essentially not been affected by the coronavirus. So understandably, we do expect a marked slowdown in our fourth quarter in this market and other parts of Asia and have already experienced this in February. Despite this near-term headwind, we remain optimistic about the long-term growth potential for our portfolio throughout Asia. 
Similar to the first half of the year, our developed international markets delivered 2% growth in underlying net sales year-to-date. This growth was led by Germany, Czechia, France, Spain and Korea, reflecting strong growth of Jack Daniel's RTDs, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey and our super-premium American whiskey portfolio, Woodford Reserve and Gentleman Jack. In the U.K., our largest market outside the U.S., underlying net sales declined in the first 9 months. You may recall that we are navigating through multiple challenges in this market this year, including: first, the upcoming route-to-consumer change in May; two, changes in our promotional strategy; and three, softness in the cash and carry channel. So all combined, we experienced what we believe is some short-term disruption. We expect the negative trends in this market to ease as we move into next fiscal year.
In addition to some softer than planned results in the U.K., the devastating fires in Australia have also contributed to our developed international markets growing less than expected. Our Global Travel Retail business, which had declined in the first and second quarter of this fiscal year, grew underlying net sales single -- grew net sales high single digits in the third quarter, due in part to easy comparisons to the same quarter a year ago. Despite improvement in the trend, Global Travel Retail remains a drag on our top line, with underlying net sales down 3% year-to-date.
While we experienced some improvement in the quarter and had anticipated further improvement in the fourth quarter, resulting from the phasing of certain customer purchases, we now estimate that as a result of the coronavirus, our Travel Retail business for the full year will be down similar to year-to-date performance. Our used barrel business declined significantly in the third quarter. The decline in this business reflects both a reduction in demand due in part to the U.S. tariff impact on Single Malt Scotch Whiskey; and secondly, softening prices driven by the increased supply of the used barrels in the market. This business and our other nonbranded business, which includes contract bottling and bulk whiskey and bulk wine sales, have negatively affected our underlying net sales year-to-date by about 1 percentage point.
Now looking at our business through a portfolio lens. Consistent with the drivers of our growth for the first half of the year, our premium whiskey brands, Jack Daniel's RTD, Jack Daniel's flavors and tequilas, remain the key contributors. As Lawson mentioned, Woodford Reserve continued its consistent double-digit underlying net sales gains, fueled by strong consumer momentum in the United States and is now over 1 million case super-premium brand globally. With only 20% of its volume outside of the United States, growing at an even faster rate, we believe the brand has a significant run rate for geographic expansion.
Tequila has delivered underlying net sales growth of 10% year-to-date, pulled down modestly by our pricing actions on the Pepe Lopez mix fill brand in the U.S. Our consumer takeaway trends in the U.S. remain very strong. For Herradura specifically, in addition to the strong takeaway trends in the U.S. and increasing volumes in Mexico, higher prices and a favorable product mix in both the U.S. and Mexico helped to deliver the 20% growth in underlying net sales year-to-date. Jack Daniel's RTDs grew underlying net sales mid-single digits on a year-to-date basis, driven by volumetric gains in Germany and the U.S. and introduction and launch in France. 
JD flavors continued its broad-based geographic growth, most notably in the U.S., France, Poland, Czechia and Brazil. As it relates to the successful launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple in the U.S., the brand remained on track to deliver about 1 percentage point of growth for the company this year. Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey underlying net sales were essentially flat as year-to-date growth in emerging markets were offset by declines for the brand in the U.K. and our Travel Retail channel.
Moving down the P&L to gross margins. Year-to-date gross margins declined 220 basis points year-over-year reflecting -- resulting in flat underlying gross profit growth through the first 9 months. The reduction in gross margin was driven by the same 2 factors we've highlighted for the last 3 earnings call: first, our input cost reflecting agave and wood inflation; and secondly, tariff related costs. As I mentioned earlier, while the impact of tariff-related costs will continue to impact the full year margin, as we began to cycle prior year periods that were affected by tariffs, the year-over-year effect began to ease in the quarter with 100 basis point compression for the first 9 months compared to 200 basis points through the first half. We continue to invest behind our brands with underlying A&P spending up 3% year-to-date, in line with our top line growth. As we've discussed on previous calls, the effective increase in our spend is much higher given the significant reallocation we took this fiscal year to increase our efficiencies from high touch spend to broad reach media and digital investments, along with our increase in activations and promotion activities. 
On the SG&A front, we remain committed to a disciplined approach to our investment, looking for opportunities to continue to gain efficiencies, including productivity initiatives that ultimately results in operating leverage. It is important to note, however, that while we continue to leverage prior investments, we've also increased our SG&A in markets where we see opportunity to heighten our focus on building our brands and accelerating our growth. For example, a key element of this can be seen in our third quarter of this fiscal year as we began to invest in the U.K., opening a new office and creating and forming the team and capabilities that we believe will support building our broader portfolio of brands in our new route to market structure that will begin on May 1. In the aggregate, both our reported and underlying operating income declined modestly year-to-date, driven in part by an approximate 3 percentage point drag related to tariff related costs. An effective tax rate of just over 17%, which includes a couple of discrete items year-to-date, drove 4% growth in diluted earnings per share to $1.45.
Now turning to my final topic this morning, an update on our fiscal 2020 full year outlook. There are really 2 sets of factors weighing on our outlook, which I will describe in turn that has led us to revising our full year underlying net sales growth from 5% to 7% to low single digits. First, tempered expectations from some international markets, reflecting short-term disruptions and macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds. Specifically, to discuss, the U.K., our largest international market, is experiencing short-term changes and disruptions, including the transition to our own route to market in just a few months. The economy of our largest emerging market, Mexico, continues to weakening. The strengthening U.S. dollar has made our brands more expensive to our customers and consumers in certain other emerging markets, such as Latin America and CIS, further exacerbating the uncertainty and unpredictability of demand. And finally, unplanned destocking in Travel Retail.
Now turning to the second factor weighing on our outlook, the uncertainty and unpredictability, the effect the coronavirus may have on our business globally, including the current, most effective areas, Travel Retail in Asia, most notably China. Included in our outlook is an estimate of some additional deterioration that is likely if this continues to evolve globally. We continue to expect gross margins will be down around 200 basis points for the year, again, split between tariff-related costs and higher input costs. Regarding our operating costs for the full year, despite the volatile and uncertain markets, we continue to build our brands, investing behind them roughly in line with our net sales growth. We're expecting SG&A to now be flat for the year, continuing to provide leverage to operating income.
We've reduced our underlying operating income outlook from a range of 2% to 4% to flat to modestly down, driven by lower top line expectations that I just discussed. We narrowed our earnings per share outlook from $1.75 to $1.85 to $1.75 to $1.80, still benefiting from a lower effective tax rate. So lastly, while our expectations for growth this year are now below our initial range, we continue to believe there is a long runway of opportunities ahead for our brand. Our teams are experienced, as Lawson said, weathering these uncertain times and are focused on accelerating our business back towards our consistent historic rates of growth. However, we are cognizant of the current market dynamics that may limit our near-term improvement.
In the meantime, we believe our business remains very attractive with nice margins resulting from the efficiency and historic consistency in our revenue growth, industry-leading return on invested capital and ample free cash flow. Over many years, we have followed a systematic approach to our capital allocation that has served us well: first, reinvesting back into the business to meet future demand; second, growing our cash dividends; and in the absence of meaningful M&A opportunities we return excess cash to shareholders through special dividends and share repurchases. Currently, we continue to invest behind the business and expanding our production capabilities, increasing whiskey inventories to meet future growth expectations, investing in technology to not only improve our efficiencies throughout all of our functions of the company but also to drive growth-based analytic insights such as our revenue management platform.
We continue to return cash to shareholders as we always have, thoughtfully, disciplined and consistently, including increasing our cash dividend for this calendar year by 5%. While we have been navigating near-term challenges, including tariffs and the increasingly uncertain and volatile world, we continue to manage our business as we always have for the long term. Strong support from our shareholders, as Lawson also said, including the Brown family, enables this long horizon, which is essential to the company's steeped and aged spirits. We believe our portfolio of premium, super-premium whiskey and tequila brands position us well to continue creating value for all of our shareholders.
And with that, this concludes our prepared remarks. Dorothy, please open the call up for questions."

Look, I mean, I think obviously we're not giving out guidance yet for next fiscal year. But I think as you look at our business in general, we feel pretty confident on the U.S. business these days as it is sort of above TDS, and I would expect that to continue. As I said in my prepared remarks, even with Jack at sort of subdued rates, we're able to grow above the TDS number. So -- and believe me, there are a lot of plans and there's a lot of action, a lot of activity going around to try to improve the growth rates on Tennessee Whiskey. And if that happens, we're even, I would call it, more confident in the U.S. market. So that feels pretty good. The developed international side of things is subdued, but it largely -- as Jane said, that's largely the U.K. There are other markets that are not kicking on all cylinders these days.
But I think we can get that -- we'll get that category of markets, the developed international, back into what its traditional range would be mid to even a little bit better than mid single-digit growth. But I'll take mid-single digits out of that part of the world. And emerging is the volatile one. It's always been the volatile one. It's been growing at a rate above our company average now for a number of years. It has slowed this year, as we said, largely because of Mexico. Asia is the wild card in this. And I don't know how to tell you to -- we're trying to think about what is the growth rate for that part of the world going to be, because right now it's solid. But we're going to be a little more subdued. And I think at the end of the day, we're going to be -- we use the word around here agility a lot. You're going to have to be agile next year because while things do have a tough outlook, the comps are going to be a little bit easier next year, and I could see some bounce backs and some other things that make it -- that turn it into a pretty good year. So not directly answering your question because we have not provided that guidance yet, but I think we generally feel pretty good on the top line, that things will return to what I call a more normalized growth rate."

With that being said, we had -- as we've talked about the Travel Retail business before, it's quite lumpy and volatile anyhow from quarter-to-quarter and when people purchase. And so we had the strong growth at the beginning of last year first half and now we're cycling against some softer growth in the second half for Travel Retail. We still do expect some improvement, but that will be offset by this coronavirus on our business and the global -- just people less traveling internationally. So we -- but that's what I would answer your question in terms of why their's our different than our, smaller and it's where they're concentrating."

We just -- that was more precise thing, cash and carry this time. The increased promotional strategy, you're right. It was planned. And it's something that we're doing as we get ready to own our own distribution come May. And that's why when we look ahead to this market and the optimism we have going forward versus what we have had this year, we will be in control of a lot of our decisions of working with the grocers and determining the pricing strategies. And right now that doesn't always happen. And so that's important for us as we go forward. Just a reminder why we made this decision to go on our own route-to-consumer in the U.K. This relationship has probably served us quite well. It started in 2002, served both companies quite well, but we had very limited portfolio at that time, I don't know, 10, 12, 15 brands. And now combined, we have over 100 brands. So you can only imagine the lack of attention, focus, prioritization, understanding the consumer and focus on our own portfolio. And so we haven't transitioned yet. That, again, is May 1. But we believe the focus, the prioritization, the understanding the consumers, the more direct contact with our customers, if you will, will allow us to not only accelerate our business there, but get our rest of our portfolio growing quite nicely."

But I think both companies would admit it's just time. We've -- as Jane said, our portfolio has got bigger, the concept has got bigger, and we've moved on. So on the pricing or the promotional question you asked a little bit earlier, I mean, the -- look, if we're totally honest, the amount of promotion in the U.K. market got too big. And so we're trying to reduce that a little bit and get some pricing up, and we're working on that slowly. It's not a -- I mean you have to do it slowly with the European retail world, but we're paying the price necessarily. We're just seeing short-term disruption with some of our customers as we do a little bit less promoting. We do think in the long run it's the smart thing to do.

Let me just pause for a minute, as we want to be super clear here with what we have in our forecast. So again, if you looked at what we did, we took our overall forecast down, as you saw. We reduced our underlying forecast with 2 factors. First, it was the tempering of the growth and contribution from some of our international markets, again reflecting some short-term disruptions as well these macro economic and geopolitical challenges. So when we look at our base business, what we would estimate now that our base business is doing is probably growing in the 3.5% to 4.5% range. It is, therefore, a couple of points less than what our expectations were just 3 months ago. But the second factor that we built into our forecast -- and this is what you're asking specifically about, Vivien, led to our reduction in our top line outlook. And again not surprising is this unpredictability and uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus and what it may have on our business globally.
So we've estimated at this point, there's about 1 point drag, including those markets that are currently affected. So to your point directly on the Asian markets, including China and other parts of Asia, Travel Retail and we have in -- Italy in there. So collectively, that's about 8% of our business. And as I said earlier, yes, we've already seen areas -- many of these areas already affected in our February results. But that being said, we also have, in that 1%, some additional downside impact. And we don't know, none of us knows, that's going to be enough, too much. We're learning daily as this situation, and so we're really only looking at our fourth quarter. We haven't tried estimating downstream, secondary effects on anything beyond the demand we see and then an expectation for perhaps it's spreading to some other markets. We don't know about the economy and the consumer confidence and sentiment and how they may linger into our first quarter and summer months. So we'll obviously come back in June with more guidance on that for next year. And I know I went into a little bit more detail, but I thought it was important to just to phrase it for you or put it in perspective in terms of where we are and that why we did reduce our guidance into the 2 buckets."

And then for Lawson, just an update on the U.S. pricing environment. As we look at the Nielsen data, the price/mix remains negative and has been that way, although, albeit moderating somewhat. Could you just give us a little bit of an update there in terms of what you're seeing in the competitive environment?

Some of that -- I mean, as most companies do, we take a hard look at how our competitors are doing and where we are relative to that and try to pick our spots, and we've done that. In the last year, we had gotten above and the competitors were going down, and that hurt our volumes a bit.

It's a number of years. So I think if we -- that's a good thing, and that means consumers are still taking the product away, and we feel pretty good about that.

I'll talk about -- we did talk about tequila, the agave cost a bit. And just as a reminder on that, we've been consistently saying that we expect agave cost to continue to increase through calendar year -- most of calendar '21. So in other words, we won't start seeing any easing to the back half of calendar '21, early calendar '22, so just as a reminder. I mean, we've got that information based upon what is publicly available from the CRT. So we can see when planting started to accelerate and we kind of know what the demand is. And so we can see, by the way, tons of plantings more recently. So we know 6 or 7 years from now we'll have -- there probably will be lots of pressure on pricing at that point in time. But in the near term, again, it's going to be late calendar '21, early calendar '22 before we see cost pressures. But now with that being said, Bryan, it's important to note that what we're seeing in the market, where we had seen like a fivefold increase from 2015 in the price of the agave, it really -- and it rapidly increased during 2016 through mid last year we have seen some slowing. It's still growing, but not at the -- and still at unprecedented dollar -- I guess peso cost, if you will, but it's just not growing just rapidly. So that perhaps is a bit of a good news there, if you will. As it relates to the cost of wood, we have seen some moderation in that. But again, you're not going to start to see that come through our P&L because of our aged products 4 years from now. And coupled with that, we have capital investments that we've made. So all of that's got to factor in. That will come through our P&L for 4 years because of our aged products."

But when we've done the work, and it's the same thing that we've said sort of on prior -- when this has come up in prior conversations around Fire and Honey, there's been almost no cannibalization, to be honest, I think it probably surprises a little bit, but it just hasn't been there. There's -- it really has been successful in bringing in new consumers in different occasions, and it just feels -- it feels like it is showing through the analysis that we do that it's tiny. I mean, it's almost -- truly on what we've done so far year-to-date on the impact on Black Label, it's imperceptible, I mean, literally a few thousand cases kind of thing, but it's not the reason that the Tennessee Whiskey brand in the U.S. has slowed down like you'd asked. Another piece of it, I guess, on a volumetric basis, Black Label is up nearly 3% at the same time that we've released Apple. So I think that also gives us some confidence that just the cannibalization is not there."

This morning's conference call contains forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Numerous risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected in these statements. Many of the factors that will determine future results are beyond the company's ability to control or predict. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, and the company undertakes no obligation to update any of these statements, whether due to new information, future events or otherwise.
This morning, we released a press release containing our results for the third quarter fiscal 2020 in addition to posting presentation materials that Jane will walk through momentarily. Both the release and the presentation can be found on our website under the section titled Investors, Events & Presentations. In the press release, we have listed a number of risk factors that you should consider in conjunction with our forward-looking statements. Other significant risk factors are described in our Form 10-K and Form 10-Q reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
During this call, we will be delivering certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures, a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the reasons management believes they provide useful information to investors regarding the company's financial conditions and results of operations are contained in the press release and investor presentation.
One last note this morning. The state of Kentucky will be conducting a statewide tornado drill at 10:07 this morning. We are not certain if this will create any disruption to our call. If necessarily, we may need to mute the line for a moment, and we apologize in advance for any potential disruption.

Thank you, Leanne, and good morning, everyone. Before I comment on our year-to-date performance, I do want to take just a short moment to recognize what a special time it is to be part of Brown-Forman as we enter our 150th year. Back in 1",1731,"All right. Good. Thank you, Leanne, and good morning, everyone. Before I comment on our year-to-date performance, I do want to take just a short moment to recognize what a special time it is to be part of Brown-Forman as we enter our 150th year. Back in 1870, our founding brand, Old Forester, was first introduced into the U.S. Today, we now have a portfolio of over 40 premium and super-premium brands sold around the globe. Since our founding, the company's been agile and resilient in navigating through many challenges, including things like prohibition, world wars and economic recessions, just to name a few historical events.
Today, we find ourselves amid trade wars resulting in tariffs that are weighing on our industry, geopolitical events that are disrupting many countries around the world and now a virus that is threatening the global economy. While the headwinds feel pretty strong right now, Brown-Forman has continued to grow throughout our history and remains a strong, healthy company, supported by the commitment of our long-term shareholders and, importantly, our dedicated and talented employees around the world.
So now on to the performance of the company. Jane is going to take us through the company's financial results in a moment. But first, I'd like to provide an update on our progress toward our strategic ambitions. As you've heard me discuss on previous calls, we continue to evaluate our performance, both on a geographic and through a portfolio lens. From a geographic perspective, 18 of our 20 largest markets are delivering underlying net sales growth this year, highlighting the strong benefits of our geographic diversification. As a side note, this does not include Travel Retail, which actually is in decline, and we can talk a little bit about later. However, the growth rates of plus 3% underlying net sales year-to-date for the company are below historical norms and they're also below our expectations, but we believe going forward these rates will return to more historical numbers and we will talk about that throughout the rest of this call.
From a portfolio perspective, our premium and our super-premium brands are well positioned to continue to deliver accelerating top line momentum with leading positions in some of the most attractive and fastest-growing spirits categories, such as whiskey and tequila. In particular, the super-premium brands in our portfolio are propelling the company's growth, both in the U.S. and increasingly on international markets, becoming a more powerful growth driver for the company. So to get into a couple of the specific brand performance issues. Look, the Jack Daniel's family of brands underlying net sales is plus 3% year-to-date, essentially in line with the company's growth rate. We've encountered some near-term challenges for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, which is the core, the Black Label brand, in some of our international markets. Jane is going to talk more about this in her remarks when we get into the market-by-market analysis. But from a strategic perspective, we believe we still have the right strategy in place to deliver long-term profitable growth, and we are investing behind the opportunities.
Jack Daniel's RTD business is now over 9 million cases globally and continues to deliver solid growth as the increasingly popular RTD format provides Jack Daniel's consumers with convenience in their drinking occasions. We continue also to focus on the versatility of our portfolio through innovation, which has resulted in the creation of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey and Fire over the last 9 years. These 2 brands now contribute 2.4 million 9-liter cases at very attractive margins and are connecting new consumers to the Jack Daniel's trademark. With the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple, which is off to a strong start in the United States, we are continuing to drive innovation and diversifying the portfolio. And for our international consumers, we're gearing up for the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple, and it should begin to appear on retail shelves in the next few months.
In Gentleman Jack, which we don't talk about quite as often, one of our super-premium family members, is now nearly 700,000 cases and continues to deliver strong international growth. We've also made notable progress towards our strategic ambition of increasing the scale of our super-premium portfolio. Woodford Reserve remain the leader in the super-premium bourbon category and has been consistently growing strong double digits since its introduction 20 years ago or more -- 22 years ago. Supported by its excellent track record along with innovations such as Double Oaked, Woodford Reserve has eclipsed 1 million 9-liter cases and is one of the largest growth contributors to the company. Looking ahead, we'll be focusing on the international development of this incredible brand with incremental resources being invested in a number of key markets around the world.
And as I mentioned a few minutes ago, Old Forester is celebrating its 150th anniversary this year. It continues to present itself as a leader in American whiskey. The brand is steeped in a reputation of quality and innovation with its core expressions and has increasing popularity with its Whiskey Row series. This brand has been registering impressive gains in the bourbon category and is becoming an increasingly meaningful growth driver for the company. Like Brown-Forman, coincidentally, Herradura was also founded in 1870 and is also celebrating its 150th anniversary. Since we purchased the brands over 12 years ago, the super-premium tequila category in the U.S. has shown dramatic growth. To note, Herradura's underlying net sales are up 20% year-to-date and it's grown to over 600,000 cases with nearly half of its volume outside of Mexico. However, the unprecedented cost of externally sourced agave is putting pressure on gross margins.
To help mitigate, we've been able to increase prices and accelerate the growth of ultra, our higher-priced innovation, which is now nearly 20% of the business. We expect cost pressure to continue, however, through fiscal '21 and continuing -- but continuing our strong sales trends. Forward-looking, Herradura and el Jimador are well positioned in the fast-growing super-premium and ultra-premium segments. Our Single Malt Scotch portfolio is also performing very well led by GlenDronach, which has been -- experienced considerable growth and has a very promising future. In our other emerging brands, things like Slane Irish Whiskey and Coopers bourbon and Fords Gin, while newer in their development, continue to show potential for very meaningful growth. So generally speaking, we feel very confident across the different brands in our portfolio and the many levers of growth that we can pull upon.
Geographically, I'm very pleased with the success of our U.S. business this fiscal year-to-date. U.S. is not only our largest market, but it is leading our growth in our 150th year. In the most valuable global spirits market in the world, Brown-Forman takeaway trends are outpacing TDS, driven largely by our American whiskey and flavored whiskey portfolios as well as our tequila brands. The launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple has also, as I said, gone very smoothly and is accelerating growth to our overall plan. However, we recognize we need better performance on Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey in the U.S. But it is worth noting that we can outpace TDS with essentially flat to low single-digit performance on our biggest brand. We could not have said that even a few years ago, but our bourbon and tequila brands have gotten big enough that they actually have a meaningful impact on the overall trends in the U.S. business.
Developed international are having a relatively weak fiscal '20 as the U.K., Australia and Japan are weighing on performance. Where we have made investments in our route-to-consumer, places such as France and Spain and Germany, our business is healthy, and we've been able to broaden our portfolio of brands. In the U.K., which is the second largest market in the world for Brown-Forman, we're in the final stages of investing in a highly talented team and we'll soon assume full control over our route-to-consumer, which, we believe, will reaccelerate growth in this market into the next fiscal year, and expectations are that this will be a strong market for us into the future.
Our emerging markets are being led by BRIC this year. All 4 are providing strong underlying net sales growth, largely driven by Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey. Also worth pointing out is Southeast Asia is producing strong underlying double-digit growth. For the first time in a while, Asia really has been delivering solid growth this year. However, these markets are likely to suffer in the near-term as a result of the impacts from coronavirus. I am, however, very encouraged that our brands are -- how our brands are resonating with consumers. And looking into the future, I do think that Asia is a part of the world where we are relatively small, but fast growing, which I do think bodes well for the future opportunity we have there.
To the coronavirus situation, just briefly, I do want to pause and take a moment, say the health and safety of our employees is paramount. Like other companies, we've taken steps to limit our employees' risk by limiting travel, canceling certain meetings, providing up-to-date information from the CDC and the World Health Organization and ensuring our flexible work policies are being utilized. There's so many unknowns right now, and it's difficult to quantify the financial impact. Jane will try to walk you through our thinking on this difficult topic.
So in summary, we're expanding the breadth of our premium and super-premium portfolio both geographically and diversifying our revenue base in categories with the strongest momentum. We continue to have confidence in our long-term global growth potential. Currently -- although currently our overall growth rate is a bit below historical trends and our expectations, these are largely driven by multiple short-term disruptions coming together in 1 fiscal year. We believe through continuing to execute our long-term growth strategy, focused on portfolio, geography, investments in our people will continue to extend our leadership in premium American whiskey around the world and continue our track record of consistently delivering profitable growth. While the near-term challenges remain, we will weather the storm as we have throughout our 150 years as we relentlessly focus on creating value for our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jane to review more detail in our financial performance that we released this morning."

Over the next several minutes or so, I plan on walking you through 2 items. First, our third quarter and year-to-date results, which, as Lawson just said a moment ago, are a bit lower than we had expected at",2445,"Thank you, Lawson, and good morning, everyone. Over the next several minutes or so, I plan on walking you through 2 items. First, our third quarter and year-to-date results, which, as Lawson just said a moment ago, are a bit lower than we had expected at this point in the year, driven largely by performance in some of our international markets. I'll discuss that in more detail as I go throughout my presentation this morning. And then, secondly, I'm going to review our full year outlook, which we revised to reflect 2 things: one, a tempered expectations in some of our international markets; and two, the increasingly uncertain global economic outlook, which includes an estimate of the effect the coronavirus may have on our business globally, including our Global Travel Retail business in Asia.
So let's begin with our actual performance. First, our underlying net sales grew 3% in the quarter, slower than we had anticipated, but consistent with the company's first half results. Second, while the impact of retaliatory tariffs, particularly from Europe, will continue to weigh on our margins and profits for the full year, the year-over-year effect began to ease a bit in our quarter 3. In fact, our underlying gross profit grew for the quarter for the first time since the cost of tariffs began affecting us, up 3%, consistent with our top line. The cycling of tariffs also helped to boost our underlying operating income growth in the quarter, up 5%. Consistent with our third quarter performance, our year-to-date underlying net sales grew 3% on top of 5% growth in the same period last year, but again slower than we had anticipated we would be at this point in our fiscal year.
So breaking down our underlying net sales performance by geography, just there's a bit more color on what Lawson just provided. Again, the U.S., our largest market, representing nearly half our sales, continued to lead our growth, growing 6% underlying net sales year-to-date, the market's strongest rate of growth registered in 4 years. This growth was fueled by the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple and sustained double-digit underlying net sales growth from our premium bourbon brands, notably Woodford Reserve and Old Forester, and our tequila brands in aggregate. This strong growth, again, as Lawson said, in the world's most valuable spirits market was also supported by improving takeaway trends, which accelerated over the past quarter and are now growing ahead of our -- the healthy total distilled spirits mid-single-digit growth for the first time in over 18 months.
In our emerging markets, we also experienced another quarter of sequential improvement in growth, with underlying net sales up 6% year-to-date on top of last year's double-digit gains. The acceleration was less than expected at this point in the year, due in part to route-to-market disruptions in Africa and macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges, which have begun to weigh more heavily on certain markets in the CIS and Latin America. One of our largest emerging markets are -- actually our largest emerging market, Mexico, where we grew underlying net sales double digits last year at this time is now growing in the low single digits through the third quarter, reflecting a weakening economy.
If we were to exclude Mexico and the rest of Latin America, CIS and Africa, our emerging markets grew underlying net sales double digits. So despite seeing some pockets of slowdown, strong double-digit underlying net sales growth was delivered across a number of emerging markets, including Turkey, Russia, China and parts of Southeast Asia, led by strong volume growth of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey. Poland also returned to mid-single-digit underlying growth year-to-date, following a very strong quarter for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey. And I thought I'd pause for a moment and discuss our performance in Asia.
Over the past nearly 2 years, we've been quite pleased with the momentum and increasing contribution we've been experiencing from this part of the world. Specifically, our business in China has been growing underlying net sales at a double-digit rate since fiscal 2018, led in large part by our growing e-premise business where we have been focusing our investment in this market. Our performance through January had essentially not been affected by the coronavirus. So understandably, we do expect a marked slowdown in our fourth quarter in this market and other parts of Asia and have already experienced this in February. Despite this near-term headwind, we remain optimistic about the long-term growth potential for our portfolio throughout Asia. 
Similar to the first half of the year, our developed international markets delivered 2% growth in underlying net sales year-to-date. This growth was led by Germany, Czechia, France, Spain and Korea, reflecting strong growth of Jack Daniel's RTDs, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey and our super-premium American whiskey portfolio, Woodford Reserve and Gentleman Jack. In the U.K., our largest market outside the U.S., underlying net sales declined in the first 9 months. You may recall that we are navigating through multiple challenges in this market this year, including: first, the upcoming route-to-consumer change in May; two, changes in our promotional strategy; and three, softness in the cash and carry channel. So all combined, we experienced what we believe is some short-term disruption. We expect the negative trends in this market to ease as we move into next fiscal year.
In addition to some softer than planned results in the U.K., the devastating fires in Australia have also contributed to our developed international markets growing less than expected. Our Global Travel Retail business, which had declined in the first and second quarter of this fiscal year, grew underlying net sales single -- grew net sales high single digits in the third quarter, due in part to easy comparisons to the same quarter a year ago. Despite improvement in the trend, Global Travel Retail remains a drag on our top line, with underlying net sales down 3% year-to-date.
While we experienced some improvement in the quarter and had anticipated further improvement in the fourth quarter, resulting from the phasing of certain customer purchases, we now estimate that as a result of the coronavirus, our Travel Retail business for the full year will be down similar to year-to-date performance. Our used barrel business declined significantly in the third quarter. The decline in this business reflects both a reduction in demand due in part to the U.S. tariff impact on Single Malt Scotch Whiskey; and secondly, softening prices driven by the increased supply of the used barrels in the market. This business and our other nonbranded business, which includes contract bottling and bulk whiskey and bulk wine sales, have negatively affected our underlying net sales year-to-date by about 1 percentage point.
Now looking at our business through a portfolio lens. Consistent with the drivers of our growth for the first half of the year, our premium whiskey brands, Jack Daniel's RTD, Jack Daniel's flavors and tequilas, remain the key contributors. As Lawson mentioned, Woodford Reserve continued its consistent double-digit underlying net sales gains, fueled by strong consumer momentum in the United States and is now over 1 million case super-premium brand globally. With only 20% of its volume outside of the United States, growing at an even faster rate, we believe the brand has a significant run rate for geographic expansion.
Tequila has delivered underlying net sales growth of 10% year-to-date, pulled down modestly by our pricing actions on the Pepe Lopez mix fill brand in the U.S. Our consumer takeaway trends in the U.S. remain very strong. For Herradura specifically, in addition to the strong takeaway trends in the U.S. and increasing volumes in Mexico, higher prices and a favorable product mix in both the U.S. and Mexico helped to deliver the 20% growth in underlying net sales year-to-date. Jack Daniel's RTDs grew underlying net sales mid-single digits on a year-to-date basis, driven by volumetric gains in Germany and the U.S. and introduction and launch in France. 
JD flavors continued its broad-based geographic growth, most notably in the U.S., France, Poland, Czechia and Brazil. As it relates to the successful launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple in the U.S., the brand remained on track to deliver about 1 percentage point of growth for the company this year. Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey underlying net sales were essentially flat as year-to-date growth in emerging markets were offset by declines for the brand in the U.K. and our Travel Retail channel.
Moving down the P&L to gross margins. Year-to-date gross margins declined 220 basis points year-over-year reflecting -- resulting in flat underlying gross profit growth through the first 9 months. The reduction in gross margin was driven by the same 2 factors we've highlighted for the last 3 earnings call: first, our input cost reflecting agave and wood inflation; and secondly, tariff related costs. As I mentioned earlier, while the impact of tariff-related costs will continue to impact the full year margin, as we began to cycle prior year periods that were affected by tariffs, the year-over-year effect began to ease in the quarter with 100 basis point compression for the first 9 months compared to 200 basis points through the first half. We continue to invest behind our brands with underlying A&P spending up 3% year-to-date, in line with our top line growth. As we've discussed on previous calls, the effective increase in our spend is much higher given the significant reallocation we took this fiscal year to increase our efficiencies from high touch spend to broad reach media and digital investments, along with our increase in activations and promotion activities. 
On the SG&A front, we remain committed to a disciplined approach to our investment, looking for opportunities to continue to gain efficiencies, including productivity initiatives that ultimately results in operating leverage. It is important to note, however, that while we continue to leverage prior investments, we've also increased our SG&A in markets where we see opportunity to heighten our focus on building our brands and accelerating our growth. For example, a key element of this can be seen in our third quarter of this fiscal year as we began to invest in the U.K., opening a new office and creating and forming the team and capabilities that we believe will support building our broader portfolio of brands in our new route to market structure that will begin on May 1. In the aggregate, both our reported and underlying operating income declined modestly year-to-date, driven in part by an approximate 3 percentage point drag related to tariff related costs. An effective tax rate of just over 17%, which includes a couple of discrete items year-to-date, drove 4% growth in diluted earnings per share to $1.45.
Now turning to my final topic this morning, an update on our fiscal 2020 full year outlook. There are really 2 sets of factors weighing on our outlook, which I will describe in turn that has led us to revising our full year underlying net sales growth from 5% to 7% to low single digits. First, tempered expectations from some international markets, reflecting short-term disruptions and macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds. Specifically, to discuss, the U.K., our largest international market, is experiencing short-term changes and disruptions, including the transition to our own route to market in just a few months. The economy of our largest emerging market, Mexico, continues to weakening. The strengthening U.S. dollar has made our brands more expensive to our customers and consumers in certain other emerging markets, such as Latin America and CIS, further exacerbating the uncertainty and unpredictability of demand. And finally, unplanned destocking in Travel Retail.
Now turning to the second factor weighing on our outlook, the uncertainty and unpredictability, the effect the coronavirus may have on our business globally, including the current, most effective areas, Travel Retail in Asia, most notably China. Included in our outlook is an estimate of some additional deterioration that is likely if this continues to evolve globally. We continue to expect gross margins will be down around 200 basis points for the year, again, split between tariff-related costs and higher input costs. Regarding our operating costs for the full year, despite the volatile and uncertain markets, we continue to build our brands, investing behind them roughly in line with our net sales growth. We're expecting SG&A to now be flat for the year, continuing to provide leverage to operating income.
We've reduced our underlying operating income outlook from a range of 2% to 4% to flat to modestly down, driven by lower top line expectations that I just discussed. We narrowed our earnings per share outlook from $1.75 to $1.85 to $1.75 to $1.80, still benefiting from a lower effective tax rate. So lastly, while our expectations for growth this year are now below our initial range, we continue to believe there is a long runway of opportunities ahead for our brand. Our teams are experienced, as Lawson said, weathering these uncertain times and are focused on accelerating our business back towards our consistent historic rates of growth. However, we are cognizant of the current market dynamics that may limit our near-term improvement.
In the meantime, we believe our business remains very attractive with nice margins resulting from the efficiency and historic consistency in our revenue growth, industry-leading return on invested capital and ample free cash flow. Over many years, we have followed a systematic approach to our capital allocation that has served us well: first, reinvesting back into the business to meet future demand; second, growing our cash dividends; and in the absence of meaningful M&A opportunities we return excess cash to shareholders through special dividends and share repurchases. Currently, we continue to invest behind the business and expanding our production capabilities, increasing whiskey inventories to meet future growth expectations, investing in technology to not only improve our efficiencies throughout all of our functions of the company but also to drive growth-based analytic insights such as our revenue management platform.
We continue to return cash to shareholders as we always have, thoughtfully, disciplined and consistently, including increasing our cash dividend for this calendar year by 5%. While we have been navigating near-term challenges, including tariffs and the increasingly uncertain and volatile world, we continue to manage our business as we always have for the long term. Strong support from our shareholders, as Lawson also said, including the Brown family, enables this long horizon, which is essential to the company's steeped and aged spirits. We believe our portfolio of premium, super-premium whiskey and tequila brands position us well to continue creating value for all of our shareholders.
And with that, this concludes our prepared remarks. Dorothy, please open the call up for questions."

Look, I mean, I think obviously we're not giving out guidance yet for next fiscal year. But I think as you look at our business in general, we feel pretty confident on the U.S. business these days as it is sort of above TDS, and I would expect that to continue. As I said in my prepared remarks, even with Jack at sort of subdued rates, we're able to grow above the TDS number. So -- and believe me, there are a lot of plans and there's a lot of action, a lot of activity going around to try to improve the growth rates on Tennessee Whiskey. And if that happens, we're even, I would call it, more confident in the U.S. market. So that feels pretty good. The developed international side of things is subdued, but it largely -- as Jane said, that's largely the U.K. There are other markets that are not kicking on all cylinders these days.
But I think we can get that -- we'll get that category of markets, the developed international, back into what its traditional range would be mid to even a little bit better than mid-single-digit growth. But I'll take mid-single digits out of that part of the world. And emerging is the volatile one. It's always been the volatile one. It's been growing at a rate above our company average now for a number of years. It has slowed this year, as we said, largely because of Mexico. Asia is the wild card in this. And I don't know how to tell you to -- we're trying to think about what is the growth rate for that part of the world going to be, because right now it's solid. But we're going to be a little more subdued. And I think at the end of the day, we're going to be -- we use the word around here agility a lot. You're going to have to be agile next year because while things do have a tough outlook, the comps are going to be a little bit easier next year, and I could see some bounce backs and some other things that make it -- that turn it into a pretty good year. So not directly answering your question because we have not provided that guidance yet, but I think we generally feel pretty good on the top line, that things will return to what I call a more normalized growth rate."

With that being said, we had -- as we've talked about the Travel Retail business before, it's quite lumpy and volatile anyhow from quarter-to-quarter and when people purchase. And so we had the strong growth at the beginning of last year first half and now we're cycling against some softer growth in the second half for Travel Retail. We still do expect some improvement, but that will be offset by this coronavirus on our business and the global -- just people less traveling internationally. So we -- but that's what I would answer your question in terms of why theirs are different than ours, smaller, and it's where they're concentrating."

We just -- that was more precise thing, cash and carry this time. The increased promotional strategy, you're right. It was planned. And it's something that we're doing as we get ready to own our own distribution come May. And that's why when we look ahead to this market and the optimism we have going forward versus what we have had this year, we will be in control of a lot of our decisions of working with the grocers and determining the pricing strategies. And right now that doesn't always happen. And so that's important for us as we go forward. Just a reminder why we made this decision to go on our own route-to-consumer in the U.K. This relationship has probably served us quite well. It started in 2002, served both companies quite well, but we had very limited portfolio at that time, I don't know, 10, 12, 15 brands. And now combined, we have over 100 brands. So you can only imagine the lack of attention, focus, prioritization, understanding the consumer and focus on our own portfolio. And so we haven't transitioned yet. That, again, is May 1. But we believe the focus, the prioritization, the understanding the consumers, the more direct contact with our customers, if you will, will allow us to not only accelerate our business there, but get our rest of our portfolio growing quite nicely."

So on the pricing or the promotional question you asked a little bit earlier, I mean, the -- look, if we're totally honest, the amount of promotion in the U.K. market got too big. And so we're trying to reduce that a little bit and get some pricing up, and we're working on that slowly. It's not a -- I mean you have to do it slowly with the European retail world, but we're paying the price necessarily. We're just seeing short-term disruption with some of our customers as we do a little bit less promoting. We do think in the long run it's the smart thing to do.

Let me just pause for a minute, as we want to be super clear here with what we have in our forecast. So again, if you looked at what we did, we took our overall forecast down, as you saw. We reduced our underlying forecast with 2 factors. First, it was the tempering of the growth and contribution from some of our international markets, again reflecting some short-term disruptions as well these macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges. So when we look at our base business, what we would estimate now that our base business is doing is probably growing in the 3.5% to 4.5% range. It is, therefore, a couple of points less than what our expectations were just 3 months ago. But the second factor that we built into our forecast -- and this is what you're asking specifically about, Vivien, led to our reduction in our top line outlook. And again not surprising is this unpredictability and uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus and what it may have on our business globally.
So we've estimated at this point, there's about 1 point drag, including those markets that are currently affected. So to your point directly on the Asian markets, including China and other parts of Asia, Travel Retail and we have in -- Italy in there. So collectively, that's about 8% of our business. And as I said earlier, yes, we've already seen areas -- many of these areas already affected in our February results. But that being said, we also have, in that 1%, some additional downside impact. And we don't know, none of us knows, that's going to be enough, too much. We're learning daily as this situation, and so we're really only looking at our fourth quarter. We haven't tried estimating downstream, secondary effects on anything beyond the demand we see and then an expectation for perhaps it's spreading to some other markets. We don't know about the economy and the consumer confidence and sentiment and how they may linger into our first quarter and summer months. So we'll obviously come back in June with more guidance on that for next year. And I know I went into a little bit more detail, but I thought it was important to just to phrase it for you or put it in perspective in terms of where we are and that why we did reduce our guidance into the 2 buckets."

And just as a reminder on that, we've been consistently saying that we expect agave cost to continue to increase through calendar year -- most of calendar '21. So in other words, we won't start seeing any easing to the back half of calendar '21, early calendar '22, so just as a reminder. I mean, we've got that information based upon what is publicly available from the CRT. So we can see when planting started to accelerate and we kind of know what the demand is. And so we can see, by the way, tons of plantings more recently. So we know 6 or 7 years from now we'll have -- there probably will be lots of pressure on pricing at that point in time. But in the near term, again, it's going to be late calendar '21, early calendar '22 before we see cost pressures. But now with that being said, Bryan, it's important to note that what we're seeing in the market, where we had seen like a fivefold increase from 2015 in the price of the agave, it really -- and it rapidly increased during 2016 through mid last year we have seen some slowing. It's still growing, but not at the -- and still at unprecedented dollar -- I guess peso cost, if you will, but it's just not growing just rapidly. So that perhaps is a bit of a good news there, if you will. As it relates to the cost of wood, we have seen some moderation in that. But again, you're not going to start to see that come through our P&L because of our aged products 4 years from now. And coupled with that, we have capital investments that we've made. So all of that's got to factor in. That will come through our P&L for 4 years because of our aged products."

But when we've done the work, and it's the same thing that we've said sort of on prior -- when this has come up in prior conversations around Fire and Honey, there's been almost no cannibalization, to be honest, I think it probably surprises a little bit, but it just hasn't been there. There's -- it really has been successful in bringing in new consumers in different occasions, and it just feels -- it feels like it is showing through the analysis that we do that it's tiny. I mean, it's almost -- truly on what we've done so far year-to-date on the impact on Black Label, it's imperceptible, I mean, literally a few thousand cases kind of thing, but it's not the reason that the Tennessee Whiskey brand in the U.S. has slowed down like you'd asked. Another piece of it, I guess, on a volumetric basis, Black Label is up nearly 3% at the same time that we've released Apple. So I think that also gives us some confidence that just the cannibalization is not there."

This morning's conference call contains forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Numerous risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected in these statements. Many of the factors that will determine future results are beyond the company's ability to control or predict. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, and the company undertakes no obligation to update any of these statements, whether due to new information, future events or otherwise.
This morning, we released a press release containing our results for the third quarter fiscal 2020 in addition to posting presentation materials that Jane will walk through momentarily. Both the release and the presentation can be found on our website under the section titled Investors, Events & Presentations. In the press release, we have listed a number of risk factors that you should consider in conjunction with our forward-looking statements. Other significant risk factors are described in our Form 10-K and Form 10-Q reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
During this call, we will be delivering certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures, a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the reasons management believes they provide useful information to investors regarding the company's financial conditions and results of operations are contained in the press release and investor presentation.
One last note this morning. The state of Kentucky will be conducting a statewide tornado drill at 10:07 this morning. We are not certain if this will create any disruption to our call. If necessarily, we may need to mute the line for a moment, and we apologize in advance for any potential disruption.

Thank you, Leanne, and good morning, everyone. Before I comment on our year-to-date performance, I do want to take just a short moment to recognize what a special time it is to be part of Brown-Forman as we enter our 150th year. Back in 1",1731,"All right. Good. Thank you, Leanne, and good morning, everyone. Before I comment on our year-to-date performance, I do want to take just a short moment to recognize what a special time it is to be part of Brown-Forman as we enter our 150th year. Back in 1870, our founding brand, Old Forester, was first introduced into the U.S. Today, we now have a portfolio of over 40 premium and super-premium brands sold around the globe. Since our founding, the company's been agile and resilient in navigating through many challenges, including things like prohibition, world wars and economic recessions, just to name a few historical events.
Today, we find ourselves amid trade wars resulting in tariffs that are weighing on our industry, geopolitical events that are disrupting many countries around the world and now a virus that is threatening the global economy. While the headwinds feel pretty strong right now, Brown-Forman has continued to grow throughout our history and remains a strong, healthy company, supported by the commitment of our long-term shareholders and, importantly, our dedicated and talented employees around the world.
So now on to the performance of the company. Jane is going to take us through the company's financial results in a moment. But first, I'd like to provide an update on our progress toward our strategic ambitions. As you've heard me discuss on previous calls, we continue to evaluate our performance, both on a geographic and through a portfolio lens. From a geographic perspective, 18 of our 20 largest markets are delivering underlying net sales growth this year, highlighting the strong benefits of our geographic diversification. As a side note, this does not include Travel Retail, which actually is in decline, and we can talk a little bit about later. However, the growth rates of plus 3% underlying net sales year-to-date for the company are below historical norms and they're also below our expectations, but we believe going forward these rates will return to more historical numbers and we will talk about that throughout the rest of this call.
From a portfolio perspective, our premium and our super-premium brands are well positioned to continue to deliver accelerating top line momentum with leading positions in some of the most attractive and fastest-growing spirits categories, such as whiskey and tequila. In particular, the super-premium brands in our portfolio are propelling the company's growth, both in the U.S. and increasingly our international markets, becoming a more powerful growth driver for the company. So to get into a couple of the specific brand performance issues. Look, the Jack Daniel's family of brands underlying net sales is plus 3% year-to-date, essentially in line with the company's growth rate. We've encountered some near-term challenges for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, which is the core, the Black Label brand, in some of our international markets. Jane is going to talk more about this in her remarks when we get into the market-by-market analysis. But from a strategic perspective, we believe we still have the right strategy in place to deliver long-term profitable growth, and we are investing behind the opportunities.
Jack Daniel's RTD business is now over 9 million cases globally and continues to deliver solid growth as the increasingly popular RTD format provides Jack Daniel's consumers with convenience in their drinking occasions. We continue also to focus on the versatility of our portfolio through innovation, which has resulted in the creation of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey and Fire over the last 9 years. These 2 brands now contribute 2.4 million 9-liter cases at very attractive margins and are connecting new consumers to the Jack Daniel's trademark. With the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple, which is off to a strong start in the United States, we are continuing to drive innovation and diversifying the portfolio. And for our international consumers, we're gearing up for the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple, and it should begin to appear on retail shelves in the next few months.
In Gentleman Jack, which we don't talk about quite as often, one of our super-premium family members, is now nearly 700,000 cases and continues to deliver strong international growth. We've also made notable progress towards our strategic ambition of increasing the scale of our super-premium portfolio. Woodford Reserve remain the leader in the super-premium bourbon category and has been consistently growing strong double digits since its introduction 20 years ago or more -- 22 years ago. Supported by its excellent track record along with innovations such as Double Oaked, Woodford Reserve has eclipsed 1 million 9-liter cases and is one of the largest growth contributors to the company. Looking ahead, we'll be focusing on the international development of this incredible brand with incremental resources being invested in a number of key markets around the world.
And as I mentioned a few minutes ago, Old Forester is celebrating its 150th anniversary this year. It continues to present itself as a leader in American whiskey. The brand is steeped in a reputation of quality and innovation with its core expressions and has increasing popularity with its Whiskey Row series. This brand has been registering impressive gains in the bourbon category and is becoming an increasingly meaningful growth driver for the company. Like Brown-Forman, coincidentally, Herradura was also founded in 1870 and is also celebrating its 150th anniversary. Since we purchased the brands over 12 years ago, the super-premium tequila category in the U.S. has shown dramatic growth. To note, Herradura's underlying net sales are up 20% year-to-date and it's grown to over 600,000 cases with nearly half of its volume outside of Mexico. However, the unprecedented cost of externally sourced agave is putting pressure on gross margins.
To help mitigate, we've been able to increase prices and accelerate the growth of ultra, our higher-priced innovation, which is now nearly 20% of the business. We expect cost pressure to continue, however, through fiscal '21 and continuing -- but continuing our strong sales trends. Forward-looking, Herradura and el Jimador are well positioned in the fast-growing super-premium and ultra-premium segments. Our Single Malt Scotch portfolio is also performing very well led by GlenDronach, which has been -- experienced considerable growth and has a very promising future. In our other emerging brands, things like Slane Irish Whiskey and Coopers bourbon and Fords Gin, while newer in their development, continue to show potential for very meaningful growth. So generally speaking, we feel very confident across the different brands in our portfolio and the many levers of growth that we can pull upon.
Geographically, I'm very pleased with the success of our U.S. business this fiscal year-to-date. U.S. is not only our largest market, but it is leading our growth in our 150th year. In the most valuable global spirits market in the world, Brown-Forman takeaway trends are outpacing TDS, driven largely by our American whiskey and flavored whiskey portfolios as well as our tequila brands. The launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple has also, as I said, gone very smoothly and is accelerating growth to our overall plan. However, we recognize we need better performance on Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey in the U.S. But it is worth noting that we can outpace TDS with essentially flat to low single-digit performance on our biggest brand. We could not have said that even a few years ago, but our bourbon and tequila brands have gotten big enough that they actually have a meaningful impact on the overall trends in the U.S. business.
Developed international are having a relatively weak fiscal '20 as the U.K., Australia and Japan are weighing on performance. Where we have made investments in our route-to-consumer, places such as France and Spain and Germany, our business is healthy, and we've been able to broaden our portfolio of brands. In the U.K., which is the second largest market in the world for Brown-Forman, we're in the final stages of investing in a highly talented team and we'll soon assume full control over our route-to-consumer, which, we believe, will reaccelerate growth in this market into the next fiscal year, and expectations are that this will be a strong market for us into the future.
Our emerging markets are being led by BRIC this year. All 4 are providing strong underlying net sales growth, largely driven by Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey. Also worth pointing out is Southeast Asia is producing strong underlying double-digit growth. For the first time in a while, Asia really has been delivering solid growth this year. However, these markets are likely to suffer in the near-term as a result of the impacts from coronavirus. I am, however, very encouraged that our brands are -- how our brands are resonating with consumers. And looking into the future, I do think that Asia is a part of the world where we are relatively small, but fast growing, which I do think bodes well for the future opportunity we have there.
To the coronavirus situation, just briefly, I do want to pause and take a moment, say the health and safety of our employees is paramount. Like other companies, we've taken steps to limit our employees' risk by limiting travel, canceling certain meetings, providing up-to-date information from the CDC and the World Health Organization and ensuring our flexible work policies are being utilized. There's so many unknowns right now, and it's difficult to quantify the financial impact. Jane will try to walk you through our thinking on this difficult topic.
So in summary, we're expanding the breadth of our premium and super-premium portfolio both geographically and diversifying our revenue base in categories with the strongest momentum. We continue to have confidence in our long-term global growth potential. Currently -- although currently our overall growth rate is a bit below historical trends and our expectations, these are largely driven by multiple short-term disruptions coming together in 1 fiscal year. We believe through continuing to execute our long-term growth strategy, focused on portfolio, geography, investments in our people will continue to extend our leadership in premium American whiskey around the world and continue our track record of consistently delivering profitable growth. While the near-term challenges remain, we will weather the storm as we have throughout our 150 years as we relentlessly focus on creating value for our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jane to review more detail in our financial performance that we released this morning."

Over the next several minutes or so, I plan on walking you through 2 items. First, our third quarter and year-to-date results, which, as Lawson just said a moment ago, are a bit lower than we had expected at",2445,"Thank you, Lawson, and good morning, everyone. Over the next several minutes or so, I plan on walking you through 2 items. First, our third quarter and year-to-date results, which, as Lawson just said a moment ago, are a bit lower than we had expected at this point in the year, driven largely by performance in some of our international markets. I'll discuss that in more detail as I go throughout my presentation this morning. And then, secondly, I'm going to review our full year outlook, which we revised to reflect 2 things: one, a tempered expectations in some of our international markets; and two, the increasingly uncertain global economic outlook, which includes an estimate of the effect the coronavirus may have on our business globally, including our Global Travel Retail business in Asia.
So let's begin with our actual performance. First, our underlying net sales grew 3% in the quarter, slower than we had anticipated, but consistent with the company's first half results. Second, while the impact of retaliatory tariffs, particularly from Europe, will continue to weigh on our margins and profits for the full year, the year-over-year effect began to ease a bit in our quarter 3. In fact, our underlying gross profit grew for the quarter for the first time since the cost of tariffs began affecting us, up 3%, consistent with our top line. The cycling of tariffs also helped to boost our underlying operating income growth in the quarter, up 5%. Consistent with our third quarter performance, our year-to-date underlying net sales grew 3% on top of 5% growth in the same period last year, but again slower than we had anticipated we would be at this point in our fiscal year.
So breaking down our underlying net sales performance by geography, just there's a bit more color on what Lawson just provided. Again, the U.S., our largest market, representing nearly half our sales, continued to lead our growth, growing 6% underlying net sales year-to-date, the market's strongest rate of growth registered in 4 years. This growth was fueled by the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple and sustained double-digit underlying net sales growth from our premium bourbon brands, notably Woodford Reserve and Old Forester, and our tequila brands in aggregate. This strong growth, again, as Lawson said, in the world's most valuable spirits market was also supported by improving takeaway trends, which accelerated over the past quarter and are now growing ahead of our -- the healthy total distilled spirits mid-single-digit growth for the first time in over 18 months.
In our emerging markets, we also experienced another quarter of sequential improvement in growth, with underlying net sales up 6% year-to-date on top of last year's double-digit gains. The acceleration was less than expected at this point in the year, due in part to route-to-market disruptions in Africa and macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges, which have begun to weigh more heavily on certain markets in the CIS and Latin America. One of our largest emerging markets are -- actually our largest emerging market, Mexico, where we grew underlying net sales double digits last year at this time is now growing in the low single digits through the third quarter, reflecting a weakening economy.
If we were to exclude Mexico and the rest of Latin America, CIS and Africa, our emerging markets grew underlying net sales double digits. So despite seeing some pockets of slowdown, strong double-digit underlying net sales growth was delivered across a number of emerging markets, including Turkey, Russia, China and parts of Southeast Asia, led by strong volume growth of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey. Poland also returned to mid-single-digit underlying growth year-to-date, following a very strong quarter for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey. And I thought I'd pause for a moment and discuss our performance in Asia.
Over the past nearly 2 years, we've been quite pleased with the momentum and increasing contribution we've been experiencing from this part of the world. Specifically, our business in China has been growing underlying net sales at a double-digit rate since fiscal 2018, led in large part by our growing e-premise business where we have been focusing our investment in this market. Our performance through January had essentially not been affected by the coronavirus. So understandably, we do expect a marked slowdown in our fourth quarter in this market and other parts of Asia and have already experienced this in February. Despite this near-term headwind, we remain optimistic about the long-term growth potential for our portfolio throughout Asia. 
Similar to the first half of the year, our developed international markets delivered 2% growth in underlying net sales year-to-date. This growth was led by Germany, Czechia, France, Spain and Korea, reflecting strong growth of Jack Daniel's RTDs, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey and our super-premium American whiskey portfolio, Woodford Reserve and Gentleman Jack. In the U.K., our largest market outside the U.S., underlying net sales declined in the first 9 months. You may recall that we are navigating through multiple challenges in this market this year, including: first, the upcoming route-to-consumer change in May; two, changes in our promotional strategy; and three, softness in the cash and carry channel. So all combined, we experienced what we believe is some short-term disruption. We expect the negative trends in this market to ease as we move into next fiscal year.
In addition to some softer than planned results in the U.K., the devastating fires in Australia have also contributed to our developed international markets growing less than expected. Our Global Travel Retail business, which had declined in the first and second quarter of this fiscal year, grew underlying net sales single -- grew net sales high single digits in the third quarter, due in part to easy comparisons to the same quarter a year ago. Despite improvement in the trend, Global Travel Retail remains a drag on our top line, with underlying net sales down 3% year-to-date.
While we experienced some improvement in the quarter and had anticipated further improvement in the fourth quarter, resulting from the phasing of certain customer purchases, we now estimate that as a result of the coronavirus, our Travel Retail business for the full year will be down similar to year-to-date performance. Our used barrel business declined significantly in the third quarter. The decline in this business reflects both a reduction in demand due in part to the U.S. tariff impact on Single Malt Scotch Whiskey; and secondly, softening prices driven by the increased supply of the used barrels in the market. This business and our other nonbranded business, which includes contract bottling and bulk whiskey and bulk wine sales, have negatively affected our underlying net sales year-to-date by about 1 percentage point.
Now looking at our business through a portfolio lens. Consistent with the drivers of our growth for the first half of the year, our premium whiskey brands, Jack Daniel's RTD, Jack Daniel's flavors and tequilas, remain the key contributors. As Lawson mentioned, Woodford Reserve continued its consistent double-digit underlying net sales gains, fueled by strong consumer momentum in the United States and is now over 1 million case super-premium brand globally. With only 20% of its volume outside of the United States, growing at an even faster rate, we believe the brand has a significant run rate for geographic expansion.
Tequila has delivered underlying net sales growth of 10% year-to-date, pulled down modestly by our pricing actions on the Pepe Lopez mix fill brand in the U.S. Our consumer takeaway trends in the U.S. remain very strong. For Herradura specifically, in addition to the strong takeaway trends in the U.S. and increasing volumes in Mexico, higher prices and a favorable product mix in both the U.S. and Mexico helped to deliver the 20% growth in underlying net sales year-to-date. Jack Daniel's RTDs grew underlying net sales mid-single digits on a year-to-date basis, driven by volumetric gains in Germany and the U.S. and introduction and launch in France. 
JD flavors continued its broad-based geographic growth, most notably in the U.S., France, Poland, Czechia and Brazil. As it relates to the successful launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple in the U.S., the brand remained on track to deliver about 1 percentage point of growth for the company this year. Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey underlying net sales were essentially flat as year-to-date growth in emerging markets were offset by declines for the brand in the U.K. and our Travel Retail channel.
Moving down the P&L to gross margins. Year-to-date gross margins declined 220 basis points year-over-year reflecting -- resulting in flat underlying gross profit growth through the first 9 months. The reduction in gross margin was driven by the same 2 factors we've highlighted for the last 3 earnings call: first, our input cost reflecting agave and wood inflation; and secondly, tariff related costs. As I mentioned earlier, while the impact of tariff-related costs will continue to impact the full year margin, as we began to cycle prior year periods that were affected by tariffs, the year-over-year effect began to ease in the quarter with 100 basis point compression for the first 9 months compared to 200 basis points through the first half. We continue to invest behind our brands with underlying A&P spending up 3% year-to-date, in line with our top line growth. As we've discussed on previous calls, the effective increase in our spend is much higher given the significant reallocation we took this fiscal year to increase our efficiencies from high touch spend to broad reach media and digital investments, along with our increase in activations and promotion activities. 
On the SG&A front, we remain committed to a disciplined approach to our investment, looking for opportunities to continue to gain efficiencies, including productivity initiatives that ultimately results in operating leverage. It is important to note, however, that while we continue to leverage prior investments, we've also increased our SG&A in markets where we see opportunity to heighten our focus on building our brands and accelerating our growth. For example, a key element of this can be seen in our third quarter of this fiscal year as we began to invest in the U.K., opening a new office and creating and forming the team and capabilities that we believe will support building our broader portfolio of brands in our new route to market structure that will begin on May 1. In the aggregate, both our reported and underlying operating income declined modestly year-to-date, driven in part by an approximate 3 percentage point drag related to tariff related costs. An effective tax rate of just over 17%, which includes a couple of discrete items year-to-date, drove 4% growth in diluted earnings per share to $1.45.
Now turning to my final topic this morning, an update on our fiscal 2020 full year outlook. There are really 2 sets of factors weighing on our outlook, which I will describe in turn that has led us to revising our full year underlying net sales growth from 5% to 7% to low single digits. First, tempered expectations from some international markets, reflecting short-term disruptions and macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds. Specifically, to discuss, the U.K., our largest international market, is experiencing short-term changes and disruptions, including the transition to our own route to market in just a few months. The economy of our largest emerging market, Mexico, continues to weakening. The strengthening U.S. dollar has made our brands more expensive to our customers and consumers in certain other emerging markets, such as Latin America and CIS, further exacerbating the uncertainty and unpredictability of demand. And finally, unplanned destocking in Travel Retail.
Now turning to the second factor weighing on our outlook, the uncertainty and unpredictability, the effect the coronavirus may have on our business globally, including the current, most effective areas, Travel Retail in Asia, most notably China. Included in our outlook is an estimate of some additional deterioration that is likely if this continues to evolve globally. We continue to expect gross margins will be down around 200 basis points for the year, again, split between tariff-related costs and higher input costs. Regarding our operating costs for the full year, despite the volatile and uncertain markets, we continue to build our brands, investing behind them roughly in line with our net sales growth. We're expecting SG&A to now be flat for the year, continuing to provide leverage to operating income.
We've reduced our underlying operating income outlook from a range of 2% to 4% to flat to modestly down, driven by lower top line expectations that I just discussed. We narrowed our earnings per share outlook from $1.75 to $1.85 to $1.75 to $1.80, still benefiting from a lower effective tax rate. So lastly, while our expectations for growth this year are now below our initial range, we continue to believe there is a long runway of opportunities ahead for our brand. Our teams are experienced, as Lawson said, weathering these uncertain times and are focused on accelerating our business back towards our consistent historic rates of growth. However, we are cognizant of the current market dynamics that may limit our near-term improvement.
In the meantime, we believe our business remains very attractive with nice margins resulting from the efficiency and historic consistency in our revenue growth, industry-leading return on invested capital and ample free cash flow. Over many years, we have followed a systematic approach to our capital allocation that has served us well: first, reinvesting back into the business to meet future demand; second, growing our cash dividends; and in the absence of meaningful M&A opportunities we return excess cash to shareholders through special dividends and share repurchases. Currently, we continue to invest behind the business and expanding our production capabilities, increasing whiskey inventories to meet future growth expectations, investing in technology to not only improve our efficiencies throughout all of our functions of the company but also to drive growth-based analytic insights such as our revenue management platform.
We continue to return cash to shareholders as we always have, thoughtfully, disciplined and consistently, including increasing our cash dividend for this calendar year by 5%. While we have been navigating near-term challenges, including tariffs and the increasingly uncertain and volatile world, we continue to manage our business as we always have for the long term. Strong support from our shareholders, as Lawson also said, including the Brown family, enables this long horizon, which is essential to the company's steeped and aged spirits. We believe our portfolio of premium, super-premium whiskey and tequila brands position us well to continue creating value for all of our shareholders.
And with that, this concludes our prepared remarks. Dorothy, please open the call up for questions."

Look, I mean, I think obviously we're not giving out guidance yet for next fiscal year. But I think as you look at our business in general, we feel pretty confident on the U.S. business these days as it is sort of above TDS, and I would expect that to continue. As I said in my prepared remarks, even with Jack at sort of subdued rates, we're able to grow above the TDS number. So -- and believe me, there are a lot of plans and there's a lot of action, a lot of activity going around to try to improve the growth rates on Tennessee Whiskey. And if that happens, we're even, I would call it, more confident in the U.S. market. So that feels pretty good. The developed international side of things is subdued, but it largely -- as Jane said, that's largely the U.K. There are other markets that are not kicking on all cylinders these days.
But I think we can get that -- we'll get that category of markets, the developed international, back into what its traditional range would be mid to even a little bit better than mid-single-digit growth. But I'll take mid-single digits out of that part of the world. And emerging is the volatile one. It's always been the volatile one. It's been growing at a rate above our company average now for a number of years. It has slowed this year, as we said, largely because of Mexico. Asia is the wild card in this. And I don't know how to tell you to -- we're trying to think about what is the growth rate for that part of the world going to be, because right now it's solid. But we're going to be a little more subdued. And I think at the end of the day, we're going to be -- we use the word around here agility a lot. You're going to have to be agile next year because while things do have a tough outlook, the comps are going to be a little bit easier next year, and I could see some bounce backs and some other things that make it -- that turn it into a pretty good year. So not directly answering your question because we have not provided that guidance yet, but I think we generally feel pretty good on the top line, that things will return to what I call a more normalized growth rate."

And so we had the strong growth at the beginning of last year first half and now we're cycling against some softer growth in the second half for Travel Retail. We still do expect some improvement, but that will be offset by this coronavirus on our business and the global -- just people less traveling internationally. So we -- but that's what I would answer your question in terms of why they’re so different than ours, smaller, and it's where they're concentrating."

The cash and carry is limited to a couple customer -- 1 customer really, and so that business, we talked about last time, so that really hasn't changed from our third quarter what we were referring to what was going on there. We just have a more precise thing, cash and carry this time. The increased promotional strategy, you're right. It was planned. And it's something that we're doing as we get ready to own our own distribution come May. And that's why when we look ahead to this market and the optimism we have going forward versus what we have had this year, we will be in control of a lot of our decisions of working with the grocers and determining the pricing strategies. And right now that doesn't always happen. And so that's important for us as we go forward. Just a reminder why we made this decision to go on our own route-to-consumer in the U.K. This relationship has probably served us quite well. It started in 2002, served both companies quite well, but we had very limited portfolio at that time, I don't know, 10, 12, 15 brands. And now combined, we have over 100 brands. So you can only imagine the lack of attention, focus, prioritization, understanding the consumer and focus on our own portfolio. And so we haven't transitioned yet. That, again, is May 1. But we believe the focus, the prioritization, the understanding the consumers, the more direct contact with our customers, if you will, will allow us to not only accelerate our business there, but get our rest of our portfolio growing quite nicely."

So on the pricing or the promotional question you asked a little bit earlier, I mean, the -- look, if we're totally honest, the amount of promotion in the U.K. market got too big. And so we're trying to reduce that a little bit and get some pricing up, and we're working on that slowly. It's not a -- I mean you have to do it slowly with the European retail world, but we're paying the price necessarily. We're just seeing short-term disruption with some of our customers as we do a little bit less promoting. We do think in the long run it's the smart thing to do.

I'm glad you asked the question. Let me just pause for a minute, as we want to be super clear here with what we have in our forecast. So again, if you looked at what we did, we took our overall forecast down, as you saw. We reduced",412,"Yes. Thank you, Vivien. I'm glad you asked the question. Let me just pause for a minute, as we want to be super clear here with what we have in our forecast. So again, if you looked at what we did, we took our overall forecast down, as you saw. We reduced our underlying forecast with 2 factors. First, it was the tempering of the growth and contribution from some of our international markets, again reflecting some short-term disruptions as well these macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges. So when we look at our base business, what we would estimate now that our base business is doing is probably growing in the 3.5% to 4.5% range. It is, therefore, a couple of points less than what our expectations were just 3 months ago. But the second factor that we built into our forecast -- and this is what you're asking specifically about, Vivien, led to our reduction in our top line outlook. And again not surprising is this unpredictability and uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus and what it may have on our business globally.
So we've estimated at this point, there's about 1 point drag, including those markets that are currently affected. So to your point directly from the Asian markets, including China and other parts of Asia, Travel Retail and we have in -- Italy in there. So collectively, that's about 8% of our business. And as I said earlier, yes, we've already seen areas -- many of these areas already affected in our February results. But that being said, we also have, in that 1%, some additional downside impact. And we don't know, none of us knows, that's going to be enough, too much. We're learning daily as this situation, and so we're really only looking at our fourth quarter. We haven't tried estimating downstream, secondary effects on anything beyond the demand we see and then an expectation for perhaps it's spreading to some other markets. We don't know about the economy and the consumer confidence and sentiment and how they may linger into our first quarter and summer months. So we'll obviously come back in June with more guidance on that for next year. So Vivien, I know I went into a little bit more detail, but I thought it was important to just to phrase it for you or put it in perspective in terms of where we are and that why we did reduce our guidance into the 2 buckets."

But it's cost us on the value line, and we want to get that back in balance again. So the idea for next year is certainly to have it more in balance, and that's something that we're working on very hard. And actually I think you'll start to see some of the results of that even in the fourth quarter, which will improve our mix. When you were commenting about the mix, was that a Jack Daniel's question or the full portfolio?"

I'll talk about -- we did talk about tequila, the agave cost a bit. And just as a reminder on that, we've been consistently saying that we expect agave cost to continue to increase through calendar year -- most of calendar '21. So in other words, we won't start seeing any easing to the back half of calendar '21, early calendar '22, so just as a reminder. I mean, we've got that information based upon what is publicly available from the CRT. So we can see when planting started to accelerate and we kind of know what the demand is. And so we can see, by the way, tons of plantings more recently. So we know 6 or 7 years from now we'll have -- there probably will be lots of pressure on pricing at that point in time. But in the near term, again, it's going to be late calendar '21, early calendar '22 before we see cost pressures. But now with that being said, Bryan, it's important to note that what we're seeing in the market, where we had seen like a fivefold increase from 2015 in the price of the agave, it really -- and it rapidly increased during 2016 through mid last year we have seen some slowing. It's still growing, but not at the -- and still at unprecedented dollar -- I guess peso cost, if you will, but it's just not growing just rapidly. So that perhaps is a bit of a good news there, if you will. As it relates to the cost of wood, we have seen some moderation in that. But again, you're not going to start to see that come through our P&L because of our aged products 4 years from now. And coupled with that, we have capital investments that we've made. So all of that's got to factor in. That will come through our P&L for 4 years because of our aged products."

But when we've done the work, and it's the same thing that we've said sort of on prior -- when this has come up in prior conversations around Fire and Honey, there's been almost no cannibalization, to be honest, I think it probably surprises a little bit, but it just hasn't been there. There's -- it really has been successful in bringing in new consumers in different occasions, and it just feels -- it feels like it is showing through the analysis that we do that it's tiny. I mean, it's almost -- truly on what we've done so far year-to-date on the impact on Black Label, it's imperceptible, I mean, literally a few thousand cases kind of thing, but it's not the reason that the Tennessee Whiskey brand in the U.S. has slowed down like you'd asked. Another piece of it, I guess, on a volumetric basis, Black Label is up nearly 3% at the same time that we've released Apple. So I think that also gives us some confidence that just the cannibalization is not there."

This morning's conference call contains forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Numerous risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected in these statements. Many of the factors that will determine future results are beyond the company's ability to control or predict. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, and the company undertakes no obligation to update any of these statements, whether due to new information, future events or otherwise.
This morning, we released a press release containing our results for the third quarter fiscal 2020 in addition to posting presentation materials that Jane will walk through momentarily. Both the release and the presentation can be found on our website under the section titled Investors, Events & Presentations. In the press release, we have listed a number of risk factors that you should consider in conjunction with our forward-looking statements. Other significant risk factors are described in our Form 10-K and Form 10-Q reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
During this call, we will be delivering certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures, a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the reasons management believes they provide useful information to investors regarding the company's financial conditions and results of operations are contained in the press release and investor presentation.
One last note this morning. The state of Kentucky will be conducting a statewide tornado drill at 10:07 this morning. We are not certain if this will create any disruption to our call. If necessarily, we may need to mute the line for a moment, and we apologize in advance for any potential disruption.

Thank you, Leanne, and good morning, everyone. Before I comment on our year-to-date performance, I do want to take just a short moment to recognize what a special time it is to be part of Brown-Forman as we enter our 150th year. Back in 1",1731,"All right. Good. Thank you, Leanne, and good morning, everyone. Before I comment on our year-to-date performance, I do want to take just a short moment to recognize what a special time it is to be part of Brown-Forman as we enter our 150th year. Back in 1870, our founding brand, Old Forester, was first introduced into the U.S. Today, we now have a portfolio of over 40 premium and super-premium brands sold around the globe. Since our founding, the company's been agile and resilient in navigating through many challenges, including things like prohibition, world wars and economic recessions, just to name a few historical events.
Today, we find ourselves amid trade wars resulting in tariffs that are weighing on our industry, geopolitical events that are disrupting many countries around the world and now a virus that is threatening the global economy. While the headwinds feel pretty strong right now, Brown-Forman has continued to grow throughout our history and remains a strong, healthy company, supported by the commitment of our long-term shareholders and, importantly, our dedicated and talented employees around the world.
So now on to the performance of the company. Jane is going to take us through the company's financial results in a moment. But first, I'd like to provide an update on our progress toward our strategic ambitions. As you've heard me discuss on previous calls, we continue to evaluate our performance, both on a geographic and through a portfolio lens. From a geographic perspective, 18 of our 20 largest markets are delivering underlying net sales growth this year, highlighting the strong benefits of our geographic diversification. As a side note, this does not include Travel Retail, which actually is in decline, and we can talk a little bit about later. However, the growth rates of plus 3% underlying net sales year-to-date for the company are below historical norms and they're also below our expectations, but we believe going forward these rates will return to more historical numbers and we will talk about that throughout the rest of this call.
From a portfolio perspective, our premium and our super-premium brands are well positioned to continue to deliver accelerating top line momentum with leading positions in some of the most attractive and fastest-growing spirits categories, such as whiskey and tequila. In particular, the super-premium brands in our portfolio are propelling the company's growth, both in the U.S. and increasingly our international markets, becoming a more powerful growth driver for the company. So to get into a couple of the specific brand performance issues. Look, the Jack Daniel's family of brands underlying net sales is plus 3% year-to-date, essentially in line with the company's growth rate. We've encountered some near-term challenges for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, which is the core, the Black Label brand, in some of our international markets. Jane is going to talk more about this in her remarks when we get into the market-by-market analysis. But from a strategic perspective, we believe we still have the right strategy in place to deliver long-term profitable growth, and we are investing behind the opportunities.
Jack Daniel's RTD business is now over 9 million cases globally and continues to deliver solid growth as the increasingly popular RTD format provides Jack Daniel's consumers with convenience in their drinking occasions. We continue also to focus on the versatility of our portfolio through innovation, which has resulted in the creation of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey and Fire over the last 9 years. These 2 brands now contribute 2.4 million 9-liter cases at very attractive margins and are connecting new consumers to the Jack Daniel's trademark. With the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple, which is off to a strong start in the United States, we are continuing to drive innovation and diversifying the portfolio. And for our international consumers, we're gearing up for the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple, and it should begin to appear on retail shelves in the next few months.
In Gentleman Jack, which we don't talk about quite as often, one of our super-premium family members, is now nearly 700,000 cases and continues to deliver strong international growth. We've also made notable progress towards our strategic ambition of increasing the scale of our super-premium portfolio. Woodford Reserve remain the leader in the super-premium bourbon category and has been consistently growing strong double digits since its introduction 20 years ago or more -- 22 years ago. Supported by its excellent track record along with innovations such as Double Oaked, Woodford Reserve has eclipsed 1 million 9-liter cases and is one of the largest growth contributors to the company. Looking ahead, we'll be focusing on the international development of this incredible brand with incremental resources being invested in a number of key markets around the world.
And as I mentioned a few minutes ago, Old Forester is celebrating its 150th anniversary this year. It continues to present itself as a leader in American whiskey. The brand is steeped in a reputation of quality and innovation with its core expressions and has increasing popularity with its Whiskey Row series. This brand has been registering impressive gains in the bourbon category and is becoming an increasingly meaningful growth driver for the company. Like Brown-Forman, coincidentally, Herradura was also founded in 1870 and is also celebrating its 150th anniversary. Since we purchased the brands over 12 years ago, the super-premium tequila category in the U.S. has shown dramatic growth. To note, Herradura's underlying net sales are up 20% year-to-date and it's grown to over 600,000 cases with nearly half of its volume outside of Mexico. However, the unprecedented cost of externally sourced agave is putting pressure on gross margins.
To help mitigate, we've been able to increase prices and accelerate the growth of ultra, our higher-priced innovation, which is now nearly 20% of the business. We expect cost pressure to continue, however, through fiscal '21 and continuing -- but continuing our strong sales trends. Forward-looking, Herradura and el Jimador are well positioned in the fast-growing super-premium and ultra-premium segments. Our Single Malt Scotch portfolio is also performing very well led by GlenDronach, which has been -- experienced considerable growth and has a very promising future. In our other emerging brands, things like Slane Irish Whiskey and Coopers bourbon and Fords Gin, while newer in their development, continue to show potential for very meaningful growth. So generally speaking, we feel very confident across the different brands in our portfolio and the many levers of growth that we can pull upon.
Geographically, I'm very pleased with the success of our U.S. business this fiscal year-to-date. U.S. is not only our largest market, but it is leading our growth in our 150th year. In the most valuable global spirits market in the world, Brown-Forman takeaway trends are outpacing TDS, driven largely by our American whiskey and flavored whiskey portfolios as well as our tequila brands. The launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple has also, as I said, gone very smoothly and is accelerating growth to our overall plan. However, we recognize we need better performance on Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey in the U.S. But it is worth noting that we can outpace TDS with essentially flat to low single-digit performance on our biggest brand. We could not have said that even a few years ago, but our bourbon and tequila brands have gotten big enough that they actually have a meaningful impact on the overall trends in the U.S. business.
Developed international are having a relatively weak fiscal '20 as the U.K., Australia and Japan are weighing on performance. Where we have made investments in our route-to-consumer, places such as France and Spain and Germany, our business is healthy, and we've been able to broaden our portfolio of brands. In the U.K., which is the second largest market in the world for Brown-Forman, we're in the final stages of investing in a highly talented team and we'll soon assume full control over our route-to-consumer, which, we believe, will reaccelerate growth in this market into the next fiscal year, and expectations are that this will be a strong market for us into the future.
Our emerging markets are being led by BRIC this year. All 4 are providing strong underlying net sales growth, largely driven by Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey. Also worth pointing out is Southeast Asia is producing strong underlying double-digit growth. For the first time in a while, Asia really has been delivering solid growth this year. However, these markets are likely to suffer in the near-term as a result of the impacts from coronavirus. I am, however, very encouraged that our brands are -- how our brands are resonating with consumers. And looking into the future, I do think that Asia is a part of the world where we are relatively small, but fast growing, which I do think bodes well for the future opportunity we have there.
To the coronavirus situation, just briefly, I do want to pause and take a moment, say the health and safety of our employees is paramount. Like other companies, we've taken steps to limit our employees' risk by limiting travel, canceling certain meetings, providing up-to-date information from the CDC and the World Health Organization and ensuring our flexible work policies are being utilized. There's so many unknowns right now, and it's difficult to quantify the financial impact. Jane will try to walk you through our thinking on this difficult topic.
So in summary, we're expanding the breadth of our premium and super-premium portfolio both geographically and diversifying our revenue base in categories with the strongest momentum. We continue to have confidence in our long-term global growth potential. Currently -- although currently our overall growth rate is a bit below historical trends and our expectations, these are largely driven by multiple short-term disruptions coming together in 1 fiscal year. We believe through continuing to execute our long-term growth strategy, focused on portfolio, geography, investments in our people will continue to extend our leadership in premium American whiskey around the world and continue our track record of consistently delivering profitable growth. While the near-term challenges remain, we will weather the storm as we have throughout our 150 years as we relentlessly focus on creating value for our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jane to review more detail in our financial performance that we released this morning."

And then, secondly, I'm going to review our full year outlook, which we revised to reflect 2 things: one, a tempered expectations in some of our international markets; and two, the increasingly uncertain global economic outlook, which includes an estimate of the effect the coronavirus may have on our business globally, including our Global Travel Retail business in Asia.
So let's begin with our actual performance. First, our underlying net sales grew 3% in the quarter, slower than we had anticipated, but consistent with the company's first half results. Second, while the impact of retaliatory tariffs, particularly from Europe, will continue to weigh on our margins and profits for the full year, the year-over-year effect began to ease a bit in our quarter 3. In fact, our underlying gross profit grew for the quarter for the first time since the cost of tariffs began affecting us, up 3%, consistent with our top line. The cycling of tariffs also helped to boost our underlying operating income growth in the quarter, up 5%. Consistent with our third quarter performance, our year-to-date underlying net sales grew 3% on top of 5% growth in the same period last year, but again slower than we had anticipated we would be at this point in our fiscal year.
So breaking down our underlying net sales performance by geography, just there's a bit more color on what Lawson just provided. Again, the U.S., our largest market, representing nearly half our sales, continued to lead our growth, growing 6% underlying net sales year-to-date, the market's strongest rate of growth registered in 4 years. This growth was fueled by the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple and sustained double-digit underlying net sales growth from our premium bourbon brands, notably Woodford Reserve and Old Forester, and our tequila brands in aggregate. This strong growth, again, as Lawson said, in the world's most valuable spirits market was also supported by improving takeaway trends, which accelerated over the past quarter and are now growing ahead of our -- the healthy total distilled spirits mid-single-digit growth for the first time in over 18 months.
In our emerging markets, we also experienced another quarter of sequential improvement in growth, with underlying net sales up 6% year-to-date on top of last year's double-digit gains. The acceleration was less than expected at this point in the year, due in part to route-to-market disruptions in Africa and macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges, which have begun to weigh more heavily on certain markets in the CIS and Latin America. One of our largest emerging markets are -- actually our largest emerging market, Mexico, where we grew underlying net sales double digits last year at this time is now growing in the low single digits through the third quarter, reflecting a weakening economy.
If we were to exclude Mexico and the rest of Latin America, CIS and Africa, our emerging markets grew underlying net sales double digits. So despite seeing some pockets of slowdown, strong double-digit underlying net sales growth was delivered across a number of emerging markets, including Turkey, Russia, China and parts of Southeast Asia, led by strong volume growth of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey. Poland also returned to mid-single-digit underlying growth year-to-date, following a very strong quarter for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey. And I thought I'd pause for a moment and discuss our performance in Asia.
Over the past nearly 2 years, we've been quite pleased with the momentum and increasing contribution we've been experiencing from this part of the world. Specifically, our business in China has been growing underlying net sales at a double-digit rate since fiscal 2018, led in large part by our growing e-premise business where we have been focusing our investment in this market. Our performance through January had essentially not been affected by the coronavirus. So understandably, we do expect a marked slowdown in our fourth quarter in this market and other parts of Asia and have already experienced this in February. Despite this near-term headwind, we remain optimistic about the long-term growth potential for our portfolio throughout Asia. 
Similar to the first half of the year, our developed international markets delivered 2% growth in underlying net sales year-to-date. This growth was led by Germany, Czechia, France, Spain and Korea, reflecting strong growth of Jack Daniel's RTDs, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey and our super-premium American whiskey portfolio, Woodford Reserve and Gentleman Jack. In the U.K., our largest market outside the U.S., underlying net sales declined in the first 9 months. You may recall that we are navigating through multiple challenges in this market this year, including: first, the upcoming route-to-consumer change in May; two, changes in our promotional strategy; and three, softness in the cash and carry channel. So all combined, we experienced what we believe is some short-term disruption. We expect the negative trends in this market to ease as we move into next fiscal year.
In addition to some softer than planned results in the U.K., the devastating fires in Australia have also contributed to our developed international markets growing less than expected. Our Global Travel Retail business, which had declined in the first and second quarter of this fiscal year, grew underlying net sales single -- grew net sales high single digits in the third quarter, due in part to easy comparisons to the same quarter a year ago. Despite improvement in the trend, Global Travel Retail remains a drag on our top line, with underlying net sales down 3% year-to-date.
While we experienced some improvement in the quarter and had anticipated further improvement in the fourth quarter, resulting from the phasing of certain customer purchases, we now estimate that as a result of the coronavirus, our Travel Retail business for the full year will be down similar to year-to-date performance. Our used barrel business declined significantly in the third quarter. The decline in this business reflects both a reduction in demand due in part to the U.S. tariff impact on Single Malt Scotch Whiskey; and secondly, softening prices driven by the increased supply of the used barrels in the market. This business and our other nonbranded business, which includes contract bottling and bulk whiskey and bulk wine sales, have negatively affected our underlying net sales year-to-date by about 1 percentage point.
Now looking at our business through a portfolio lens. Consistent with the drivers of our growth for the first half of the year, our premium whiskey brands, Jack Daniel's RTD, Jack Daniel's flavors and tequilas, remain the key contributors. As Lawson mentioned, Woodford Reserve continued its consistent double-digit underlying net sales gains, fueled by strong consumer momentum in the United States and is now over 1 million case super-premium brand globally. With only 20% of its volume outside of the United States, growing at an even faster rate, we believe the brand has a significant run rate for geographic expansion.
Tequila has delivered underlying net sales growth of 10% year-to-date, pulled down modestly by our pricing actions on the Pepe Lopez mix fill brand in the U.S. Our consumer takeaway trends in the U.S. remain very strong. For Herradura specifically, in addition to the strong takeaway trends in the U.S. and increasing volumes in Mexico, higher prices and a favorable product mix in both the U.S. and Mexico helped to deliver the 20% growth in underlying net sales year-to-date. Jack Daniel's RTDs grew underlying net sales mid-single digits on a year-to-date basis, driven by volumetric gains in Germany and the U.S. and introduction and launch in France. 
JD flavors continued its broad-based geographic growth, most notably in the U.S., France, Poland, Czechia and Brazil. As it relates to the successful launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple in the U.S., the brand remained on track to deliver about 1 percentage point of growth for the company this year. Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey underlying net sales were essentially flat as year-to-date growth in emerging markets were offset by declines for the brand in the U.K. and our Travel Retail channel.
Moving down the P&L to gross margins. Year-to-date gross margins declined 220 basis points year-over-year reflecting -- resulting in flat underlying gross profit growth through the first 9 months. The reduction in gross margin was driven by the same 2 factors we've highlighted for the last 3 earnings call: first, our input cost reflecting agave and wood inflation; and secondly, tariff related costs. As I mentioned earlier, while the impact of tariff-related costs will continue to impact the full year margin, as we began to cycle prior year periods that were affected by tariffs, the year-over-year effect began to ease in the quarter with 100 basis point compression for the first 9 months compared to 200 basis points through the first half. We continue to invest behind our brands with underlying A&P spending up 3% year-to-date, in line with our top line growth. As we've discussed on previous calls, the effective increase in our spend is much higher given the significant reallocation we took this fiscal year to increase our efficiencies from high touch spend to broad reach media and digital investments, along with our increase in activations and promotion activities. 
On the SG&A front, we remain committed to a disciplined approach to our investment, looking for opportunities to continue to gain efficiencies, including productivity initiatives that ultimately results in operating leverage. It is important to note, however, that while we continue to leverage prior investments, we've also increased our SG&A in markets where we see opportunity to heighten our focus on building our brands and accelerating our growth. For example, a key element of this can be seen in our third quarter of this fiscal year as we began to invest in the U.K., opening a new office and creating and forming the team and capabilities that we believe will support building our broader portfolio of brands in our new route to market structure that will begin on May 1. In the aggregate, both our reported and underlying operating income declined modestly year-to-date, driven in part by an approximate 3 percentage point drag related to tariff related costs. An effective tax rate of just over 17%, which includes a couple of discrete items year-to-date, drove 4% growth in diluted earnings per share to $1.45.
Now turning to my final topic this morning, an update on our fiscal 2020 full year outlook. There are really 2 sets of factors weighing on our outlook, which I will describe in turn that has led us to revising our full year underlying net sales growth from 5% to 7% to low single digits. First, tempered expectations from some international markets, reflecting short-term disruptions and macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds. Specifically, to discuss, the U.K., our largest international market, is experiencing short-term changes and disruptions, including the transition to our own route to market in just a few months. The economy of our largest emerging market, Mexico, continues to weakening. The strengthening U.S. dollar has made our brands more expensive to our customers and consumers in certain other emerging markets, such as Latin America and CIS, further exacerbating the uncertainty and unpredictability of demand. And finally, unplanned destocking in Travel Retail.
Now turning to the second factor weighing on our outlook, the uncertainty and unpredictability, the effect the coronavirus may have on our business globally, including the current, most effective areas, Travel Retail in Asia, most notably China. Included in our outlook is an estimate of some additional deterioration that is likely if this continues to evolve globally. We continue to expect gross margins will be down around 200 basis points for the year, again, split between tariff-related costs and higher input costs. Regarding our operating costs for the full year, despite the volatile and uncertain markets, we continue to build our brands, investing behind them roughly in line with our net sales growth. We're expecting SG&A to now be flat for the year, continuing to provide leverage to operating income.
We've reduced our underlying operating income outlook from a range of 2% to 4% to flat to modestly down, driven by lower top line expectations that I just discussed. We narrowed our earnings per share outlook from $1.75 to $1.85 to $1.75 to $1.80, still benefiting from a lower effective tax rate. So lastly, while our expectations for growth this year are now below our initial range, we continue to believe there is a long runway of opportunities ahead for our brand. Our teams are experienced, as Lawson said, weathering these uncertain times and are focused on accelerating our business back towards our consistent historic rates of growth. However, we are cognizant of the current market dynamics that may limit our near-term improvement.
In the meantime, we believe our business remains very attractive with nice margins resulting from the efficiency and historic consistency in our revenue growth, industry-leading return on invested capital and ample free cash flow. Over many years, we have followed a systematic approach to our capital allocation that has served us well: first, reinvesting back into the business to meet future demand; second, growing our cash dividends; and in the absence of meaningful M&A opportunities we return excess cash to shareholders through special dividends and share repurchases. Currently, we continue to invest behind the business and expanding our production capabilities, increasing whiskey inventories to meet future growth expectations, investing in technology to not only improve our efficiencies throughout all of our functions of the company but also to drive growth-based analytic insights such as our revenue management platform.
We continue to return cash to shareholders as we always have, thoughtfully, disciplined and consistently, including increasing our cash dividend for this calendar year by 5%. While we have been navigating near-term challenges, including tariffs and the increasingly uncertain and volatile world, we continue to manage our business as we always have for the long term. Strong support from our shareholders, as Lawson also said, including the Brown family, enables this long horizon, which is essential to the company's steeped and aged spirits. We believe our portfolio of premium, super-premium whiskey and tequila brands position us well to continue creating value for all of our shareholders.
And with that, this concludes our prepared remarks. Dorothy, please open the call up for questions."

Look, I mean, I think obviously we're not giving out guidance yet for next fiscal year. But I think as you look at our business in general, we feel pretty confident on the U.S. business these days as it is sort of above TDS, and I would expect that to continue. As I said in my prepared remarks, even with Jack at sort of subdued rates, we're able to grow above the TDS number. So -- and believe me, there are a lot of plans and there's a lot of action, a lot of activity going around to try to improve the growth rates on Tennessee Whiskey. And if that happens, we're even, I would call it, more confident in the U.S. market. So that feels pretty good. The developed international side of things is subdued, but it largely -- as Jane said, that's largely the U.K. There are other markets that are not kicking on all cylinders these days.
But I think we can get that -- we'll get that category of markets, the developed international, back into what its traditional range would be mid to even a little bit better than mid-single-digit growth. But I'll take mid-single digits out of that part of the world. And emerging is the volatile one. It's always been the volatile one. It's been growing at a rate above our company average now for a number of years. It has slowed this year, as we said, largely because of Mexico. Asia is the wild card in this. And I don't know how to tell you to -- we're trying to think about what is the growth rate for that part of the world going to be, because right now it's solid. But we're going to be a little more subdued. And I think at the end of the day, we're going to be -- we use the word around here agility a lot. You're going to have to be agile next year because while things do have a tough outlook, the comps are going to be a little bit easier next year, and I could see some bounce backs and some other things that make it -- that turn it into a pretty good year. So not directly answering your question because we have not provided that guidance yet, but I think we generally feel pretty good on the top line, that things will return to what I call a more normalized growth rate."

And so we had the strong growth at the beginning of last year first half and now we're cycling against some softer growth in the second half for Travel Retail. We still do expect some improvement, but that will be offset by this coronavirus on our business and the global -- just people less traveling internationally. So we -- but that's what I would answer your question in terms of why they’re so different than ours, smaller, and it's where they're concentrating."

We just have a more precise thing, cash and carry this time. The increased promotional strategy, you're right. It was planned. And it's something that we're doing as we get ready to own our own distribution come May. And that's why when we look ahead to this market and the optimism we have going forward versus what we have had this year, we will be in control of a lot of our decisions of working with the grocers and determining the pricing strategies. And right now that doesn't always happen. And so that's important for us as we go forward. Just a reminder why we made this decision to go on our own route-to-consumer in the U.K. This relationship has probably served us quite well. It started in 2002, served both companies quite well, but we had very limited portfolio at that time, I don't know, 10, 12, 15 brands. And now combined, we have over 100 brands. So you can only imagine the lack of attention, focus, prioritization, understanding the consumer and focus on our own portfolio. And so we haven't transitioned yet. That, again, is May 1. But we believe the focus, the prioritization, the understanding the consumers, the more direct contact with our customers, if you will, will allow us to not only accelerate our business there, but get our rest of our portfolio growing quite nicely."

So on the pricing or the promotional question you asked a little bit earlier, I mean, the -- look, if we're totally honest, the amount of promotion in the U.K. market got too big. And so we're trying to reduce that a little bit and get some pricing up, and we're working on that slowly. It's not a -- I mean you have to do it slowly with the European retail world, but we're paying the price necessarily. We're just seeing short-term disruption with some of our customers as we do a little bit less promoting. We do think in the long run it's the smart thing to do.

I'm glad you asked the question. Let me just pause for a minute, as we want to be super clear here with what we have in our forecast. So again, if you looked at what we did, we took our overall forecast down, as you saw. We reduced",412,"Yes. Thank you, Vivien. I'm glad you asked the question. Let me just pause for a minute, as we want to be super clear here with what we have in our forecast. So again, if you looked at what we did, we took our overall forecast down, as you saw. We reduced our underlying forecast with 2 factors. First, it was the tempering of the growth and contribution from some of our international markets, again reflecting some short-term disruptions as well these macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges. So when we look at our base business, what we would estimate now that our base business is doing is probably growing in the 3.5% to 4.5% range. It is, therefore, a couple of points less than what our expectations were just 3 months ago. But the second factor that we built into our forecast -- and this is what you're asking specifically about, Vivien, led to our reduction in our top line outlook. And again not surprising is this unpredictability and uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus and what it may have on our business globally.
So we've estimated at this point, there's about 1 point drag, including those markets that are currently affected. So to your point directly from the Asian markets, including China and other parts of Asia, Travel Retail and we have in -- Italy in there. So collectively, that's about 8% of our business. And as I said earlier, yes, we've already seen areas -- many of these areas already affected in our February results. But that being said, we also have, in that 1%, some additional downside impact. And we don't know, none of us knows, that's going to be enough, too much. We're learning daily as this situation, and so we're really only looking at our fourth quarter. We haven't tried estimating downstream, secondary effects on anything beyond the demand we see and then an expectation for perhaps it's spreading to some other markets. We don't know about the economy and the consumer confidence and sentiment and how they may linger into our first quarter and summer months. So we'll obviously come back in June with more guidance on that for next year. So Vivien, I know I went into a little bit more detail, but I thought it was important to just to phrase it for you or put it in perspective in terms of where we are and that why we did reduce our guidance into the 2 buckets."

My thinking is you're probably toward the higher end of low single digits, and that is closer to 3% as opposed to 1%, with the 3% for the year implying something sort of similar for 4Q, particularly given the strength of the U.S. But if you could just confirm that, that would be helpful, just to kind of see where you are with that. And then for Lawson, just an update on the U.S. pricing environment. As we look at the Nielsen data, the price/mix remains negative and has been that way, although, albeit moderating somewhat. Could you just give us a little bit of an update there in terms of what you're seeing in the competitive environment? And then your expectations going forward from a pricing perspective to help drive some gross margin improvement."

Really for the last -- I'll say last decade, it's been low single digit. Some of that -- I mean, as most companies do, we take a hard look at how our competitors are doing and where we are relative to that and try to pick our spots, and we've done that. In the last year, we had gotten above and the competitors were going down, and that hurt our volumes a bit. And so at the beginning of this fiscal year, we got a little more aggressive, and our volumes have reacted. Our volume growth this year is as good as it's been -- I don't know how many years. It's a number of years. So I think if we -- that's a good thing, and that means consumers are still taking the product away, and we feel pretty good about that. But it's cost us on the value line, and we want to get that back in balance again. So the idea for next year is certainly to have it more in balance, and that's something that we're working on very hard. And actually I think you'll start to see some of the results of that even in the fourth quarter, which will improve our mix.

So in other words, we won't start seeing any easing to the back half of calendar '21, early calendar '22, so just as a reminder. I mean, we've got that information based upon what is publicly available from the CRT. So we can see when planting started to accelerate and we kind of know what the demand is. And so we can see, by the way, tons of plantings more recently. So we know 6 or 7 years from now we'll have -- there probably will be lots of pressure on pricing at that point in time. But in the near term, again, it's going to be late calendar '21, early calendar '22 before we see cost pressures. But now with that being said, Bryan, it's important to note that what we're seeing in the market, where we had seen like a fivefold increase from 2015 in the price of the agave, it really -- and it rapidly increased during 2016 through mid last year we have seen some slowing. It's still growing, but not at the -- and still at unprecedented dollar -- I guess peso cost, if you will, but it's just not growing just rapidly. So that perhaps is a bit of a good news there, if you will. As it relates to the cost of wood, we have seen some moderation in that. But again, you're not going to start to see that come through our P&L because of our aged products 4 years from now. And coupled with that, we have capital investments that we've made.

There's -- it really has been successful in bringing in new consumers in different occasions, and it just feels -- it feels like it is showing through the analysis that we do that it's tiny. I mean, it's almost -- truly on what we've done so far year-to-date on the impact on Black Label, it's imperceptible, I mean, literally a few thousand cases kind of thing, but it's not the reason that the Tennessee Whiskey brand in the U.S. has slowed down like you'd asked.

So today, while we will cover our full year financial results, we're really going to focus more of our time updating you on the impact of the pandemic on our business and share how we have and will continue to strategically navigate the volatility and uncertainty that we are facing. But before we do that, let me say, the events happening across America have highlighted yet again the disturbing and systemic racism that persists in the United States. I'm proud of the work Brown-Forman and our employees have been doing in diversity inclusion for nearly 2 decades, which only accelerated when Ralph de Chabert, our Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer, joined the company in 2007. While we've been diligent in our diversity inclusion work, we all know that there's so much more to be done. 
These current events have sparked numerous conversations across the company about how we live our value of respect, about how we identify and eliminate bias within ourselves and how we continue to foster in an environment and relationships where we can bring our best selves to work. 
At Brown-Forman, we're continually challenging ourselves to be better and to do better as individuals, as leaders and as teams. I do want to highlight a few initiatives that our company that not only promote diversity and inclusion within the company, but also address racial inequality in Louisville, Kentucky, where we have our corporate headquarters. Last fall, we published our 2030 diversity and inclusion strategy, where we set quantitative ambitions, specifically for people of color and women. We've tied a portion of our executive compensation to make sure we can achieve these ambitions. We're also leading the new Racism and Business Council sponsored by Greater Louisville Ink. This council will focus on racism and any quality and will lead efforts to cultivate minority businesses and new talent. 
Another effort is with our largest and most influential brand, Jack Daniel's, which is committed to uplifting the important story of its first master distiller, Nearest Green. To help the life and legacy of Nearest, we're forming a partnership with Nearest Green, Inc. that will create developmental opportunities for African-American talent for senior distilling roles and support African-American entrepreneurs in distilling start-ups. More information about this partnership will be shared in the coming weeks. 
In the California neighborhood, home to our Louisville corporate campus we're committed to being better neighbors. And over the past 3 years, we've made local community investments of more than $6 million, including supporting the nearby YMCA and Simmons College. In the coming months, we'll commit to providing additional resources for the invest California initiative. This initiative will focus on improving education, economic development and wealth building for our closest neighbors, the majority of whom are black. In conclusion, I want to make it clear that we are committed as individuals and as an organization to continue to take action in order to address the racial and ethnic divides and in qualities in our local communities and our industry around the globe. 
All right. Now turning to the global COVID-19 pandemic. While a business challenge, above it all, we know it's a human tragedy. At Brown-Forman, as we always do, we took a people-first approach to this crisis. Which means the health and safety of our employees is our #1 priority. In support of our colleagues, friends and partners facing hardship and loss, we've produced our own hand sanitizer to protect our workforce and community front line workers. We've supplied and are continuing to supply high proof alcohol to manufacturers of hand sanitizer, which now is producing over 20,000 gallons per day. We've also donated in communities where we work and live around the world from supporting bar-tenured communities, restaurants, relief funds and community foundations to providing over 70,000 meals to soup kitchens and homeless shelters in Louisville as well as countless hours of volunteerism. I really would like to thank all of our 4,800 employees around the world for their exceptional agility and creativity, and quickly shifting and adapting to the recent challenges. From our quick and nearly seamless transition to working from home where it's possible. Adjusting on how we work in our production facilities to ensure the health and safety of our employees, which resulted in almost no impact to our supply chain. 
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Jane, who will walk us through how our business has been impacted by COVID-19, the adjustments we have made to the business and the strength of our balance sheet. Afterwards, I'll share our strategic priorities that will continue to guide us through the near-term, and which I believe will position our brands and our business to be even stronger in the long term.

Before I get into the results, I would like to build on some of Lawson's comments and acknowledge that the last several weeks have required our entire organization to pivot quickly to the changing business environment. Brought on first by the global pandemic to now tremendously trying times, especially for our black colleagues. As recent events highlight the continued work still to do in the United States to close the racial and equality's gap. I, too, would like to thank our entire employee population for our resilience and extra efforts during these trying times as we continue to work to grow our business. 
In these efforts, we understand that our diverse and inclusive culture is key to our continued success. And in these times, we are refocusing our efforts on deepening our understanding and acceptance of all of our differences. It was difficult to make a transition from these significant issues. Let's turn to our full year results. 
Fiscal '20 really was a year like no other. We began the year with a business environment in which our margins continue to be weighed down by tariffs, largely European tariffs and higher agave costs to end the year with a global pandemic and it's resulting effect on the global economy that we are still facing today. Despite these challenges, we still achieved many significant accomplishments and milestones in fiscal 2020 that I'd like to take a moment and highlight. We saw Woodford reserve exceed 1 million cases. We continue to innovate, developing and launching Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple and depleting over 250,000 cases in just 8 months. Our Jack Daniel's flavor portfolio surpassed 2.5 million cases. And to put that in perspective, none of our Jack Daniel's flavors existed a short 9 years ago, illustrating the importance that innovation has provided, including being a significant source of growth and bringing in numerous new consumers to the Jack Daniel's franchise. 
Jack Daniel's RTDs reached 1.5 million cases in Germany. Old Forester, our founding brand, grew underlying net sales double digits and is now over 300,000 cases. Our business in the U.S. accelerated its top line compared to fiscal 2019, and outpaced TDS for the first time since the summer of 2018. We transitioned our U.K. and Thailand business to own distribution rep to consumer models, both launching on May 1, 2020. We welcomed Fords Gin to our family of brands, and we closed another chapter in our 150-year history of enduring and thriving. 
I'm not going to spend a lot of time going through the financial performance for fiscal 2020 as we typically do, but instead focus more on the last couple of months of the fiscal year, where our results were significantly impacted by the global health pandemic. First, as a reminder, we completed our third quarter of the fiscal year on January 31, 2020, with year-to-date underlying net sales growth of 3%. This trend held up for us through February. We began to experience the effect of the pandemic on our results beginning in mid-March and it continued throughout April as many of our major markets went into countries wide lockdowns, implemented significant stay-at-home restrictions and shutdown are severely limited the on-premise business, which represents approximately 20% of our business globally. In addition, travel bans and other restrictions were implemented and these significantly impacted the Travel Retail channel. As a result, we estimate that the pandemic negatively affected our underlying net sales approximately 15% for the March-April period with a greater negative effect occurring in April, following some benefit we believe we experienced from pantry loading in March. 
As we look broadly across our geographic clusters, all were affected during this period, some more than others. I want to call your attention to this on Slide 7 of our presentation we uploaded to our Investor Relations website this morning. As you can see, the most notable decline occurred in our Travel Retail business where international travel and cruise channels essentially halted overnight. Additionally, our emerging markets were down significantly. Some markets, such as Mexico, went into the crisis with weak economic conditions. Further, history would suggest that it is coming for emerging market consumers to reduce spending on our category and focus on essential needs during challenging economic times. 
Our developed international markets experienced underlying net sales decline similar to the company for the March-April period and worse in the U.S. While we saw strong off-premise consumer takeaway trends across many of these markets, these increases were not sufficient to offset the on-premise closures. And finally, while our business in the U.S. experienced a slowdown in performance over this 2-month period, it held up well and continued to grow. 
Since the pandemic began to affect the U.S. -- the off-premise takeaway trends for beverage alcohol significantly accelerated and have remained robust over the past 13 weeks with spirits growing the fastest. While we expect there were some early on pantry loading in mid- to late March, overall consumption has clearly shifted from the on-premise to new at home occasions. Our blended takeaway trends over the period have outperformed TDS. And importantly, the strong growth in the off-premise channel has offset the significant hit to the on-premise business. In many of our major markets around the world, consumer purchase patterns changed quickly as bars and restaurants essentially shut down. We saw impressive growth of our brands in the e-premise channel and significant acceleration in large off-premise accounts. We observe consumers moving towards trusted brands and seeking opportunities to indulge everyday luxuries. We noted the consumers are seeking convenience such as RTDs and flavored whiskeys and increased home consumption occasions, including virtual cocktail parties. And we ascertain the consumers were and are still making larger, less frequent shopping trips. 
We quickly made adjustments to our focus and resources based on these trends and applied on a market-by-market basis. For example, we reprioritized our portfolio and we shifted our focus to channels where the consumer was and continues to shop. We shifted advertising investments and teams to align with these reprioritize areas of focus, such as digital as well as prioritize off-premise accounts such as classic versus convenience, large-format versus independent. We reduced discretionary spending, such as T&E, we stopped spending behind on-premise activities and various events and sponsorships that were canceled. And we accelerated and fueled our activities in the e-premise channel in several key markets globally. As the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on the global economy continues to evolve, we are closely monitoring key indicators in each market, such as the stage of restrictions in a given market or country, consumer trends and behavioral insights and macroeconomic conditions. We believe this will aid us in our evaluation of the pace of recovery and appropriately identify opportunities. 
Now given the high degree of uncertainty that we all face in these times, I'd like to take a few minutes to comment on our financial position and specifically to address the topic of liquidity. First of all, a few relevant facts. On April 30, the end of our fiscal year 2020, we had $675 million in cash equivalents on hand. Our commercial pay balance was roughly $330 million with an average of over 70 days to maturity for paper outstanding, and we had approximately $2.3 billion of long-term debt outstanding. Importantly, in a long-term debt picture, we have no maturity scheduled until our fiscal 2023. Our $800 million credit facility was and remains undrawn. So we believe our financial position remains strong and our continuing capacity to generate solid operating cash flows is sound. We believe our strengths will allow us to navigate this crisis as circumstances evolve. That said, we have taken and will continue to take additional steps to secure our strong financial position, managing both our uses and sources of cash. For example, while we continue to manage our uses of cash thoughtfully as we always have, we have turned up our focus in a few areas. Naturally, we are managing our operating expenses closely and have significantly curtailed discretionary spending, such as freezes for hiring and travel. 
On the CapEx front, we will continue to invest behind the business with an eye toward the future and not forego important maintenance spending. However, we are reprioritizing and deferring certain spending where prudent. We are more actively managing our working capital, including monitoring credit closely while working constructively with our customers most affected by the crisis. In parallel to our management or our cash usage, we have bolstered our cash balances and position Brown-Forman access additional liquidity, if needed. First, just a few comments on the short-term debt markets and our recent experience. Rewinding to March, despite extremely volatile conditions in the short-term debt market then, which have improved markedly since then, we sustained our access to short-term funding in the commercial paper market. Leading up to our fiscal year-end, we added to our cash position by issuing commercial paper, more of it and with longer durations than usual, enabling us to fortify our cash position. Looking ahead, we expect to meet our short-term liquidity needs through cash generated from operations and borrowings under our commercial paper program. However, as you know well, these are dynamic times. So we are closely monitoring both our own liquidity outlook based on various scenarios and conditions in the debt capital markets. If our appraisals suggest a worsening situation, we won't hesitate to increase our margin of safety on the liquidity front. Considering our history of strong operating cash flows, our excellent credit ratings and the resilience of our industry in our business in these turbulent times, we expect that, if needed, we could access additional debt capital readily and with favorable terms. 
And finally, to our fiscal '21 outlook. As we indicated in our earnings release this morning, we face substantial uncertainty related to the evolving COVID-19 global pandemic and its effect on the global economy. As a result of this uncertainty, we are not able to provide quantitative guidance for fiscal 2021 at this time. We hope to have a better picture of how the recovery, including this economic effect on consumers, may unfold and affect our full year financial results when we report our Q1 performance later this summer. 
With that being said, based on our early read of our own performance in May, we believe that our top line results will show some improvements to that we experienced in March, April, but still down relative to last year. Separately, given our strong balance sheet, solid cash flows and ample liquidity, we expect to fully fund ongoing investment in our business and continue to pay regular dividends. 
In summary, while fiscal 2020 was a year like no other in our 150-year history and we expect to continue to face headwinds given the current environment, our view of the ultimate global opportunity for our brands is undiminished. We believe our talented, resilient and agile employees, our commitment to diversity and inclusion, our attractive portfolio of brands and growing categories, our resilient global supply chain and our strong balance sheet will allow us to emerge an even stronger company with healthier brands that will drive our growth for the next generation. 
And with that, let me turn the call back over to Lawson to conclude our prepared remarks this morning."

As we all know, there is substantial amount of uncertainty in the world and in the days ahead, but we do have 150 years of experience of successfully navigating many challenges. These include world wars, a prior pandemic, prohibition, a depression and recessions. Although this global pandemic and economic challenge is certainly different, I do believe we'll endure and we will reemerge even stronger. 
I'm optimistic about our future and confident we have the right strategy to guide us now and as we look ahead. We're well positioned in some of the best categories in the spirits industry and we remain focused on developing a premium portfolio that we can develop around the world. In this current environment, we know that consumers are looking for both trusted brands and for an opportunity to indulge in everyday luxuries. I want to argue that Jack Daniel's is actually the most trusted brand in the spirits industry. We continue to strive to deliver balanced geographic growth with competitive routes to consumer. Near term, we will be reallocating more towards the developed markets, including the United States, where spirits consumption has been relatively stronger. We'll also be allocating more resources towards channels like e-commerce to ensure we're utilizing the most competitive routes to consumer. 
A hallmark of Brown-Forman, we intend to maintain our historically disciplined approach to capital deployment, including our commitment to return cash to shareholders in a prudent yet opportunistic manner. Additionally, we aspire to deliver top-tier total shareholder returns over the long term. And finally, we will continue to leverage our talent and agile workforce. Over the last few months, I've seen truly exceptional examples of adaptability and resilience in our people. People will continue to be our most important asset. As discussed and shared with you on many occasions in the past, we think about our future in generations. This crisis provides us with the opportunity to reimagine the next-generation of growth for our brands, our geographies, our people and our investments. At the end of the day, our goal is to ensure the long-term health of our iconic brands. 
And finally, we'll continue to be guided by our values while working to preserve the resources of our planet, educating consumers on responsible consumption of our brands and ensuring the communities in which we live and work will provide social equities for all. 
With that, Dorothy, you may open up the call for questions."

Now if you look over what's happened over the last couple of months, those trends have continued. You haven't seen the trade down that, honestly some of us were worried about. Ultra-premium is still growing the fastest in super and then and work your way down the chain. So even in this environment and this particular set of circumstances that we're in, the premiumization trends continue. So I think we feel good about that, and our portfolio does skew to that and we continue to we want to continue to make that happen. So as far as looking out ahead over the next couple of years, I don't see us changing our portfolio strategy other than to focus on more super-premium and above brands.

And as you said, set it up perfectly, countries are at different stages of the pandemic, countries are at different stages of coming out of the pandemic, different stages of opening, different states, different -- all kinds of different things that are effectiveness. And so the answer is not a simple answer as you can imagine. What we saw some improvement on in the month -- in the month of May, what we're looking at current trends are places like the U.S. and certain channel or certain portfolio, I guess, I should say. So our Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey, our RTDs are doing quite well. Our Global Travel Retail remains down still. So what we saw in the month of March, April, which was down around 65%, that's still holding the same. Some of our emerging markets have improved. So China. We see that early look. Looks like it's back to levels it was a year ago May. Other parts of Southeast Asia have rebounded. But then you still have other parts of Latin America that are just -- other parts of emerging markets such as Latin America that are just going into the pandemic. So there's not a one size fits all answer here, I hate to say. But I would like to build on some of the things that we are seeing. If this might help you think about the on-premise and the business, primarily in the developed markets. 
So if we think about Europe, it's a bit further behind than the U.S. For instance, our second largest market is the U.K. The loosening of the restrictions there for bars and restaurants is not going to be till July 4, you probably know this. France just opened last week. Germany has been open since the middle of May, and we've seen nice trends in Germany since this reopened. In the U.S., the trends are -- for the -- what we've been following it, those trends for the early openings of those that opened prior to May 15, where we saw the off-premise was down, say, in the 90% range. By the end of May, they had improved to down 70%. So we're seeing a nice improvement, but slow improvement. Of course, this is all going to be dependent upon the consumer, the fillings of safety and when they feel like they can come back. So I wish there was an easier answer for you, but that's why it's so hard to also give any kind of forecast right now because there are so many scenarios and so many things at play that are impacting each and every market. And one size does not fit all, now it's hard to generalize anything in this environment."

And that's where I have the most concern about what the next year may look like. Our emerging markets, which over the last few years has been a very dynamic sort of double-digit growth area for many of the years, was already slowing a bit on this fiscal year. We're still growing but it was slowing. A lot of that was led by Mexico, which is our largest emerging market, and Mexico has had its own economic problems going back over the last 12 to 18 months. And so we saw some weakness there earlier on, and that was a big portion of the change in our sales. But if you look out at the rest of the emerging markets world, I'm talking about South America, Africa, particularly South Africa. If you look across parts of Asia and India, a lot of those countries have gone into either a complete shutdown or something close to a complete shutdown. And those markets don't have this social safety methods you're seeing in the U.S. and most of Western Europe. And so those markets, when they go into shutdown, people don't have money for luxuries at all. And they're really going to the base of goods and trying just being able to try to survive. And so I do think you're going to see a deeper problem in those markets and it's going to be tougher to come out of there. So yes. I would argue that emerging markets are the place that we were trying to figure out how that's going to go, but it does have a fair amount of concern."

So it's just something as you get into the results to start understanding that.

If you could comment on that. I'm not sure if there is a number that you guys track or how closely you look at it. But what I'm really looking for is the overall category growth rate in terms of what you're seeing more recently in May and June for the bourbon category. And then if you'd indulge me, just a housekeeping question for Jane. Collection risk or bad debt risk in the on-premise channel, given that some of these bars restaurants will not come out of this. Does that entirely reside with distributors? Or is there any risk-sharing that's going to take place with Brown-Forman?"

So Kevin, I think you're asking about the trend, the bourbon trends in the U.S. business, I'm not going to look at the NABCA data -- and I can look at NABCA data, and like I said to Vivien a few moments ago, really do have to start pulling it apart and understand what's going on there. And the actual overall bourbon trends in the off-premise have remained very strong. They're up about 36%. Now what you've got to do is you've got to pull out Pennsylvania, which shut down and you got to pull out the on-premise business. Once you've done that, again, we show growth of around 36%. Brown-Forman is growing faster than that. Our bourbon and Tennessee Whiskey are growing around 38%. This is for the most recent data through April. We did see a small -- I guess, a slowdown, if you will, that you're referring to in May, maybe from the Nielsens and the categories. But still up very strong. It's still up in the 30 percentage range from an off-premise takeaway trend perspective. So we feel good about that. What you saw, though, in those trends is an acceleration in a couple of categories, a few categories. It was cordial, liquors and tequilas. And of course, our portfolio has some in it. We have wonderful tequilas. We have liquors to think of Honey and Fire and Apple, but that's the extent of our portfolio in those categories. So I feel optimistic still that we're still seeing very strong trends from the syndicated data as it relates to bourbon and Tennessee Whiskey. 
And then your question about our bad debt. I thought it might be helpful just to talk about what we've done on that just for a moment and then I can get specifically to your question. But since this pandemic started, we've really been working actively with the customers around the globe. And looking for ways to partner with them and the credit issue in a really productive way. So not surprisingly in March and April, customers catering to the on-premise and Travel Retail channels. We've quested additional credit due to the fall offs in their business, and that's not surprising. And those comments are more outside the U.S. I think you were referring to in the U.S. but what would..."

So you're not seeing any degradation in our credit picture, by the way. No change in our bad debt. So that's outside the U.S. As it relates to anything going on in the U.S., we sell to our distributors and the titers sell on to the retailers. We have not had anybody. So that's really their -- I guess their risk at that point in time. Of course, I think with the openings that the on-premise is starting to happen. Hopefully, some of those, we'll get moving there. But to your point, there may be some bad debt -- or excuse me, uncollectibility on their part that what they end up doing is probably just shifting and around and using in other parts of their distributor houses. That could then affect, of course, our shipments in the short term, but not long term."

Is it -- does it make sense to assume in the U.S. and international developed markets, per capita consumption stays the same. We have to make some assessment about channels and brands and price. But perhaps don't really change, it's just where people will consume. And then developing markets, especially if we're -- we go into a recession, per capita consumption maybe goes down a bit. And then travel retail is obviously just sort of dependent on being open or not. Is that -- is that just like a basic framework, is that a reasonable way to approach it?"

But I think it's -- your approach is pretty reasonable. I do think one of the things that's happened over the last few months compared to what had been happening in the prior years before it is whatever trends were happening seem to be an exaggerated. So if you look at the U.S., spirits has been very healthy in the U.S. for 10 years or more -- well, 20 years or more. The trend of spirits taking share from beer and wine has continued and has accelerated over the last few months. And so for capita, in the U.S., I would say, is probably ticking up a little bit. But you go to Europe and it's a bit of the opposite. It's not an extreme change, but beer has been healthier than spirits in Europe for the last few years. And even if you look at short-term trends now, you're seeing that same thing happen. So maybe there's a little bit of per capita going down. I don't think it's all that significant. And then emerging markets is kind of a unique bucket. I'm not sure how to even think about per capita there. But certainly, that, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, those markets are struggling."

How -- beyond the next 12 months, I think, is a bit of a different answer. But as the on-premise is going to be down. I mean there's almost no question about that over the next 12 months. And that has been an important brand building channel throughout -- literally throughout the decades, I guess. So what is the result of that? I do think it pushes towards the tried and true trusted brands that we talked about a little bit earlier. I mean the the bars themselves -- one, you're not going to be running a lot of promotions in restaurants that are only 1/3 full. I mean that just doesn't make a lot of sense. And so we're reallocating dollars away from that channel, away from events and stadiums and things like that and more into what we would call broad-based media. So that is a brand building change happening there. But I also do think that it makes new brands, it's going to be more challenging for new tiny brands to dent into the big brands that are out there now, and that's a bit of a different trend compared to what has been happening. Craft brands have not really made a meaningful impact on market share over the last few years, they sort of topped out around 3% or 4%. We're still growing, but it's nothing like fear. I think those brands are going to have a hard time because restaurants that are struggling, that are only half full have to be careful with their inventories and have to rationalize their SKUs. And so you're going to see them gravitate towards brands that turn and so that's a benefit for Jack Daniel's. At the same time, it may make some of our other brands, take a Fords Gin as an example, which is much smaller, it makes it that much harder. And so I also think there's a dynamic where consumers are not -- you're not able to go up to a bar, look at 200 brands behind the bar and make a choice on a different -- something you want to try. You're sitting at a table, you have to be able to order something that you know and so experimentation goes down a little bit. And we'll just have to see how that plays out over time, but I do think there is -- there will be a bias in the on-premise world for the big tried and trusted brands. And we'll just have to see how that plays out."

This morning's conference call contains forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Numerous risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected in these statements. Many of the factors that will determine future results are beyond the company's ability to control or predict. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, and the company undertakes no obligation to update any of these statements, whether due to new information, future events or otherwise. 
This morning, we issued a press release containing our results for the fourth quarter fiscal 2020, in addition to posting presentation materials that Lawson and Jane will walk through momentarily. Both the release and the presentation can be found on our website under section titled Investors, Events and Presentations. In the press release, we have listed a number of risk factors that you should consider in conjunction with our forward-looking statements. Other significant risk factors are described in our Form 10-K and Form 10-Q reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
During this call, we will be describing certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures, a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the reasons management believes they provide useful information to investors regarding the company's financial conditions and results of operations are contained in the press release and investor presentation. 
As a reminder, before I turn the call over to Lawson and Jane, in the interest of time and fairness, we ask that you limit your questions to 1 per analyst. You are welcome to rejoin the queue, and we'll take your follow-up questions as time permits.

Our last investor call when we discussed third quarter earnings was on March 4, just before the world went into lockdown. Since that call, so much has changed around the world. So today, while we will cover our full year financial results, we're really going to focus more of our time updating you on the impact of the pandemic on our business and share how we have and will continue to strategically navigate the volatility and uncertainty that we are facing. But before we do that, let me say, the events happening across America have highlighted yet again the disturbing and systemic racism that persists in the United States. I'm proud of the work Brown-Forman and our employees have been doing in diversity inclusion for nearly 2 decades, which only accelerated when Ralph de Chabert, our Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer, joined the company in 2007. While we've been diligent in our diversity inclusion work, we all know that there's so much more to be done. 
These current events have sparked numerous conversations across the company about how we live our value of respect, about how we identify and eliminate bias within ourselves and how we continue to foster in an environment and relationships where we can bring our best selves to work. At Brown-Forman, we're continually challenging ourselves to be better and to do better as individuals, as leaders and as teams. 
I do want to highlight a few initiatives that our company that not only promote diversity and inclusion within the company, but also address racial inequality in Louisville, Kentucky, where we have our corporate headquarters. Last fall, we published our 2030 diversity and inclusion strategy, where we set quantitative ambitions, specifically for people of color and women. We've tied a portion of our executive compensation to make sure we can achieve these ambitions. We're also leading the new Racism and Business Council sponsored by Greater Louisville Inc. This council will focus on racism and inequality and will lead efforts to cultivate minority businesses and new talent. 
Another effort is with our largest and most influential brand, jack Daniel's, which is committed to uplifting the important story of its first Master Distiller Nearest Green. To help the life and legacy of Nearest, we're forming a partnership with Nearest Green, Inc. that will create developmental opportunities for African-American talent for senior distilling roles and support African-American entrepreneurs in distilling start-ups. More information about this partnership will be shared in the coming weeks. 
In the California neighborhood, home to our Louisville corporate campus, we're committed to being better neighbors. And over the past 3 years, we've made local community investments of more than $6 million, including supporting the nearby YMCA and Simmons College. In the coming months, we'll commit to providing additional resources for the Invest California initiative. This initiative will focus on improving education, economic development and wealth building for our closest neighbors, the majority of whom are black. 
In conclusion, I want to make it clear that we are committed as individuals and as an organization to continue to take action in order to address the racial and ethnic divides and inequalities in our local communities and our industry around the globe. 
All right. Now turning to the global COVID-19 pandemic. While a business challenge, above it all, we know it's a human tragedy. At Brown-Forman, as we always do, we took a people-first approach to this crisis, which means the health and safety of our employees is our #1 priority. In support of our colleagues, friends and partners facing hardship and loss, we've produced our own hand sanitizer to protect our workforce and community frontline workers. We've supplied and are continuing to supply high-proof alcohol to manufacturers of hand sanitizer, which now is producing over 20,000 gallons per day. We've also donated in communities where we work and live around the world from supporting bartender communities, restaurants, relief funds and community foundations to providing over 70,000 meals to soup kitchens and homeless shelters in Louisville as well as countless hours of volunteerism. I really would like to thank all of our 4,800 employees around the world for their exceptional agility and creativity and quickly shifting and adapting to the recent challenges. From our quick and nearly seamless transition to working from home where it's possible, adjusting on how we work in our production facilities to ensure the health and safety of our employees, which resulted in almost no impact to our supply chain. 
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Jane, who'll walk us through how our business has been impacted by COVID-19, the adjustments we have made to the business and the strength of our balance sheet. Afterwards, I'll share our strategic priorities that will continue to guide us through the near-term, and which I believe will position our brands and our business to be even stronger in the long term. Jane?"

Before I get into the results, I would like to build on some of Lawson's comments and acknowledge that the last several weeks have required our entire organization to pivot quickly to the changing business environment. Brought on first by the global pandemic to now tremendously trying times, especially for our black colleagues. As recent events highlight the continued work still to do in the United States to close the racial inequality's gap. I, too, would like to thank our entire employee population for our resilience and extra efforts during these trying times as we continue to work to grow our business. In these efforts, we understand that our diverse and inclusive culture is key to our continued success. And in these times, we are refocusing our efforts on deepening our understanding and acceptance of all of our differences. It was difficult to make a transition from these significant issues. Let's turn to our full year results. 
Fiscal '20 really was a year like no other. We began the year with a business environment in which our margins continue to be weighed down by tariffs, largely European tariffs and higher agave costs to end the year with a global pandemic and its resulting effect on the global economy that we are still facing today. Despite these challenges, we still achieved many significant accomplishments and milestones in fiscal 2020 that I'd like to take a moment and highlight. We saw Woodford Reserve exceed 1 million cases. We continue to innovate, developing and launching Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple and depleting over 250,000 cases in just 8 months. Our Jack Daniel's flavor portfolio surpassed 2.5 million cases. And to put that in perspective, none of our Jack Daniel's flavors existed a short 9 years ago, illustrating the importance that innovation has provided, including being a significant source of growth and bringing in numerous new consumers to the Jack Daniel's franchise. 
Jack Daniel's RTDs reached 1.5 million cases in Germany. Old Forester, our founding brand, grew underlying net sales double digits and is now over 300,000 cases. Our business in the U.S. accelerated its top line compared to fiscal 2019 and outpaced TDS for the first time since the summer of 2018. We transitioned our U.K. and Thailand business to own distribution, route-to-consumer models, both launching on May 1, 2020. We welcomed Fords Gin to our family of brands, and we closed another chapter in our 150-year history of enduring and thriving. 
I'm not going to spend a lot of time going through the financial performance for fiscal 2020 as we typically do, but instead focus more on the last couple of months of the fiscal year, where our results were significantly impacted by the global health pandemic. First, as a reminder, we completed our third quarter of the fiscal year on January 31, 2020, with year-to-date underlying net sales growth of 3%. This trend held up for us through February. We began to experience the effect of the pandemic on our results beginning in mid-March, and it continued throughout April as many of our major markets went into countries-wide lockdowns, implemented significant stay-at-home restrictions and shutdown are severely limited the on-premise business, which represents approximately 20% of our business globally. In addition, travel bans and other restrictions were implemented and these significantly impacted the Travel Retail channel. As a result, we estimate that the pandemic negatively affected our underlying net sales approximately 15% for the March-April period with a greater negative effect occurring in April, following some benefit we believe we experienced from pantry loading in March. 
As we look broadly across our geographic clusters, all were affected during this period, some more than others. I want to call your attention to this on Slide 7 of our presentation we uploaded to our Investor Relations website this morning. As you can see, the most notable decline occurred in our Travel Retail business where international travel and cruise channels essentially halted overnight. Additionally, our emerging markets were down significantly. Some markets, such as Mexico, went into the crisis with weak economic conditions. Further, history would suggest that it is coming for emerging market consumers to reduce spending on our category and focus on essential needs during challenging economic times. 
Our developed international markets experienced underlying net sales decline similar to the company for the March-April period and worse in the U.S. While we saw strong off-premise consumer takeaway trends across many of these markets, these increases were not sufficient to offset the on-premise closures. And finally, while our business in the U.S. experienced a slowdown in performance over this 2-month period, it held up well and continued to grow. 
Since the pandemic began to affect the U.S., the off-premise takeaway trends for beverage alcohol significantly accelerated and have remained robust over the past 13 weeks with spirits growing the fastest. While we expect there were some early on pantry loading in mid- to late March, overall consumption has clearly shifted from the on-premise to new at-home occasions. Our blended takeaway trends over the period have outperformed TDS. And importantly, the strong growth in the off-premise channel has offset the significant hit to the on-premise business. 
In many of our major markets around the world, consumer purchase patterns changed quickly as bars and restaurants essentially shut down. We saw impressive growth of our brands in the e-premise channel and significant acceleration in large off-premise accounts. We observe consumers moving towards trusted brands and seeking opportunities to indulge everyday luxuries. We noted the consumers are seeking convenience such as RTDs and flavored whiskeys and increased home-consumption occasions, including virtual cocktail parties. And we ascertain the consumers were and are still making larger, less frequent shopping trips. 
We quickly made adjustments to our focus and resources based on these trends and applied on a market-by-market basis. For example, we reprioritized our portfolio and we shifted our focus to channels where the consumer was and continues to shop. We shifted advertising investments and teams to align with these reprioritized areas of focus, such as digital as well as prioritize off-premise accounts such as classic versus convenience, large-format versus independent. We reduced discretionary spending, such as T&E. We stopped spending behind on-premise activities and various events and sponsorships that were canceled. And we accelerated and fueled our activities in the e-premise channel in several key markets globally. 
As the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on the global economy continues to evolve, we are closely monitoring key indicators in each market, such as the stage of restrictions in a given market or country, consumer trends and behavioral insights and macroeconomic conditions. We believe this will aid us in our evaluation of the pace of recovery and appropriately identify opportunities. 
Now given the high degree of uncertainty that we all face in these times, I'd like to take a few minutes to comment on our financial position and specifically to address the topic of liquidity. First of all, a few relevant facts. On April 30, the end of our fiscal year 2020, we had $675 million in cash equivalents on hand. Our commercial paper balance was roughly $330 million with an average of over 70 days to maturity for paper outstanding, and we had approximately $2.3 billion of long-term debt outstanding. Importantly, in a long-term debt picture, we have no maturity scheduled until our fiscal 2023. Our $800 million credit facility was and remains undrawn. 
So we believe our financial position remains strong and our continuing capacity to generate solid operating cash flows is sound. We believe our strengths will allow us to navigate this crisis as circumstances evolve. That said, we have taken and will continue to take additional steps to secure our strong financial position, managing both our uses and sources of cash. For example, while we continue to manage our uses of cash thoughtfully as we always have, we have turned up our focus in a few areas. Naturally, we are managing our operating expenses closely and have significantly curtailed discretionary spending, such as freezes for hiring and travel. 
On the CapEx front, we will continue to invest behind the business with an eye toward the future and not forego important maintenance spending. However, we are reprioritizing and deferring certain spending where prudent. We are more actively managing our working capital, including monitoring credit closely while working constructively with our customers most affected by the crisis. 
In parallel to our management of our cash usage, we have bolstered our cash balances and position Brown-Forman to access additional liquidity, if needed. First, just a few comments on the short-term debt markets and our recent experience. Rewinding to March, despite extremely volatile conditions in the short-term debt market then, which have improved markedly since then, we sustained our access to short-term funding in the commercial paper market. Leading up to our fiscal year-end, we added to our cash position by issuing commercial paper, more of it and with longer durations than usual, enabling us to fortify our cash position. Looking ahead, we expect to meet our short-term liquidity needs through cash generated from operations and borrowings under our commercial paper program. However, as you know well, these are dynamic times. So we are closely monitoring both our own liquidity outlook based on various scenarios and conditions in the debt capital markets. If our appraisals suggest a worsening situation, we won't hesitate to increase our margin of safety on the liquidity front. 
Considering our history of strong operating cash flows, our excellent credit ratings and the resilience of our industry in our business in these turbulent times, we expect that, if needed, we could access additional debt capital readily and with favorable terms. 
And finally, to our fiscal '21 outlook. As we indicated in our earnings release this morning, we face substantial uncertainty related to the evolving COVID-19 global pandemic and its effect on the global economy. As a result of this uncertainty, we are not able to provide quantitative guidance for fiscal 2021 at this time. We hope to have a better picture of how the recovery, including this economic effect on consumers, may unfold and affect our full year financial results when we report our Q1 performance later this summer. 
With that being said, based on our early read of our performance in May, we believe that our top line results will show some improvements to that we experienced in March, April, but still down relative to last year. Separately, given our strong balance sheet, solid cash flows and ample liquidity, we expect to fully fund ongoing investment in our business and continue to pay regular dividends. 
In summary, while fiscal 2020 was a year like no other in our 150-year history and we expect to continue to face headwinds given the current environment, our view of the ultimate global opportunity for our brands is undiminished. We believe our talented, resilient and agile employees, our commitment to diversity and inclusion, our attractive portfolio of brands and growing categories, our resilient global supply chain and our strong balance sheet will allow us to emerge an even stronger company with healthier brands that will drive our growth for the next generation. 
And with that, let me turn the call back over to Lawson to conclude our prepared remarks this morning."

As we all know, there is substantial amount of uncertainty in the world and in the days ahead, but we do have 150 years of experience of successfully navigating many challenges. These include world wars, a prior pandemic, prohibition, a depression and recessions. Although this global pandemic and economic challenge is certainly different, I do believe we'll endure and we will reemerge even stronger. 
I'm optimistic about our future and confident we have the right strategy to guide us now and as we look ahead. We're well positioned in some of the best categories in the spirits industry, and we remain focused on developing a premium portfolio that we can develop around the world. In this current environment, we know that consumers are looking for both trusted brands and for an opportunity to indulge in everyday luxuries. 
I want to argue that Jack Daniel's is actually the most trusted brand in the spirits industry. We continue to strive to deliver balanced geographic growth with competitive routes to consumer. Near term, we will be reallocating more towards the developed markets, including the United States, where spirits consumption has been relatively stronger. We'll also be allocating more resources towards channels like e-commerce to ensure we're utilizing the most competitive routes to consumer. 
A hallmark of Brown-Forman, we intend to maintain our historically disciplined approach to capital deployment, including our commitment to return cash to shareholders in a prudent, yet opportunistic, manner. Additionally, we aspire to deliver top-tier total shareholder returns over the long term. 
And finally, we will continue to leverage our talent and agile workforce. Over the last few months, I've seen truly exceptional examples of adaptability and resilience in our people. People will continue to be our most important asset. As discussed and shared with you on many occasions in the past, we think about our future in generations. This crisis provides us with the opportunity to reimagine the next generation of growth for our brands, our geographies, our people and our investments. At the end of the day, our goal is to ensure the long-term health of our iconic brands. 
And finally, we'll continue to be guided by our values while working to preserve the resources of our planet, educating consumers on responsible consumption of our brands and ensuring the communities in which we live and work will provide social equities for all. 
With that, Dorothy, you may open up the call for questions."

And even over the last 12 months, if you look at the difference between value and volume, you continue to see very strong premiumization trends in the industry. 
Now if you look over what's happened over the last couple of months, those trends have continued. You haven't seen the trade down that, honestly some of us were worried about. Ultra-premium is still growing the fastest in super and then and work your way down the chain. So even in this environment and this particular set of circumstances that we're in, the premiumization trends continue. So I think we feel good about that, and our portfolio does skew to that and we continue to -- we want to continue to make that happen. So as far as looking out ahead over the next couple of years, I don't see us changing our portfolio strategy other than to focus on more super-premium and above brands. I mean that's where the -- not only where the growth has been, but I think it's where our company performs the best. It's one of the reasons we created that emerging brands group for the U.S. It's been 2 years now has driven those very super-premium brands that needed to focus, and they have had an outstanding run now for 2 years, last 2 months accepted.

Again, there's a lot of dynamics going on here. And as you said, set it up perfectly, countries are at different stages of the pandemic, countries are at different stages of coming out of the pandemic, different stages of opening, different states, different -- all kinds of different things that are effecting us. And so the answer is not a simple answer as you can imagine. What we saw some improvement on in the month of May, what we're looking at current trends are places like the U.S. and certain channel or certain portfolio, I guess, I should say. So our Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey, our RTDs are doing quite well. Our Global Travel Retail remains down still. So what we saw in the month of March, April, which was down around 65%, that's still holding the same. Some of our emerging markets have improved. So China, we see that early look, looks like it's back to levels it was a year ago, May. Other parts of Southeast Asia have rebounded. But then you still have other parts of Latin America that are just -- other parts of emerging markets such as Latin America that are just going into the pandemic. So there's not a one size fits all answer here, I hate to say. But I would like to build on some of the things that we are seeing. If this might help you think about the on-premise and the business, primarily in the developed markets. 
So if we think about Europe, it's a bit further behind than the U.S. For instance, our second largest market is the U.K. The loosening of the restrictions there for bars and restaurants is not going to be till July 4, you probably know this. France just opened last week. Germany has been opened since the middle of May, and we've seen nice trends in Germany since this reopened. In the U.S., the trends are -- for the -- what we've been following it, those trends for the early openings of those that opened prior to May 15, where we saw the off-premise was down, say, in the 90% range. By the end of May, they had improved to down 70%. So we're seeing a nice improvement, but slow improvement. Of course, this is all going to be dependent upon the consumer, the fillings of safety and when they feel like they can come back. So I wish there was an easier answer for you, but that's why it's so hard to also give any kind of forecast right now because there are so many scenarios and so many things at play that are impacting each and every market. And one size does not fit all, now it's hard to generalize anything in this environment."

And that's where I have the most concern about what the next year may look like. Our emerging markets, which over the last few years has been a very dynamic, sort of double-digit growth area for many of the years, was already slowing a bit on this fiscal year. We're still growing but it was slowing. A lot of that was led by Mexico, which is our largest emerging market, and Mexico has had its own economic problems going back over the last 12 to 18 months. And so we saw some weakness there earlier on, and that was a big portion of the change in our sales. But if you look out at the rest of the emerging markets world, I'm talking about South America, Africa, particularly South Africa. If you look across parts of Asia and India, a lot of those countries have gone into either a complete shutdown or something close to a complete shutdown. And those markets don't have this social safety methods you're seeing in the U.S. and most of Western Europe. And so those markets, when they go into shutdown, people don't have money for luxuries at all. And they're really going to the basic goods and trying just being able to try to survive. And so I do think you're going to see a deeper problem in those markets and it's going to be tougher to come out of there. So yes. I would argue that emerging markets are the place that we were trying to figure out how that's going to go, but it does have a fair amount of concern."

And so when you have -- and you think about TDS, where it's got value, it's got all kinds of things. So a lot of the value brands are not in on-premise locations and probably aren't down -- like are being pulled down because of that loss of business. So it's just something as you get into the results to start understanding that. And as it comes back -- I should have said this earlier, too, as it comes back in the space that we've seen that opened early in May, where we've seen the drop from the on-premise declines of 90% down the 70%, we've actually seen the trends hold up quite well in the off-premise over that period of time in the mid-single digits.

If you could comment on that. I'm not sure if there is a number that you guys track or how closely you look at it. But what I'm really looking for is the overall category growth rate in terms of what you're seeing more recently in May and June for the bourbon category. And then if you'd indulge me, just a housekeeping question for Jane. Collection risk or bad debt risk in the on-premise channel, given that some of these bars restaurants will not come out of this. Does that entirely reside with distributors? Or is there any risk-sharing that's going to take place with Brown-Forman?"

So Kevin, I think you're asking about the trend, the bourbon trends in the U.S. business, and I can NABCA data. And like I said to Vivien a few moments ago, really do have to start pulling it apart and understand what's going on there. And the actual overall bourbon trends in the off-premise have remained very strong. They're up about 36%. Now what you've got to do is you've got to pull out Pennsylvania, which shut down, and you got to pull out the on-premise business. Once you've done that, again, we show growth of around 36%. 
Brown-Forman is growing faster than that. Our bourbon and Tennessee Whiskey are growing around 38%. This is for the most recent data through April. We did see a small -- I guess a slowdown, if you will, that you're referring to in May, maybe from the Nielsens and the categories, but still up very strong. It's still up in the 30 percentage range from an off-premise takeaway trend perspective. So we feel good about that. What you saw, though, in those trends is an acceleration in a couple of categories, a few categories. It was cordials, liquors and tequilas. And of course, our portfolio has some in it. We have wonderful tequilas. We have liquors to think of Honey and Fire and Apple, but that's the extent of our portfolio in those categories. 
So I feel optimistic still that we're still seeing very strong trends from the syndicated data as it relates to bourbon and Tennessee Whiskey. 
And then your question about our bad debt. I thought it might be helpful just to talk about what we've done on that just for a moment and then I can get specifically to your question. But since this pandemic started, we've really been working actively with the customers around the globe and looking for ways to partner with them on credit issues in a really productive way. So not surprisingly in March and April, customers catering to the on-premise and Travel Retail channels requested additional credit due to the fall offs in their business, and that's not surprising. And those comments are more outside the U.S. I think you were referring to in the U.S. but what..."

So you're not seeing any degradation in our credit picture, by the way. No change in our bad debt. So that's outside the U.S. As it relates to anything going on in the U.S., we sell to our distributors and distributors sell on to the retailers. We have not had anybody. So that's really their -- I guess their risk at that point in time. Of course, I think with the openings as the on-premise is starting to happen. Hopefully, some of those, we'll get moving there. But to your point, there may be some bad debt -- or excuse me, uncollectibility on their part that what they end up doing is probably just shifting and around and using in other parts of their distributor houses. That could then affect, of course, our shipments in the short term, but not long term."

So if you look at the U.S., spirits has been very healthy in the U.S. for 10 years or more -- well, 20 years or more. The trend of spirits taking share from beer and wine has continued and has accelerated over the last few months. And so per capita, in the U.S., I would say, is probably ticking up a little bit. But you go to Europe and it's a bit of the opposite. It's not an extreme change, but beer has been healthier than spirits in Europe for the last few years. And even if you look at short-term trends now, you're seeing that same thing happen. So maybe there's a little bit of per capita going down. I don't think it's all that significant. And then emerging markets is kind of a unique bucket. I'm not sure how to even think about per capita there. But certainly, that, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, those markets are struggling."

I mean the bars themselves, one, you're not going to be running a lot of promotions in restaurants that are only 1/3 full. I mean that just doesn't make a lot of sense. And so we're reallocating dollars away from that channel, away from events and stadiums and things like that and more into what we would call broad-based media. So that is a brand-building change happening there. But I also do think that it makes new brands. It's going to be more challenging for new tiny brands to dent into the big brands that are out there now, and that's a bit of a different trend compared to what has been happening. Craft brands have not really made a meaningful impact on market share over the last few years. They sort of topped out around 3% or 4%. We're still growing, but it's nothing like beer. I think those brands are going to have a hard time because restaurants that are struggling that are only half full, have to be careful with their inventories and have to rationalize the SKUs. And so you're going to see them gravitate towards brands that turn and so that's a benefit for Jack Daniel's. At the same time, it may make some of our other brands take a Fords Gin as an example, which is much smaller, it makes it that much harder. And so I also think there's a dynamic where consumers are not -- you're not able to go up to a bar, look at 200 brands behind in the bar and make a choice on a different -- something you want to try. You're sitting at a table, you have to be able to order something that you know. And so experimentation goes down a little bit. And we'll just have to see how that plays out over time, but I do think there is -- there will be a bias in the on-premise world for the big tried and trusted brands. And we'll just have to see how that plays out."

And so I think even with our e-premise -- e-commerce and e-premise premise space, the contactless economy, but the digital everything is coming about. And so that's going to be areas that we look at, too.

Now the international expansion on Apple has been hindered by this. We still -- it did launch in the U.K. and in Germany and France and a few others, but we've sort of pulled back a little bit, particularly in markets that have a high on-premise percentage of business, so the Italy and Spain and places like that. We just said, let's not even launch right now, it just doesn't make any sense in that environment. So that has slowed the international rollout out, but that's a matter of timing.

This morning's conference call contains forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Numerous risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected in these statements. Many of the factors that will determine future results are beyond the company's ability to control or predict. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, and the company undertakes no obligation to update any of these statements, whether due to new information, future events or otherwise. 
This morning, we issued a press release containing our results for the fourth quarter fiscal 2020, in addition to posting presentation materials that Lawson and Jane will walk through momentarily.

Our last investor call when we discussed third quarter earnings was on March 4, just before the world went into lockdown. Since that call, so much has changed around the world. So today, while we will cover our full year financial results, we're really going to focus more of our time updating you on the impact of the pandemic on our business and share how we have and will continue to strategically navigate the volatility and uncertainty that we are facing. But before we do that, let me say, the events happening across America have highlighted yet again the disturbing and systemic racism that persists in the United States. I'm proud of the work Brown-Forman and our employees have been doing in diversity inclusion for nearly 2 decades, which only accelerated when Ralph de Chabert, our Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer, joined the company in 2007. While we've been diligent in our diversity inclusion work, we all know that there's so much more to be done. 
These current events have sparked numerous conversations across the company about how we live our value of respect, about how we identify and eliminate bias within ourselves and how we continue to foster in an environment and relationships where we can bring our best selves to work. At Brown-Forman, we're continually challenging ourselves to be better and to do better as individuals, as leaders and as teams. 
I do want to highlight a few initiatives that our company that not only promote diversity and inclusion within the company, but also address racial inequality in Louisville, Kentucky, where we have our corporate headquarters. Last fall, we published our 2030 diversity and inclusion strategy, where we set quantitative ambitions, specifically for people of color and women. We've tied a portion of our executive compensation to make sure we can achieve these ambitions. We're also leading the new Racism and Business Council sponsored by Greater Louisville Inc. This council will focus on racism and inequality and will lead efforts to cultivate minority businesses and new talent. 
Another effort is with our largest and most influential brand, jack Daniel's, which is committed to uplifting the important story of its first Master Distiller Nearest Green. To help the life and legacy of Nearest, we're forming a partnership with Nearest Green, Inc. that will create developmental opportunities for African-American talent for senior distilling roles and support African-American entrepreneurs in distilling start-ups. More information about this partnership will be shared in the coming weeks. 
In the California neighborhood, home to our Louisville corporate campus, we're committed to being better neighbors. And over the past 3 years, we've made local community investments of more than $6 million, including supporting the nearby YMCA and Simmons College. In the coming months, we'll commit to providing additional resources for the Invest California initiative. This initiative will focus on improving education, economic development and wealth building for our closest neighbors, the majority of whom are black. 
In conclusion, I want to make it clear that we are committed as individuals and as an organization to continue to take action in order to address the racial and ethnic divides and inequalities in our local communities and our industry around the globe. 
All right. Now turning to the global COVID-19 pandemic. While a business challenge, above it all, we know it's a human tragedy. At Brown-Forman, as we always do, we took a people-first approach to this crisis, which means the health and safety of our employees is our #1 priority. In support of our colleagues, friends and partners facing hardship and loss, we've produced our own hand sanitizer to protect our workforce and community frontline workers. We've supplied and are continuing to supply high-proof alcohol to manufacturers of hand sanitizer, which now is producing over 20,000 gallons per day. We've also donated in communities where we work and live around the world from supporting bartender communities, restaurants, relief funds and community foundations to providing over 70,000 meals to soup kitchens and homeless shelters in Louisville as well as countless hours of volunteerism. I really would like to thank all of our 4,800 employees around the world for their exceptional agility and creativity and quickly shifting and adapting to the recent challenges. From our quick and nearly seamless transition to working from home where it's possible, adjusting on how we work in our production facilities to ensure the health and safety of our employees, which resulted in almost no impact to our supply chain. 
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Jane, who'll walk us through how our business has been impacted by COVID-19, the adjustments we have made to the business and the strength of our balance sheet. Afterwards, I'll share our strategic priorities that will continue to guide us through the near-term, and which I believe will position our brands and our business to be even stronger in the long term. Jane?"

Before I get into the results, I would like to build on some of Lawson's comments and acknowledge that the last several weeks have required our entire organization to pivot quickly to the changing business environment. Brought on first by the global pandemic to now tremendously trying times, especially for our black colleagues. As recent events highlight the continued work still to do in the United States to close the racial inequality's gap. I, too, would like to thank our entire employee population for our resilience and extra efforts during these trying times as we continue to work to grow our business. In these efforts, we understand that our diverse and inclusive culture is key to our continued success. And in these times, we are refocusing our efforts on deepening our understanding and acceptance of all of our differences. It was difficult to make a transition from these significant issues. Let's turn to our full year results. 
Fiscal '20 really was a year like no other. We began the year with a business environment in which our margins continue to be weighed down by tariffs, largely European tariffs and higher agave costs to end the year with a global pandemic and its resulting effect on the global economy that we are still facing today. Despite these challenges, we still achieved many significant accomplishments and milestones in fiscal 2020 that I'd like to take a moment and highlight. We saw Woodford Reserve exceed 1 million cases. We continue to innovate, developing and launching Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple and depleting over 250,000 cases in just 8 months. Our Jack Daniel's flavor portfolio surpassed 2.5 million cases. And to put that in perspective, none of our Jack Daniel's flavors existed a short 9 years ago, illustrating the importance that innovation has provided, including being a significant source of growth and bringing in numerous new consumers to the Jack Daniel's franchise. 
Jack Daniel's RTDs reached 1.5 million cases in Germany. Old Forester, our founding brand, grew underlying net sales double digits and is now over 300,000 cases. Our business in the U.S. accelerated its top line compared to fiscal 2019 and outpaced TDS for the first time since the summer of 2018. We transitioned our U.K. and Thailand business to own distribution, route-to-consumer models, both launching on May 1, 2020. We welcomed Fords Gin to our family of brands, and we closed another chapter in our 150-year history of enduring and thriving. 
I'm not going to spend a lot of time going through the financial performance for fiscal 2020 as we typically do, but instead focus more on the last couple of months of the fiscal year, where our results were significantly impacted by the global health pandemic. First, as a reminder, we completed our third quarter of the fiscal year on January 31, 2020, with year-to-date underlying net sales growth of 3%. This trend held up for us through February. We began to experience the effect of the pandemic on our results beginning in mid-March, and it continued throughout April as many of our major markets went into countries-wide lockdowns, implemented significant stay-at-home restrictions and shutdown are severely limited the on-premise business, which represents approximately 20% of our business globally. In addition, travel bans and other restrictions were implemented and these significantly impacted the Travel Retail channel. As a result, we estimate that the pandemic negatively affected our underlying net sales approximately 15% for the March-April period with a greater negative effect occurring in April, following some benefit we believe we experienced from pantry loading in March. 
As we look broadly across our geographic clusters, all were affected during this period, some more than others. I want to call your attention to this on Slide 7 of our presentation we uploaded to our Investor Relations website this morning. As you can see, the most notable decline occurred in our Travel Retail business where international travel and cruise channels essentially halted overnight. Additionally, our emerging markets were down significantly. Some markets, such as Mexico, went into the crisis with weak economic conditions. Further, history would suggest that it is coming for emerging market consumers to reduce spending on our category and focus on essential needs during challenging economic times. 
Our developed international markets experienced underlying net sales decline similar to the company for the March-April period and worse in the U.S. While we saw strong off-premise consumer takeaway trends across many of these markets, these increases were not sufficient to offset the on-premise closures. And finally, while our business in the U.S. experienced a slowdown in performance over this 2-month period, it held up well and continued to grow. 
Since the pandemic began to affect the U.S., the off-premise takeaway trends for beverage alcohol significantly accelerated and have remained robust over the past 13 weeks with spirits growing the fastest. While we expect there were some early on pantry loading in mid- to late March, overall consumption has clearly shifted from the on-premise to new at-home occasions. Our blended takeaway trends over the period have outperformed TDS. And importantly, the strong growth in the off-premise channel has offset the significant hit to the on-premise business. 
In many of our major markets around the world, consumer purchase patterns changed quickly as bars and restaurants essentially shut down. We saw impressive growth of our brands in the e-premise channel and significant acceleration in large off-premise accounts. We observe consumers moving towards trusted brands and seeking opportunities to indulge everyday luxuries. We noted the consumers are seeking convenience such as RTDs and flavored whiskeys and increased home-consumption occasions, including virtual cocktail parties. And we ascertain the consumers were and are still making larger, less frequent shopping trips. 
We quickly made adjustments to our focus and resources based on these trends and applied on a market-by-market basis. For example, we reprioritized our portfolio and we shifted our focus to channels where the consumer was and continues to shop. We shifted advertising investments and teams to align with these reprioritized areas of focus, such as digital as well as prioritize off-premise accounts such as classic versus convenience, large-format versus independent. We reduced discretionary spending, such as T&E. We stopped spending behind on-premise activities and various events and sponsorships that were canceled. And we accelerated and fueled our activities in the e-premise channel in several key markets globally. 
As the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on the global economy continues to evolve, we are closely monitoring key indicators in each market, such as the stage of restrictions in a given market or country, consumer trends and behavioral insights and macroeconomic conditions. We believe this will aid us in our evaluation of the pace of recovery and appropriately identify opportunities. 
Now given the high degree of uncertainty that we all face in these times, I'd like to take a few minutes to comment on our financial position and specifically to address the topic of liquidity. First of all, a few relevant facts. On April 30, the end of our fiscal year 2020, we had $675 million in cash equivalents on hand. Our commercial paper balance was roughly $330 million with an average of over 70 days to maturity for paper outstanding, and we had approximately $2.3 billion of long-term debt outstanding. Importantly, in a long-term debt picture, we have no maturity scheduled until our fiscal 2023. Our $800 million credit facility was and remains undrawn. 
So we believe our financial position remains strong and our continuing capacity to generate solid operating cash flows is sound. We believe our strengths will allow us to navigate this crisis as circumstances evolve. That said, we have taken and will continue to take additional steps to secure our strong financial position, managing both our uses and sources of cash. For example, while we continue to manage our uses of cash thoughtfully as we always have, we have turned up our focus in a few areas. Naturally, we are managing our operating expenses closely and have significantly curtailed discretionary spending, such as freezes for hiring and travel. 
On the CapEx front, we will continue to invest behind the business with an eye toward the future and not forego important maintenance spending. However, we are reprioritizing and deferring certain spending where prudent. We are more actively managing our working capital, including monitoring credit closely while working constructively with our customers most affected by the crisis. 
In parallel to our management of our cash usage, we have bolstered our cash balances and position Brown-Forman to access additional liquidity, if needed. First, just a few comments on the short-term debt markets and our recent experience. Rewinding to March, despite extremely volatile conditions in the short-term debt market then, which have improved markedly since then, we sustained our access to short-term funding in the commercial paper market. Leading up to our fiscal year-end, we added to our cash position by issuing commercial paper, more of it and with longer durations than usual, enabling us to fortify our cash position. Looking ahead, we expect to meet our short-term liquidity needs through cash generated from operations and borrowings under our commercial paper program. However, as you know well, these are dynamic times. So we are closely monitoring both our own liquidity outlook based on various scenarios and conditions in the debt capital markets. If our appraisals suggest a worsening situation, we won't hesitate to increase our margin of safety on the liquidity front. 
Considering our history of strong operating cash flows, our excellent credit ratings and the resilience of our industry in our business in these turbulent times, we expect that, if needed, we could access additional debt capital readily and with favorable terms. 
And finally, to our fiscal '21 outlook. As we indicated in our earnings release this morning, we face substantial uncertainty related to the evolving COVID-19 global pandemic and its effect on the global economy. As a result of this uncertainty, we are not able to provide quantitative guidance for fiscal 2021 at this time. We hope to have a better picture of how the recovery, including this economic effect on consumers, may unfold and affect our full year financial results when we report our Q1 performance later this summer. 
With that being said, based on our early read of our performance in May, we believe that our top line results will show some improvements to that we experienced in March, April, but still down relative to last year. Separately, given our strong balance sheet, solid cash flows and ample liquidity, we expect to fully fund ongoing investment in our business and continue to pay regular dividends. 
In summary, while fiscal 2020 was a year like no other in our 150-year history and we expect to continue to face headwinds given the current environment, our view of the ultimate global opportunity for our brands is undiminished. We believe our talented, resilient and agile employees, our commitment to diversity and inclusion, our attractive portfolio of brands and growing categories, our resilient global supply chain and our strong balance sheet will allow us to emerge an even stronger company with healthier brands that will drive our growth for the next generation. 
And with that, let me turn the call back over to Lawson to conclude our prepared remarks this morning."

As we all know, there is substantial amount of uncertainty in the world and in the days ahead, but we do have 150 years of experience of successfully navigating many challenges. These include world wars, a prior pandemic, prohibition, a depression and recessions. Although this global pandemic and economic challenge is certainly different, I do believe we'll endure and we will reemerge even stronger. 
I'm optimistic about our future and confident we have the right strategy to guide us now and as we look ahead. We're well positioned in some of the best categories in the spirits industry, and we remain focused on developing a premium portfolio that we can develop around the world. In this current environment, we know that consumers are looking for both trusted brands and for an opportunity to indulge in everyday luxuries. 
I want to argue that Jack Daniel's is actually the most trusted brand in the spirits industry. We continue to strive to deliver balanced geographic growth with competitive routes to consumer. Near term, we will be reallocating more towards the developed markets, including the United States, where spirits consumption has been relatively stronger. We'll also be allocating more resources towards channels like e-commerce to ensure we're utilizing the most competitive routes to consumer. 
A hallmark of Brown-Forman, we intend to maintain our historically disciplined approach to capital deployment, including our commitment to return cash to shareholders in a prudent, yet opportunistic, manner. Additionally, we aspire to deliver top-tier total shareholder returns over the long term.

I mean one thing, the premiumization, as you know, over the last 12 months, really over the last decade has been one of the biggest macro factors in our industry. And even over the last 12 months, if you look at the difference between value and volume, you continue to see very strong premiumization trends in the industry. 
Now if you look over what's happened over the last couple of months, those trends have continued. You haven't seen the trade down that, honestly some of us were worried about. Ultra-premium is still growing the fastest in super and then and work your way down the chain. So even in this environment and this particular set of circumstances that we're in, the premiumization trends continue. So I think we feel good about that, and our portfolio does skew to that and we continue to -- we want to continue to make that happen. So as far as looking out ahead over the next couple of years, I don't see us changing our portfolio strategy other than to focus on more super-premium and above brands. I mean that's where the -- not only where the growth has been, but I think it's where our company performs the best. It's one of the reasons we created that emerging brands group for the U.S. It's been 2 years now has driven those very super-premium brands that needed to focus, and they have had an outstanding run now for 2 years, last 2 months accepted.

Again, there's a lot of dynamics going on here. And as you said, set it up perfectly, countries are at different stages of the pandemic, countries are at different stages of coming out of the pandemic, different stages of opening, different states, different -- all kinds of different things that are effecting us. And so the answer is not a simple answer as you can imagine. What we saw some improvement on in the month of May, what we're looking at current trends are places like the U.S. and certain channel or certain portfolio, I guess, I should say. So our Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey, our RTDs are doing quite well. Our Global Travel Retail remains down still. So what we saw in the month of March, April, which was down around 65%, that's still holding the same. Some of our emerging markets have improved. So China, we see that early look, looks like it's back to levels it was a year ago, May. Other parts of Southeast Asia have rebounded. But then you still have other parts of Latin America that are just -- other parts of emerging markets such as Latin America that are just going into the pandemic. So there's not a one size fits all answer here, I hate to say. But I would like to build on some of the things that we are seeing. If this might help you think about the on-premise and the business, primarily in the developed markets. 
So if we think about Europe, it's a bit further behind than the U.S. For instance, our second largest market is the U.K. The loosening of the restrictions there for bars and restaurants is not going to be till July 4, you probably know this. France just opened last week. Germany has been opened since the middle of May, and we've seen nice trends in Germany since this reopened. In the U.S., the trends are -- for the -- what we've been following it, those trends for the early openings of those that opened prior to May 15, where we saw the off-premise was down, say, in the 90% range. By the end of May, they had improved to down 70%. So we're seeing a nice improvement, but slow improvement. Of course, this is all going to be dependent upon the consumer, the fillings of safety and when they feel like they can come back. So I wish there was an easier answer for you, but that's why it's so hard to also give any kind of forecast right now because there are so many scenarios and so many things at play that are impacting each and every market. And one size does not fit all, now it's hard to generalize anything in this environment."

And that's where I have the most concern about what the next year may look like. Our emerging markets, which over the last few years has been a very dynamic, sort of double-digit growth area for many of the years, was already slowing a bit on this fiscal year. We're still growing but it was slowing. A lot of that was led by Mexico, which is our largest emerging market, and Mexico has had its own economic problems going back over the last 12 to 18 months. And so we saw some weakness there earlier on, and that was a big portion of the change in our sales. But if you look out at the rest of the emerging markets world, I'm talking about South America, Africa, particularly South Africa. If you look across parts of Asia and India, a lot of those countries have gone into either a complete shutdown or something close to a complete shutdown. And those markets don't have this social safety methods you're seeing in the U.S. and most of Western Europe. And so those markets, when they go into shutdown, people don't have money for luxuries at all. And they're really going to the basic goods and trying just being able to try to survive. And so I do think you're going to see a deeper problem in those markets and it's going to be tougher to come out of there. So yes. I would argue that emerging markets are the place that we were trying to figure out how that's going to go, but it does have a fair amount of concern."

And so when you have -- and you think about TDS, where it's got value, it's got all kinds of things. So a lot of the value brands are not in on-premise locations and probably aren't down -- like are being pulled down because of that loss of business. So it's just something as you get into the results to start understanding that. And as it comes back -- I should have said this earlier, too, as it comes back in the space that we've seen that opened early in May, where we've seen the drop from the on-premise declines of 90% down the 70%, we've actually seen the trends hold up quite well in the off-premise over that period of time in the mid-single digits.

So Kevin, I think you're asking about the trend, the bourbon trends in the U.S. business, and I can NABCA data. And like I said to Vivien a few moments ago, really do have to start pulling it apart and understand what's going on there. And the actual overall bourbon trends in the off-premise have remained very strong. They're up about 36%. Now what you've got to do is you've got to pull out Pennsylvania, which shut down, and you got to pull out the on-premise business. Once you've done that, again, we show growth of around 36%. 
Brown-Forman is growing faster than that. Our bourbon and Tennessee Whiskey are growing around 38%. This is for the most recent data through April. We did see a small -- I guess a slowdown, if you will, that you're referring to in May, maybe from the Nielsens and the categories, but still up very strong. It's still up in the 30 percentage range from an off-premise takeaway trend perspective. So we feel good about that. What you saw, though, in those trends is an acceleration in a couple of categories, a few categories. It was cordials, liquors and tequilas. And of course, our portfolio has some in it. We have wonderful tequilas. We have liquors to think of Honey and Fire and Apple, but that's the extent of our portfolio in those categories. 
So I feel optimistic still that we're still seeing very strong trends from the syndicated data as it relates to bourbon and Tennessee Whiskey. 
And then your question about our bad debt. I thought it might be helpful just to talk about what we've done on that just for a moment and then I can get specifically to your question. But since this pandemic started, we've really been working actively with the customers around the globe and looking for ways to partner with them on credit issues in a really productive way. So not surprisingly in March and April, customers catering to the on-premise and Travel Retail channels requested additional credit due to the fall offs in their business, and that's not surprising. And those comments are more outside the U.S. I think you were referring to in the U.S. but what..."

So you're not seeing any degradation in our credit picture, by the way. No change in our bad debt. So that's outside the U.S. As it relates to anything going on in the U.S., we sell to our distributors and distributors sell on to the retailers. We have not had anybody. So that's really their -- I guess their risk at that point in time. Of course, I think with the openings as the on-premise is starting to happen. Hopefully, some of those, we'll get moving there. But to your point, there may be some bad debt -- or excuse me, uncollectibility on their part that what they end up doing is probably just shifting and around and using in other parts of their distributor houses.

I do think one of the things that's happened over the last few months compared to what had been happening in the prior years before it is whatever trends were happening seem to be an exaggerated. So if you look at the U.S., spirits has been very healthy in the U.S. for 10 years or more -- well, 20 years or more. The trend of spirits taking share from beer and wine has continued and has accelerated over the last few months. And so per capita, in the U.S., I would say, is probably ticking up a little bit. But you go to Europe and it's a bit of the opposite. It's not an extreme change, but beer has been healthier than spirits in Europe for the last few years. And even if you look at short-term trends now, you're seeing that same thing happen. So maybe there's a little bit of per capita going down. I don't think it's all that significant. And then emerging markets is kind of a unique bucket. I'm not sure how to even think about per capita there. But certainly, that, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, those markets are struggling."

So in your industry, brands are built in on-premise has always been the discussion. In particular, as you've been developing those premium -- super premium brands in your portfolio and all the resources you've been allocating to on-premise. So as you think forward, of course, not knowing how COVID unfolds, but just the notion of there being lower capacity at restaurants and bars and kind of the consumer mobility and flow of people changes for the foreseeable future. How do you think about kind of building brands and what might be a sort of new world for quite a period of time?"

How -- beyond the next 12 months, I think, is a bit of a different answer. But as the on-premise, the on-premise is going to be down. I mean there's almost no question about that over the next 12 months. And that has been an important brand-building channel throughout -- literally throughout the decades, I guess. So what is the result of that? I do think it pushes towards the tried and true trusted brands that we talked about a little bit earlier. I mean the bars themselves, one, you're not going to be running a lot of promotions in restaurants that are only 1/3 full. I mean that just doesn't make a lot of sense. And so we're reallocating dollars away from that channel, away from events and stadiums and things like that and more into what we would call broad-based media. So that is a brand-building change happening there. But I also do think that it makes new brands. It's going to be more challenging for new tiny brands to dent into the big brands that are out there now, and that's a bit of a different trend compared to what has been happening. Craft brands have not really made a meaningful impact on market share over the last few years. They sort of topped out around 3% or 4%. We're still growing, but it's nothing like beer. I think those brands are going to have a hard time because restaurants that are struggling that are only half full, have to be careful with their inventories and have to rationalize the SKUs. And so you're going to see them gravitate towards brands that turn and so that's a benefit for Jack Daniel's. At the same time, it may make some of our other brands take a Fords Gin as an example, which is much smaller, it makes it that much harder. And so I also think there's a dynamic where consumers are not -- you're not able to go up to a bar, look at 200 brands behind in the bar and make a choice on a different -- something you want to try. You're sitting at a table, you have to be able to order something that you know. And so experimentation goes down a little bit. And we'll just have to see how that plays out over time, but I do think there is -- there will be a bias in the on-premise world for the big tried and trusted brands. And we'll just have to see how that plays out."

The flavors are largely off-premise play anyway. And so they've benefited from that. 
Now the international expansion on Apple has been hindered by this. We still -- it did launch in the U.K. and in Germany and France and a few others, but we've sort of pulled back a little bit, particularly in markets that have a high on-premise percentage of business, so the Italy and Spain and places like that. We just said, let's not even launch right now, it just doesn't make any sense in that environment. So that has slowed the international rollout out, but that's a matter of timing.

Our last investor call when we discussed third quarter earnings was on March 4, just before the world went into lockdown. Since that call, so much has changed around the world. So today, while we will cover our full year financial results, we're really going to focus more of our time updating you on the impact of the pandemic on our business and share how we have and will continue to strategically navigate the volatility and uncertainty that we are facing. But before we do that, let me say, the events happening across America have highlighted yet again the disturbing and systemic racism that persists in the United States. I'm proud of the work Brown-Forman and our employees have been doing in diversity inclusion for nearly 2 decades, which only accelerated when Ralph de Chabert, our Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer, joined the company in 2007. While we've been diligent in our diversity inclusion work, we all know that there's so much more to be done. 
These current events have sparked numerous conversations across the company about how we live our value of respect, about how we identify and eliminate bias within ourselves and how we continue to foster in an environment and relationships where we can bring our best selves to work. At Brown-Forman, we're continually challenging ourselves to be better and to do better as individuals, as leaders and as teams. 
I do want to highlight a few initiatives that our company that not only promote diversity and inclusion within the company, but also address racial inequality in Louisville, Kentucky, where we have our corporate headquarters. Last fall, we published our 2030 diversity and inclusion strategy, where we set quantitative ambitions, specifically for people of color and women. We've tied a portion of our executive compensation to make sure we can achieve these ambitions. We're also leading the new Racism and Business Council sponsored by Greater Louisville Inc. This council will focus on racism and inequality and will lead efforts to cultivate minority businesses and new talent. 
Another effort is with our largest and most influential brand, jack Daniel's, which is committed to uplifting the important story of its first Master Distiller Nearest Green. To help the life and legacy of Nearest, we're forming a partnership with Nearest Green, Inc. that will create developmental opportunities for African-American talent for senior distilling roles and support African-American entrepreneurs in distilling start-ups. More information about this partnership will be shared in the coming weeks. 
In the California neighborhood, home to our Louisville corporate campus, we're committed to being better neighbors. And over the past 3 years, we've made local community investments of more than $6 million, including supporting the nearby YMCA and Simmons College. In the coming months, we'll commit to providing additional resources for the Invest California initiative. This initiative will focus on improving education, economic development and wealth building for our closest neighbors, the majority of whom are black. 
In conclusion, I want to make it clear that we are committed as individuals and as an organization to continue to take action in order to address the racial and ethnic divides and inequalities in our local communities and our industry around the globe. 
All right. Now turning to the global COVID-19 pandemic. While a business challenge, above it all, we know it's a human tragedy. At Brown-Forman, as we always do, we took a people-first approach to this crisis, which means the health and safety of our employees is our #1 priority. In support of our colleagues, friends and partners facing hardship and loss, we've produced our own hand sanitizer to protect our workforce and community frontline workers. We've supplied and are continuing to supply high-proof alcohol to manufacturers of hand sanitizer, which now is producing over 20,000 gallons per day. We've also donated in communities where we work and live around the world from supporting bartender communities, restaurants, relief funds and community foundations to providing over 70,000 meals to soup kitchens and homeless shelters in Louisville as well as countless hours of volunteerism. I really would like to thank all of our 4,800 employees around the world for their exceptional agility and creativity and quickly shifting and adapting to the recent challenges. From our quick and nearly seamless transition to working from home where it's possible, adjusting on how we work in our production facilities to ensure the health and safety of our employees, which resulted in almost no impact to our supply chain. 
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Jane, who'll walk us through how our business has been impacted by COVID-19, the adjustments we have made to the business and the strength of our balance sheet. Afterwards, I'll share our strategic priorities that will continue to guide us through the near-term, and which I believe will position our brands and our business to be even stronger in the long term.

We began the year with a business environment in which our margins continue to be weighed down by tariffs, largely European tariffs and higher agave costs to end the year with a global pandemic and its resulting effect on the global economy that we are still facing today. Despite these challenges, we still achieved many significant accomplishments and milestones in fiscal 2020 that I'd like to take a moment and highlight. We saw Woodford Reserve exceed 1 million cases. We continue to innovate, developing and launching Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple and depleting over 250,000 cases in just 8 months. Our Jack Daniel's flavor portfolio surpassed 2.5 million cases. And to put that in perspective, none of our Jack Daniel's flavors existed a short 9 years ago, illustrating the importance that innovation has provided, including being a significant source of growth and bringing in numerous new consumers to the Jack Daniel's franchise. 
Jack Daniel's RTDs reached 1.5 million cases in Germany. Old Forester, our founding brand, grew underlying net sales double digits and is now over 300,000 cases. Our business in the U.S. accelerated its top line compared to fiscal 2019 and outpaced TDS for the first time since the summer of 2018. We transitioned our U.K. and Thailand business to own distribution, route-to-consumer models, both launching on May 1, 2020. We welcomed Fords Gin to our family of brands, and we closed another chapter in our 150-year history of enduring and thriving. 
I'm not going to spend a lot of time going through the financial performance for fiscal 2020 as we typically do, but instead focus more on the last couple of months of the fiscal year, where our results were significantly impacted by the global health pandemic. First, as a reminder, we completed our third quarter of the fiscal year on January 31, 2020, with year-to-date underlying net sales growth of 3%. This trend held up for us through February. We began to experience the effect of the pandemic on our results beginning in mid-March, and it continued throughout April as many of our major markets went into countries-wide lockdowns, implemented significant stay-at-home restrictions and shutdown are severely limited the on-premise business, which represents approximately 20% of our business globally. In addition, travel bans and other restrictions were implemented and these significantly impacted the Travel Retail channel. As a result, we estimate that the pandemic negatively affected our underlying net sales approximately 15% for the March-April period with a greater negative effect occurring in April, following some benefit we believe we experienced from pantry loading in March. 
As we look broadly across our geographic clusters, all were affected during this period, some more than others. I want to call your attention to this on Slide 7 of our presentation we uploaded to our Investor Relations website this morning. As you can see, the most notable decline occurred in our Travel Retail business where international travel and cruise channels essentially halted overnight. Additionally, our emerging markets were down significantly. Some markets, such as Mexico, went into the crisis with weak economic conditions. Further, history would suggest that it is coming for emerging market consumers to reduce spending on our category and focus on essential needs during challenging economic times. 
Our developed international markets experienced underlying net sales decline similar to the company for the March-April period and worse in the U.S. While we saw strong off-premise consumer takeaway trends across many of these markets, these increases were not sufficient to offset the on-premise closures. And finally, while our business in the U.S. experienced a slowdown in performance over this 2-month period, it held up well and continued to grow. 
Since the pandemic began to affect the U.S., the off-premise takeaway trends for beverage alcohol significantly accelerated and have remained robust over the past 13 weeks with spirits growing the fastest. While we expect there were some early on pantry loading in mid- to late March, overall consumption has clearly shifted from the on-premise to new at-home occasions. Our blended takeaway trends over the period have outperformed TDS. And importantly, the strong growth in the off-premise channel has offset the significant hit to the on-premise business. 
In many of our major markets around the world, consumer purchase patterns changed quickly as bars and restaurants essentially shut down. We saw impressive growth of our brands in the e-premise channel and significant acceleration in large off-premise accounts. We observe consumers moving towards trusted brands and seeking opportunities to indulge everyday luxuries. We noted the consumers are seeking convenience such as RTDs and flavored whiskeys and increased home-consumption occasions, including virtual cocktail parties. And we ascertain the consumers were and are still making larger, less frequent shopping trips. 
We quickly made adjustments to our focus and resources based on these trends and applied on a market-by-market basis. For example, we reprioritized our portfolio and we shifted our focus to channels where the consumer was and continues to shop. We shifted advertising investments and teams to align with these reprioritized areas of focus, such as digital as well as prioritize off-premise accounts such as classic versus convenience, large-format versus independent. We reduced discretionary spending, such as T&E. We stopped spending behind on-premise activities and various events and sponsorships that were canceled. And we accelerated and fueled our activities in the e-premise channel in several key markets globally. 
As the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on the global economy continues to evolve, we are closely monitoring key indicators in each market, such as the stage of restrictions in a given market or country, consumer trends and behavioral insights and macroeconomic conditions. We believe this will aid us in our evaluation of the pace of recovery and appropriately identify opportunities. 
Now given the high degree of uncertainty that we all face in these times, I'd like to take a few minutes to comment on our financial position and specifically to address the topic of liquidity. First of all, a few relevant facts. On April 30, the end of our fiscal year 2020, we had $675 million in cash equivalents on hand. Our commercial paper balance was roughly $330 million with an average of over 70 days to maturity for paper outstanding, and we had approximately $2.3 billion of long-term debt outstanding. Importantly, in a long-term debt picture, we have no maturity scheduled until our fiscal 2023. Our $800 million credit facility was and remains undrawn. 
So we believe our financial position remains strong and our continuing capacity to generate solid operating cash flows is sound. We believe our strengths will allow us to navigate this crisis as circumstances evolve. That said, we have taken and will continue to take additional steps to secure our strong financial position, managing both our uses and sources of cash. For example, while we continue to manage our uses of cash thoughtfully as we always have, we have turned up our focus in a few areas. Naturally, we are managing our operating expenses closely and have significantly curtailed discretionary spending, such as freezes for hiring and travel. 
On the CapEx front, we will continue to invest behind the business with an eye toward the future and not forego important maintenance spending. However, we are reprioritizing and deferring certain spending where prudent. We are more actively managing our working capital, including monitoring credit closely while working constructively with our customers most affected by the crisis. 
In parallel to our management of our cash usage, we have bolstered our cash balances and position Brown-Forman to access additional liquidity, if needed. First, just a few comments on the short-term debt markets and our recent experience. Rewinding to March, despite extremely volatile conditions in the short-term debt market then, which have improved markedly since then, we sustained our access to short-term funding in the commercial paper market. Leading up to our fiscal year-end, we added to our cash position by issuing commercial paper, more of it and with longer durations than usual, enabling us to fortify our cash position. Looking ahead, we expect to meet our short-term liquidity needs through cash generated from operations and borrowings under our commercial paper program. However, as you know well, these are dynamic times. So we are closely monitoring both our own liquidity outlook based on various scenarios and conditions in the debt capital markets. If our appraisals suggest a worsening situation, we won't hesitate to increase our margin of safety on the liquidity front. 
Considering our history of strong operating cash flows, our excellent credit ratings and the resilience of our industry in our business in these turbulent times, we expect that, if needed, we could access additional debt capital readily and with favorable terms. 
And finally, to our fiscal '21 outlook. As we indicated in our earnings release this morning, we face substantial uncertainty related to the evolving COVID-19 global pandemic and its effect on the global economy. As a result of this uncertainty, we are not able to provide quantitative guidance for fiscal 2021 at this time. We hope to have a better picture of how the recovery, including this economic effect on consumers, may unfold and affect our full year financial results when we report our Q1 performance later this summer. 
With that being said, based on our early read of our performance in May, we believe that our top line results will show some improvements to that we experienced in March, April, but still down relative to last year. Separately, given our strong balance sheet, solid cash flows and ample liquidity, we expect to fully fund ongoing investment in our business and continue to pay regular dividends. 
In summary, while fiscal 2020 was a year like no other in our 150-year history and we expect to continue to face headwinds given the current environment, our view of the ultimate global opportunity for our brands is undiminished. We believe our talented, resilient and agile employees, our commitment to diversity and inclusion, our attractive portfolio of brands and growing categories, our resilient global supply chain and our strong balance sheet will allow us to emerge an even stronger company with healthier brands that will drive our growth for the next generation. 
And with that, let me turn the call back over to Lawson to conclude our prepared remarks this morning."

As we all know, there is substantial amount of uncertainty in the world and in the days ahead, but we do have 150 years of experience of successfully navigating many challenges. These include world wars, a prior pandemic, prohibition, a depression and recessions. Although this global pandemic and economic challenge is certainly different, I do believe we'll endure and we will reemerge even stronger. 
I'm optimistic about our future and confident we have the right strategy to guide us now and as we look ahead. We're well positioned in some of the best categories in the spirits industry, and we remain focused on developing a premium portfolio that we can develop around the world. In this current environment, we know that consumers are looking for both trusted brands and for an opportunity to indulge in everyday luxuries. 
I want to argue that Jack Daniel's is actually the most trusted brand in the spirits industry. We continue to strive to deliver balanced geographic growth with competitive routes to consumer. Near term, we will be reallocating more towards the developed markets, including the United States, where spirits consumption has been relatively stronger. We'll also be allocating more resources towards channels like e-commerce to ensure we're utilizing the most competitive routes to consumer. 
A hallmark of Brown-Forman, we intend to maintain our historically disciplined approach to capital deployment, including our commitment to return cash to shareholders in a prudent, yet opportunistic, manner. Additionally, we aspire to deliver top-tier total shareholder returns over the long term. 
And finally, we will continue to leverage our talent and agile workforce. Over the last few months, I've seen truly exceptional examples of adaptability and resilience in our people. People will continue to be our most important asset. As discussed and shared with you on many occasions in the past, we think about our future in generations. This crisis provides us with the opportunity to reimagine the next generation of growth for our brands, our geographies, our people and our investments. At the end of the day, our goal is to ensure the long-term health of our iconic brands. 
And finally, we'll continue to be guided by our values while working to preserve the resources of our planet, educating consumers on responsible consumption of our brands and ensuring the communities in which we live and work will provide social equities for all. 
With that, Dorothy, you may open up the call for questions."

And even over the last 12 months, if you look at the difference between value and volume, you continue to see very strong premiumization trends in the industry. 
Now if you look over what's happened over the last couple of months, those trends have continued. You haven't seen the trade down that, honestly some of us were worried about. Ultra-premium is still growing the fastest in super and then and work your way down the chain. So even in this environment and this particular set of circumstances that we're in, the premiumization trends continue. So I think we feel good about that, and our portfolio does skew to that and we continue to -- we want to continue to make that happen. So as far as looking out ahead over the next couple of years, I don't see us changing our portfolio strategy other than to focus on more super-premium and above brands. I mean that's where the -- not only where the growth has been, but I think it's where our company performs the best. It's one of the reasons we created that emerging brands group for the U.S. It's been 2 years now has driven those very super-premium brands that needed to focus, and they have had an outstanding run now for 2 years, last 2 months accepted. But I really like that part of our portfolio, and I like that part of our strategy and I think we're going to continue forward with it."

Again, there's a lot of dynamics going on here. And as you said, set it up perfectly, countries are at different stages of the pandemic, countries are at different stages of coming out of the pandemic, different stages of opening, different states, different -- all kinds of different things that are effecting us. And so the answer is not a simple answer as you can imagine. What we saw some improvement on in the month of May, what we're looking at current trends are places like the U.S. and certain channel or certain portfolio, I guess, I should say. So our Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey, our RTDs are doing quite well. Our Global Travel Retail remains down still. So what we saw in the month of March, April, which was down around 65%, that's still holding the same. Some of our emerging markets have improved. So China, we see that early look, looks like it's back to levels it was a year ago, May. Other parts of Southeast Asia have rebounded. But then you still have other parts of Latin America that are just -- other parts of emerging markets such as Latin America that are just going into the pandemic. So there's not a one size fits all answer here, I hate to say. But I would like to build on some of the things that we are seeing. If this might help you think about the on-premise and the business, primarily in the developed markets. 
So if we think about Europe, it's a bit further behind than the U.S. For instance, our second largest market is the U.K. The loosening of the restrictions there for bars and restaurants is not going to be till July 4, you probably know this. France just opened last week. Germany has been opened since the middle of May, and we've seen nice trends in Germany since this reopened. In the U.S., the trends are -- for the -- what we've been following it, those trends for the early openings of those that opened prior to May 15, where we saw the off-premise was down, say, in the 90% range. By the end of May, they had improved to down 70%. So we're seeing a nice improvement, but slow improvement. Of course, this is all going to be dependent upon the consumer, the fillings of safety and when they feel like they can come back. So I wish there was an easier answer for you, but that's why it's so hard to also give any kind of forecast right now because there are so many scenarios and so many things at play that are impacting each and every market. And one size does not fit all, now it's hard to generalize anything in this environment."

And that's where I have the most concern about what the next year may look like. Our emerging markets, which over the last few years has been a very dynamic, sort of double-digit growth area for many of the years, was already slowing a bit on this fiscal year. We're still growing but it was slowing. A lot of that was led by Mexico, which is our largest emerging market, and Mexico has had its own economic problems going back over the last 12 to 18 months. And so we saw some weakness there earlier on, and that was a big portion of the change in our sales. But if you look out at the rest of the emerging markets world, I'm talking about South America, Africa, particularly South Africa. If you look across parts of Asia and India, a lot of those countries have gone into either a complete shutdown or something close to a complete shutdown. And those markets don't have this social safety methods you're seeing in the U.S. and most of Western Europe. And so those markets, when they go into shutdown, people don't have money for luxuries at all. And they're really going to the basic goods and trying just being able to try to survive. And so I do think you're going to see a deeper problem in those markets and it's going to be tougher to come out of there. So yes. I would argue that emerging markets are the place that we were trying to figure out how that's going to go, but it does have a fair amount of concern."

So a lot of the value brands are not in on-premise locations and probably aren't down -- like are being pulled down because of that loss of business. So it's just something as you get into the results to start understanding that. And as it comes back -- I should have said this earlier, too, as it comes back in the space that we've seen that opened early in May, where we've seen the drop from the on-premise declines of 90% down the 70%, we've actually seen the trends hold up quite well in the off-premise over that period of time in the mid-single digits.

If you could comment on that. I'm not sure if there is a number that you guys track or how closely you look at it. But what I'm really looking for is the overall category growth rate in terms of what you're seeing more recently in May and June for the bourbon category. And then if you'd indulge me, just a housekeeping question for Jane. Collection risk or bad debt risk in the on-premise channel, given that some of these bars restaurants will not come out of this. Does that entirely reside with distributors? Or is there any risk-sharing that's going to take place with Brown-Forman?"

So Kevin, I think you're asking about the trend, the bourbon trends in the U.S. business, and I can NABCA data. And like I said to Vivien a few moments ago, really do have to start pulling it apart and understand what's going on there. And the actual overall bourbon trends in the off-premise have remained very strong. They're up about 36%. Now what you've got to do is you've got to pull out Pennsylvania, which shut down, and you got to pull out the on-premise business. Once you've done that, again, we show growth of around 36%. 
Brown-Forman is growing faster than that. Our bourbon and Tennessee Whiskey are growing around 38%. This is for the most recent data through April. We did see a small -- I guess a slowdown, if you will, that you're referring to in May, maybe from the Nielsens and the categories, but still up very strong. It's still up in the 30 percentage range from an off-premise takeaway trend perspective. So we feel good about that. What you saw, though, in those trends is an acceleration in a couple of categories, a few categories. It was cordials, liquors and tequilas. And of course, our portfolio has some in it. We have wonderful tequilas. We have liquors to think of Honey and Fire and Apple, but that's the extent of our portfolio in those categories. 
So I feel optimistic still that we're still seeing very strong trends from the syndicated data as it relates to bourbon and Tennessee Whiskey. 
And then your question about our bad debt. I thought it might be helpful just to talk about what we've done on that just for a moment and then I can get specifically to your question. But since this pandemic started, we've really been working actively with the customers around the globe and looking for ways to partner with them on credit issues in a really productive way. So not surprisingly in March and April, customers catering to the on-premise and Travel Retail channels requested additional credit due to the fall offs in their business, and that's not surprising. And those comments are more outside the U.S. I think you were referring to in the U.S. but what..."

So you're not seeing any degradation in our credit picture, by the way. No change in our bad debt. So that's outside the U.S. As it relates to anything going on in the U.S., we sell to our distributors and distributors sell on to the retailers. We have not had anybody. So that's really their -- I guess their risk at that point in time. Of course, I think with the openings as the on-premise is starting to happen. Hopefully, some of those, we'll get moving there. But to your point, there may be some bad debt -- or excuse me, uncollectibility on their part that what they end up doing is probably just shifting and around and using in other parts of their distributor houses. That could then affect, of course, our shipments in the short term, but not long term."

But perhaps don't really change, it just where people will consume. And then developing markets, especially if we're -- we go into a recession, per capita consumption maybe goes down a bit. And then Travel Retail is obviously just sort of dependent on being open or not. Is that -- just like a basic framework, is that a reasonable way to approach it?"

But I think it's -- your approach is pretty reasonable. I do think one of the things that's happened over the last few months compared to what had been happening in the prior years before it is whatever trends were happening seem to be an exaggerated. So if you look at the U.S., spirits has been very healthy in the U.S. for 10 years or more -- well, 20 years or more. The trend of spirits taking share from beer and wine has continued and has accelerated over the last few months. And so per capita, in the U.S., I would say, is probably ticking up a little bit. But you go to Europe and it's a bit of the opposite. It's not an extreme change, but beer has been healthier than spirits in Europe for the last few years. And even if you look at short-term trends now, you're seeing that same thing happen. So maybe there's a little bit of per capita going down. I don't think it's all that significant. And then emerging markets is kind of a unique bucket. I'm not sure how to even think about per capita there. But certainly, that, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, those markets are struggling."

How -- beyond the next 12 months, I think, is a bit of a different answer. But as the on-premise, the on-premise is going to be down. I mean there's almost no question about that over the next 12 months. And that has been an important brand-building channel throughout -- literally throughout the decades, I guess. So what is the result of that? I do think it pushes towards the tried and true trusted brands that we talked about a little bit earlier. I mean the bars themselves, one, you're not going to be running a lot of promotions in restaurants that are only 1/3 full. I mean that just doesn't make a lot of sense. And so we're reallocating dollars away from that channel, away from events and stadiums and things like that and more into what we would call broad-based media. So that is a brand-building change happening there. But I also do think that it makes new brands. It's going to be more challenging for new tiny brands to dent into the big brands that are out there now, and that's a bit of a different trend compared to what has been happening. Craft brands have not really made a meaningful impact on market share over the last few years. They sort of topped out around 3% or 4%. We're still growing, but it's nothing like beer. I think those brands are going to have a hard time because restaurants that are struggling that are only half full, have to be careful with their inventories and have to rationalize the SKUs. And so you're going to see them gravitate towards brands that turn and so that's a benefit for Jack Daniel's. At the same time, it may make some of our other brands take a Fords Gin as an example, which is much smaller, it makes it that much harder. And so I also think there's a dynamic where consumers are not -- you're not able to go up to a bar, look at 200 brands behind in the bar and make a choice on a different -- something you want to try. You're sitting at a table, you have to be able to order something that you know. And so experimentation goes down a little bit. And we'll just have to see how that plays out over time, but I do think there is -- there will be a bias in the on-premise world for the big tried and trusted brands.

Now the international expansion on Apple has been hindered by this. We still -- it did launch in the U.K. and in Germany and France and a few others, but we've sort of pulled back a little bit, particularly in markets that have a high on-premise percentage of business, so the Italy and Spain and places like that. We just said, let's not even launch right now, it just doesn't make any sense in that environment. So that has slowed the international rollout out, but that's a matter of timing.

As I stated in the earnings release that went out earlier this morning, I'm actually very pleased with the company's first quarter performance, and truly want to thank our dedicated, agile and resilient team",1241,"Thank you, Leanne, and good morning, everyone. As I stated in the earnings release that went out earlier this morning, I'm actually very pleased with the company's first quarter performance, and truly want to thank our dedicated, agile and resilient team of employees worldwide who made these results possible. 
We entered this fiscal year in one of the most complex and challenging business environments that we have seen in decades. Every market around the world has and continues to experience the health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. We've continued to lead by our values. Keeping the health and safety of all our employees is our highest priority, but we remain committed to our strategic priorities. But like much of the world, we're adjusting the ways in which we do our work. 
There have been very dramatic changes to channels, to brands, occasions, which really impacts things like seismics and formats, and we continue to see a lot of volatility around the world. 
One of the most obvious ways that COVID-19 has impacted our business is the prolonged closure of the on-premise and the resulting shift in consumption to at-home occasions. As you can imagine, we've rapidly shifted people and investments into the off-premise, but different markets around the world have shown very different results. 
Even more interesting, we've also seen the pandemic accelerate a number of macro consumer trends. For the most part, trends that were happening before the pandemic have really accelerated over the past few months. So I thought I'd walk through some of these accelerating trends as well as provide examples of how we are capitalizing on these trends to our advantage. 
The first really would be premiumization. This was a growing trend pre COVID and really has been a trend in the spirits business for a long time, but we've seen growth rates of premium and super premium brands accelerate greatly in the U.S. since March. 
Before I go further, I did want to note that this is an area where we have started to see a divergence between the more developed markets, like much of Europe and the United States and the emerging markets. We believe this is largely due to the broader social safety nets and other forms of stimulus that the larger developed markets offer. So consumer spending has remained strong in many developed markets, and the spirits industry is benefiting. 
We do believe consumers are looking for everyday luxuries, and this is great for super premium spirits. In the U.S., Nielsen trends for spirits remained very strong since the beginning of the pandemic and have really maintained those higher rates of growth through the summer. 
The long-term trend of spirits taking share from beer and wine continues. I think as long as people are largely unable to spend on travel and other forms of entertainment, we think that the spirit strong growth will continue predominantly in the off-premise. Making cocktails at home has certainly become a source of entertainment for many and that makes this pandemic just a little bit easier to take. 
We also have confidence that we may not see the level of down-trading that we might have seen in past recessions in the developed economies. The factors are just different this time. As a premium spirits company, we feel that our portfolio of brands is well positioned to win in this type of environment. 
The next macro trend I wanted to touch on is media consumption. Consumers have been shifting away from more traditional forms of media for a number of years. And we're not only seeing an increase in overall media consumption, which is intuitive as consumers around the world are spending more time at home, but also an acceleration of media consumption by digital platforms like social and streaming services. 
As I have mentioned on prior calls, we continue to move more and more of our investments behind our brands into broad-reach media, especially growth areas like online video. And I'm thrilled that we brought our new creative partner Energy BBDO, on board at the beginning of 2020 right before the world went into shutdown. 
While our brand expense was down significantly in Q1, driven by the uncertain environment, starting in Q2, you will begin seeing more spending as we launch new creative across many of our brands. Some of you have may already seen the new Woodford Reserve ads that began airing earlier this month and a lot of new work from the Jack Daniel's family, which will be coming out soon. 
While not unique to spirits, the e-commerce channel globally has been growing even faster since the pandemic as consumers look for greater convenience. While e-commerce is still a small part of our overall business today, since March, we've increased our investment, both in dollars and in people to focus on this growing channel. 
Familiar and trusted brands are posed to win in these types of shopping environments, which gives many of our brands like Jack Daniel's or Woodford Reserve, we believe, a good advantage. 
Furthermore, convenience, more broadly as a macro trend, has influenced our business in a couple of ways. With bars closed, consumers want convenient and easy-to-mix cocktails at home. Our Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey and Apple brands are providing consumers ease in making flavorful yet simple cocktails. And there are a lot of people making Margaritas at home, too, and that has really helped our tequila portfolio continue to grow across the U.S. 
And we're really pleased with the early success of our partnership and our first branded cocktail with them for the Jack Daniel's Lynchburg Lemonade. Consumers are also increasingly interested in ready-to-drink cocktails. So I think I'd like to spend a couple of minutes this morning just on this increasingly popular category, and as Jane will share with you, a key driver of our first quarter results. 
Ready-to-drink beverages, our RTDs are having a moment right now, but it's a business we've believed in and invested in for a long time. It was nearly 30 years ago that we launched Jack Daniel's Country Cocktails in the U.S. Since that time, we've been building RTDs in many markets around the world. 
Globally, Jack Daniel's RTDs are now over 10 million cases, with Australia, the U.S., Germany and Mexico, all over 1 million cases. This really has become a meaningful business for our company. 
Jack RTDs were created to expand occasions where Jack could be enjoyed and focus is really on the key cocktail serves, such as Jack and Cola, Lynchburg Lemonade and Jack and Ginger Ale. These RTDs serve as an important consumer recruitment vehicle due to the category's light and really accessible flavor profile. 
Through innovation, we feel we can meet consumer taste and pack preferences as they really do vary by market. Such recent examples would include Jack and Barry in Germany, Double Jack and American Serve in Australia and then Jack Daniel's Country Cocktails Southern Peach and Southern Citrus in the U.S. 
Our other large RTD business is our tequila-based New Mix RTDs in Mexico, which are now over 7 million cases. This business is also doing well in the environment we're in. 
I believe that we're well positioned with the right offerings at the right time to meet the increasing popularity of these ready-to-drink cocktails. 
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Jane, who will walk us through our first quarter financial results."
256839,684435341,2088492,"Brown-Forman Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Sep 02, 2020",2020-09-02,"Earnings Calls","Brown-Forman Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Lawson, and good morning, everyone. As Lawson said, we are pleased with the start to our fiscal year, particularly in light of the current environment, with both our underlying net sales and operating income up relative to last year, and our re",1973,"Thank you, Lawson, and good morning, everyone. As Lawson said, we are pleased with the start to our fiscal year, particularly in light of the current environment, with both our underlying net sales and operating income up relative to last year, and our reported operating income and EPS increasing even more. 
Not surprising and amplified during this volatile time, there is considerable noise in these results, ranging from product innovation launches, timing-related items in the same period last year, portfolio reshaping, a significant discrete tax benefit and, of course, COVID-19-related effects that include inventory fluctuations, customer buying pattern changes and geographic channel, size and portfolio mix shifts. 
I plan on highlighting these effects on our results to provide more clarity on our performance in the quarter. But first, as a reminder, our business began to significantly experience the impact of COVID-19 pandemic in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, beginning in mid-March and continuing throughout April. 
As a result, we estimated that the pandemic negatively affected our underlying net sales approximately 15% for the March-April period with a greater negative effect occurring in April, following some benefit we believe we experienced from pantry loading in March in some of our larger developed markets. 
Now with that as a backdrop, let's turn our attention to the first quarter, where our results improved significantly relative to our fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. 
Starting with our top line. Compared to the first quarter of last year, reported net sales were down modestly, reflecting the rebalancing our giveback of the distributor inventory built in the U.S. in April 2020 during the period of great uncertainty surrounding potential supply chain disruptions. 
Adjusting for this factor, our underlying net sales grew 3%. When stripping out the noise, I noted earlier, however, we believe our net sales were down low single digits. 
As we look broadly across our geographic clusters, all were affected in some way during this quarter by the pandemic and its related effects, of course, some more than others. 
Our travel retail business continued to be the most significantly affected as international airline travel remains at very low levels: airport stores are largely closed, airlines are offering limited in-flight services and the cruise industry is still shut down. 
These factors contributed to our underlying net sales declining over 60% for the quarter for our travel retail business. Our emerging markets collectively declined underlying net sales low single digits for the quarter. 
Benefits from timing-related customer buying patterns in Q1 of both last year and this year, notably in Poland and Brazil and exceptional growth from our New Mix RTD business in Mexico, driven by the temporary interruption experienced in the country's beer supply chain in May-June, masked the significant and broad-based declines registered across nearly all our emerging markets. 
Our developed international markets returned to underlying net sales growth in the quarter, up double digits, propelled by the accelerated demand for RTDs, most notably in Australia and Germany, which are both benefiting from the consumer desire for convenience. 
The launch of Jack Daniel's and Barry in Germany and Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple in a number of key markets, including U.K., Germany and France, also contributed to the quarter-over-quarter increase. 
Further, we estimate that favorable comparison to Q1 last year and customer buying patterns this year contributed to nearly half of the growth in underlying net sales. Adjusting for these factors, we believe our developed international business grew low single digits. 
And finally, our U.S. business, which represents half our sales has remained resilient throughout this pandemic. Our portfolio appears to be well positioned, as Lawson mentioned, in this important market to meet some of the changing consumer needs and behaviors, driven by the significant increase in at-home consumption and the desire for everyday luxury. 
In fact, the acceleration in our underlying net sales growth in the quarter in this market was driven by those brands in our portfolio that are meeting those needs. For example, the desire for convenience. Our Jack Daniel's RTDs experienced strong consumer demand, both from our existing Jack Daniel's Country Cocktails brand as well as the excitement of our recent limited introduction of new spirit space Jack Daniel's RTDs. 
The ease of mixability. The continued launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple, higher volumes of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey and our tequilas, and Herradura, provided a benefit to the quarter. As a reminder, we will begin to lap the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple in this market in our second quarter. 
Everyday luxury. Woodford Reserve and Old Forester continued to sustain double-digit growth trends that we've enjoyed for a number of years. 
Now I'd like to expand a bit further on Lawson's comments as they relate to the U.S. market by leveraging both Nielsen and Napka takeaway information. 
Since the pandemic began, the off-premise takeaway trends for beverage alcohol significantly accelerated. We also note the acceleration in volumes in the off-premise has consistently, throughout this period, more than offset the declines in the on-premise, meaning overall TDS consumption volumetrically has increased compared to pre COVID. 
Consistent with TDS, we have also experienced increase in volumes. However, portfolio and channel mix shifts have adversely affected our margins, which I will discuss in a bit. 
As you know, each of our major markets around the world are in varying stages of reopening, and in some cases, are experiencing a halt in reopenings, new restrictions or even a second round of closures. Consumer purchase patterns continue to evolve as bars, restaurants and other on-premise channels try to remain open while complying with various regulations. 
And in some markets, we are seeing a return of consumers to the on-premise as restrictions on consumer movement are easing. I thought it was important to take a minute and talk about our flagship brand, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, and how it's performing in this environment. 
Overall, for the quarter, Tennessee Whiskey volumes were down with essentially flat volumes in the developed markets and declines in the emerging and travel retail channel. 
The shift from on-premise to off-premise consumption in the developed markets drove the brand's underlying net sales down further. However, overall, the brand remains quite healthy and is gaining share in the majority of its top 10 markets. 
In the brand's largest market, the U.S., volumetric trends are essentially consistent with pre COVID trends. 
Now turning to our gross margin. For the quarter, our gross margin declined 320 basis points, which also resulted in our underlying gross profit dropping 1%. Higher input costs related to agave, lower volumes for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, resulting in a reduction in fixed cost absorption and unfavorable mix drove our margin down. 
The mix impact reflects a shift in where consumers are buying our brands from the on-premise to the off-premise and e-premise and a significant acceleration in the rate of sales growth from our RTD portfolio. 
Combined, these shifts reduced our gross margin by approximately 100 basis points. Not surprising, given the rapid restrictions placed by the COVID-19 crisis and the timing of our quarter, our advertising investments were down significantly in the first 3 months of the fiscal year. This not only reflects a reduction of on-premise activations and the cancellation of consumer events such as summer festivals and sponsorships, but also a pause in the month of July, on certain social media platforms, specifically Facebook and Instagram. 
In addition, and importantly, the reduction reflects the phasing of spending. For example, our investment in the Kentucky Derby has been shifted from Q1 to Q2 as the event was rescheduled. We expect our advertising investment to accelerate over the balance of the fiscal year. In the meantime, we have quickly adjusted our focus and resources based on the evolving landscape. 
Our underlying SG&A investment was down in the quarter as well, reflecting a significant reduction in discretionary spending, such as travel and entertainment and special meetings as well as hiring freezes. 
As the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on the global economy continues to evolve, we continue to closely monitor key indicators in each market, such as the stage of restriction, consumer trends and behavioral insights and macroeconomic conditions. We believe this has and will continue to aid us in our frequent evaluations of the pace of recovery and where and when to invest. 
There are 2 items that positively impacted our first quarter reported results only. First, the sale of the Early Times, Canadian Mist and Collingwood brands and the Canadian Mist production facility resulted in an EPS estimated gain on sale of $0.19. Second, we recognized an $0.08 per share benefit related to a discrete tax item. 
These 2 items, combined with the increase in operating income from our business, resulted in diluted earnings per share increasing 73% to $0.67. 
And finally, to our fiscal 2021 outlook. We continue to face substantial uncertainty, and that has not diminished since our year-end early June call. As a result of this uncertainty and volatility that we expect to persist over the months to come and the low visibility we have on recovery, we are not able to provide quantitative guidance for fiscal 2021 at this time. 
With that being said and more qualitatively speaking, as we think about our broad geographic clusters, we expect travel retail business to not recover and to remain down significantly for the year. Considering the benefits that aided our emerging markets underlying top line performance in the quarter, and the continued expected shift in spending to value brands and assistant needs, we expect that declines in our emerging markets collectively to increase compared to Q1 performance over the balance of the fiscal year. 
For our developed markets, we expect the volatility and uncertainty to remain high for the foreseeable future and hope to have a better understanding of such impact of volatility when we report our Q2 performance later this calendar year. 
Our nonbranded business dominated by sales of used barrels is expected to continue to be a drag on our top line performance this year as it was in the quarter, reflecting the expectation of lower volumes and pricing. We believe the timing and strength of the on-premise channel recovery will depend on a variety of factors, but will look different and not at full capacity by the fiscal year-end. 
Our gross margin will likely remain under pressure for the year, driven by the expectation of higher input costs and mix shifts. Where our gross margin ultimately lands will depend not only on the volumes of our business, but the mix of our business geographically, by portfolio, channel and size. 
Regarding our operating investments, both advertising and SG&A, we believe we are well positioned to invest effectively as the recovery occurs. We expect overall operating expenses, notably our advertising investments, to accelerate as a significant year-over-year rate of declines in Q1 will not be sustained throughout the year. We, of course, will remain agile, diligent, focused and disciplined on our investments as the environment continues to evolve. 
As it relates to our effective tax rate for the full year, we expect our tax rate from operations to be about 21% and our all-in tax rate to be in the range of 17% to 19%. 
In summary, while there is a lot of noise in our first quarter performance, we believe our results are solid amidst this very challenging environment. Our balance sheet remains strong and our continuing capacity to generate solid operating cash flow is sound. 
As always, we will continue to manage our uses of cash thoughtfully. We believe these actions and strength will allow us to navigate this crisis as circumstances evolve, and we will emerge from this unprecedented time an even stronger company with healthier brands. 
And with that, this concludes our prepared remarks. Dorothy, you may open the line up to questions."

So if you recall at our year-end call, we had already some visibility in our month of May results, and we told you at that time that they had improved from our lows in April. We think that was the trough of what we have seen. And -- but they were still down. So the month of June and July were both positive months. When we look at -- growth months, obviously, to drive the quarter up. 
When we look at what's driving this, travel retail has not improved, it remains down. Our emerging markets, set aside the 3 countries I noted within our script today, which is Poland, Brazil and Mexico were all down pretty significantly. There's been no change there really from what we had seen at year-end. 
Where we saw the biggest changes were in an acceleration in the U.S., which, by the way, has remained resilient throughout this pandemic. So we saw some acceleration there, and Lawson was referring to some of the reasons why that was, which is really the consumer behaviors and the desire for convenience with the at-home consumption and our RTD business is so well placed for that as is our flavored whiskey and tequilas. So we benefited from that. 
And then finally, the developed markets improved significantly from year-end. And that's where we got a fair amount of noise in the numbers. We had some easy -- or favorable comparisons to last year. We actually saw some restocking, if you will, in some markets that we've restocked at the hypermarkets where they were -- people were shopping at the local corner before, I would say, as an example. So we got a benefit from that. 
We had the launch of Apple in there, both from the U.S. It wasn't there in the first quarter of last year, and we that in the second quarter of this year, but also the launch in 6 markets at the end of last year in 6 more markets internationally at the beginning of this year. 
And so we wanted to give visibility into that and say, really, if you strip all that out, our improvement in the developed markets has improved, but not at the rate that you're seeing, and we're estimating more in the low single-digit type of growth. 
If you look at channels and things of that nature, the on-premise has started to recover in some markets, but still down significantly about 60% in the U.S. Overseas, we just started seeing some of that more easing in the months of June and July, and I'm seeing some promising trends there that have a ways to go, particularly in those tourist markets, such as Spain and Turkey and Czechia. 
E-premise remains on fire, as Lawson mentioned. And so that growth rate has continued to be pretty solid throughout. We haven't seen a lot of change in that. 
But all in, what we were trying to give exposure to was that we think all of our trends in the business have improved, but not at the rates that we recorded in the first quarter. We think we're down growing. If you pull a lot of the onetime factors out more in the low -- down low single digits."

And just the number of activities that we've got going on that we believe we'll be funding behind.

And a lot of it's just fitting lifestyles that are out there right now. It's -- obviously, people are at home, and they want it to be simple. And so people really do turn to these both simple RTDs simple drinks. Obviously, you just open up a can or even very mixable products that we have, which is why we think Honey, as an example, is doing so very, very well right now. And our Apple launch is actually doing quite well right now.

But what you're asking, I believe, is about the degradation on margins. And I will say, in the first quarter, we talked about the degradation of both channel and portfolio having about a 1 percentage point or an 100 basis point impact. And a big piece of that isn't related to the portfolio are the RTDs, but more specifically, it was really the new mix RTD, which we best found and as we said in our script, with one time, we think, in nature because of the temporary disruption of the beer industry in Mexico. 
With that being said, we have read it about this for some time. But in the environment like this, we think the volume and the sales generation vehicle for our brands are more important. Are you increasing your demand for your products? Absolutely, we are. You can see that. And importantly, if you look at the economics of an RTD, something we do frequently, and we convert it to what we call a drink equivalent basis on a whiskey basis, the economics are phenomenally even better than our full strength. And so that's a couple of ways that we think about it. And in this environment, we think the small amount of degradation in the margins not material is 100% makes sense, and we want to be there for the consumer."

One, to point out that Jack Daniel's family asking about the U.S., but globally, was still plus 3%. So in the middle of a pandemic, generating 3% sales growth on the entire family, I think we're pretty happy with that. 
Now focusing just on Tennessee Whiskey itself, and I will talk about the whole world for a second, then I'll go more to your U.S. question. But keep in mind, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, so Black Label is one of the largest on-premise brands in the world. I mean it is in nearly every bar around the world. And so that business -- that's why that number is down somewhere around -- what is it? 7% down for the quarter on a global basis, a lot of that is on-prem. 
In the U.S. itself, 30%-ish of its volume is in the on-premise, and that went down drastically. So making it up with pretty dynamic off-premise growth, I mean, that feels pretty good. I think the Nielsen numbers on Jack are somewhere in the high teens now, something like that. So you're getting -- you are getting on a brand that's north of 5 million cases to get that much off-premise gross is pretty -- I mean, these are big numbers. So now how -- or what are we going to do differently a little bit about it? 
Because you're right, it's -- we aren't happy with the growth rates that we've been seeing on Jack on Black Label over the last couple of years. A lot of it does have to do with -- we're going to rely a fair amount on these new campaigns that are coming out. We've been working with this new advertising agency since when they were hired in January. And so obviously, they went and shutdown mode, but bringing out an entire new campaign with a whole bunch of money behind it is in our plans for the next 6 months. And so we're doing a lot more other things than that. 
Obviously, the brand-building model is on hold -- not on hold, but, I mean, the way you do it is going to be very different in this environment than in a normal place, and you've got to find ways to get to consumers that are outside of the bars. But I think we'll be pretty effective in communicating that and getting that to them. 
And as I say, I think the U.S. Jack Daniel's business is in pretty good shape. But I'll highlight Gentleman Jack as an example, which is largely a U.S. brand. It's up 17% for the quarter. That's the best growth rate we've seen on Gentlemen Jack in a long, long time. And then Tennessee Honey, too, we talked about that a little bit earlier, but that brand is also on fire. 
So the family stuff, I think, we feel pretty good about."

I think that's 30% versus 17%, 18%, we were able to offset that loss of that business, which I think is pretty strong for the brand in this environment. And then more importantly, just to build on Lawson's comment about the full family of brands, he just referenced Honey more in our 90 of that brand and is growing high single digits, which is a fascinating and amazing as we're approaching 2 million cases. 
And the brand is actually bigger outside the U.S., it's over 1.1 million cases than it is in the U.S., and they're both growing high single digits, which leads us to the comment about -- and the performance about the brand and how we think about the innovation that we just did with last year, which was Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple. Because what we're seeing in a number of markets overseas where we've introduced it is we're performing at or above rate at the same point in time at Honey, which holds well for that brand.

And it's -- although it's probably worth pointing out, too, over the last 10 years, we have shed most of our are brands that were sort of less than premium. And so we don't have a lot to trade down, too. But I think in the broader question across the whole of TDS, certainly, the stimulus money is a big part of it. And that travels all the way through to Europe and some other places. And as you say, in the emerging markets, there is some trading down, I think, in the emerging markets that we have seen. And a large -- a lot of that would be stimulus related to but I also think in this environment now is back to the U.S. a little bit more. We're also in the right categories. So tequilas and whiskeys are places that where consumers are really buying these days, and those consumers are -- a lot of the consumers while unemployment may be high -- is high right now, there's a lot of consumers in the United States that are saving money from not traveling and not vacationing and not doing all those sorts of things. And they've got money. And about the only thing that's fun to do is throw a little home party or sit at mix cocktails and make all that kind of thing. 
And so those tend to be very super-premium consumers, and that's what they're spending their money on. And so for us, things like Woodford Reserve, Double Oaked or within Old Forester, the more premium line extensions there, those things are all on fire. They have been for a while, but they've remained very, very strong. And so we just happen to be the recipient of with the trends. Our portfolio matches up with the consumer trends these days, and we're getting some benefit from that."

So I don't know. As I say, I think it will be pretty weak for the next 6 to 12, and then you'll be comping against such easy periods as restaurants back -- open back up again, you're probably going to get a period of pretty good acceleration. But 3 to 5 -- 3, 4, 5 years out, I just don't know."

Numerous risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected in these statements. Many of the factors that will determine future results are beyond the company's ability to control or predict. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, and the company takes no obligation to update any of these statements, whether due to new information, future events or otherwise.
This morning, we issued a press release containing our results for the first quarter fiscal 2021, in addition to posting presentation materials that Lawson and Jane will walk you through momentarily. Both the release and the presentation can be found on our website under the section titled, Investors, Events and Presentations.
In the press release, we listed a number of risk factors that you should consider in conjunction with our forward-looking statements. Other significant risk factors are described in our Form 10-K and Form 10-Q reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
During this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures, a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the reason management believes they provide useful information to investors regarding the company's financial conditions and results of operations are contained in the press release and investor presentation.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Lawson."

As I stated in the earnings release that went out earlier this morning, I'm actually very pleased with the company's first quarter performance, and truly want to thank our dedicated, agile and resilient team",1242,"Thank you, Leanne, and good morning, everyone. As I stated in the earnings release that went out earlier this morning, I'm actually very pleased with the company's first quarter performance, and truly want to thank our dedicated, agile and resilient team of employees worldwide who made these results possible.
We entered this fiscal year in one of the most complex and challenging business environments that we have seen in decades. Every market around the world has and continues to experience the health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. We've continued to lead by our values, keeping the health and safety of all our employees as our highest priority, but we remain committed to our strategic priorities. But like much of the world, we're adjusting the ways in which we do our work. There have been very dramatic changes to channels, to brands, occasions, which really impacts things like seismics and formats, and we continue to see a lot of volatility around the world.
One of the most obvious ways that COVID-19 has impacted our business is the prolonged closure of the on-premise and the resulting shift in consumption to at-home occasions. As you can imagine, we've rapidly shifted people and investments into the off-premise, but different markets around the world have shown very different results. Even more interesting, we've also seen the pandemic accelerate a number of macro consumer trends. For the most part, trends that were happening before the pandemic have really accelerated over the past few months. So I thought I'd walk through some of these accelerating trends as well as provide examples of how we are capitalizing on these trends to our advantage.
The first really would be premiumization. This was a growing trend pre-COVID and really has been a trend in the spirits business for a long time, but we've seen growth rates of premium and super premium brands accelerate greatly in the U.S. since March. Before I go further, I did want to note that this is an area where we have started to see a divergence between the more developed markets, like much of Europe and the United States, and the emerging markets. We believe this is largely due to the broader social safety nets and other forms of stimulus that the larger developed markets offer. So consumer spending has remained strong in many developed markets, and the spirits industry is benefiting.
We do believe consumers are looking for everyday luxuries, and this is great for super premium spirits. In the U.S., Nielsen trends for spirits have remained very strong since the beginning of the pandemic and have really maintained those higher rates of growth through the summer. The long-term trend of spirits taking share from beer and wine continues. I think as long as people are largely unable to spend on travel and other forms of entertainment, we think that the spirits' strong growth will continue predominantly in the off-premise. Making cocktails at home has certainly become a source of entertainment for many and that makes this pandemic just a little bit easier to take.
We also have confidence that we may not see the level of down-trading that we might have seen in past recessions in the developed economies. The factors are just different this time. As a premium spirits company, we feel that our portfolio of brands is well positioned to win in this type of environment.
The next macro trend I wanted to touch on is media consumption. Consumers have been shifting away from more traditional forms of media for a number of years. And we're not only seeing an increase in overall media consumption, which is intuitive as consumers around the world are spending more time at home, but also an acceleration of media consumption by digital platforms like social and streaming services. As I have mentioned on prior calls, we continue to move more and more of our investments behind our brands into broad-reach media, especially growth areas like online video. And I'm thrilled that we brought our new creative partner Energy BBDO on board at the beginning of 2020, right before the world went into shutdown.
While our brand expense was down significantly in Q1, driven by the uncertain environment, starting in Q2, you will begin seeing more spending as we launch new creative across many of our brands. Some of you have may already seen the new Woodford Reserve ads that began airing earlier this month and a lot of new work from the Jack Daniel's family, which will be coming out soon.
While not unique to spirits, the e-commerce channel globally has been growing even faster since the pandemic as consumers look for greater convenience. While e-commerce is still a small part of our overall business today, since March, we've increased our investment, both in dollars and in people to focus on this growing channel. Familiar and trusted brands are poised to win in these types of shopping environments, which gives many of our brands like Jack Daniel's or Woodford Reserve, we believe, a good advantage.
Furthermore, convenience, more broadly, as a macro trend has influenced our business in a couple of ways. With bars closed, consumers want convenient and easy-to-mix cocktails at home. Our Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey and Apple brands are providing consumers ease in making flavorful yet simple cocktails. And there are a lot of people making Margaritas at home, too, and that has really helped our tequila portfolio continue to grow across the U.S.
And we're really pleased with the early success of our Drinkworks' partnership and our first branded cocktail with them for the Jack Daniel's Lynchburg Lemonade. Consumers are also increasingly interested in ready-to-drink cocktails. So I think I'd like to spend a couple of minutes this morning just on this increasingly popular category. And as Jane will share with you, a key driver of our first quarter results.
Ready-to-drink beverages, our RTDs are having a moment right now, but it's a business we've believed in and invested in for a long time. It was nearly 30 years ago that we launched Jack Daniel's Country Cocktails in the U.S. Since that time, we've been building RTDs in many markets around the world. Globally, Jack Daniel's RTDs are now over 10 million cases, with Australia, the U.S., Germany and Mexico, all over 1 million cases. This really has become a meaningful business for our company.
Jack RTDs were created to expand occasions where Jack could be enjoyed and it focuses really on the key cocktail serves, such as Jack & Cola, Lynchburg Lemonade and Jack & Ginger Ale. These RTDs serve as an important consumer recruitment vehicle due to the category's light and really accessible flavor profile.
Through innovation, we feel we can meet consumer taste and pack preferences as they really do vary by market. Such recent examples would include Jack & Berry in Germany, Double Jack and American Serve in Australia and then Jack Daniel's Country Cocktails' Southern Peach and Southern Citrus in the U.S.
Our other large RTD business is our tequila-based New Mix RTDs in Mexico, which are now over 7 million cases. This business is also doing well in the environment we're in. I believe that we're well positioned with the right offerings at the right time to meet the increasing popularity of these ready-to-drink cocktails.
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Jane, who will walk us through our first quarter financial results."
256839,684435341,2088609,"Brown-Forman Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Sep 02, 2020",2020-09-02,"Earnings Calls","Brown-Forman Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Lawson, and good morning, everyone. As Lawson said, we are pleased with the start to our fiscal year, particularly in light of the current environment, with both our underlying net sales and operating income up relative to last year, and our re",1975,"Thank you, Lawson, and good morning, everyone. As Lawson said, we are pleased with the start to our fiscal year, particularly in light of the current environment, with both our underlying net sales and operating income up relative to last year, and our reported operating income and EPS increasing even more.
Not surprising and amplified during this volatile time, there's considerable noise in these results, ranging from product innovation launches, timing-related items in the same period last year, portfolio reshaping, a significant discrete tax benefit and, of course, COVID-19-related effects that include inventory fluctuations, customer buying pattern changes and geographic channel, size and portfolio of mix shift. I plan on highlighting these effects on our results to provide more clarity on our performance in the quarter. But first, as a reminder, our business began to significantly experience the impact of COVID-19 pandemic in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, beginning in mid-March and continuing throughout April. As a result, we estimated that the pandemic negatively affected our underlying net sales approximately 15% for the March-April period with a greater negative effect occurring in April, following some benefit we believe we experienced from pantry loading in March in some of our larger developed markets.
Now with that as a backdrop, let's turn our attention to the first quarter, where our results improved significantly relative to our fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Starting with our top line. Compared to the first quarter of last year, reported net sales were down modestly, reflecting the rebalancing, our giveback of the distributor inventory built in the U.S. in April 2020 during the period of great uncertainty surrounding potential supply chain disruptions. Adjusting for this factor, our underlying net sales grew 3%. When stripping out the noise, I noted earlier, however, we believe our net sales were down low single digits. As we look broadly across our geographic clusters, all were affected in some way during this quarter by the pandemic and its related effects, of course, some more than others.
Our Travel Retail business continued to be the most significantly affected as international airline travel remains at very low levels, airport stores are largely closed, airlines are offering limited in-flight services and the cruise industry is still shut down. These factors contributed to our underlying net sales declining over 60% for the quarter for our Travel Retail business. Our emerging markets collectively declined underlying net sales low single digits for the quarter.
Benefits from timing-related customer buying patterns in Q1 of both last year and this year, notably in Poland and Brazil and exceptional growth from our New Mix RTD business in Mexico, driven by the temporary interruption experienced in the country's beer supply chain in May-June, masked the significant and broad-based declines registered across nearly all our emerging markets.
Our developed international markets returned to underlying net sales growth in the quarter, up double digits, propelled by the accelerated demand for RTDs, most notably in Australia and Germany, which are both benefiting from the consumer desire for convenience.
The launch of Jack Daniel's and Berry in Germany and Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple in a number of key markets, including U.K., Germany and France, also contributed to the quarter-over-quarter increase. Further, we estimate that favorable comparison to Q1 last year and customer buying patterns this year contributed to nearly half of the growth in underlying net sales. Adjusting for these factors, we believe our developed international business grew low single digits.
And finally, our U.S. business, which represents half of our sales has remained resilient throughout this pandemic. Our portfolio appears to be well positioned, as Lawson mentioned, in this important market to meet some of the changing consumer needs and behaviors, driven by the significant increase in at-home consumption and the desire for everyday luxury. In fact, the acceleration in our underlying net sales growth in the quarter in this market was driven by those brands in our portfolio that are meeting those needs. For example, the desire for convenience. Our Jack Daniel's RTDs experienced strong consumer demand, both from our existing Jack Daniel's Country Cocktails brand as well as the excitement of our recent limited introduction of new spirit space Jack Daniel's RTDs.
The ease of mixability. The continued launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple, higher volumes of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey and our tequilas el Jimador and Herradura provided a benefit to the quarter. As a reminder, we will begin to lap the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple in this market in our second quarter.
Everyday luxury. Woodford Reserve and Old Forester continued to sustain double-digit growth trends that we've enjoyed for a number of years.
Now I'd like to expand a bit further on Lawson's comments as they relate to the U.S. market by leveraging both Nielsen and NABCA takeaway information. Since the pandemic began, the off-premise takeaway trends for beverage alcohol significantly accelerated. We also note the acceleration in volumes in the off-premise has consistently, throughout this period, more than offset the declines in the on-premise, meaning overall TDS consumption volumetrically has increased compared to pre-COVID. Consistent with TDS, we have also experienced increase in volumes. However, portfolio and channel mix shifts have adversely affected our margins, which I will discuss in a bit.
As you know, each of our major markets around the world are in varying stages of reopening and, in some cases, are experiencing a halt in reopenings, new restrictions or even a second round of closures. Consumer purchase patterns continue to evolve as bars, restaurants and other on-premise channels try to remain open while complying with various regulations. And in some markets, we are seeing a return of consumers to the on-premise as restrictions on consumer movement are easing.
I thought it was important to take a minute and talk about our flagship brand, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, and how it's performing in this environment. Overall, for the quarter, Tennessee Whiskey volumes were down with essentially flat volumes in the developed markets and declines in the emerging and Travel Retail channel. The shift from on-premise to off-premise consumption in the developed markets drove the brand's underlying net sales down further. However, overall, the brand remains quite healthy and is gaining share in the majority of its top 10 markets. In the brand's largest market, the U.S., volumetric trends are essentially consistent with pre-COVID trends.
Now turning to our gross margin. For the quarter, our gross margin declined 320 basis points, which also resulted in our underlying gross profit dropping 1%. Higher input costs related to agave, lower volumes for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, resulting in a reduction in fixed cost absorption and unfavorable mix drove our margin down. The mix impact reflects a shift in where consumers are buying our brands from the on-premise to the off-premise and e-premise and a significant acceleration in the rate of sales growth from our RTD portfolio. Combined, these shifts reduced our gross margin by approximately 100 basis points.
Not surprising, given the rapid restrictions placed by the COVID-19 crisis and the timing of our quarter, our advertising investments were down significantly in the first 3 months of the fiscal year. This not only reflects a reduction of on-premise activations and the cancellation of consumer events such as summer festivals and sponsorships, but also a pause in the month of July on certain social media platforms, specifically Facebook and Instagram. In addition and importantly, the reduction reflects the phasing of spending. For example, our investment in the Kentucky Derby has been shifted from Q1 to Q2 as the event was rescheduled. We expect our advertising investment to accelerate over the balance of the fiscal year. In the meantime, we have quickly adjusted our focus and resources based on the evolving landscape.
Our underlying SG&A investment was down in the quarter as well, reflecting a significant reduction in discretionary spending, such as travel and entertainment and special meetings as well as hiring freezes.
As the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on the global economy continues to evolve, we continue to closely monitor key indicators in each market, such as the stage of restriction, consumer trends and behavioral insights and macroeconomic conditions. We believe this has and will continue to aid us in our frequent evaluations of the pace of recovery and where and when to invest.
There are 2 items that positively impacted our first quarter reported results only. First, the sale of the Early Times, Canadian Mist and Collingwood brands and the Canadian Mist production facility resulted in an EPS estimated gain on sale of $0.19. Second, we recognized an $0.08 per share benefit related to a discrete tax item. These 2 items, combined with the increase in operating income from our business, resulted in diluted earnings per share increasing 73% to $0.67.
And finally, to our fiscal 2021 outlook. We continue to face substantial uncertainty, and that has not diminished since our year-end early June call. As a result of this uncertainty and volatility that we expect to persist over the months to come and the low visibility we have on recovery, we are not able to provide quantitative guidance for fiscal 2021 at this time.
With that being said and more qualitatively speaking, as we think about our broad geographic clusters, we expect Travel Retail business to not recover and to remain down significantly for the year. Considering the benefits that aided our emerging markets underlying top line performance in the quarter and the continued expected shift in spending to value brands and assist in needs, we expect the declines in our emerging markets collectively to increase compared to Q1 performance over the balance of the fiscal year.
For our developed markets, we expect the volatility and uncertainty to remain high for the foreseeable future and hope to have a better understanding of such impact of volatility when we report our Q2 performance later this calendar year.
Our nonbranded business dominated by sales of used barrels is expected to continue to be a drag on our top line performance this year as it was in the quarter, reflecting the expectation of lower volumes and pricing. We believe the timing and strength of the on-premise channel recovery will depend on a variety of factors, but will look different and not at full capacity by the fiscal year-end.
Our gross margin will likely remain under pressure for the year, driven by the expectation of higher input costs and mix shifts. Where our gross margin ultimately lands will depend not only on the volumes of our business, but the mix of our business geographically, by portfolio, channel and size.
Regarding our operating investments, both advertising and SG&A, we believe we are well positioned to invest effectively as the recovery occurs. We expect overall operating expenses, notably our advertising investments, to accelerate as a significant year-over-year rate of declines in Q1 will not be sustained throughout the year. We, of course, will remain agile, diligent, focused and disciplined on our investments as the environment continues to evolve.
As it relates to our effective tax rate for the full year, we expect our tax rate from operations to be about 21% and our all-in tax rate to be in the range of 17% to 19%.
In summary, while there is a lot of noise in our first quarter performance, we believe our results are solid amidst this very challenging environment. Our balance sheet remains strong and our continuing capacity to generate solid operating cash flow is sound. As always, we will continue to manage our uses of cash thoughtfully. We believe these actions and strength will allow us to navigate this crisis as circumstances evolve, and we will emerge from this unprecedented time an even stronger company with healthier brands.
And with that, this concludes our prepared remarks. Dorothy, you may open the line up to questions."

So if you recall at our year-end call, we had already some visibility in our month of May results, and we told you at that time that they had improved from our lows in April. We think that was the trough of what we have seen. And -- but they were still down. So the month of June and July were both positive months, when we look at growth months, obviously, to drive the quarter up.
When we look at what's driving this, Travel Retail has not improved, it remains down. Our emerging markets, set aside the 3 countries I noted within our script today, which is Poland, Brazil and Mexico, were all down pretty significantly. There's been no change there really from what we had seen at year-end.
Where we saw the biggest changes were in an acceleration in the U.S., which, by the way, has remained resilient throughout this pandemic. So we saw some acceleration there, and Lawson was referring to some of the reasons why that was, which is really the consumer behaviors and the desire for convenience with the at-home consumption and our RTD business is so well placed for that as is our flavored whiskey and tequilas. So we benefited from that.
And then finally, the developed markets improved significantly from year-end. And that's where we got a fair amount of noise in the numbers. We had some easy -- or favorable comparisons to last year. We also saw some restocking, if you will, in some markets that we've restocked at the hypermarkets where they were -- people were shopping at the local corner before, I would say, as an example. So we got a benefit from that. We had the launch of Apple in there, both from the U.S. It wasn't there in the first quarter of last year. I am going to refer it less a bit in the second quarter of this year. But also the launch in 6 markets at the end of last year -- in 6 more markets internationally at the beginning of this year. And so we wanted to give visibility into that and say, really, if you strip all that out, our improvement in the developed markets has improved, but not at the rate that you're seeing. We're estimating more in the low single digit type of growth.
If you look at channels and things of that nature, the on-premise has started to recover in some markets, but still down significantly about 60% in the U.S. Overseas, we just started seeing some of that more easing in the months of June and July, and I'm seeing some promising trends there that have a ways to go, particularly in those tourist markets, such as Spain and Turkey and Czechia.
E-premise remains on fire, as Lawson mentioned. And so that growth rate has continued to be pretty solid throughout. We haven't seen a lot of change in that.
But all in, what we were trying to give exposure to was that we think all of our trends in the business have improved, but not at the rates that we recorded in the first quarter. We think we're down growing. If you pull a lot of the onetime factors out more in the low -- down low single digits."

And so we hope to see a little bit of a pickup as this coming weekend hits, although lord knows, we don't know what kind of Derby it's going to be, but that put pressure on it, too."

And all this is dictated by -- are determined by a market where it might be performing and where it's not.

But on a volumetric basis, it's higher even with 60% decline in the on-premise, which is pretty amazing. And it's remained steady.

And so as you did know that it was down significantly, we do not -- as Lawson and I've mentioned, we do not expect it to be down for the year, like it was in the first quarter. Where we land in the year, we're going to be very agile about this. You will see it quite a bit in the acceleration in our second quarter. I think Lawson mentioned this because this is also when we're going to be launching some new creative. The shift of the Derby, if you will, from the first quarter to the second quarter will be -- you'll notice there will be a pickup in spending there.
And just the number of activities that we've got going on that we believe we'll be funding behind. In terms of trying to get down to any quarterly phasing, that's about as far as I can go now is we pick -- we expect a pickup in the second quarter and the third quarter for sure.

Now I'll just pick up on part 2 of your question. And just building on Lawson's comments about the RTDs and playing an important role in this environment for the home consumption and convenience occasion and the cocktails and so forth.
But what you're asking, I believe, is about the degradation on margins. And I will say, in the first quarter, we talked about the degradation of both channel and portfolio having about a 1 percentage point or a 100 basis point impact. And a big piece of that isn't related to the portfolio or the RTDs, but more specifically, it was really the New Mix RTD, which we best found and as we said in our script, was one time, we think, in nature because of the temporary disruption of the beer industry in Mexico. With that being said, we have read it about this for some time. But in the environment like this, we think the volume and the sales generation vehicle for our brands are more important. Are you increasing your demand for your products? Absolutely, we are. You can see that. And importantly, if you look at the economics of an RTD, something we do frequently, and we convert it to what we call a drink equivalent basis on a whiskey basis, the economics are phenomenally even better than our full strength. And so that's just a couple of ways that we think about it. And in this environment, we think the small amount of degradation in the margins, not material is like 100% makes sense, and we want to be there for the consumer."

One, to point out that Jack Daniel's family globally -- you're asking about the U.S., but globally, it was still plus 3%. So in the middle of a pandemic, generating 3% sales growth on the entire family, I think we're pretty happy with that.
Now focusing just on Tennessee Whiskey itself, and I will talk about the whole world for a second, then I'll go more to your U.S. question, but keep in mind, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, so Black Label is one of the largest on-premise brands in the world. I mean it is in nearly every bar around the world. And so that business -- that's why that number is down somewhere around -- what is it? 7% down for the quarter on a global basis, a lot of that is on-premise.
In the U.S. itself, 30%-ish of its volume is in the on-premise and that went down drastically. So making it up with pretty dynamic off-premise growth, I mean, that feels pretty good. I think the Nielsen numbers on Jack are somewhere in the high teens now, something like that. So you're getting on a brand that's north of 5 million cases to get that much off-premise growth is pretty -- I mean, these are big numbers. So now how -- or what are we going to do differently a little bit about it?
Because you're right, it's -- we aren't happy with the growth rates that we've been seeing on Jack on Black Label over the last couple of years. A lot of it does have to do with -- we're going to rely a fair amount on these new campaigns that are coming out. We've been working with this new advertising agency since when they were hired in January. And so obviously, they went in shutdown mode, but bringing out an entire new campaign with a whole bunch of money behind it is in our plans for the next 6 months. And so we're doing a lot more other things than that.
Obviously, the brand-building model is on hold -- not on hold, but, I mean, the way you do it is going to be very different in this environment than in a normal place. And you've got to find ways to get to consumers that are outside of the bars. But I think we'll be pretty effective in communicating that and getting that to them. And as I say, I think the U.S. Jack Daniel's business is in pretty good shape. But also highlight Gentleman Jack as an example, which is largely a U.S. brand. It's up 17% for the quarter. That's the best growth rate we've seen on Gentlemen Jack in a long, long time. And then Tennessee Honey, too, we talked about that a little bit earlier, but that brand is also on fire. So the family stuff, I think, we feel pretty good about."

But we have even if -- even though Tennessee Whiskey, it's higher skewed toward the on-premise than the rest of the American whiskey, I think that's 30% versus 17%, 18%. We were able to offset that loss of that business, which I think is pretty strong for the brand in this environment.
And then, more importantly, just to build on Lawson's comment about the full family of brands, he just referenced Honey. We're in our ninth year of that brand and is growing high single digits, which is a fascinating and amazing as we're approaching 2 million cases. And the brand is actually bigger outside the U.S. It's over 1.1 million cases than it is in the U.S., and they're both growing high single digits, which leads us to the comment about -- in the performance about the brand and how we think about the innovation that we just did with last year, which was Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple. Because what we're seeing in a number of markets overseas where we've introduced it is we're performing at or above rate at the same point in time as Honey, which holds well for that brand in markets outside the U.S."

In terms of the RTD business and where it might go and whether it will have more pressure on the margins or not, what I was referring to in the first quarter was we had an outsized impact from New Mix.

And as you say, in the emerging markets, there is some trading down, I think in the emerging markets that we have seen. And a large -- a lot of that would be stimulus related, too. But I also think in this environment, now is back to the U.S., a little bit more, we're also in the right categories. So tequilas and whiskeys are places where consumers are really buying these days, and those consumers are -- a lot of the consumers, while unemployment may be high -- it is high right now, there's a lot of consumers in the United States that are saving money from not traveling and not vacationing and not doing all those sorts of things. And they've got money. And about the only thing that's fun to do is throw a little home party or sit at mix cocktails and make all that kind of thing.
And so those tend to be very super-premium consumers and that's what they're spending their money on. And so for us, things like Woodford Reserve, Double Oaked or within Old Forester, the more premium line extensions there, those things are all on fire. They have been for a while, but they've remained very, very strong. And so we just happen to be the recipients of -- we're with the trends.

This morning's conference call contains forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Numerous risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected in these statements. Many of the factors that will determine future results are beyond the company's ability to control or predict. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, and the company undertakes no obligation to update any of these statements, whether due to new information, future events or otherwise. This morning, we issued a press release containing our results for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2021, in addition to posting presentation materials that Lawson and Jane will walk through momentarily. Both the release and the presentation can be found on our website under the section titled Investors, Events and Presentations. In the press release, we have listed a number of risk factors you should consider in conjunction with our forward-looking statements. Other significant risk factors are described in our Form 10-K and Form 10-Q reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
During this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures, a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the reasons management believes they provide useful information to investors regarding the company's financial conditions and results of operations are contained in the press release and investor presentation. 
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Lawson."

I don't have to tell anyone on this call that 2020 has been a year that no one could have possibly predicted. And when we started fiscal '21 back on May 1, I did not imagine that I'd be sharing such solid results with you today. Both Brown-Forman and the industry as a whole has been very resilient through what is a very challenging and volatile environment. 
But first, let me start by thanking our employees. This has been a year of extreme turmoil in all areas of life, no matter who you are or where you live, and we could not deliver these results without your hard work, dedication and agility. I also want to thank our dedicated long-term shareholders, including all of the Brown family members and our outstanding Board of Directors for your leadership, encouragement and most of all your support. 
Before Jane and I get into the business discussion, I want to offer a few thoughts as we're less than a month away from closing out Brown-Forman's 150th anniversary year. I find it interesting that milestones of our company always seem to come about in turbulent and unforeseen times. Our 50th anniversary was back in 1920, the year prohibition began in the United States. Back then, we found a way to continue to sell whiskey through medicinal licenses and permits. Our 75th anniversary coincided with the end of World War II. And our 100th anniversary was in 1970 when bourbon began its period of decline, and we reinvented ourselves as a consumer goods company and expanded beyond spirits. And now today, in our 150th year, amidst a global pandemic, we have again found a way to reach more consumers and delivering underlying top line growth fiscal year-to-date. This year has reaffirmed my long-held belief that no matter the circumstances, Brown-Forman will be agile and able to find a way to deliver top-tier results. And in this year full of uncertainties and the unexpected, it's nice to have something that we can rely on, and we do not take that for granted. 
So as I turn to our fiscal '21 results, I want to talk a little bit about some of the surprises in our business. As you can imagine, when we started this fiscal year back in May, the headwinds appeared strong. Bars and restaurants had largely closed worldwide since March. Global travel retail had ground to a halt. Vacations and travel and hospitality were getting canceled all over the world. And in actuality, most of these headwinds really haven't changed, but I want to share with you a few positive stories of resilience in our business in spite of these headwinds and continued uncertainty. First is really the overall performance of the spirits industry. I often talk about what a great business premium spirits is with solid growth, nice margins and high returns on capital, and this year is no exception. Since the start of the COVID pandemic, spirits performance, particularly in the United States, has accelerated. Overall consumption is up even with many restaurants and bars closed. And we continue to take share from both wine and beer. Although that's a trend that has existed in the U.S. for a long time, the gap has gotten wider in spirits favor. 
Another surprise has been the exceptional growth we've experienced in our RTD business. As I mentioned last quarter, we have belief in the ready-to-drink category ever since we launched our first Jack Daniel's RTD over 25 years ago. But I'll admit that this year's performance has exceeded our expectations about the format and the category. And this really is not a single brand or single market phenomenon. We've seen strong growth from our Jack Daniel's RTDs in markets like Australia, Germany and the U.K. Our recent launch of the Jack Daniel's spirit-based RTDs in the U.S. is off to a terrific start. We've also seen excellent performance from our malt-based Jack Daniel's country cocktails in the U.S. Our tequila-based RTDs, called New Mix, in Mexico, which is now near a record 8 million cases in the last 12 months. And since our last earnings call, we acquired Part Time Rangers, a range of low-calorie, white spirit-based RTDs as a targeted investment that we believe will help us grow in this key category. 
A little bit on Part Time Rangers. This brand was found by 2 brothers in New Zealand and offers white spirit-based cocktails in a convenient format. We believe this brand can help diversify our RTD offerings in this region as well as broaden our reach into the fast-growing white spirit RTD segment. This brand has done very well with a new generation of consumers, and we believe it's well positioned to take advantage of recent consumer trends such as lower calorie, lighter and brighter tasting. Part Time Rangers is also known for its focus on wildlife conservation and sustainability, particularly through its charitable donations, supporting conservation and ecosystem preservation.  While focused on New Zealand and Australia over the next 12 months, we believe this brand has the potential to move into more markets in upcoming years. Although the shutdown of the on-premise certainly gave a boost to the RTD category, the megatrends of convenience and flavors give us confidence that this category will continue to be a growth driver into the future. 
Another pleasant surprise is the continued and really accelerated growth of super premium brands. As I've shared before, this has been unlike any other recession that we've experienced. In the U.S., ultra and super premium spirits are gaining share at faster rates than in the pre-COVID time periods. And thanks to the portfolio reshaping efforts over the past decade, we don't really have much below the premium price level anymore. I also want to mention that we believe we are not only playing in the right price segments, we're also in the right categories really at the right time. I've already mentioned RTDs, but our 2 most important categories are really American whiskey and tequila. In the U.S., both of these categories have seen a significant increase in their pre-COVID growth trends. And it's worth highlighting the performance of Woodford Reserve. It has not only sustained its double-digit growth and is growing its market share in the U.S., but also we believe it's ready for a significant push in the international markets. 
On a geographic basis, the strength of the developed markets and sequential improvement in recent months of the emerging markets has been impressive. It has certainly been a welcome surprise in this dynamic business environment to see such robust growth from our U.S. business. And as we've progressed through this pandemic, we've seen relatively healthy performance from our large developed markets in much of Western Europe as well as Australia. 
I'm also pleased with the improving health in the emerging markets, too, which did improve over this past quarter, particularly highlight Poland and Brazil, as Jane is going to talk about in just a couple of minutes. And lastly, the teams deserve a lot of credit for the delivery of new world-class creative. We signed a deal with our new agency of record, Energy BBDO, almost exactly 1 year ago. And in less than a year, they have created beautiful global 360 campaigns for our American whiskey brands, Old Forrester, Woodford Reserve and Jack Daniel's, all through a global pandemic and all done remotely. If you haven't seen these campaigns yet, we've included them in our slides today, and you can believe that Brown-Forman employees around the world are planning to Make It Count this holiday season. 
So in summary, while we continue to face uncertainty and disruptions to markets and channels throughout the world, I remain confident that the essentials of our business are strong. And then as we approach the end of our 150th anniversary, Brown-Forman will enjoy many more milestones to come. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jane, who will walk us through our second quarter and first half financial results."

As Lawson said, this year has been full of surprises. Considering all the volatility and uncertainty in the world today, we believe that results we released today are strong.

Considering all the volatility and uncertainty in the world today, we believe that results we released today are strong. 
In the first half, both our underlying net sales and operating income are up relative to last year with an acceleration in our top line growth registered in the quarter. Not surprisingly, many of the items that created noise in our first quarter continued to impact our second quarter, including product innovation launches, notably Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple; timing-related items, both this year and last year; and of course, COVID-19, resulting in effects that include inventory fluctuations, customer buying pattern changes and geographic channel, size and portfolio mix shifts. 
Before I discuss our results in more detail, I would like to take you back a year ago. Specifically, as a reminder, in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we launched Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple in the United States and sustained our double-digit underlying net sales growth from our premium bourbon and tequila portfolios. Well, no one could have envisioned the world as it is today. And of course, COVID-19 has created challenges and uncertainty, but also opportunities. We believe this is evidenced by the continuation of our stronger-than-expected performance this second quarter. 
With that as a backdrop, let's now turn our attention to the second quarter and first half performance where familiar trends continue to produce solid results. Starting with our top line. Compared to the first half of last year, reported net sales were down modestly as a result of the decrease in distributor inventory levels that were built in the United States in April and the negative effect of the stronger U.S. dollar. Adjusting for these factors, our underlying net sales grew 4%. As we look broadly across our geographic clusters, we saw a wide range of top line performance with either strong growth or generally double-digit declines. We experienced top line growth in approximately 85% of our markets through the first half, driven by a number of factors, including our well-positioned portfolio, premiumization trends, our innovation and externally, the impact that government stimulus packages had in a number of markets on the economy. 
The markets where we are experiencing significant declines appear to have been impacted by a variety of factors, such as down-trading due to economic conditions; heavy on-premise exposure and for us in markets such as Spain and Czechia; declines in tourism, of course, in Travel Retail, but also in Southeast Asia, as an example; and then the external factor lacking here was the lack of stimulus from the government in many of these markets. 
Starting with our U.S. business, which represents approximately half our net sales. We sustained our strong first quarter underlying net sales performance in the quarter despite lapping last year's launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple as our year-to-date underlying net sales grew 9%. This strong growth reflects many of the same themes we discussed in the first quarter. First, the strength in the off-premise. The channel shift since the pandemic began has remained significant with off-premise volumetric growth more than offsetting the on-premise declines. Our portfolio continues to benefit from being well positioned in growing categories and to meet the needs of our consumers during this environment at home consumption. Most notably, the consumers' desire for convenience, portability and variety as well as ease of mixability is being met by the Jack Daniel's RTDs, Jack Daniel's flavors and our portfolio of tequilas. Of note, Jack Daniel's country cocktails again delivered exceptional performance, more than doubling volume both in the quarter and on a year-to-date basis compared to last year. 
Separately, the shift to at-home consumption convenience and the desire for contactless commerce has propelled our portfolio's explosive growth in the e-commerce channel with continued triple-digit trends compared to pre-COVID levels. And as consumers seek everyday luxury, premiumization continues to favor our super premium portfolio, particularly Woodford Reserve and our craft series expressions of Old Forester as these brand families sustain their double-digit underlying net sales growth. Our developed markets grew underlying net sales in the high single digits for the second quarter and 10% through the first half. Continued growing demand for Jack Daniel's RTDs, most notably in Australia and Germany, benefiting from the consumers' desire for convenience and the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple, drove these gains. We remain pleased with the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple internationally, where we continue to see the rate of sales equal to or greater than the Honey post-launch rate of sales. 
Our emerging markets collectively reversed their first quarter declines, growing underlying net sales low single digits for the second quarter and lifting the underlying net sales to flat year-to-date. Poland and Brazil have been resilient in the first half. And while Mexico declined in the quarter, its underlying net sales have grown year-to-date, driven by the exceptional performance of the new mix RTD business in the first quarter, benefiting from the temporary interruption experience in the country's beer supply chain. While the New Mix business remains healthy, we continue to see evidence of consumer trade down in the tequila and whiskey categories in Mexico and several other emerging markets. The rest of our emerging markets collectively remain down year-to-date, most notably, Southeast Asia, Russia, India and Latin America. 
Finally, our Travel Retail business continued to be the most significantly affected with international airline travel declining almost 90% and nearly all the cruise industry remained shut down. While we saw a slight improvement in the second quarter as our military channel is performing well, our Travel Retail business, excluding this channel, continued to experience net sales declines well over 60% for the first half of the fiscal year. 
Turning to our largest brand for a moment, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey. Overall, through the first half, the brand's volumes remained down, with essentially flat volumes in both the U.S. and our developed international markets and declines in emerging markets, though the rate of declines improved somewhat in the second quarter and declines in the Travel Retail channel. The shift from on-premise to off-premise consumption in our developed markets continues to drag down Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey's underlying net sales year-to-date. However, we believe the brand remains quite healthy and is gaining share in the majority of its top 10 markets. 
Now turning to our gross margin. Our gross margin declined 350 basis points through the first half, resulting in our underlying gross profit dropping 1%. Higher input costs related to agave and wood as well as a reduction in fixed cost absorption due to lower Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey volumes represented nearly 2/3 of our gross margin decline. Channel and portfolio mix shifts essentially drove the remainder of the margin drop. 
Moving to brand expense. While our advertising spend was down for the quarter, reflecting the reduction in on-premise activations and the cancellation of various events and sponsorships, we did see the decline slow compared to the first quarter as there are investments, most notably behind our new Jack Daniel's Make It Count campaign began in October. We continue to expect our advertising investment to accelerate over the balance of the fiscal year. Our underlying SG&A investment remained down in the quarter, reflecting tight management of discretionary spending, such as travel and hiring freezes. 
And finally, to our fiscal 2021 outlook. As we look ahead, a high level of uncertainty continues to exist, including the impact of the current surge in COVID-19 cases and resulting restrictions as well as the impact this may have on our consumer demand, notably during the critical holiday season that is upon us; and the tapering off of government financial stimulus in a number of countries, barring no changes between now; and the end of the calendar year and the potential effect on the global economy, employment and overall recovery. As a result of this uncertainty and volatility, that we expect to persist over the months to come, we are not providing quantitative guidance for fiscal 2021 at this time. 
With that being said, and more qualitatively speaking, as we think about our broad geographic clusters. First, our developed markets. While we expect the volatility and uncertainty to remain high for the foreseeable future, as we experienced a second round of lockdowns related to the pandemic and have noted slowdown in our November early results in Europe, we remain optimistic given the resiliency and strength of our performance during COVID to date. Travel Retail. We do not expect our business to recover this year in this channel and will remain down significantly. We expect many of our emerging markets will remain subdued, though we anticipate to benefit from easy comps when we begin to lap the start of the pandemic in our fourth quarter. Our nonbranded business dominated by the sales of used barrels is expected to continue to be a drag on our top line performance this year as it was in the first half, reflecting the expectation of lower volumes and pricing. 
Our gross margin will remain under pressure for the year, driven by the expectation of higher input costs and mix shifts. However, where our gross margin ultimately lands will depend not only on the volumes of our business, but the mix of our business geographically, by portfolio, channel and size. Regarding operating investments. We believe we are well positioned to invest effectively. We expect our unusually high operating expense leverage in the first half to significantly reverse in the second half, reflecting a notable increase in broad reach media spend as we are investing more into the important holiday period and the recently launched Jack Daniel's Make It Count campaign. As it relates to our effective tax rate for the full year, we still expect our all-in tax rate to be in the range of 17% to 19%. Our balance sheet and cash flows remained strong, and our capital allocation strategy is unchanged. 
I thought I'd pause and just mention a few recent actions in this arena. As you know, our first priority is to invest fully behind our business. Our Board recently approved an investment of $125 million in capital to expand our bourbon making capacity in Kentucky to meet the anticipated future consumer demand of our brands. We also announced a couple of weeks ago an increase in our annual regular dividend, marking the 37th consecutive year of increases and the 76th year of paying quarterly dividends in our 150-year history. We continue to actively evaluate our portfolio, selling the Early Times Canadian Mist and Collingwood brands, and as Lawson mentioned, acquiring the ready-to-drink brand Part Time Rangers. 
In summary, while there have been a number of challenges and headwinds in the first 6 months of our year, we believe our results reflect our agility and resilience to adapt and seize the opportunities in this very volatile and uncertain environment. As the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on the global economy continues to evolve, we will continue to manage, as we always have, putting our people first and staying focused on the long term. As Lawson mentioned, in our 150-year history, we have experienced many turbulent and unforeseen events and have emerged from those times stronger and with healthier brands. 
And with that, this concludes our prepared remarks. Let's open the line to questions."

And so that continued a bit into the second quarter. Though I will say that it's always more important to step back and peel back the onion, if you will, and understand that we were spending and did increase our spending in places where the momentum was going, so behind U.S. Woodford Reserve and Old Forester, behind our RTDs, behind our flavors. So all the things that you have seen driving our growth in the quarter, we spent behind and have spent behind year-to-date. 
What we did though was pull back a bit, as I said, in the first quarter, rightfully so for the COVID environment because of the restrictions on the on-premise channel, which took activities out of that as well as sponsorship events and things. And we said, let's take the money there and reallocate it to broad reach media and focus it when the new campaign that Lawson mentioned earlier came out -- comes out. And that's really behind Jack Daniel's in the Make It Count campaign, and it really just started in the October period, really late October. And so you didn't see a lot of that, but you're going to see a heavy concentration when we think about the phasing of it. We wanted to be there for the holiday. So our -- a lot of spending is focused in the holiday period, where we think we'll have nice share of voice. And from then on, when you compare our spend relative to the prior year in the fourth quarter where we were down because, again, COVID related. So I'll let Lawson pick up on share of voice or anything he wants to add on that."

So while I do think our share of voice will be going up markedly over the next few months, I'd just be a little cautious on using that as a real strong metric because of the different ways that people are spending. And as Jane said, she's right, we were -- I know the teams were very excited to get these new campaigns out there, and there was just a bit of a bias to wait until we had that. And so for the most part, Jack is ready now. Woodford has been out now for a few months. You're going to see more from Old Forester and more on our tequilas in the very near future. And so you'll be seeing more of our brands on air starting now."

On the A&P, when I look back, it's hard, I guess, to figure out what the right benchmark is. But a decade ago, A&P was running about mid-teens as a percentage of sales. Clearly, first half, we're down below 10%. I guess when you think about the normal -- what normalization looks like as we emerge, what -- how should investors be thinking about the right level of spending for your business as it's currently scaled? And then that's, I guess, the follow-up. And the second bucket is just -- it didn't come up in your prepared remarks, but obviously, e-commerce has been making great inroads in your -- across the market, but in your category specifically.

But again -- and that's why were so dramatic in the first half relative to our top line growth, this being down. But it is something that we, long term, want to spend in line with our sales growth. I hear what you're saying, you're looking back a decade ago. There's lots of puts and takes in the area. You got to look at pull out effects, brands that have come and gone and things of that nature. And we also look at the spending that we do not just in the A&P line item. We've talked about this before. I know on calls, we look at all line items in the P&L. So our packaging costs will show up in cost of goods or gifts that shows up in cost of goods. Our promotional activity, which are a net reduction to our sales price. And then, of course, our people who build the brands.  And so we look at it holistically like that as opposed to just one line item. But again, I would say, our ambitions are to, again, spend in line with our growth in revenues on an ongoing sustained basis."

So you're going to see an explosion there, and we're obviously going to be a part of that. But it is small. In the U.S., it's sort of 1% right now, 1%, 1.5%. But we've added a lot of investment there, and we will be adding more over the next, say, 6 to 6 months or so.

None of us 2.5 years ago thought that we would still be in the situation that we're in now, and we continue to work hard to try to find ways for the entire industry to get out of this mess. There are, I mean, I think, compared to, say, last quarter when we talked about this, certainly some encouraging signs. Certainly, the new administration seems to be putting people in place in important sort of economic roles or trade-related roles that are more centrist and a little more free trade than what we have seen out of the Trump administration. And so we have to be a little more optimistic there. And we'll see. I mean I do think also really both the U.S. and the EU together want more stability in these international relations. They don't like the chaos either. And so we don't know what the Biden administration is going to do, but we are trying everything that we can do to influence to make sure that these trade disputes get resolved. 
And so I hate to -- I am more optimistic, I guess. I've been optimistic now for 2.5 years and it still hasn't solved itself. So optimism isn't getting it done. But there are so many people that are getting hurt by these things. And I think the entire industry is looking at this like we need to solve both sides of the Atlantic. It's tough to say at the same time because they're 2 different disputes, but both sides are working to limit it or get it rid of it altogether. And then there is Brexit, which is only, what, 3 weeks away or something like that. And so I do think the U.S. and U.K. have been making progress there on trying to find free trade agreements. And so that one may pop up sooner than a resolution with the EU. But net-net, getting more positive on the topic."

And that's what was working very, very well, pre-COVID was the brands like Fords and the brands like Slane and even our GlenDronach and our single malt Scotches. So that model really, really was working well. We're having to pivot to spend a little bit more time and attention with those folks in the specialty on-premise channel, which is still huge -- specialty off-premise channel, I'm sorry, which is still very, very big. And it's just a matter of focus that seems to be working. You can do that focus on the on-premise, you can do it in the off-premise. But you just need to put time and attention against these smaller brands and that separating those people's responsibilities from building a Jack Daniel's or building a Woodford has worked very, very well in the U.S., and it's something we're going to do outside of the U.S. now, too. I mean we're -- it would certainly -- it works better when the on-premise is more vibrant. But these folks are able to do both channels at the same time and really build these brands. And I think we've got enough confidence that, that model can work that we are going to continue to focus on it."

Just -- I think maybe I'll start off with just what -- where we are year-to-date and then what we're forecasting for the rest of the year or are expecting for the rest of the year and then just pull ourselves back and say, what does",859,"Sure. Great question. Just -- I think maybe I'll start off with just what -- where we are year-to-date and then what we're forecasting for the rest of the year or are expecting for the rest of the year and then just pull ourselves back and say, what does this look like over the longer term. So as you heard me, and you saw in our earnings release this morning, we talked about 350 basis points of margin erosion. About 1/3 of that is really due to this channel size portfolio shift mix, and the other 2/3 of it is really due to input cost and fixed cost absorption being less because of volumes. Now the input cost was driven by 2 components, agave and wood or the cost of making wood. And something I haven't spent a lot of time and time talking about in the past is -- reminding all of us here that are wood cost were laid down 4 years ago and they're coming through today. And so the reason why I'm mentioning that is because of some of the things we're working on today, which will help improve our margins longer term. So I'll come back to that in just a moment. So that's where we are on a year-to-date basis. Hopefully, that first makes sense. 
As you said, yes, we said we do still expect margins to be down for the year. We're forecasting by the end of the year that we won't -- we will improve from the 350 basis points drag of where we are today, it will improve from there. So I think we've hit our peak, if you will, and so we expect that to improve where we land. As you also pointed out, Peter, it depends upon the mix, the channel mix, the portfolio mix and so forth. But we do expect an improvement in the back half of the year. Now thinking of our future expectations of margins, think medium to long term. I'll start it off explaining the wood situation because, again, what we're seeing come through the P&L this year is wood that was laid down 4, 5, 6 years ago. And so we've got a number of initiatives that we've been working on and continue to work on and will continue to work on that will help improve our cost situation in these type of areas like wood, things that are going into the aging of the barrel. They will not show up this year, they will show up down the road. 
Agave, you mentioned agave. We really haven't changed our outlook on agave from what we explained in the first quarter. Again, just as a reminder, it's really based upon CRT, the plantings from '15 and '16. We expected things to -- the situation to -- supply/demand imbalance to improve by the end of next -- about a year from now, which is our calendar '22, so this time next year. We have, though -- because overall tequila on a worldwide basis, while doing great in the U.S. and growing quite rapidly, it is actually forecasted to be down for the year. Mexico's down, parts of -- other parts of the world where it's really not that big anyhow, but it's down. So I think IWSR said -- came out with a forecast of tequila being down about 4% for the calendar year. I only mentioned that is because we have seen some stabilization in pricing. No change really from our first quarter conversation with you, which is about 26 to 28 [ peso ], so still in that range. 
But perhaps the pressure on the prices will come down a bit faster we're hoping than maybe this time next year, but we're not seeing a rapid change. We don't expect it to be all of a sudden, drop down to the bottom. But we do expect to start seeing some benefits starting later next fiscal year for sure. And then finally, as one of the previous callers asked was about tariffs. And we're cautiously optimistic that they will resolve successfully, and that will also take pressure offer for our margins. And so over the long term, if I'm think -- medium to long term, I'm looking at our margins to improve from not only where it is today, but even from there. We have one final variable that we've been working on, which is our pricing. I've talked about this before with this group, I believe, which is our revenue growth management capabilities. We've invested a lot in tools. We've gotten quite sophisticated in our U.S. organization and just recently rolled it out to the rest of our major markets around the world. So we're building those capabilities. And what that capabilities allow us to do is to look at optimizing our pricing by channel, by customer, whether our promotions are effective or are not effective, where are those opportunities to take pricing. And we're actively doing that and have actually seen nice benefits from it already in the U.S. and expect that will help as we go down the road, too."

And so something that we'd like to do is type to equalize it on an equivalent basis. And so when you equivalize the drinks on a volumetric basis, both full strength whiskeys and full strength tequilas, you're about at a 1% volumetric growth. Our mix, again, is really, again, driven by the portfolio shift, meaning the acceleration in the RTDs and the new mix. We talked about this in our first quarter earnings call that something we've read about from time to time is this margin erosion from RTDs. But quite frankly, it's pretty small in the grand scheme of the margin erosion that we've seen. And we want to be there for the consumer, which we are, as you can tell by these volumetric trends. We're meeting the convenience needs, the tasty, flavorful cocktails and so forth like that. So we have. And we'll continue to believe that the small amount of margin erosion resulting from the RT (sic) [ RTD ] business is a good thing in this environment, particularly."

Okay. So the -- look, I do -- in terms of how we think about planning for the future and things like that, I wouldn't -- I mean, I know the brand expense variation between the first half and the second half seems very, very COVID driven, and it certainly was in Q1. But we're not really changing our mentality here over the medium or long term. As Jane said, having brand expense grow in line with sales is a pretty fair way to think about it. And so -- and even though we -- as I said, the first half hasn't been that way, that is the sort of the near term, medium and long-term direction that we look at. As far as different -- the one thing in the planning world that we'll see how the next 12 months go is what does the recession look like? I feel -- I think we feel pretty good about the United States and sort of the bigger markets in Europe. But boy, some of the emerging markets of the world, I think, are still -- they're going to be slower coming out of this. And so how do we reallocate resources to make sure we're keeping the U.S. vibrant, the U.K., Germanys of the world without walking away from the emerging markets, but we're certainly not going to be investing at the same levels in some of those that continue to struggle in a recessionary environment. And I -- not that I'm an economist, but if you -- certainly the economists that are out there are predicting a pretty rough return for places like India and Africa and pieces of South America, places like that. Global travel retail is another one that is likely to be in a pretty subdued trends now for years."

I [indiscernible] and alluded to it in the script that, of course, the shutdowns in Europe and lockdowns Europe happened in late October. So it really didn't affect our results.

It's going to be our toughest quarter, both the top line and then the deleveraging because we are spending during this O&D -- during this [indiscernible] period. And then we just swing back with the fourth quarter as we go against easy comps at the top line and then the less spending there. So that's I know a little tactical, but I wanted to make sure that I explained that somewhere in this conversation."

I don't have to tell anyone on this call that 2020 has been a year that no one could have possibly predicted. And when we started fiscal '21 back on May 1, I did not imagine that I'd be sharing such solid results with you today. Both Brown-Forman and the industry as a whole has been very resilient through what is a very challenging and volatile environment.
But first, let me start by thanking our employees. This has been a year of extreme turmoil in all areas of life, no matter who you are or where you live, and we could not deliver these results without your hard work, dedication and agility. I also want to thank our dedicated long-term shareholders, including all of the Brown family members and our outstanding Board of Directors for your leadership, encouragement and most of all your support. 
Before Jane and I get into the business discussion, I want to offer a few thoughts as we're less than a month away from closing out Brown-Forman's 150th anniversary year. I find it interesting that milestones of our company always seem to come about in turbulent and unforeseen times. Our 50th anniversary was back in 1920, the year prohibition began in the United States. Back then, we found a way to continue to sell whiskey through medicinal licenses and permits. Our 75th anniversary coincided with the end of World War II. And our 100th anniversary was in 1970 when Bourbon began its period of decline, and we reinvented ourselves as a consumer goods company and expanded beyond spirits. 
And now today, in our 150th year, amidst a global pandemic, we have again found a way to reach more consumers and delivering underlying top line growth fiscal year-to-date. This year has reaffirmed my long-held belief that no matter the circumstances, Brown-Forman will be agile and able to find a way to deliver top-tier results. And in this year full of uncertainties and the unexpected, it's nice to have something that we can rely on, and we do not take that for granted.
So as I turn to our fiscal '21 results, I want to talk a little bit about some of the surprises in our business. As you can imagine, when we started this fiscal year back in May, the headwinds appeared strong. Bars and restaurants had largely closed worldwide since March. Global travel retail had ground to a halt. Vacations and travel and hospitality were getting canceled all over the world. And in actuality, most of these headwinds really haven't changed, but I want to share with you a few positive stories of resilience in our business in spite of these headwinds and continued uncertainty. First is really the overall performance of the spirits industry. I often talk about what a great business premium spirits is with solid growth, nice margins and high returns on capital, and this year is no exception. Since the start of the COVID pandemic, spirits performance, particularly in the United States, has accelerated. Overall consumption is up, even with many restaurants and bars closed. And we continue to take share from both wine and beer. Although that's a trend that has existed in the U.S. for a long time, the gap has gotten wider in spirits favor. 
Another surprise has been the exceptional growth we've experienced in our RTD business. As I mentioned last quarter, we have belief in the ready-to-drink category ever since we launched our first Jack Daniel's RTD over 25 years ago. But I'll admit that this year's performance has exceeded our expectations about the format and the category. And this really is not a single brand or single market phenomenon, we've seen strong growth from our Jack Daniel's RTDs in markets like Australia, Germany and the U.K. Our recent launch of the Jack Daniel's spirit-based RTDs in the U.S. is off to a terrific start. We've also seen excellent performance from our malt-based Jack Daniel's country cocktails in the U.S., our tequila-based RTDs, called New Mix, in Mexico, which is now near a record 8 million cases in the last 12 months. And since our last earnings call, we acquired Part Time Rangers, a range of low-calorie, white spirit-based RTDs as a targeted investment that we believe will help us grow in this key category.
A little bit on Part Time Rangers. This brand was found by 2 brothers in New Zealand and offers white spirit-based cocktails in a convenient format. We believe this brand can help diversify our RTD offerings in this region as well as broaden our reach into the fast-growing white spirit RTD segment. This brand has done very well with a new generation of consumers, and we believe it's well positioned to take advantage of recent consumer trends, such as lower calorie, lighter and brighter tasting. Part Time Rangers is also known for its focus on wildlife conservation and sustainability, particularly through its charitable donations, supporting conservation and ecosystem preservation.  
While focused on New Zealand and Australia over the next 12 months, we believe this brand has the potential to move into more markets in upcoming years. Although the shutdown of the on-premise certainly gave a boost to the RTD category, the megatrends of convenience and flavors give us confidence that this category will continue to be a growth driver into the future.
Another pleasant surprise is the continued and really accelerated growth of super premium brands. As I've shared before, this has been unlike any other recession that we've experienced. In the U.S., ultra and super premium spirits are gaining share at faster rates than in the pre-COVID time periods. And thanks to the portfolio reshaping efforts over the past decade, we don't really have much below the premium price level anymore. I also want to mention that we believe we are not only playing in the right price segments, we're also in the right categories really at the right time. I've already mentioned RTDs, but our 2 most important categories are really American whiskey and tequila. In the U.S., both of these categories have seen a significant increase in their pre-COVID growth trends. And it's worth highlighting the performance of Woodford Reserve. It has not only sustained its double-digit growth and is growing its market share in the U.S., but also we believe it's ready for a significant push in the international markets. 
On a geographic basis, the strength of the developed markets and sequential improvement in recent months of the emerging markets has been impressive. It has certainly been a welcome surprise in this dynamic business environment to see such robust growth from our U.S. business. And as we've progressed through this pandemic, we've seen relatively healthy performance from our large developed markets in much of Western Europe as well as Australia. 
I'm also pleased with the improving health in the emerging markets, too, which did improve over this past quarter, particularly highlight Poland and Brazil, as Jane is going to talk about in just a couple of minutes. And lastly, the teams deserve a lot of credit for the delivery of new world-class creative. We signed a deal with our new agency of record, Energy BBDO, almost exactly 1 year ago. And in less than a year, they have created beautiful global 360 campaigns for our American whiskey brands, Old Forrester, Woodford Reserve and Jack Daniel's, all through a global pandemic and all done remotely. If you haven't seen these campaigns yet, we've included them in our slides today, and you can believe that Brown-Forman employees around the world are planning to make it count this holiday season. 
So in summary, while we continue to face uncertainty and disruptions to markets and channels throughout the world, I remain confident that the essentials of our business are strong. And then as we approach the end of our 150th anniversary, Brown-Forman will enjoy many more milestones to come. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jane, who will walk us through our second quarter and first half financial results."

As Lawson said, this year has been full of surprises. Considering all the volatility and uncertainty in the world today, we believe that results we released today are strong.
In the first half, both our underlying net sales and operating income are up relative to last year with an acceleration in our top line growth registered in the quarter. Not surprisingly, many of the items that created noise in our first quarter continued to impact our second quarter, including product innovation launches, notably Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple; timing-related items, both this year and last year; and of course, COVID-19 resulting impacts  that include inventory fluctuations, customer buying pattern changes and geographic channel, size and portfolio mix shifts.
Before I discuss our results in more detail, I would like to take you back a year ago. Specifically, as a reminder, in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we launched Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple in the United States and sustained our double-digit underlying net sales growth from our premium bourbon and tequila portfolios, when no one could have envisioned the world as it is today. And of course, COVID-19 has created challenges and uncertainty, but also opportunities. We believe this is evidenced by the continuation of our stronger-than-expected performance this second quarter. 
With that as a backdrop, let's now turn our attention to the second quarter and first half performance where familiar trends continue to produce solid results. 
Starting with our top line. Compared to the first half of last year, reported net sales were down modestly as a result of the decrease in distributor inventory levels that were built in the United States in April and the negative effect of the stronger U.S. dollar. Adjusting for these factors, our underlying net sales grew 4%. As we look broadly across our geographic clusters, we saw a wide range of top line performance with either strong growth or generally double-digit declines. We experienced top line growth in approximately 85% of our markets through the first half, driven by a number of factors, including our well-positioned portfolio, premiumization trends, our innovation and externally, the impact that government stimulus packages had in a number of markets on the economy. 
The markets where we are experiencing significant declines appear to have been impacted by a variety of factors, such as down-trading due to economic conditions; heavy on-premise exposure and for us in markets such as Spain and Czechia;  declines in tourism, of course, in Travel Retail, but also in Southeast Asia, as an example; and then the external factor lacking here was the lack of stimulus from the government in many of these markets. 
Starting with our U.S. business, which represents approximately half our net sales. We sustained our strong first quarter underlying net sales performance in the quarter despite lapping last year's launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple as our year-to-date underlying net sales grew 9%. This strong growth reflects many of the same themes we discussed in the first quarter. First, the strength in the off-premise. The channel shift since the pandemic began has remained significant with off-premise volumetric growth more than offsetting the on-premise declines. Our portfolio continues to benefit from being well positioned in growing categories and to meet the needs of our consumers during this environment at home consumption. Most notably, the consumers' desire for convenience, portability and variety as well as ease of mixability is being met by the Jack Daniel's RTDs, Jack Daniel's flavors and our portfolio of tequilas. Of note, Jack Daniel's country cocktails again delivered exceptional performance, more than doubling volume both in the quarter and on a year-to-date basis compared to last year. 
Separately, the shift to at-home consumption convenience and the desire for contactless commerce has propelled our portfolio's explosive growth in the e-commerce channel with continued triple-digit trends compared to pre-COVID levels. And as consumers seek everyday luxury, premiumization continues to favor our super premium portfolio, particularly Woodford Reserve and our craft series expressions of Old Forester as these brand families sustain their double-digit underlying net sales growth. Our developed markets grew underlying net sales in the high single digits for the second quarter and 10% through the first half. Continued growing demand for Jack Daniel's RTDs, most notably in Australia and Germany, benefiting from the consumers' desire for convenience and the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple, drove these gains. We remain pleased with the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple internationally, where we continue to see the rate of sales equal to or greater than the Honey post-launch rate of sales. 
Our emerging markets collectively reversed their first quarter declines, growing underlying net sales low single digits for the second quarter and lifting the underlying net sales to flat year-to-date. Poland and Brazil have been resilient in the first half. And while Mexico declined in the quarter, its underlying net sales have grown year-to-date, driven by the exceptional performance of the new mix RTD business in the first quarter, benefiting from the temporary interruption experience in the country's beer supply chain. 
While the New Mix business remains healthy, we continue to see evidence of consumer trade down in the tequila and whiskey categories in Mexico and several other emerging markets. The rest of our emerging markets collectively remain down year-to-date, most notably, Southeast Asia, Russia, India and Latin America.
Finally, our Travel Retail business continued to be the most significantly affected with international airline travel declining almost 90% and nearly all the cruise industry remained shut down. While we saw a slight improvement in the second quarter as our military channel is performing well, our Travel Retail business, excluding this channel, continued to experience net sales declines well over 60% for the first half of the fiscal year.
Turning to our largest brand for a moment, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey. Overall, through the first half, the brand's volumes remained down, with essentially flat volumes in both the U.S. and our developed international markets and declines in emerging markets, though the rate of declines improved somewhat in the second quarter and declines in the Travel Retail channel. The shift from on-premise to off-premise consumption in our developed markets continues to drag down Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey's underlying net sales year-to-date. However, we believe the brand remains quite healthy and is gaining share in the majority of its top 10 markets. 
Now turning to our gross margin. Our gross margin declined 350 basis points through the first half, resulting in our underlying gross profit dropping 1%. Higher input costs related to agave and wood as well as a reduction in fixed cost absorption due to lower Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey volumes represented nearly 2/3 of our gross margin decline. 
Channel and portfolio mix shifts essentially drove the remainder of the margin drop. 
Moving to brand expense. While our advertising spend was down for the quarter, reflecting the reduction in on-premise activations and the cancellation of various events and sponsorships, we did see the decline slow compared to the first quarter as there are investments, most notably behind our new Jack Daniel's Make It Count campaign began in October. We continue to expect our advertising investment to accelerate over the balance of the fiscal year. Our underlying SG&A investment remained down in the quarter, reflecting tight management of discretionary spending, such as travel and hiring freezes.
And finally, to our fiscal 2021 outlook. As we look ahead, a high level of uncertainty continues to exist, including the impact of the current surge in COVID-19 cases and resulting restrictions as well as the impact this may have on our consumer demand, notably during the critical holiday season that is upon us; and the tapering off of government financial stimulus in a number of countries, barring no changes between now and the end of the calendar year; and the potential effect on the global economy, employment and overall recovery. As a result of this uncertainty and volatility, that we expect to persist over the months to come, we are not providing quantitative guidance for fiscal 2021 at this time.
With that being said, and more qualitatively speaking, as we think about our broad geographic clusters. First, our developed markets. While we expect the volatility and uncertainty to remain high for the foreseeable future as we experienced a second round of lockdowns related to the pandemic and have noted slowdown in our November early results in Europe, we remain optimistic given the resiliency and strength of our performance during COVID to date. 
Travel Retail. We do not expect our business to recover this year in this channel and will remain down significantly. We expect many of our emerging markets will remain subdued, though we anticipate to benefit from easy comps when we begin to lap the start of the pandemic in our fourth quarter. Our nonbranded business dominated by the sales of used barrels is expected to continue to be a drag on our top line performance this year as it was in the first half, reflecting the expectation of lower volumes and pricing.
Our gross margin will remain under pressure for the year, driven by the expectation of higher input costs and mix shifts. However, where our gross margin ultimately lands will depend not only on the volumes of our business, but the mix of our business geographically, by portfolio, channel and size. 
Regarding operating investments. We believe we are well positioned to invest effectively. We expect our unusually high operating expense leverage in the first half to significantly reverse in the second half, reflecting a notable increase in broad reach media spend, as we are investing more into the important holiday period and the recently launched Jack Daniel's Make It Count campaign. As it relates to our effective tax rate for the full year, we still expect our all-in tax rate to be in the range of 17% to 19%. Our balance sheet and cash flows remained strong, and our capital allocation strategy is unchanged.
I thought I'd pause and just mention a few recent actions in this arena. As you know, our first priority is to invest fully behind our business. Our Board recently approved an investment of $125 million in capital to expand our bourbon making capacity in Kentucky to meet the anticipated future consumer demand of our brands. We also announced a couple of weeks ago an increase in our annual regular dividend, marking the 37th consecutive year of increases and the 76th year of paying quarterly dividends in our 150-year history. We continue to actively evaluate our portfolio, selling the Early Times Canadian Mist and Collingwood brands, and as Lawson mentioned, acquiring the ready-to-drink brand, Part Time Rangers. 
In summary, while there have been a number of challenges and headwinds in the first 6 months of our year, we believe our results reflect our agility and resilience to adapt and seize the opportunities in this very volatile and uncertain environment. As the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on the global economy continues to evolve, we will continue to manage, as we always have, putting our people first and staying focused on the long term. 
As Lawson mentioned, in our 150-year history, we have experienced many turbulent and unforeseen events and have emerged from those times stronger and with healthier brands.
And with that, this concludes our prepared remarks. Let's open the line to questions."

I mean really what you saw on the -- just as a reminder, yes, we were down significantly in the first quarter, and it was really more driven by when the pandemic hit and us taking a pause in our spend so that we can evaluate and reflect where we wanted to spend and the type of spending that we wanted to have take place. And so that continued a bit into the second quarter. Though I will say that it's always more important to step back and peel back the onion, if you will, and understand that we were spending and did increase our spending in places where the momentum was going, so behind U.S. Woodford Reserve and Old Forester, behind our RTDs, behind our flavors. So all the things that you have seen driving our growth in the quarter, we spent behind and have spent behind year-to-date. 
What we did though was pull back a bit, as I said, in the first quarter rightfully so for the COVID environment because of the restrictions on the on-premise channel, which took activities out of that, as well as sponsorship events and things. And we said, let's take the money there and reallocate it to broad reach media and focus it when the new campaign that Lawson mentioned earlier came out -- comes out. And that's really behind Jack Daniel's in the Make It Count campaign, and it really just started in the October period, really late October. And so you didn't see a lot of that, but you're going to see a heavy concentration when we think about the phasing of it.
We wanted to be there for the holiday, so a lot of spending is focused in the holiday period, where we think we'll have nice share of voice. And from then on, when you compare our spend relative to the prior year in the fourth quarter where we were down because, again, COVID related. 
So I'll let Lawson pick up on share of voice or anything he wants to add on that."

And as Jane said, she's right, we were -- I know the teams were very excited to get these new campaigns out there, and there was just a bit of a bias to wait until we had that. And so for the most part, Jack is ready now. Woodford has been out now for a few months. You're going to see more from Old Forester and more on our tequilas in the very near future. And so you'll be seeing more of our brands on air starting now."

But it is something that we, long term, want to spend in line with our sales growth. I hear what you're saying, you're looking back a decade ago. There's lots of puts and takes in the area. You got to look at pull out effects, brands that have come and gone and things of that nature. And we also look at the spending that we do not just in the A&P line item. We've talked about this before. I know on calls, we look at all line items in the P&L. So our packaging costs would show up in cost of goods or gifts that shows up in cost of goods. Our promotional activity, which are a net reduction to our sales price. And then, of course, our people who build the brands.  And so we look at it holistically like that as opposed to just one line item. But again, I would say, our ambitions are to, again, spend in line with our growth in revenues on an ongoing sustained basis."

So you're going to see an explosion there, and we're obviously going to be a part of that. But it is small. In the U.S., it's sort of 1% right now, 1%, 1.5%, but we've added a lot of investment there, and we will be adding more over the next, say, 6 to -- 6 months or so. 
And so we've got a number of ideas and things that we're going to do there, and we're reallocating resources pretty much like you would expect we would to make sure that we're there for that channel.

There are, I mean, I think, compared to, say, last quarter when we talked about this, certainly some encouraging signs. Certainly, the new administration seems to be putting people in place in important sort of economic roles or trade-related roles that are more centrist and a little more free trade than what we have seen out of the Trump administration. And so we have to be a little more optimistic there. And we'll see. I mean I do think also really both the U.S. and the EU together want more stability in these international relations. They don't like the chaos either. And so we don't know what the Biden administration is going to do, but we are trying everything that we can do to influence to make sure that these trade disputes get resolved. 
And so I hate to -- I am more optimistic, I guess. I've been optimistic now for 2.5 years and it still hasn't solved itself. So optimism isn't getting it done. But there are so many people that are getting hurt by these things. And I think the entire industry is looking at this like we need to solve both sides of the Atlantic. It's tough to say at the same time because they're 2 different disputes, but both sides are working to limit it or get it -- rid of it altogether. And then there is Brexit, which is only, what, 3 weeks away or something like that. And so I do think the U.S. and U.K. have been making progress there on trying to find free trade agreements. And so that one may pop up sooner than a resolution with the EU. But net-net, getting more positive on the topic."

And that's what was working very, very well, pre-COVID was the brands like Fords and the brands like Slane and even our GlenDronach and our single malt Scotches. So that model really, really was working well. We're having to pivot to spend a little bit more time and attention with those folks in the specialty on-premise channel, which is still huge -- specialty off-premise channel, I'm sorry, which is still very, very big. And it's just a matter of focus that seems to be working. You can do that focus on the on-premise, you can do it in the off-premise. But you just need to put time and attention against these smaller brands and that separating those people's responsibilities from building a Jack Daniel's or building a Woodford has worked very, very well in the U.S., and it's something we're going to do outside of the U.S. now, too. I mean we're -- it would certainly -- it works better when the on-premise is more vibrant. But these folks are able to do both channels at the same time and really build these brands.

And so again, we want to be reach, we're trying to reach more consumers regardless of what it is, which brands, whether they're small or large.

Great question. Just -- I think maybe I'll start off with just what -- where we are year-to-date and then what we're forecasting for the rest of the year or are expecting for the rest of the year and then just pull ourselves back and say what does this look like over the longer term. 
So as you heard me, and you saw in our earnings release this morning, we talked about 350 basis points of margin erosion. About 1/3 of that is really due to this channel size portfolio shift mix, and the other 2/3 of it is really due to input costs and fixed cost absorption being less because of volumes. 
Now the input cost was driven by 2 components, agave and wood or the cost of making wood. And something I haven't spent a lot of time and time talking about in the past is -- reminding all of us here that are wood cost were laid down 4 years ago and they're coming through today. And so the reason why I'm mentioning that is because of some of the things we're working on today, which will help improve our margins longer term. So I'll come back to that in just a moment. So that's where we are on a year-to-date basis. Hopefully, that first makes sense. 
As you said, yes, we said we do still expect margins to be down for the year. We're forecasting by the end of the year that we won't -- we will improve from the 350 basis points drag of where we are today, it will improve from there. So I think we've hit our peak, if you will, and so we expect that to improve where we land. As you also pointed out, Peter, it depends upon the mix, the channel mix, the portfolio mix and so forth. But we do expect an improvement in the back half of the year. 
Now thinking of our future expectations of margins, in medium to long term, I'll start it off explaining the wood situation because, again, what we're seeing come through the P&L this year is wood that was laid down 4, 5, 6 years ago. And so we've got a number of initiatives that we've been working on and continue to work on and will continue to work on that will help improve our cost situation in these type of areas, like wood, things that are going into the aging of the barrel. They will not show up this year, they will show up down the road. 
Agave, you mentioned agave. We really haven't changed our outlook on agave from what we explained in the first quarter. Again, just as a reminder, it's really based upon CRT, the plantings from '15 and '16. We expected things to -- the situation, the supply/demand imbalance to improve by the end of next -- about a year from now, which is our calendar '22, so this time next year. We have, though because overall tequila on a worldwide basis, by doing great in the U.S. and growing quite rapidly, it is actually forecasted to be down for the year. Mexico's down, parts of -- other parts of the world where it's really not that big anyhow, but it's down. So I think IWSR said -- came out with a forecast of tequila being down about 4% for the calendar year. I only mentioned that is because we have seen some stabilization in pricing. No change really from our first quarter conversation with you, which is about 26 to 28 peso, so still in that range. 
But perhaps the pressure on the prices will come down a bit faster we're hoping than maybe this time next year, but we're not seeing a rapid change. We don't expect it to be all of a sudden drop down to the bottom. But we do expect to start seeing some benefits starting later next fiscal year for sure. 
And then finally, as one of the previous callers asked was about tariffs. And we're cautiously optimistic that they will resolve successfully, and that will also take pressure off of our margins. And so over the long term, if I'm thinking -- medium to long term, I'm looking at our margins to improve from not only where it is today, but even from there. We have one final variable that we've been working on, which is our pricing. I've talked about this before with this group, I believe, which is our revenue growth management capabilities. We've invested a lot in tools. We've gotten quite sophisticated in our U.S. organization and just recently rolled it out to the rest of our major markets around the world. 
So we're building those capabilities. And what that capabilities allow us to do is to look at optimizing our pricing by channel, by customer, whether our promotions are effective or are not effective, where are those opportunities to take pricing, and we're actively doing that and have actually seen nice benefits from it already in the U.S. and expect that will help as we go down the road, too."

And if you look at the Nielsen trends or the NAFTA trends or anything else, I mean vodka, which is a much larger category, for every dollar that tequila is growing, vodka is losing, and the 2 of them almost offset each other. But it's just been a dramatic change in the U.S. spirits business in terms of categories between those 2.

Definitely understand there are several major drivers here, both from a product mix and a channel mix standpoint. But I guess it would be helpful if you could provide a little bit more color on the drivers of this. And then second, can you give us a sense as to when we might expect this divergence to narrow? I guess I'm wondering how big of a risk do you guys see that pricing ultimately reverts to lower levels over the long term?"

I assume what you're referring to is that our volumes were up 15% year-to-date, and that's really driven by our RTD business, where we've seen explosive growth.

I assume what you're referring to is that our volumes were up 15% year-to-date, and that's really driven by our RTD business, where we've seen explosive growth. Our Jack Daniel's RTDs are up 36%, and our rest of -- and our New Mix business, which is 100% in Mexico, is up quite nicely as well, benefiting from a first quarter beer disruption in that market. 
And so something that we'd like to do is try to equalize it on an equivalent basis. And so when you equivalize the drinks on a volumetric basis, both full strength whiskeys and full strength tequilas, you're about at a 1% volumetric growth. Our mix, again, is really, again, driven by the portfolio shift, meaning the acceleration in the RTDs and the new mix. We talked about this in our first quarter earnings call that something we've read about from time to time is this margin erosion from RTDs. But quite frankly, it's pretty small in the grand scheme of the margin erosion that we've seen. And we want to be there for the consumer, which we are, as you can tell by these volumetric trends. We're meeting the convenience needs, the tasty, flavorful cocktails and so forth like that. So we have and we'll continue to believe that the small amount of margin erosion resulting from the RT (sic) [ RTD ] business is a good thing in this environment, particularly."

We've been having an internal debate, quite honestly, on how sustainable are these growth rates in the RTD world, and are they just COVID driven because so many people are home, or are they something bigger than that? 
And I do think -- we call them megatrends, but I mean, convenience and flavor fits very well on those. And so you're not going to be seeing the triple-digit growth rates that we've seen in some places, but we feel pretty good that it's going to stay. The other big one that Jane mentioned in her prepared remarks, but it's the on and off thing, I mean that's obviously very big, too, probably bigger than most folks realize as that liter size in the U.S. would be the example versus [ 1 75 ] which is much more profitable. And so that will reverse and be a benefit to the gross margin at some point, too. So there's just a lot going on in terms of mix that all add up, but there are lots and lots of small things. Did we answer your questions?"

It's not growing by leaps and bounds, but there's certainly momentum to take the price up in that. Even our own brands, if you go SKU for SKU as the comparison or apples-to-apples, there is some small amount of pricing going up now largely from reduced discounting in the off-premise. But I don't sense in the industry or even in our own sentiments that when this is over, we're going to get more aggressive on pricing. I don't think anybody really wants that. And so I would expect similar to what -- we haven't had much pricing. It's been very, very low single digit, but that's a fair assumption, I think, going forward to long term."

A couple of questions for me, if I may, one on the outlook, and then just a follow-up for Jane on cash and capital deployment. So the first one probably for Lawson, just sort of understanding that we have to get through some volatility here in the winter months. But the broad question, how has your planning changed internally, if at all, as you think about a post-vaccine environment over the next 12 months? And then maybe more immediate term with respect to the guidance, talk about the factors you'd like to see before reinstituting guidance. So you mentioned some of the challenges in November. We understand that there's going to be some volatility. The flip side is, you're also seeing growth in 85% of your markets. I think collectively, the industry across total beverage alcohol has a little bit better sense of what changes in mobility may mean with respect to channel implications and consumer and demand. So maybe just comment on that, and then I'll follow-up on the cash and capital deployment."

Okay. So the -- look, I do -- in terms of how we think about planning for the future and things like that, I wouldn't -- I mean, I know the brand expense variation between the first half and the second half seems very, very COVID driven, and it certainly was in Q1. But we're not really changing our mentality here over the medium or long term. As Jane said, having brand expense grow in line with sales is a pretty fair way to think about it. And so -- and even though we -- as I said, the first half hasn't been that way, that is the sort of the near term, medium and long-term direction that we look at. 
As far as different -- the one thing in the planning world that we'll see how the next 12 months go is what does the recession look like? I feel -- I think we feel pretty good about United States and sort of the bigger markets in Europe. But boy, some of the emerging markets of the world, I think, are still -- they're going to be slower coming out of this. And so how do we reallocate resources to make sure we're keeping the U.S. vibrant, the U.K., Germanys of the world without walking away from the emerging markets, but we're certainly not going to be investing at the same levels in some of those that continue to struggle in a recessionary environment. And I -- not that I'm an economist, but if you -- certainly the economists that are out there are predicting a pretty rough return for places like India and Africa and pieces of South America, places like that. Global travel retail is another one that is likely to be in a pretty subdued trends now for years."

I guess this reallocation has been something we've been focusing on for a while in terms of -- to be more effective in our spend. And so the COVID environment has really accelerated that. So I don't know that we'll go back to plowing a bunch of a more expensive spend in on-premise. Yes, we'll have people there, but I don't know -- because you said post-COVID, and again, it's a crystal ball.  So I wish I had to actually [indiscernible] consumer behaviors and what they may look like after that. 
But I think our focus will still continue to be on reaching as many consumers as we can in our messaging and continue with new creative and with new advertising agency. 
But I thought I'd might take one point, so I want to make sure -- I haven't really talked about this. I alluded to it in the script that, of course, the shutdowns in Europe and lockdowns in Europe happened in late October. So it really didn't affect our results. I mentioned in my script that we did see a slowdown in November. 
Q3 is going to be our toughest quarter, and it was going to be. Anyhow, it's going to be our toughest quarter, both the top line and then the deleveraging because we are spending during this O&D during this spending period. And then we just swing back with the fourth quarter as we go against easy comps at the top line and then the less spending there. So that's I know a little tactical, but I wanted to make sure that I explained that somewhere in this conversation."

Our dividend just went up, but we do not have any plans for this fiscal year. So there's too much uncertainty and volatility. We've got lots of things coming up, who knows. While we're cautiously optimistic the tariffs will go away, if tariffs goes the other way in June, we -- having the cash on hand is pretty important to us, and we just really don't know what's happening.
