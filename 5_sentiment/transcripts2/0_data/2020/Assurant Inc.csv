We are pleased with our operating results for both the fourth quarter and full year 2019 as they illustrate our ongoing ability to deliver superior value for our customers, employees and shareholders. For the f",1345,"Thanks, Francesca. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our operating results for both the fourth quarter and full year 2019 as they illustrate our ongoing ability to deliver superior value for our customers, employees and shareholders. 
For the full year, net operating income, excluding reportable catastrophes, increased 11%; while earnings per share grew 6%, reflecting the shares issued for the Warranty Group acquisition. After adjusting for certain nonreoccurring items, which Richard will detail later, net operating income increased 15%; and earnings per share grew 10%, at the high end of our expectations. These results primarily reflected the stronger-than-expected performance of our mobile business and full year contributions from the Warranty Group. Overall, we continue to evolve our mix of business with about 3/4 of our segment earnings now coming from noncatastrophe exposed businesses, driven by strong growth in Connected Living. We believe this allows us to generate more diversified earnings and cash flow. 
In 2019, our operating segments contributed a total of $748 million in dividends to the holding company. This allowed us to raise our common stock dividend for the 15th consecutive year since our IPO and returned $426 million to our shareholders. This positions us to deliver on our Investor Day objective to return a total of $1.35 billion to shareholders by the end of 2021. We delivered strong earnings and cash flows, while also taking actions to strengthen Assurant for the future. We added or renewed more than 60 valuable client partnerships across our lifestyle and housing segments and launched several new product offerings to drive even greater value for our customers. 
Our targeted investments in emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and other capabilities, will ensure that we continue to deliver a superior experience for the 300 million consumers we serve worldwide. These investments also were made possible by the $100 million in gross expense saves we've now realized since 2016. Our performance wouldn't be possible without the unwavering dedication of our 14,000 employees across the world. They continue to serve not only our customers, but their local communities as well. With our Assurant Foundation during 2019, we provided support to nearly 1,300 charities, focused on helping our local communities grow stronger. Most recently, this included a relief for the Australian wildfires and the earthquakes in Puerto Rico. In March, we will publish our next Assurant social responsibility report to share our progress on multiple environmental, social and governance priorities, which we believe are key to the execution of our strategy. 
Now let me provide additional highlights from the year for each of our business segments. Within Global Lifestyle, 2019 was a record year as we increased earnings 37% to $409 million. Connected Living was the major contributor as the segment benefited from several long-standing partnerships and the market success of 10 new mobile programs added since 2017. As of year-end, we now protect over 53 million mobile subscribers, an increase of 15% year-over-year. Importantly, we cemented several key partnerships, including securing a long-term extension of a major client relationship in Japan, where we've increased the number of covered devices by over 50% just in the last year. 
Key to our success has been our ability to drive additional value for customers by expanding our fee-for-service offerings beyond traditional device protection to include value-added offerings like personal [indiscernible] and [indiscernible]. These platforms allow customers to help solve technical issues, optimize the performance of their devices and connect to live technical assistance, all of which delivers a better experience as tracked through our strong Net Promoter scores. In the year ahead, we will look to further expand our services to include new offerings such as ID protection. 
In Global Automotive, we protect over 47 million vehicles worldwide, up by almost 3 million since 2018. This growth is the result of the strength of our relationships with global OEMs, national dealers and TPAs and the scale and expertise we acquired with the Warranty Group. In 2019, TWG contributed an estimated $130 million to Global Lifestyle's earnings after accounting for intangibles and synergies. As we announced in the second quarter, we've delivered operating synergies beyond our initial goal of $60 million pretax since the close of the acquisition. While 2020 earnings growth is expected to moderate from a record 2019, it supports our view that we can grow net operating income by at least 10% on average from 2019 through 2021 and continue to produce strong cash flows in Global Lifestyle. 
Moving to Global Housing. We generated operating return on equity, including cats, of almost 17%, which we believe continues to surpass the P&C industry average. We benefited from a relative mild cat year and continued growth within our multifamily housing business. While we incurred higher losses within our specialty housing portfolio, we have taken actions to limit our go-forward exposure and improved results this year. Within our lender-placed business, we renewed 16 clients, representing approximately 60% of our tracked loans, a testament to our superior offerings. As we look to sustain our leadership position, we will continue to invest in our more efficient and customer-centric single-source platform, where we've now onboarded multiple clients and have plans to onboard others in the pipeline. 
In multifamily housing, we grew our renters policies to $2.2 million, up 10%; while also growing revenue by 6%. Our focus remains on driving a superior experience for both our clients and renters. We continued to roll out integrated billing and tracking platform, which provides substantial value to renters and landlords to allow us to increase attachment rates going forward. Overall, we believe the actions we've taken within Global Housing positions the business for profitable growth in 2020 and enables us to further generate above-average returns and strong cash flows. 
In Global Preneed, we delivered [ $52 ] million in net operating income after the onetime DAC adjustment in the third quarter. During the course of the year, we continued to leverage our strong long-term partnership with SCI, an industry leader, while also growing our final need business with new distribution partners. This has allowed us to create a more profitable sales mix as we continued to generate strong cash flows. The unique characteristics of this business, including low mortality risk relative to other life insurance products, steadily growing earnings and strong cash flows, provides us with confidence that we can sustain operating ROE of 13% Global Preneed long term. 
To summarize, 2019 was a strong year for Assurant. We deepened our relationships with many leading brands, delivered superior value for end consumers and strengthened our bench of talent. All of this helped us generate a more diversified base of earnings, from which we expect to continue to grow. 
For full year 2010, we expect operating earnings per diluted share, excluding catastrophe losses, to increase by 10% to 14% from $9.21 in 2019. The range includes a 1% negative impact related to convertible shares being dilutive for 2020. EPS growth will be driven primarily by higher net operating income across each of our segments as well as continued share repurchases. We believe our 2020 outlook builds off a larger and more diversified mix of businesses. Overall, it gives us confidence that we can meet our financial objective of 12% annual EPS growth on average for 2020 and 2021. 
As we enter the connected decade, we believe it will create opportunities for Assurant as consumer lifestyles will increasingly intertwine with their connected ecosystems. For example, with the rollout of 5G and major enhancements to vehicle technology on the horizon, we look to address consumer needs in both the connected home and connected car. We believe that investing in our people, customer experience and innovation should allow us to continue to expand earnings and cash flow over the long term. To prepare, we will drive investments, both organic and through targeted acquisitions, to scale our operations, develop new offerings and launch new client programs, while strengthening our infrastructure to support future growth. 
I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review fourth quarter results and 2020 outlook in more detail. Richard?"
4026111,650870827,1906760,"Assurant, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 12, 2020",2020-02-12,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As Alan noted, we are pleased with our overall performance for 2019. I'm now going to review our fourth quarter results and our 2020 outlook in more detail. Excluding cats, fourth quarter 2019 net operating income",1391,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As Alan noted, we are pleased with our overall performance for 2019. 
I'm now going to review our fourth quarter results and our 2020 outlook in more detail. Excluding cats, fourth quarter 2019 net operating income declined by $5 million to $140 million due to the absence of a client recoverable in the prior year period. In the quarter, we accelerated investments within Global Lifestyle to support future growth driven by strong business momentum. At the same time, we also took actions to transform our IT operations, which resulted in $8 million of severance. Savings are expected to fund future investments in our infrastructure and cloud capabilities. 
Now let's move to segment results for Global Lifestyle. The segment posted earnings of $97 million, an increase of 15%, when excluding $4 million of IT severance and a $9 million client recoverable from the prior year period. Growth was driven primarily by continued mobile subscriber growth from programs in Asia Pacific and North America. This was partially offset by investments to support business growth. 
In Global Automotive, earnings declined due to higher expenses to support business growth, partially offset by growth in the national dealer and PPA distribution channels. Total revenue for the segment was up $233 million or 14%. The increase was driven by expansion within Connected Living, primarily from mobile carriers and OEMs, and to a lesser extent, extended service contracts. Within Global Automotive, revenue grew 11% primarily reflecting prior period sales of VSCs across all 3 distribution channels, while our protected vehicle count increased by 7%. 
For full year 2020, we expect Global Lifestyle's net operating income to be up modestly compared to an exceptionally strong 2019. This is in line with the expectations we presented at Investor Day. The main driver will be growth from maturing Connected Living programs launched since 2017. As always, trading activity will be driven by the timing and success of new phone introductions and carrier promotions, which can vary from quarter-to-quarter. Throughout the year, we expect to make additional investments to support new programs and future growth. Our Global Automotive business is also expected to grow next year, but to a lesser degree than Connected Living. Growth will be driven by prior period sales of vehicle service contracts. Auto results will continue to be impacted by the low interest rate environment and expected declines in investment income. 
Within global Financial Services, we continue to anticipate declines in our legacy credit insurance business, which will offset growth from embedded card benefit offerings as we scale our programs in the United States. 
Moving to Global Housing. Net operating income for the quarter totaled $73 million, an increase of $85 million year-over-year largely driven by lower reportable catastrophes. Excluding catastrophe losses and a $3 million -- and $3 million of IT severance, earnings declined $8 million. This was driven by higher loss experience primarily related to a client within our sharing economy portfolio. In response, we've taken actions to improve results, including terminating certain coverages, and we are continuing to monitor experience closely. 
Lender-placed income contracted, reflecting the reduction in policies in force from the financially insolvent client we previously disclosed. Higher premium rates and lower expenses helped to partially offset the decline. Within small commercial, policies are now in runoff and results improved during the quarter, in line with our expectations. Going forward, we expect contribution from the business to be immaterial. 
Turning to revenue. Global Housing net earned premiums and fees increased 2%, driven by our specialty property and multifamily housing businesses. Lender-placed revenues decreased, reflecting the reduction in loans referenced earlier, partially offset by higher premium rates. The placement rate within the lender-placed business decreased to 1.58%, down 5 basis points year-over-year and 3 basis points sequentially, reflecting our mix of loans. In January, we placed 2/3 of our 2020 catastrophe reinsurance program and expect to finalize the program in July. We secured additional multiyear coverage, with now 47% of our U.S. program benefiting from this feature. We maintained our per-event retention levels at $80 million as we believe the actions we took last year, combined with growth in our non cat-exposed businesses provide appropriate risk-return balance for 2020. As always, we will continue to evaluate our exposure. 
For 2020, we expect Global Housing net operating income, excluding cats, to increase for the first time after several years of decline, driven by expansion across all of our lines of business. Results should benefit from improved profitability in our specialty property offerings, including the wind-down of our small commercial business. Lender-placed growth will be partially offset by the transition of loans from the financial insolvent client over the next few quarters. 
Lastly, we expect continued growth in multifamily, reflecting increased penetration across our PMC and affinity partner channels. While still early, we're monitoring claims from the earthquakes in Puerto Rico in January and believe that they will surpass our reportable catastrophe threshold of $5 million pretax. Overall, we continue to believe that we can generate above-market operating returns on equity of 17% to 20%, including cats, through 2021. Should the economy soften, the segment has potential for additional upside. 
Now let's move to Global Preneed. The segment reported $16 million of net operating income, down slightly year-over-year due to a combination of lower real estate income and lower investment yields. Revenue for preneed was up 6% driven by U.S. growth, including final need sales as we continue to add new distribution partners. In 2020, we expect Global Preneed earnings to be up compared to 2019 reported results and relatively flat, excluding the third quarter DAC adjustment. Growth from existing distribution partners and adjacent offerings will be offset by lower portfolio yields due to the current interest rate environment. 
At corporate, the net operating loss was $22 million, a $6 million improvement compared to the prior year period. The decrease was due to the benefit from our annual consolidating tax rate adjustment and lower employee-related expenses. For the full year 2020, we expect the corporate loss to be similar to 2019, around $85 million as we continue to benefit from scale efficiencies. Interest expense should be approximately $81 million, a modest savings from 2019, driven by our debt financing last year. Preferred dividends are expected to be approximately [ $19 ] million. 
Turning to holding company liquidity. We ended the year with $534 million or $309 million above our current minimum target level of $225 million. Dividends in the quarter from operating segments totaled $276 million. In terms of inflows, we received $27 million in upfront cash related to the sale of rights to future claims from our ACA risk corridor program receivables. In addition to our quarterly corporate and interest expenses, key outflows included $109 million in share repurchases and $43 million in common and preferred dividends. In 2020, we will continue to be strong stewards of our capital. 
For the full year, we expect segment dividends to approximate segment earnings, providing us the flexibility to invest in our businesses, organic growth and acquisitions as well as return of capital to shareholders in line with our stated objectives, subject to market conditions. We expect the pace and level of buybacks to be somewhat similar to 2019 and weighted towards the second half of the year. 
In January, we signed an agreement to sell our interest in Iké to certain management shareholders. Subject to regulatory approvals, we expect the closing to occur in the second quarter. This should result in an expected net cash outflow of approximately $54 million. This amount represents the difference between the balance owed on the put call and the agreed sale price. The amount could increase up to an additional $40 million in the event we provide seller financing at closing. As a result of the pending sale, we are required to further adjust the fair value at end year, which resulted in an additional charge to net income of $33 million. We believe divesting in Iké will enable us to deploy our capital and management attention toward targeted areas where we can drive greater shareholder value. 
In summary, we're pleased with our results for the fourth quarter and for the full year 2019, which provide a solid foundation to drive continued growth into 2020.

And so part of what you're seeing there is just that mix shift and that's going to continue. We're going to continue to add the additional services. Most of what went on in 2019 was really to absorb the growth, which was extraordinary in Lifestyle and to set up for continued growth in 2020.

One of them didn't perform the way we expected this year in 2019.

But you can bring that out maybe from the severance to the deck and you bring it up to maybe [ 9 50 ]. And so I just want to make sure I'm thinking about this right. If we do that, that 10% to 14% kind of looks more like a 6.5% to 10%, which sounds a lot like the last year's guidance. And I guess, a, does it sound right, am I thinking about that right? And then if I am, is it simply because of your guidance talks on the Lifestyle being more modest this year versus last year? Or what would cause the guidance to be -- if I adjust that correctly, the guidance to be about the same as last year?"

Second, we are continuing to invest, and it's important to invest on the back of extraordinary growth year in Connected Living last year. So you will see us continue to invest in the migration of our infrastructure to the cloud, which improves our delivery and reliability and capabilities. You'll see us continuing to invest in the next product. I mentioned briefly ID protection, but we have a whole pipeline of things that we're going to embed into our offerings in the years ahead that also creates additional future profit, but it's an investment today. The other thing I would say, we're growing off of a much larger base in 2020. 2019 had the benefit of a full year of really capturing The Warranty Group synergies and driving that into our business. That just -- that's good news, but creates a much larger starting point as we head into 2020. The final couple of things I'd say on it is, it's early in the year. We are being appropriately measured in how we think about the outlook. When we set an expectation, we fully intend to meet that expectation. And we have a strong pipeline that if that develops this year, as we've talked about in the past, if we launch another new program, another client, that will actually hurt in the short term in earnings, but is a very positive long-term development for our shareholders."

But I think it's important just to remind everyone, the context of why we made the decision to exit Iké. That investment was originally put in place 7 years ago in a very different Assurant and it was put in place with the objective to really grow scale in Latin America as well as potentially expand some fee income opportunities. With The Warranty Group deal, we are in a much stronger position in Latin America and international, and it just became not nearly as strategically relevant. And we are trying to focus our efforts around our true growth businesses. And so that led to the decision. And then, Richard, do you want to answer the question?"

If you look at lender-placed homeowners, extraordinary progress last year kind of in consolidating our franchise. Beginning to make real progress in converting clients to our single-source processing system, which will continue. That affects our expenses, every time we convert one, we can then reduce some expenses related to that. So that business is well positioned. And with the reductions we've taken and the retention on the hurricane exposure, we feel good about that business. Multifamily, although the growth was a little bit slower, it's still above market. We continue to gain share, and we have consolidated our position there by investing in digital and being able to provide a new way to acquire that product. And then finally, in specialty, obviously, the real disappointments last year. But at the end of the day, we're running experiments. If they work, great, and then we scale them. If they don't, we take decisive action. And as you heard Richard say, we did that in small commercial and it's now going to be kind of immaterial in 2020."

But it's because we're creating new fee income streams that are diversifying our earnings that don't have exposure or volatility really in those earnings. I think that's a big positive. If you look at investments, hard to say exactly how investments this year will compare to last year. A lot will depend on whether we're able to sign some new clients because a big part of our investment is when we sign a new client, we have to ramp up the people, the technology, the marketing, their filings, et cetera. But we're going to continue to invest. This is a business that has a history now for many years of strong double-digit growth on average, and we see that continuing into the future.

We look forward to discussing our fourth quarter and full year 2019 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Richard D",1539,"Thanks, Christina, and good morning, everyone. We look forward to discussing our fourth quarter and full year 2019 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Richard Dziadzio, our Chief Financial Officer. 
Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2019. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available on assurant.com. We'll start today's call with remarks from Alan and Richard before moving on to Q&A. 
Some of the statements made today are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. Additional information regarding these factors can be found in yesterday's earnings release as well as in our SEC reports. 
During today's call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the 2, please refer to yesterday's news release and financial supplement. 
I'll now turn the call over to Alan. 
Thanks, Francesca. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our operating results for both the fourth quarter and full year 2019 as they illustrate our ongoing ability to deliver superior value for our customers, employees and shareholders. 
For the full year, net operating income, excluding reportable catastrophes, increased 11%; while earnings per share grew 6%, reflecting the shares issued for the Warranty Group acquisition. After adjusting for certain nonreoccurring items, which Richard will detail later, net operating income increased 15%; and earnings per share grew 10%, at the high end of our expectations. These results primarily reflected the stronger-than-expected performance of our mobile business and full year contributions from the Warranty Group. Overall, we continue to evolve our mix of business with about 3/4 of our segment earnings now coming from noncatastrophe exposed businesses, driven by strong growth in Connected Living. We believe this allows us to generate more diversified earnings and cash flow. 
In 2019, our operating segments contributed a total of $748 million in dividends to the holding company. This allowed us to raise our common stock dividend for the 15th consecutive year since our IPO and returned $426 million to our shareholders. This positions us to deliver on our Investor Day objective to return a total of $1.35 billion to shareholders by the end of 2021. We delivered strong earnings and cash flows, while also taking actions to strengthen Assurant for the future. We added or renewed more than 60 valuable client partnerships across our lifestyle and housing segments and launched several new product offerings to drive even greater value for our customers. 
Our targeted investments in emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and other capabilities, will ensure that we continue to deliver a superior experience for the 300 million consumers we serve worldwide. These investments also were made possible by the $100 million in gross expense saves we've now realized since 2016. Our performance wouldn't be possible without the unwavering dedication of our 14,000 employees across the world. They continue to serve not only our customers, but their local communities as well. With our Assurant Foundation during 2019, we've provided support to nearly 1,300 charities, focused on helping our local communities grow stronger. Most recently, this included a relief for the Australian wildfires and the earthquakes in Puerto Rico. In March, we will publish our next Assurant social responsibility report to share our progress on multiple environmental, social and governance priorities, which we believe are key to the execution of our strategy. 
Now let me provide additional highlights from the year for each of our business segments. Within Global Lifestyle, 2019 was a record year as we increased earnings 37% to $409 million. Connected Living was the major contributor as the segment benefited from several long-standing partnerships and the market success of 10 new mobile programs added since 2017. As of year-end, we now protect over 53 million mobile subscribers, an increase of 15% year-over-year. Importantly, we cemented several key partnerships, including securing a long-term extension of a major client relationship in Japan, where we've increased the number of covered devices by over 50% just in the last year. 
Key to our success has been our ability to drive additional value for customers by expanding our fee-for-service offerings beyond traditional device protection to include value-added offerings like Personal TechPro and Pocket Geek. These platforms allow customers to help solve technical issues, optimize the performance of their devices and connect to live technical assistance, all of which delivers a better experience as tracked through our strong Net Promoter scores. In the year ahead, we will look to further expand our services to include new offerings such as ID protection. 
In Global Automotive, we protect over 47 million vehicles worldwide, up by almost 3 million since 2018. This growth is the result of the strength of our relationships with global OEMs, national dealers and TPAs and the scale and expertise we acquired with the Warranty Group. In 2019, TWG contributed an estimated $130 million to Global Lifestyle's earnings after accounting for intangibles and synergies. As we announced in the second quarter, we've delivered operating synergies beyond our initial goal of $60 million pretax since the close of the acquisition. While 2020 earnings growth is expected to moderate from a record 2019, it supports our view that we can grow net operating income by at least 10% on average from 2019 through 2021 and continue to produce strong cash flows in Global Lifestyle. 
Moving to Global Housing. We generated operating return to equity, including cats, of almost 17%, which we believe continues to surpass the P&C industry average. We benefited from a relative mild cat year and continued growth within our multifamily housing business. While we incurred higher losses within our specialty housing portfolio, we have taken actions to limit our go-forward exposure and improved results this year. Within our lender-placed business, we renewed 16 clients, representing approximately 60% of our tracked loans, a testament to our superior offerings. As we look to sustain our leadership position, we will continue to invest in our more efficient and customer-centric single-source platform, where we've now onboarded multiple clients and have plans to onboard others in the pipeline. 
In multifamily housing, we grew our renters policies to $2.2 million, up 10%; while also growing revenue by 6%. Our focus remains on driving a superior experience for both our clients and renters. We continued the roll out integrated billing and tracking platform, which provides substantial value to renters and landlords to allow us to increase attachment rates going forward. Overall, we believe the actions we've taken within Global Housing positions the business for profitable growth in 2020 and enables us to further generate above-average returns and strong cash flows. 
In Global Preneed, we delivered $52 million in net operating income after the onetime DAC adjustment in the third quarter. During the course of the year, we continue to leverage our strong long-term partnership with SCI, an industry leader, while also growing our Final Need business with new distribution partners. This has allowed us to create a more profitable sales mix as we continued to generate strong cash flows. The unique characteristics of this business, including low mortality risk relative to other life insurance products, steadily growing earnings and strong cash flows, provides us with confidence that we can sustain operating ROE of 13% Global Preneed long term. 
To summarize, 2019 was a strong year for Assurant. We deepened our relationships with many leading brands, delivered superior value for end consumers and strengthened our bench of talent. All of this helped us generate a more diversified base of earnings, from which we expect to continue to grow. 
For full year 2010, we expect operating earnings per diluted share, excluding catastrophe losses, to increase by 10% to 14% from $9.21 in 2019. The range includes a 1% negative impact related to convertible shares being dilutive for 2020. EPS growth will be driven primarily by higher net operating income across each of our segments as well as continued share repurchases. We believe our 2020 outlook builds off a larger and more diversified mix of businesses. Overall, it gives us confidence that we can meet our financial objective of 12% annual EPS growth on average for 2020 and 2021. 
As we enter the connected decade, we believe it will create opportunities for Assurant as consumer lifestyles will increasingly intertwine with their connected ecosystems. For example, with the rollout of 5G and major enhancements to vehicle technology on the horizon, we look to address consumer needs in both the connected home and connected car. We believe that investing in our people, customer experience and innovation should allow us to continue to expand earnings and cash flow over the long term. 
To prepare, we will drive investments, both organic and through targeted acquisitions, to scale our operations, develop new offerings and launch new client programs, while strengthening our infrastructure to support future growth. 
I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review fourth quarter results and 2020 outlook in more detail. Richard?"
4026111,650870827,1906780,"Assurant, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 12, 2020",2020-02-12,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As Alan noted, we are pleased with our overall performance for 2019. I'm now going to review our fourth quarter results and our 2020 outlook in more detail. Excluding cats, fourth quarter 2019 net operating income",1389,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As Alan noted, we are pleased with our overall performance for 2019. 
I'm now going to review our fourth quarter results and our 2020 outlook in more detail. Excluding cats, fourth quarter 2019 net operating income declined by $5 million to $140 million due to the absence of a client recoverable in the prior year period. In the quarter, we accelerated investments within Global Lifestyle to support future growth driven by strong business momentum. At the same time, we also took actions to transform our IT operations, which resulted in $8 million of severance. Savings are expected to fund future investments in our infrastructure and cloud capabilities. 
Now let's move to segment results for Global Lifestyle. This segment posted earnings of $97 million, an increase of 15%, when excluding $4 million of IT severance and a $9 million client recoverable from the prior year period. Growth was driven primarily by continued mobile subscriber growth from programs in Asia Pacific and North America. This was partially offset by investments to support business growth. 
In Global Automotive, earnings declined due to higher expenses to support business growth, partially offset by growth in the national dealer and PPA distribution channels. Total revenue for this segment was up $233 million or 14%. The increase was driven by expansion within Connected Living, primarily from mobile carriers and OEMs, and to a lesser extent, extended service contracts. Within Global Automotive, revenue grew 11% primarily reflecting prior period sales of VSCs across all 3 distribution channels, while our protected vehicle count increased by 7%. 
For full year 2020, we expect Global Lifestyle's net operating income to be up modestly compared to an exceptionally strong 2019. This is in line with the expectations we've presented at Investor Day. The main driver will be growth from maturing Connected Living programs launched since 2017. As always, trading activity will be driven by the timing and success of new phone introductions and carrier promotions, which can vary from quarter-to-quarter. Throughout the year, we expect to make additional investments to support new programs and future growth. Our Global Automotive business is also expected to grow next year, but to a lesser degree than Connected Living. Growth will be driven by prior period sales of vehicle service contracts. Auto results will continue to be impacted by the low interest rate environment and expected declines in investment income. 
Within global Financial Services, we continue to anticipate declines in our legacy credit insurance business, which will offset growth from embedded card benefit offerings as we scale our programs in the United States. 
Moving to Global Housing. Net operating income for the quarter totaled $73 million, an increase of $85 million year-over-year largely driven by lower reportable catastrophes. Excluding catastrophe losses and a $3 million -- and $3 million of IT severance, earnings declined $8 million. This was driven by higher loss experience primarily related to a client within our sharing economy portfolio. In response, we've taken actions to improve results, including terminating certain coverages, and we are continuing to monitor experience closely. 
Lender-placed income contracted, reflecting the reduction in policies in force from the financially insolvent client we've previously disclosed. Higher premium rates and lower expenses helped to partially offset the decline. Within small commercial, policies are now in runoff and results improved during the quarter, in line with our expectations. Going forward, we expect contribution from the business to be immaterial. 
Turning to revenue. Global Housing net earned premiums and fees increased 2%, driven by our specialty property and multifamily housing businesses. Lender-placed revenues decreased, reflecting the reduction in loans referenced earlier, partially offset by higher premium rates. The placement rate within the lender-placed business decreased to 1.58%, down 5 basis points year-over-year and 3 basis points sequentially, reflecting our mix of loans. In January, we placed 2/3 of our 2020 catastrophe reinsurance program and expect to finalize the program in July. We secured additional multiyear coverage, with now 47% of our U.S. program benefiting from this feature. We maintained our per-event retention levels at $80 million as we believe the actions we took last year, combined with growth in our non cat-exposed businesses provide appropriate risk-return balance for 2020. As always, we will continue to reevaluate our exposure. 
For 2020, we expect Global Housing net operating income, excluding cats, to increase for the first time after several years of decline, driven by expansion across all of our lines of business. Results should benefit from improved profitability in our specialty property offerings, including the wind-down of our small commercial business. Lender-placed growth will be partially offset by the transition of loans from the financial insolvent client over the next few quarters. 
Lastly, we expect continued growth in multifamily, reflecting increased penetration across our PMC and affinity partner channels. While still early, we're monitoring claims from the earthquakes in Puerto Rico in January and believe that they will surpass our reportable catastrophe threshold of $5 million pretax. Overall, we continue to believe that we can generate above-market operating returns on equity of 17% to 20%, including cats, through 2021. Should the economy soften, this segment has potential for additional upside. 
Now let's move to Global Preneed. The segment reported $16 million of net operating income, down slightly year-over-year due to a combination of lower real estate income and lower investment yields. Revenue for preneed was up 6% driven by U.S. growth, including final need sales as we continue to add new distribution partners. In 2020, we expect Global Preneed earnings to be up compared to 2019 reported results and relatively flat, excluding the third quarter DAC adjustment. Growth from existing distribution partners and adjacent offerings will be offset by lower portfolio yields due to the current interest rate environment. 
At corporate, the net operating loss was $22 million, a $6 million improvement compared to the prior year period. The decrease was due to the benefit from our annual consolidating tax rate adjustment and lower employee-related expenses. For the full year 2020, we expect the corporate loss to be similar to 2019, around $85 million as we continue to benefit from scale efficiencies. Interest expense should be approximately $81 million, a modest savings from 2019, driven by our debt financing last year. Preferred dividends are expected to be approximately $19 million. 
Turning to holding company liquidity. We ended the year with $534 million or $309 million above our current minimum target level of $225 million. Dividends in the quarter from operating segments totaled $276 million. In terms of inflows, we received $27 million in upfront cash related to the sale of rights to future claims from our ACA risk corridor program receivables. In addition to our quarterly corporate and interest expenses, key outflows included $109 million in share repurchases and $43 million in common and preferred dividends. In 2020, we will continue to be strong stewards of our capital. 
For the full year, we expect segment dividends to approximate segment earnings, providing us the flexibility to invest in our businesses, organic growth and acquisitions as well as return of capital to shareholders in line with our stated objectives, subject to market conditions. 
We expect the pace and level of buybacks to be somewhat similar to 2019 and weighted towards the second half of the year. 
In January, we signed an agreement to sell our interest in IkÃ© to certain management shareholders. Subject to regulatory approvals, we expect the closing to occur in the second quarter. This should result in an expected net cash outflow of approximately $54 million. This amount represents the difference between the balance owed on the put call and the agreed sale price. The amount could increase up to an additional $40 million in the event we provide seller financing at closing. As a result of the pending sale, we are required to further adjust the fair value at end year, which resulted in an additional charge to net income of $33 million. We believe divesting in IkÃ© will enable us to deploy our capital and management attention toward targeted areas where we can drive greater shareholder value. 
In summary, we're pleased with our results for the fourth quarter and for the full year 2019, which provide a solid foundation to drive continued growth into 2020. 
And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

One of them didn't perform the way we expected this year in 2019.

The 6% to -- the 10% to 14%, starting with the $9.21 from this year. I guess, if you adjust the $9.21 for some of the items this year, there's obviously some moving parts. But you can bring that out maybe from the severance to the DAC and you bring it up to maybe $9.50. And so I just want to make sure I'm thinking about this right. If we do that, that 10% to 14% kind of looks more like a 6.5% to 10%, which sounds a lot like the last year's guidance. And I guess, a, does it sound right, am I thinking about that right? And then if I am, is it simply because of your guidance talks on the Lifestyle being more modest this year versus last year? Or what would cause the guidance to be, if I adjust that correctly, the guidance to be about the same as last year?"

First, our outlook for 2020 is very much in line with what we had shared at Investor Day back in the spring of 2019. Second, we are continuing to invest, and it's important to invest on the back of extraordinary growth year in Connected Living last year.
So you will see us continue to invest in the migration of our infrastructure to the cloud, which improves our delivery and reliability and capabilities. You'll see us continuing to invest in the next product. I mentioned briefly ID protection, but we have a whole pipeline of things that we're going to embed into our offerings in the years ahead that also creates additional future profit, but it's an investment today. The other thing I would say, we're growing off of a much larger base in 2020. 2019 had the benefit of a full year of really capturing The Warranty Group synergies and driving that into our business. That just -- that's good news, but creates a much larger starting point as we head into 2020. The final couple of things I'd say on it is, it's early in the year. We are being appropriately measured in how we think about the outlook. When we set an expectation, we fully intend to meet that expectation. And we have a strong pipeline that if that develops this year, as we've talked about in the past, if we launch another new program, another client, that will actually hurt in the short term in earnings, but is a very positive long-term development for our shareholders."

But I think it's important just to remind everyone, the context of why we made the decision to exit IkÃ©. That investment was originally put in place 7 years ago in a very different Assurant and it was put in place with the objective to really grow scale in Latin America as well as potentially expand some fee income opportunities. With The Warranty Group deal, we are in a much stronger position in Latin America and international, and it just became not nearly as strategically relevant. And we are trying to focus our efforts around our true growth businesses. And so that led to the decision. And then, Richard, do you want to answer the question?"

But I think we took actions collectively that put Housing into a much better position as we head into 2020. If you look at lender-placed homeowners, extraordinary progress last year kind of in consolidating our franchise, beginning to make real progress in converting clients to our single-source processing system, which will continue. That affects our expenses, every time we convert one, we can then reduce some expenses related to that. So that business is well positioned. And with the reductions we've taken and the retention on the hurricane exposure, we feel good about that business. Multifamily, although the growth was a little bit slower, it's still above market. We continue to gain share, and we have consolidated our position there by investing in digital and being able to provide a new way to acquire that product. And then finally, in specialty, obviously, the real disappointments last year. But at the end of the day, we're running experiments. If they work, great, and then we scale them. If they don't, we take decisive action. And as you heard Richard say, we did that in small commercial and it's now going to be kind of immaterial in 2020."

But it's because we're creating new fee income streams that are diversifying our earnings that don't have exposure or volatility really in those earnings. I think that's a big positive. If you look at investments, hard to say exactly how investments this year will compare to last year. A lot will depend on whether we're able to sign some new clients because a big part of our investment is when we sign a new client, we have to ramp up the people, the technology, the marketing, their filings, et cetera. But we're going to continue to invest. This is a business that has a history now for many years of strong double-digit growth on average, and we see that continuing into the future.

For the f",1343,"Thanks, Francesca. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our operating results for both the fourth quarter and full year 2019 as they illustrate our ongoing ability to deliver superior value for our customers, employees and shareholders. 
For the full year, net operating income, excluding reportable catastrophes, increased 11%; while earnings per share grew 6%, reflecting the shares issued for the Warranty Group acquisition. After adjusting for certain nonrecurring items, which Richard will detail later, net operating income increased 15%; and earnings per share grew 10%, at the high end of our expectations. These results primarily reflected the stronger-than-expected performance of our mobile business and full year contributions from the Warranty Group. 
Overall, we continue to evolve our mix of business with about 3/4 of our segment earnings now coming from non-catastrophe exposed businesses, driven by strong growth in Connected Living. We believe this allows us to generate more diversified earnings and cash flow. 
In 2019, our operating segments contributed a total of $748 million in dividends to the holding company. This allowed us to raise our common stock dividend for the 15th consecutive year since our IPO and returned $426 million to our shareholders. This positions us to deliver on our Investor Day objective to return a total of $1.35 billion to shareholders by the end of 2021. 
We delivered strong earnings and cash flows, while also taking actions to strengthen Assurant for the future. We added or renewed more than 60 valuable client partnerships across our Lifestyle and Housing segments and launched several new product offerings to drive even greater value for our customers. 
Our targeted investments in emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and other capabilities, will ensure that we continue to deliver a superior experience for the 300 million consumers we serve worldwide. These investments also were made possible by the $100 million in gross expense saves we've now realized since 2016. Our performance wouldn't be possible without the unwavering dedication of our 14,000 employees across the world. They continue to serve not only our customers, but their local communities as well. 
With our Assurant Foundation during 2019, we provided support to nearly 1,300 charities, focused on helping our local communities grow stronger. Most recently, this included relief for the Australian wildfires and the earthquakes in Puerto Rico. 
In March, we will publish our next Assurant Social Responsibility Report to share our progress on multiple environmental, social and governance priorities, which we believe are key to the execution of our strategy. 
Now let me provide additional highlights from the year for each of our business segments. Within Global Lifestyle, 2019 was a record year as we increased earnings 37% to $409 million. Connected Living was the major contributor as the segment benefited from several long-standing partnerships and the market success of 10 new mobile programs added since 2017. As of year-end, we now protect over 53 million mobile subscribers, an increase of 15% year-over-year. 
Importantly, we cemented several key partnerships, including securing a long-term extension of a major client relationship in Japan, where we've increased the number of covered devices by over 50% just in the last year. 
Key to our success has been our ability to drive additional value for customers by expanding our fee-for-service offerings beyond traditional device protection to include value-added offerings like Personal TechPro and Pocket Geek. These platforms allow customers to help solve technical issues, optimize the performance of their devices and connect to live technical assistance, all of which delivers a better experience as tracked through our strong Net Promoter Scores. In the year ahead, we will look to further expand our services to include new offerings such as ID protection. 
In Global Automotive, we protect over 47 million vehicles worldwide, up by almost 3 million since 2018. This growth is the result of the strength of our relationships with global OEMs, national dealers and TPAs and the scale and expertise we acquired with the Warranty Group. 
In 2019, TWG contributed an estimated $130 million to Global Lifestyle's earnings after accounting for intangibles and synergies. As we announced in the second quarter, we've delivered operating synergies beyond our initial goal of $60 million pretax since the close of the acquisition. While 2020 earnings growth is expected to moderate from a record 2019, it supports our view that we can grow net operating income by at least 10% on average from 2019 through 2021 and continue to produce strong cash flows in Global Lifestyle. 
Moving to Global Housing, we generated operating return on equity, including cats, of almost 17%, which we believe continues to surpass the P&C industry average. We benefited from a relative mild cat year and continued growth within our multifamily housing business. While we incurred higher losses within our specialty housing portfolio, we have taken actions to limit our go-forward exposure and improved results this year. 
Within our lender-placed business, we renewed 16 clients, representing approximately 60% of our tracked loans, a testament to our superior offerings. As we look to sustain our leadership position, we will continue to invest in our more efficient and customer-centric single-source platform, where we've now onboarded multiple clients and have plans to onboard others in the pipeline. 
In multifamily housing, we grew our renters policies to $2.2 million, up 10%; while also growing revenue by 6%. Our focus remains on driving a superior experience for both our clients and renters. We continued the roll out integrated billing and tracking platform, which provides substantial value to renters and landlords to allow us to increase attachment rates going forward. Overall, we believe the actions we've taken within Global Housing positions the business for profitable growth in 2020 and enables us to further generate above-average returns and strong cash flows. 
In Global Preneed, we delivered $52 million in net operating income after the onetime DAC adjustment in the third quarter. During the course of the year, we continue to leverage our strong long-term partnership with SCI, an industry leader, while also growing our Final Need business with new distribution partners. This has allowed us to create a more profitable sales mix as we continue to generate strong cash flows. The unique characteristics of this business, including low mortality risk relative to other life insurance products, steadily growing earnings and strong cash flows, provides us with confidence that we can sustain operating ROE of 13% Global Preneed long term. 
To summarize, 2019 was a strong year for Assurant. We deepened our relationships with many leading brands, delivered superior value for end consumers and strengthened our bench of talent. All of this helped us generate a more diversified base of earnings, from which we expect to continue to grow. 
For full year 2010, we expect operating earnings per diluted share, excluding catastrophe losses, to increase by 10% to 14% from $9.21 in 2019. The range includes a 1% negative impact related to convertible shares being dilutive for 2020. EPS growth will be driven primarily by higher net operating income across each of our segments as well as continued share repurchases. We believe our 2020 outlook builds off a larger and more diversified mix of businesses. Overall, it gives us confidence that we can meet our financial objective of 12% annual EPS growth on average for 2020 and 2021. 
As we enter the connected decade, we believe it will create opportunities for Assurant as consumer lifestyles will increasingly intertwine with their connected ecosystems. For example, with the rollout of 5G and major enhancements to vehicle technology on the horizon, we look to address consumer needs in both the connected home and connected car. 
We believe that investing in our people, customer experience and innovation should allow us to continue to expand earnings and cash flow over the long term. To prepare, we will drive investments, both organic and through targeted acquisitions, to scale our operations, develop new offerings and launch new client programs, while strengthening our infrastructure to support future growth. 
I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review fourth quarter results and 2020 outlook in more detail. Richard?"

As Alan noted, we are pleased with our overall performance for 2019. I'm now going to review our fourth quarter results and our 2020 outlook in more detail. Excluding cats, fourth quarter 2019 net operating income",1390,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As Alan noted, we are pleased with our overall performance for 2019. 
I'm now going to review our fourth quarter results and our 2020 outlook in more detail. Excluding cats, fourth quarter 2019 net operating income declined by $5 million to $140 million, due to the absence of a client recoverable in the prior year period. In the quarter, we accelerated investments within Global Lifestyle to support future growth driven by strong business momentum. At the same time, we also took actions to transform our IT operations, which resulted in $8 million of severance. Savings are expected to fund future investments in our infrastructure and cloud capabilities. 
Now, let's move to segment results for Global Lifestyle. This segment posted earnings of $97 million, an increase of 15%, when excluding $4 million of IT severance and a $9 million client recoverable from the prior year period. Growth was driven primarily by continued mobile subscriber growth from programs in Asia Pacific and North America. This was partially offset by investments to support business growth. 
In Global Automotive, earnings declined due to higher expenses to support business growth, partially offset by growth in the national dealer and TPA distribution channels. Total revenue for this segment was up $233 million or 14%. The increase was driven by expansion within Connected Living, primarily from mobile carriers and OEMs and, to a lesser extent, extended service contracts. Within Global Automotive, revenue grew 11% primarily reflecting prior period sales of VSCs across all 3 distribution channels, while our protected vehicle count increased by 7%. 
For full year 2020, we expect Global Lifestyle's net operating income to be up modestly compared to an exceptionally strong 2019. This is in line with the expectations we've presented at Investor Day. The main driver will be growth from maturing Connected Living programs launched since 2017. As always, trading activity will be driven by the timing and success of new phone introductions and carrier promotions, which can vary from quarter-to-quarter. Throughout the year, we expect to make additional investments to support new programs and future growth. 
Our Global Automotive business is also expected to grow next year, but to a lesser degree than Connected Living. Growth will be driven by prior period sales of vehicle service contracts. Auto results will continue to be impacted by the low interest rate environment and expected declines in investment income. 
Within global Financial Services, we continue to anticipate declines in our legacy credit insurance business, which will offset growth from embedded card benefit offerings as we scale our programs in the United States. 
Moving to Global Housing. Net operating income for the quarter totaled $73 million, an increase of $85 million year-over-year largely driven by lower reportable catastrophes. Excluding catastrophe losses and a $3 million -- and $3 million of IT severance, earnings declined $8 million. This was driven by higher loss experience primarily related to a client within our sharing economy portfolio. In response, we've taken actions to improve results, including terminating certain coverages, and we are continuing to monitor experience closely. 
Lender-placed income contracted, reflecting the reduction in policies in force from the financially insolvent client we've previously disclosed. Higher premium rates and lower expenses helped to partially offset the decline. Within small commercial, policies are now in runoff and results improved during the quarter, in line with our expectations. Going forward, we expect contribution from the business to be immaterial. 
Turning to revenue. Global Housing net earned premiums and fees increased 2%, driven by our specialty property and multifamily housing businesses. Lender-placed revenues decreased, reflecting the reduction in loans referenced earlier, partially offset by higher premium rates. The placement rate within the lender-placed business decreased to 1.58%, down 5 basis points year-over-year and 3 basis points sequentially, reflecting our mix of loans. 
In January, we placed 2/3 of our 2020 catastrophe reinsurance program and expect to finalize the program in July. We secured additional multiyear coverage, with now 47% of our U.S. program benefiting from this feature. We maintained our per event retention levels at $80 million as we believe the actions we took last year, combined with growth in our non-cat exposed businesses, provide appropriate risk-return balance for 2020. As always, we will continue to re-evaluate our exposure. 
For 2020, we expect Global Housing net operating income, excluding cats, to increase for the first time after several years of decline, driven by expansion across all of our lines of business. Results should benefit from improved profitability in our specialty property offerings, including the wind-down of our small commercial business. Lender-placed growth will be partially offset by the transition of loans from the financial insolvent client over the next few quarters. Lastly, we expect continued growth in multifamily, reflecting increased penetration across our PMC and affinity partner channels. 
While still early, we're monitoring claims from the earthquakes in Puerto Rico in January and believe that they will surpass our reportable catastrophe threshold of $5 million pretax. Overall, we continue to believe that we can generate above-market operating returns on equity of 17% to 20%, including cats, through 2021. Should the economy soften, this segment has potential for additional upside. 
Now let's move to Global Preneed. The segment reported $16 million of net operating income, down slightly year-over-year due to a combination of lower real estate income and lower investment yields. Revenue for Preneed was up 6% driven by U.S. growth, including Final Need sales as we continue to add new distribution partners. In 2020, we expect Global Preneed's earnings to be up compared to 2019 reported results and relatively flat, excluding the third quarter DAC adjustment. Growth from existing distribution partners and adjacent offerings will be offset by lower portfolio yields due to the current interest rate environment. 
At Corporate, the net operating loss was $22 million, a $6 million improvement compared to the prior year period. The decrease was due to the benefit from our annual consolidating tax rate adjustment and lower employee-related expenses. For the full year 2020, we expect the corporate loss to be similar to 2019, around $85 million as we continue to benefit from scale efficiencies. Interest expense should be approximately $81 million, a modest savings from 2019, driven by our debt financing last year. Preferred dividends are expected to be approximately $19 million. 
Turning to holding company liquidity. We ended the year with $534 million or $309 million above our current minimum target level of $225 million. Dividends in the quarter from operating segments totaled $276 million. In terms of inflows, we received $27 million in upfront cash related to the sale of rights to future claims from our ACA risk corridor program receivables. In addition to our quarterly corporate and interest expenses, key outflows included $109 million in share repurchases and $43 million in common and preferred dividends. 
In 2020, we will continue to be strong stewards of our capital. For the full year, we expect segment dividends to approximate segment earnings, providing us the flexibility to invest in our businesses, organic growth and acquisitions as well as return of capital to shareholders in line with our stated objectives, subject to market conditions. We expect the pace and level of buybacks to be somewhat similar to 2019 and weighted towards the second half of the year. 
In January, we signed an agreement to sell our interest in Iké to certain management shareholders. Subject to regulatory approvals, we expect the closing to occur in the second quarter. This should result in an expected net cash outflow of approximately $54 million. This amount represents the difference between the balance owed on the put call and the agreed sale price. The amount could increase up to an additional $40 million in the event we provide seller financing at closing. 
As a result of the pending sale, we are required to further adjust the fair value at end year, which resulted in an additional charge to net income of $33 million. We believe divesting in Iké will enable us to deploy our capital and management attention toward targeted areas where we can drive greater shareholder value. 
In summary, we're pleased with our results for the fourth quarter and for the full year 2019, which provide a solid foundation to drive continued growth into 2020. 
And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

Most of what went on in 2019 was really to absorb the growth, which was extraordinary in Lifestyle in '19 and to set up for continued growth in 2020.

The 6% to -- the 10% to 14%, starting with the $9.21 from this year. I guess, if you adjust the $9.21 for some of the items this year, there's obviously some moving parts. But you can bring that up maybe, from the severance to the DAC, can you bring that up to maybe $9.50? 
And so, I just want to make sure I'm thinking about this right. If we do that, that 10% to 14% kind of looks more like a 6.5% to 10%, which sounds a lot like the last year's guidance. And I guess, does that sound right, am I thinking about that right? And then if I am, is it simply because of your guidance talks on the Lifestyle being more modest this year versus last year? Or what would cause the guidance to be, if I adjust that correctly, the guidance to be about the same as last year?"

Second, we are continuing to invest, and it's important to invest on the back of extraordinary growth year in Connected Living last year.
So you will see us continue to invest in the migration of our infrastructure to the cloud, which improves our delivery and reliability and capabilities. You'll see us continuing to invest in the next product. I mentioned briefly ID protection, but we have a whole pipeline of things that we're going to embed into our offerings in the years ahead that also creates additional future profit, but it's an investment today. 
The other thing I would say, we're growing off of a much larger base in 2020. 2019 had the benefit of a full year of really capturing The Warranty Group synergies and driving that into our business. That just -- that's good news, but creates a much larger starting point as we head into 2020. 
The final couple of things I'd say on it is, it's early in the year. We are being appropriately measured in how we think about the outlook. When we set an expectation, we fully intend to meet that expectation. And we have a strong pipeline that if that develops this year, as we've talked about in the past, if we launch another new program, another client, that will actually hurt in the short term in earnings, but is a very positive long-term development for our shareholders."

That investment was originally put in place 7 years ago in a very different Assurant.

With The Warranty Group deal, we are in a much stronger position in Latin America and international. And it just became not nearly as strategically relevant, and we are trying to focus our efforts around our true growth businesses. And so that led to the decision.

First of all, we were disappointed in the 2019 results of Housing. But I think we took actions collectively that put Housing into a much better position as we head into 2020. If you look at lender-placed homeowners, extraordinary progress last year kind of in consolidating our franchise, beginning to make real progress in converting clients to our single-source processing system, which will continue. That affects our expenses, every time we convert one, we can then reduce some expenses related to that. So that business is well positioned. And with the reductions we've taken and the retention on the hurricane exposure, we feel good about that business. 
Multifamily, although the growth was a little bit slower, it's still above market. We continue to gain share, and we have consolidated our position there by investing in digital and being able to provide a new way to acquire that product. 
And then finally, in Specialty, obviously, the real disappointments last year. But at the end of the day, we're running experiments. If they work, great, and then we scale them. If they don't, we take decisive action. And as you heard Richard say, we did that in small commercial and it's now going to be kind of immaterial in 2020."

So probably the biggest thing going on in Lifestyle is this evolving business mix, where, as we grow, what's growing disproportionately are fee income and services.

But it's because we're creating new fee income streams that are diversifying our earnings that don't have exposure or volatility really in those earnings. I think that's a big positive. 
If you look at investments, hard to say exactly how investments this year will compare to last year. A lot will depend on whether we're able to sign some new clients because a big part of our investment is when we sign a new client, we have to ramp up the people, the technology, the marketing, their filings, et cetera. But we're going to continue to invest. This is a business that has a history now for many years of strong double-digit growth on average, and we see that continuing into the future.

We are pleased with our operating results for both the fourth quarter and full year 2019 as they illustrate our ongoing ability to deliver superior value for our customers, employees and shareholders. For the f",1342,"Thanks, Francesca. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our operating results for both the fourth quarter and full year 2019 as they illustrate our ongoing ability to deliver superior value for our customers, employees and shareholders. 
For the full year, net operating income, excluding reportable catastrophes, increased 11%; while earnings per share grew 6%, reflecting the shares issued for the Warranty Group acquisition. After adjusting for certain nonrecurring items, which Richard will detail later, net operating income increased 15%; and earnings per share grew 10%, at the high end of our expectations. These results primarily reflected the stronger-than-expected performance of our mobile business and full year contributions from the Warranty Group. 
Overall, we continue to evolve our mix of business with about 3/4 of our segment earnings now coming from noncatastrophe exposed businesses, driven by strong growth in Connected Living. We believe this allows us to generate more diversified earnings and cash flow. 
In 2019, our operating segments contributed a total of $748 million in dividends to the holding company. This allowed us to raise our common stock dividend for the 15th consecutive year since our IPO and returned $426 million to our shareholders. This positions us to deliver on our Investor Day objective to return a total of $1.35 billion to shareholders by the end of 2021. 
We delivered strong earnings and cash flows, while also taking actions to strengthen Assurant for the future. We added or renewed more than 60 valuable client partnerships across our Lifestyle and Housing segments and launched several new product offerings to drive even greater value for our customers. 
Our targeted investments in emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and other capabilities, will ensure that we continue to deliver a superior experience for the 300 million consumers we serve worldwide. These investments also were made possible by the $100 million in gross expense saves we've now realized since 2016. Our performance wouldn't be possible without the unwavering dedication of our 14,000 employees across the world. They continue to serve not only our customers, but their local communities as well. 
With our Assurant Foundation during 2019, we provided support to nearly 1,300 charities, focused on helping our local communities grow stronger. Most recently, this included relief for the Australian wildfires and the earthquakes in Puerto Rico. 
In March, we will publish our next Assurant Social Responsibility Report to share our progress on multiple environmental, social and governance priorities, which we believe are key to the execution of our strategy. 
Now let me provide additional highlights from the year for each of our business segments. Within Global Lifestyle, 2019 was a record year as we increased earnings 37% to $409 million. Connected Living was the major contributor as the segment benefited from several long-standing partnerships and the market success of 10 new mobile programs added since 2017. As of year-end, we now protect over 53 million mobile subscribers, an increase of 15% year-over-year. 
Importantly, we cemented several key partnerships, including securing a long-term extension of a major client relationship in Japan, where we've increased the number of covered devices by over 50% just in the last year. 
Key to our success has been our ability to drive additional value for customers by expanding our fee-for-service offerings beyond traditional device protection to include value-added offerings like Personal TechPro and Pocket Geek. These platforms allow customers to help solve technical issues, optimize the performance of their devices and connect to live technical assistance, all of which delivers a better experience as tracked through our strong Net Promoter Scores. In the year ahead, we will look to further expand our services to include new offerings such as ID protection. 
In Global Automotive, we protect over 47 million vehicles worldwide, up by almost 3 million since 2018. This growth is the result of the strength of our relationships with global OEMs, national dealers and TPAs and the scale and expertise we acquired with the Warranty Group. 
In 2019, TWG contributed an estimated $130 million to Global Lifestyle's earnings after accounting for intangibles and synergies. As we announced in the second quarter, we've delivered operating synergies beyond our initial goal of $60 million pretax since the close of the acquisition. While 2020 earnings growth is expected to moderate from a record 2019, it supports our view that we can grow net operating income by at least 10% on average from 2019 through 2021 and continue to produce strong cash flows in Global Lifestyle. 
Moving to Global Housing, we generated operating return on equity, including cats, of almost 17%, which we believe continues to surpass the P&C industry average. We benefited from a relative mild cat year and continued growth within our multifamily housing business. While we incurred higher losses within our specialty housing portfolio, we have taken actions to limit our go-forward exposure and improved results this year. 
Within our lender-placed business, we renewed 16 clients, representing approximately 60% of our tracked loans, a testament to our superior offerings. As we look to sustain our leadership position, we will continue to invest in our more efficient and customer-centric single-source platform, where we've now onboarded multiple clients and have plans to onboard others in the pipeline. 
In multifamily housing, we grew our renters policies to $2.2 million, up 10%; while also growing revenue by 6%. Our focus remains on driving a superior experience for both our clients and renters. We continued the rollout integrated billing and tracking platform, which provides substantial value to renters and landlords to allow us to increase attachment rates going forward. Overall, we believe the actions we've taken within Global Housing positions the business for profitable growth in 2020 and enables us to further generate above-average returns and strong cash flows. 
In Global Preneed, we delivered $52 million in net operating income after the onetime DAC adjustment in the third quarter. During the course of the year, we continue to leverage our strong long-term partnership with SCI, an industry leader, while also growing our Final Need business with new distribution partners. This has allowed us to create a more profitable sales mix as we continue to generate strong cash flows. The unique characteristics of this business, including low mortality risk relative to other life insurance products, steadily growing earnings and strong cash flows, provides us with confidence that we can sustain operating ROE of 13% Global Preneed long term. 
To summarize, 2019 was a strong year for Assurant. We deepened our relationships with many leading brands, delivered superior value for end consumers and strengthened our bench of talent. All of this helped us generate a more diversified base of earnings, from which we expect to continue to grow. 
For full year 2010, we expect operating earnings per diluted share, excluding catastrophe losses, to increase by 10% to 14% from $9.21 in 2019. The range includes a 1% negative impact related to convertible shares being dilutive for 2020. EPS growth will be driven primarily by higher net operating income across each of our segments as well as continued share repurchases. We believe our 2020 outlook builds off a larger and more diversified mix of businesses. Overall, it gives us confidence that we can meet our financial objective of 12% annual EPS growth on average for 2020 and 2021. 
As we enter the connected decade, we believe it will create opportunities for Assurant as consumer lifestyles will increasingly intertwine with their connected ecosystems. For example, with the rollout of 5G and major enhancements to vehicle technology on the horizon, we look to address consumer needs in both the connected home and connected car. 
We believe that investing in our people, customer experience and innovation should allow us to continue to expand earnings and cash flow over the long term. To prepare, we will drive investments, both organic and through targeted acquisitions, to scale our operations, develop new offerings and launch new client programs, while strengthening our infrastructure to support future growth. 
I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review fourth quarter results and 2020 outlook in more detail. Richard?"

As Alan noted, we are pleased with our overall performance for 2019. I'm now going to review our fourth quarter results and our 2020 outlook in more detail. Excluding cats, fourth quarter 2019 net operating income",1390,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As Alan noted, we are pleased with our overall performance for 2019. 
I'm now going to review our fourth quarter results and our 2020 outlook in more detail. Excluding cats, fourth quarter 2019 net operating income declined by $5 million to $140 million due to the absence of a client recoverable in the prior year period. In the quarter, we accelerated investments within Global Lifestyle to support future growth driven by strong business momentum. At the same time, we also took actions to transform our IT operations, which resulted in $8 million of severance. Savings are expected to fund future investments in our infrastructure and cloud capabilities. 
Now, let's move to segment results for Global Lifestyle. This segment posted earnings of $97 million, an increase of 15%, when excluding $4 million of IT severance and a $9 million client recoverable from the prior year period. Growth was driven primarily by continued mobile subscriber growth from programs in Asia Pacific and North America. This was partially offset by investments to support business growth. 
In Global Automotive, earnings declined due to higher expenses to support business growth, partially offset by growth in the national dealer and TPA distribution channels. Total revenue for this segment was up $233 million or 14%. The increase was driven by expansion within Connected Living primarily from mobile carriers and OEMs and, to a lesser extent, extended service contracts. Within Global Automotive, revenue grew 11% primarily reflecting prior period sales of VSCs across all 3 distribution channels, while our protected vehicle count increased by 7%. 
For full year 2020, we expect Global Lifestyle's net operating income to be up modestly compared to an exceptionally strong 2019. This is in line with the expectations we've presented at Investor Day. The main driver will be growth from maturing Connected Living programs launched since 2017. As always, trading activity will be driven by the timing and success of new phone introductions and carrier promotions, which can vary from quarter-to-quarter. Throughout the year, we expect to make additional investments to support new programs and future growth. 
Our Global Automotive business is also expected to grow next year, but to a lesser degree than Connected Living. Growth will be driven by prior period sales of vehicle service contracts. Auto results will continue to be impacted by the low interest rate environment and expected declines in investment income. 
Within global Financial Services, we continue to anticipate declines in our legacy credit insurance business, which will offset growth from embedded card benefit offerings as we scale our programs in the United States. 
Moving to Global Housing. Net operating income for the quarter totaled $73 million, an increase of $85 million year-over-year largely driven by lower reportable catastrophes. Excluding catastrophe losses and a $3 million -- and $3 million of IT severance, earnings declined $8 million. This was driven by higher loss experience primarily related to a client within our sharing economy portfolio. In response, we've taken actions to improve results, including terminating certain coverages, and we are continuing to monitor experience closely. 
Lender-placed income contracted, reflecting the reduction in policies in force from the financially insolvent client we've previously disclosed. Higher premium rates and lower expenses helped to partially offset the decline. Within small commercial, policies are now in runoff and results improved during the quarter, in line with our expectations. Going forward, we expect contribution from the business to be immaterial. 
Turning to revenue. Global Housing net earned premiums and fees increased 2%, driven by our specialty property and multifamily housing businesses. Lender-placed revenues decreased, reflecting the reduction in loans referenced earlier, partially offset by higher premium rates. The placement rate within the lender-placed business decreased to 1.58%, down 5 basis points year-over-year and 3 basis points sequentially, reflecting our mix of loans. 
In January, we placed 2/3 of our 2020 catastrophe reinsurance program and expect to finalize the program in July. We secured additional multiyear coverage, with now 47% of our U.S. program benefiting from this feature. We maintained our per event retention levels at $80 million as we believe the actions we took last year, combined with growth in our noncat exposed businesses, provide appropriate risk-return balance for 2020. As always, we will continue to re-evaluate our exposure. 
For 2020, we expect Global Housing net operating income, excluding cats, to increase for the first time after several years of decline, driven by expansion across all of our lines of business. Results should benefit from improved profitability in our specialty property offerings, including the wind-down of our small commercial business. Lender-placed growth will be partially offset by the transition of loans from the financial insolvent client over the next few quarters. Lastly, we expect continued growth in multifamily, reflecting increased penetration across our PMC and affinity partner channels. 
While still early, we're monitoring claims from the earthquakes in Puerto Rico in January and believe that they will surpass our reportable catastrophe threshold of $5 million pretax. Overall, we continue to believe that we can generate above-market operating returns on equity of 17% to 20%, including cats, through 2021. Should the economy soften, this segment has potential for additional upside. 
Now let's move to Global Preneed. The segment reported $16 million of net operating income, down slightly year-over-year due to a combination of lower real estate income and lower investment yields. Revenue for Preneed was up 6% driven by U.S. growth, including Final Need sales as we continue to add new distribution partners. In 2020, we expect Global Preneed's earnings to be up compared to 2019 reported results and relatively flat, excluding the third quarter DAC adjustment. Growth from existing distribution partners and adjacent offerings will be offset by lower portfolio yields due to the current interest rate environment. 
At Corporate, the net operating loss was $22 million, a $6 million improvement compared to the prior year period. The decrease was due to the benefit from our annual consolidating tax rate adjustment and lower employee-related expenses. For the full year 2020, we expect the corporate loss to be similar to 2019, around $85 million as we continue to benefit from scale efficiencies. Interest expense should be approximately $81 million, a modest savings from 2019, driven by our debt financing last year. Preferred dividends are expected to be approximately $19 million. 
Turning to holding company liquidity. We ended the year with $534 million or $309 million above our current minimum target level of $225 million. Dividends in the quarter from operating segments totaled $276 million. In terms of inflows, we received $27 million in upfront cash related to the sale of rights to future claims from our ACA risk corridor program receivables. In addition to our quarterly corporate and interest expenses, key outflows included $109 million in share repurchases and $43 million in common and preferred dividends. 
In 2020, we will continue to be strong stewards of our capital. For the full year, we expect segment dividends to approximate segment earnings, providing us the flexibility to invest in our businesses, organic growth and acquisitions as well as return of capital to shareholders in line with our stated objectives, subject to market conditions. We expect the pace and level of buybacks to be somewhat similar to 2019 and weighted towards the second half of the year. 
In January, we signed an agreement to sell our interest in Iké to certain management shareholders. Subject to regulatory approvals, we expect the closing to occur in the second quarter. This should result in an expected net cash outflow of approximately $54 million. This amount represents the difference between the balance owed on the put call and the agreed sale price. The amount could increase up to an additional $40 million in the event we provide seller financing at closing. 
As a result of the pending sale, we are required to further adjust the fair value at end year, which resulted in an additional charge to net income of $33 million. We believe divesting in Iké will enable us to deploy our capital and management attention toward targeted areas where we can drive greater shareholder value. 
In summary, we're pleased with our results for the fourth quarter and for the full year 2019, which provide a solid foundation to drive continued growth into 2020. 
And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

And so part of what you're seeing there is just that mix shift and that's going to continue. We're going to continue to add the additional services. 
Most of what went on in 2019 was really to absorb the growth, which was extraordinary in Lifestyle in '19 and to set up for continued growth in 2020. You also have the onetime IT severance that ran through Q4, which is also about setting up and helping fund the transition we need to continue to make to cloud, to digital, to even strengthening further our customer experience.

But you can bring that up maybe, from the severance to the DAC, can you bring that up to maybe $9.50? 
And so I just want to make sure I'm thinking about this right. If we do that that 10% to 14% kind of looks more like a 6.5% to 10%, which sounds a lot like the last year's guidance. And I guess does that sound right, am I thinking about that right? And then if I am, is it simply because of your guidance talks on the Lifestyle being more modest this year versus last year? Or what would cause the guidance to be, if I adjust that correctly, the guidance to be about the same as last year?"

Second, we are continuing to invest, and it's important to invest on the back of extraordinary growth year in Connected Living last year.
So you will see us continue to invest in the migration of our infrastructure to the cloud, which improves our delivery and reliability and capabilities. You'll see us continuing to invest in the next product. I mentioned briefly ID protection, but we have a whole pipeline of things that we're going to embed into our offerings in the years ahead that also creates additional future profit, but it's an investment today. 
The other thing I would say, we're growing off of a much larger base in 2020. 2019 had the benefit of a full year of really capturing The Warranty Group synergies and driving that into our business. That just -- that's good news, but creates a much larger starting point as we head into 2020. 
The final couple of things I'd say on it is, it's early in the year. We are being appropriately measured in how we think about the outlook. When we set an expectation, we fully intend to meet that expectation. And we have a strong pipeline that if that develops this year, as we've talked about in the past, if we launch another new program, another client, that will actually hurt in the short term in earnings, but is a very positive long-term development for our shareholders."

With The Warranty Group deal, we are in a much stronger position in Latin America and international. And it just became not nearly as strategically relevant, and we are trying to focus our efforts around our true growth businesses. And so that led to the decision.

First of all, we were disappointed in the 2019 results of Housing. But I think we took actions collectively that put Housing into a much better position as we head into 2020. If you look at lender-placed homeowners, extraordinary progress last year kind of in consolidating our franchise, beginning to make real progress in converting clients to our single-source processing system, which will continue. That affects our expenses, every time we convert one, we can then reduce some expenses related to that. So that business is well positioned. And with the reductions we've taken and the retention on the hurricane exposure, we feel good about that business. 
Multifamily, although the growth was a little bit slower, it's still above market. We continue to gain share, and we have consolidated our position there by investing in digital and being able to provide a new way to acquire that product. 
And then finally, in Specialty, obviously, the real disappointments last year. But at the end of the day, we're running experiments. If they work, great, and then we scale them. If they don't, we take decisive action. And as you heard Richard say, we did that in small commercial and it's now going to be kind of immaterial in 2020."

But it's because we're creating new fee income streams that are diversifying our earnings that don't have exposure or volatility really in those earnings. I think that's a big positive. 
If you look at investments, hard to say exactly how investments this year will compare to last year. A lot will depend on whether we're able to sign some new clients because a big part of our investment is when we sign a new client, we have to ramp up the people, the technology, the marketing, their filings, et cetera. But we're going to continue to invest. This is a business that has a history now for many years of strong double-digit growth on average, and we see that continuing into the future.

Before reviewing our results for the quarter, I wanted to share a few comments regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and our ongoing response. From the beginning, Assurance leadership team acted swiftly and deliberately, led by our guiding principles to safeguard our employees and their families, to maintain operations and service level for our customers and to support our local communities.
Early in this crisis, we implemented a global ban on business travel and transitioned the vast majority of our workforce to work from home to help stem the spread of the virus in our communities and to protect our employees. For those employees who need to work from our offices or repair sites due to the essential nature of their roles, we've implemented strong safety and hygiene protocols. These measures include social distancing and the use of personal protective equipment, along with regular cleaning and disinfection of our locations based on the guidelines from the centers for disease control.
We are committed to doing what we can to protect our employees through this period of uncertainty, always treating them with respect and providing appropriate support given the challenges we are all dealing with at this time.
To allay job security concerns as well as to continue to deliver for our customers, we've made commitments to our employees to not eliminate any roles due to COVID-19 in the short term. We've also offered financial support where it's most needed. As part of our Assurant CARES employee support or ASIS Fund, we've launched a special COVID-19 emergency relief program to support eligible employees who are experiencing severe financial hardship caused by the pandemic We've already raised more than $1 million through the support of our foundation and personal donations from our management committee, the Assurant Board of Directors and the generosity of hundreds of employees.
Since its inception in late March, the special ASIS Fund has helped more than 800 families managed through these turbulent times.
Furthermore, our Assurant foundation is honoring all of its 2020 charitable commitments and has placed an additional $250,000 to aid core charitable partners that are providing food and emergency support in the communities where we operate.
I'm exceptionally proud of how our employees have supported not only each other and our communities, but also our customers. We've been able to maintain continuous service for our clients and provide essential support for our customers, like ensuring that their homes remain protected and helping them stay connected through their mobile devices at a time when we are all socially distancing. I want to thank our more than 14,000 employees for supporting each other, our customers and our communities throughout this extraordinary time. You have truly made us Assurant proud.
Now let's move to our first quarter results, which were strong and largely unaffected by COVID-19. We benefited from continued growth in global lifestyle as well as improved results in global housing. For Assurant overall, we reported net operating earnings per share, excluding catastrophes of $2.84, an increase of 22% from the same period last year. Net operating income, excluding catastrophes, was up 18% to $176 million.
In the quarter, we incurred about $2 million of incremental expenses directly related to COVID-19, which were reflected in net income. These expenses include, among other things, cost for the standardization of our facilities and the purchase of personal protective equipment and technology to enable work from home.
Throughout this period, our balance sheet remained strong. At the end of March, we had $433 million of holding company liquidity after returning $95 million to shareholders through dividends and buybacks during the quarter. Provide us with an additional buffer during this crisis, we drew down $200 million from our revolving credit facility in late March, solely as a precautionary measure. We do not expect to use these funds.
We are pleased with our first quarter results, which reflect strong momentum across our business, pre crisis. However, we recognize that they may not be indicative of our performance in the coming quarters as the world continues to grapple with the impact of COVID-19. We have run multiple scenarios, looking at the potential duration and severity of this crisis to better understand how our business might perform and to ensure we have the agility to react appropriately. Although we believe the long-term fundamentals and resilience of our business remains strong, we are suspending our 2020 financial outlook until we gain additional clarity on COVID-19's duration and its impact on the broader economy and our business. We believe this is a prudent and sensible action given the current uncertainty.
Relative to capital deployment, we want to retain maximum flexibility. Over the next few months, we will exercise caution in light of market volatility and as we enter hurricane season. This will include an ongoing evaluation of share buybacks with an expectation that we will slow down. This applies to new M&A evaluations as well. We plan to provide an update on our 2020 view and our long-term targets, once we have more clarity of the economic landscape we're facing. We still believe that we can continue to deliver shareholder value through above-market growth and disciplined capital management.
This confidence is grounded in the strength of our business portfolio. Our installed customer base across connected living, global automotive, multifamily housing and preneed and our countercyclical lender place business position us well to weather a prolonged crisis. Near term, however, we expect a greater impact to our business as a result of the ongoing market volatility and containment measures and how those could further impact consumer behavior. As an example, in late March and throughout April, we saw a reduction in new sales across multifamily housing, auto and preneed. Within mobile, we experienced lower trading activity and slower sales growth. We are taking actions to mitigate potential impacts. For instance, we've deferred some discretionary spending and delayed staffing of certain open roles in our support areas. While we're deferring some investments as a precautionary measure, we have continued to make progress against key strategic initiatives to support our clients and their customers during this crisis and beyond. These have included, among other things, continued enhancement of our self-service capabilities and our dynamic claims fulfillment to facilitate faster claims resolution as well as our ongoing IT transformation.
Before turning to Richard, let me provide additional highlights from the quarter for each of our business segments. Within Global lifestyle, we were pleased to see earnings increase by 20% year-over-year. Our growth has been driven by continued additions of new mobile subscribers, up 15% year-over-year. We believe that our ability to offer bundled value-added services to our installed base of more than 54 million subscribers provides a recurring revenue stream, even during an extended period of financial uncertainty. While we may add fewer new subscribers during this crisis, we still expect our count to grow. This should help mitigate impacts from expected lower trade-in volumes.
Another driver of our success within global lifestyle has been our ability to expand partnerships with market leaders and new entrants. For example, this quarter, we enhanced our existing relationship with Rakuten Mobile by launching a new trade-in program in Japan. In addition to offering device protection for their mobile networks, the program provides a completely digital trading experience.
Turning to Global Automotive, we believe the business is relatively well insulated from near-term economic shocks given its significant level of embedded earnings. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $8.2 billion of unearned premium related to this business, which we will earn over the next 3 to 7 years. Furthermore, approximately 50% of our business comes from service contracts on used car sales, which tend to be less impact as a results of the economic downturns as we saw during the last recession.
As such, we remain positive on auto and have continued to look for select opportunities to further scale the business. Last week, we closed on the acquisition of our long time partner, American Financial and Automotive services, or AFAS, for $158 million. This represents an attractive valuation relative to recent transactions in the space and complements our 2018 acquisition of the Warranty group.
AFAS is a provider of finance and insurance products and services, including vehicle service contracts and other ancillary offerings with nearly a 40-year history. AFAS products and services are sold directly through a network of nearly 600 franchise dealerships with a deep footprint in Texas and the Southwest. For 2020, we don't expect the acquisition to be a significant contributor to our results. However, in 2021 and beyond, we expect it to further enhance our market position and add scale with the expectation to deliver additional profitable growth over time.
Moving to Global housing. Our lender-placed franchise continues to be an integral part of our specialty risk offerings. During the quarter, we renewed another one of our largest lender-placed clients for an additional 4 years. Since the beginning of last year, we've now renewed 17 clients, representing more than 80% of our tracked loans. Our superior customer platform has been a differentiator and will serve us well through economic cycles to support our clients and policyholders. In multifamily housing, we now support almost 2.3 million renters across all 50 states.
While the business tends to be more resilient during economic downturns as consumers prefer to rent versus buy, beginning in mid-March, we saw a decline in new policies as renters are delaying their moving plans due to the pandemic. During the last few weeks, we've seen some tentative signs of stabilization, especially in our Affinity channel as tenants may be regaining comfort with moving. We remain cautious, however, as we enter the summer, when we typically see greater activity and sales growth. We will continue to monitor sales, persistency and claim trends while also doing what we can to support current policyholders who are experiencing financial hardship during this challenging time. This includes differing premium where appropriate. 
Moving to Global Preneed, results in the first quarter were largely in line with our expectations. This business benefits from lower mortality risk than traditional life insurance products and act as more of a spread business. In light of the current low interest rate environment, we've worked with our partners to make changes to their product as well as help our clients complete the sales process virtually. We will continue to evaluate other actions as appropriate.
With regards to mortality, experience has been largely consistent with our experience last year. We attribute this to our policy footprint, including the fact that we do not write in New York.
In summary, despite this uncertainty, we believe our business is resilient and that Assurant will weather this period and emerge strong.
I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review first quarter results and recent trends in detail. Richard?"
4026111,663837277,1973077,"Assurant, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 06, 2020",2020-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with global lifestyle.

Let's start with global lifestyle. The segment reported earnings of $121 million in the first quarter, $6.7 million client recoverable in connected living, earnings grew 14%, primarily from continued mobile growth in both new and existing programs. Global automotive was also a contributor, largely due to $5 million of onetime income related to client recontracting, along with modest growth from prior period sales.
Global lifestyle results were partially offset by lower margins for mobile trade in activity, including some impacts related to COVID-19 from the shutdown of Asian markets earlier in the quarter. Unfavorable foreign exchange also impacted results.
Looking at total revenue, net earned premiums and fees were up $265 million or 16%. The increase was driven primarily by higher fee income for mobile trade-in volumes and subscriber growth across North America and Asia Pacific. Expansion within extended service contracts also contributed to growth in the quarter.
Within global automotive, revenue grew 9%, primarily reflecting prior period sales of vehicle service contracts across all distribution channels. Looking ahead, as Alan mentioned, we are continuing to monitor trends and the impact of COVID-19 across the segment. While we believe mobile is well positioned given our large in-force subscriber base, trade-in volumes did decline significantly in the first few weeks of April, reflecting store closures and lower consumer demand for new devices. We expect volumes to rebound when stores reopen and carriers are able to resume in-store promotional activity, although timing of such widespread recovery remains unclear [indiscernible] 
Looking at our underwriting experience, we have seen a decline in mobile claims as a result of customers staying indoors. In most cases, this favorable experience will not benefit our bottom line due to profit sharing or reinsurance agreements. In Global Automotive, near-term earnings should be relatively well protected from a slowdown due to how the business earns. However, we still have exposure related to reductions in vehicle service contract sales, which in April were down by roughly 40% year-over-year due to a decrease in vehicle sales. In general, new car sales typically earn a majority of income 3 to 5 years after being sold following the expiration of the manufacturers' warranties, thereby delaying the revenue impact. However, in the event of a prolonged downturn, we would expect to see an uptick in used car sales, which are more quickly.
The persistently low interest rate environment also creates some headwind. While Global Automotive does have a longer duration portfolio of 3 to 7 years, we do expect investment income to be pressured from lower investment yields coming from new business. Throughout global lifestyle, we also expect continued pressure from foreign exchange volatility, especially in Latin America, due to the economic environment. So while we expect global lifestyle to be impacted in 2020, this segment should be more resilient during an economic downturn relative to other consumer-type businesses.
Moving to Global Housing. Net operating income for the quarter totaled $74 million, up slightly year-over-year despite higher reportable catastrophes from the Puerto Rico earthquakes. Excluding catastrophe losses, earnings increased $6 million. This was driven by favorable non-catastrophe loss experience and improved results with property offerings, largely related to the absence of losses within small commercial as it continues to run off.
Lender-placed income increased, reflecting higher premium rates, partially offset by a reduction of policies in-force, including the loss of loans from the financially insolvent client we previously disclosed. That portfolio has now completely deboarded.
Turning to revenue. Global housing net earned premiums and fees were flat as growth in our special property and multifamily businesses was offset by the reduction in policies referenced earlier. The insolvent client portfolio also contributed to a 7 basis point year-over-year decline in the placement rate.
As we continue to operate in this environment, we are tracking a few trends in global housing. In multifamily housing, we see a decline in new sales starting in mid-March. We continue to monitor sales, policy cancellations as well as the impact from premium deferrals, which today are primarily related to policyholders requesting premium leniency. While we initially saw a dip in claims, we are seeing activity normalize reflecting the fact that policyholders are at home.
Within lender place, we will continue to monitor the state of the overall housing market, including the potential impact of the current mortgage moratorium which would delay placement of new policies, but at the same time, reduce lapsation. This business provides critical coverage to both homeowners and their lenders, and provides downside protection should the economy deteriorate significantly. However, we would not anticipate any benefit to our placement rate this year.
Lastly, our small commercial business continues to run off as expected, with only 8% of the original block of policies remaining. With regard to potential exposure on business interruption coverage associated with this business, we currently leave our risk is low given virus exclusions included in our policies. We will continue to track state actions and their implications.
In summary, while we remain cautious on multifamily housing, in light of the current uncertainty created by COVID-19, we continue to believe that global housing is well positioned to weather a prolonged economic downturn.
Now let's move to Global Preneed. The segment reported $12 million of net operating income, up slightly year-over-year, driven by continued growth within the business. Revenue for Preneed was up 9% driven by U.S. growth, including final need sales. As we look ahead, we expect some pressure from lower yields on new sales through the current interest rate environment. However, given the 10-year average duration of our investment portfolio, our existing block of business should not be significantly impacted for some years to come.
As Alan mentioned, so far, we haven't seen any significant spikes in mortality due to COVID-19. As a reminder, a large portion of our policies are concentrated in California, Texas, South Carolina and Tennessee. So far, these states have experienced lower mortality from COVID-19 compared to states in the Northeast.
At Corporate, the net operating loss was $20 million versus $19 million in the prior year period. This was due to lower investment income in the corporate segment, partially offset by lower employee-related expenses, including travel. We will continue to evaluate additional expense actions as necessary.
In light of market volatility, I also wanted to provide an overview of our investment portfolio and strategy. In the first quarter, we recorded a $76 million mark-to-market loss in our investment portfolio. This reflects the decline in valuations of our equity securities and our CLOs, each contributing to about half of the total loss. Despite these losses, we believe that our $13.6 billion investment portfolio is well diversified and high quality. Approximately 86% of our investments are comprised of fixed maturities and 95% of these securities are investment-grade rating.
While interest rates are expected to remain relatively low for the foreseeable future, we believe we are well positioned to navigate this environment, given the duration of our existing investment portfolio, along with our conservative low asset turnover approach. Our overall exposure to these sectors that have been hit the hardest by the current market turbulence is not significant. Investments in travel and leisure represent less than 0.5% of our investment portfolio. Energy makes up only 4% of our portfolio and our investments tend to be in larger and more diversified energy companies. Retail represents 2% of our portfolio and is comprised of mostly large diversified household names. Our Auto and Airline exposures are each 1% or less of our portfolio.
I would finish on the investment portfolio by saying we will continue to apply consistent investment approach. While we recognize every crisis is different, this is the same strategy that served us well during the financial crisis over a decade ago.
Finally, I'd like to mention that in April, we completed the outsourcing of the management of our core investment portfolio the Goldman Sachs Asset Management and Voya Investment Management. We believe that their investment expertise and scaled platforms, coupled with ongoing oversight of our in-house team should serve us well going forward.
Turning to the holding company liquidity, we ended March with $433 million or $208 million above our current minimum target level. These figures not include the $200 million draw from our $450 million revolving credit facility, the proceeds of which are also held at the holding company. In the first quarter, dividends from our operating segments totaled $127 million.
In addition to our quarterly corporate and interest expenses, key outflows in the first quarter included $57 million in share repurchases and $43 million in common and preferred stock dividends.
As Alan mentioned, relative to capital deployment, we will exercise even greater caution in light of market volatility and as we enter hurricane season. We have a robust risk management program, including stress testing our capital, cash flows and liquidity under a variety of scenarios considering this uncertain environment.
Before wrapping up, I wanted to address 2 additional points. First, as you saw in our release, we booked a onetime tax benefit to net income amounting to $79 million. This was related to the enactment of the Federal CARES Act in March. The benefit is associated with the carryback of losses in 2018 to 5 years prior. This allowed us to accelerate deferred tax assets, which would have been recognized over the next 3 years at a lower tax rate.
Second, we still expect to close on the sale of EK in the second quarter as planned, which will result in a net cash outflow of approximately $54 million plus seller financing of up to $40 million. Both the EK and AFAS transactions will be reflected in second quarter holding company capital.
In conclusion, I echo Alan's gratitude to our employees and how they have responded during this unprecedented crisis. 
[Audio Gap] 
confident that we will emerge in a position staying our financial strength for the long term.

If you think about mobile, one of the things we've seen over the last few years is that Q1 tends to be a pretty active quarter. And we saw that again in Q1 prior to the slowdown that began the second half of March. So normally, Q2 is a slower quarter anyway in terms of buyback and trade in activity, and that often rolls into Q3 as a slower quarter. Just as people are waiting to see what the new phones might be. So I think, certainly, in the second and third quarters, we'll have less activity anyway, even if we start to see a recovery. And while we're on mobile, maybe just a couple of other thoughts about what we're seeing in that important line of business. You heard us in the prepared remarks, talk about we've seen new sales slow down as stores are closed, largely across the U.S. and in other markets around the world. Even with that, we do expect subscriber growth. As we've talked about previously, we have these programs that have been launched in the last year or 2 that are going to continue to ramp. So even in a slower sales environment, we expect some growth in new subscribers, that will help offset the slowdown that we see in buyback and trade-in.
And then longer term, once we're through this crisis, it really -- whether we have a big bounce back a buyback trade in or whether it's just a return to normal it's going to depend a lot on what new phones come to market, what carriers elect to do. So again, we feel well positioned in mobile even as we go through this crisis. But Richard, what would you add?"

Now again, those moves may just be delayed and it could return if we get through the crisis in a reasonable time period.
The other thing that's unique on multifamily is we are seeing some requests for premium deferral. And that's either being driven a few states have mandated that others were voluntarily providing it. It's not significant so far to our overall block, but it is something we're watching, and we are putting up an appropriate reserve in the event of people not being able to pay for their insurance that we're providing.

First of all, lender-placed, it's an important product for the mortgage industry. We're effectively there to support the functioning of the market to protect policyholders and lenders. But in the short term, we don't really see a lot changing. If you look at the mortgage forbearance that's underway, it's not going to have a big impact on us one way or the other. And so really, if we do get into a downturn, our product tends to be placed later in that cycle. So someone needs to move into seriously delinquent and often into -- So if you look at the last downturn, which is really the data point we have, which was an extreme housing market downturn. Today, we're at about 1.5%, 1.6% placement rate. In the last downturn, we peaked at about just under 3%. So that gives you some sense of at least what happened in the last downturn. Who knows if we'll have a downturn here, and I certainly hope we don't. But if we do, our business is strong. It's well positioned, and we've made significant advancements in the last 5 years on our compliance, our tracking infrastructure.

So the new subscribers are the biggest driver of that business over the last couple of years, and they're really coming from the new clients and programs that we've talked about that have been launched in the last couple of years. So for example, KDDI in Japan, Comcast and Charter in the U.S., et cetera. And those programs, once we launch them, it generally takes anywhere between 3 to 4 years. You need to go through a phone handset replacement cycle. So even if there are fewer sales now in the crisis, sales are still happening to a degree. So that's why they're going to grow.
Buyback trade in was a big driver of our business back in like '15 and '16, and when we really ramped it up. Over the last few years, it's been more stable. We haven't -- in key markets like the U.S. and Japan, you've seen the ownership of handsets lengthening. So people have gone to owning a handset for 3 years or in Japan 4 years. That's offset the growth we've had in subscribers. So that business has been more kind of flattish over the last couple of years. Now if we look forward, we see a significant wave of buyback trading coming. It may be delayed a little bit by the current crisis. But if you think about 5G, when that really starts to roll out, and it was going to start to roll out later this year in the U.S. We'll see how widely that really happens. That will create a wave of activity for the next year or 2 in buyback trade-in, and we're well positioned.
The other important thing in mobile that's really driven our growth is we've been adding more services per subscriber. So if you recall, when in the early days, we have 1 service. Now often, we have up to 6 different sources of value with every agreement where we're providing things like Premium Tech support, our onboard diagnostic technology and Pocket Geek. We're doing the buyback trade-in. And increasingly, we're doing an extended warranty for year-3 and year-4 of phone ownership. So overall, again, I think we're encouraged by our position. We expect to have continued growth that just may not be at the same level this year as we've seen in past years."

So that's important.
Where might we see trends? I think it's too early to say. What we've seen is for most things consumers are just being cautious about going out and buying anything at the moment, either the stores are closed or they don't feel safe going out. We saw the low so far in this crisis, the first week or 2 of April, with activity levels dropping 40% or 50% across a lot of the channels we serve.

We've got the embedded earnings on the balance sheet in Auto and Preneed. We do have things like if we do end up with an economic downturn out as crisis, Auto, for example, generally, you have more used car sales in that environment. And if we sell in a used car, we start to earn much sooner than we do on a new car. And we've got that strong balance sheet and conservative investment philosophy that Richard talked about.

Before reviewing our results for the quarter, I wanted to share a few comments regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and our ongoing response. From the beginning, Assurant's leadership team acted swiftly and deliberately led by our guiding principles, to safeguard our employees and their families, to maintain operations and service level for our customers and to support our local communities. 
Early in this crisis, we implemented a global ban on business travel and transitioned the vast majority of our workforce to work-from-home to help stem the spread of the virus in our communities and to protect our employees. For those employees who need to work from our offices or repair sites due to the essential nature of their roles, we've implemented strong safety and hygiene protocols. These measures include social distancing and the use of personal protective equipment, along with regular cleaning and disinfection of our locations based on the guidelines from The Centers for Disease Control. 
We are committed to doing what we can to protect our employees through this period of uncertainty, always treating them with respect and providing appropriate support given the challenges we are all dealing with at this time. To allay job security concerns as well as to continue to deliver for our customers, we've made commitments to our employees to not eliminate any roles due to COVID-19 in the short term. 
We've also offered financial support where it's most needed. As part of our Assurant Cares Employee Support or ACES Fund, we've launched a special COVID-19 Emergency Relief program to support eligible employees who are experiencing severe financial hardship caused by the pandemic. We've already raised more than $1 million through the support of our foundation and personal donations from our management committee, the Assurant Board of Directors and the generosity of hundreds of employees. 
Since its inception in late March, the special ACES Fund has helped more than 800 families manage through these turbulent times. Furthermore, our Assurant Foundation is honoring all of its 2020 charitable commitments and has pledged some additional $250,000 to aid core charitable partners that are providing food and emergency support in the communities where we operate. 
I'm exceptionally proud of how our employees have supported not only each other and our communities, but also our customers. We've been able to maintain continuous service for our clients and provide essential support for our customers, like ensuring that their homes remain protected and helping them stay connected through their mobile devices at a time when we are all socially distancing. 
I want to thank our more than 14,000 employees for supporting each other, our customers and our communities throughout this extraordinary time. You have truly made us, Assurant, proud. 
Now let's move to our first quarter results, which were strong and largely unaffected by COVID-19. We benefited from continued growth in Global Lifestyle as well as improved results in Global Housing. 
For Assurant overall, we reported net operating earnings per share, excluding catastrophes of $2.84, an increase of 22% from the same period last year. Net operating income, excluding catastrophes, was up 18% to $176 million. 
In the quarter, we incurred about $2 million of incremental expenses directly related to COVID-19, which were reflected in net income. These expenses include, among other things, cost for the standardization of our facilities and the purchase of personal protective equipment and technology to enable work-from-home. 
Throughout this period, our balance sheet remained strong. At the end of March, we had $433 million of holding company liquidity after returning $95 million to shareholders through dividends and buybacks during the quarter. 
[Audio Gap] provide us with an additional buffer during this crisis, we drew down $200 million from our revolving credit facility in late March, solely as a precautionary measure. We do not expect to use these funds. We are pleased with our first quarter results, which reflect strong momentum across our business, pre-crisis.
However, we recognize that they may not be indicative of our performance in the coming quarters as the world continues to grapple with the impact of COVID-19. We have run multiple scenarios looking at the potential duration and severity of this crisis to better understand how our business might perform and to ensure we have the agility to react appropriately. 
Although we believe the long-term fundamentals and resiliency of our business remains strong, we are suspending our 2020 financial outlook until we gain additional clarity on COVID-19's duration and its impact on the broader economy and our business. We believe this is a prudent and sensible action given the current uncertainty. 
Relative to capital deployment, we want to retain maximum flexibility. Over the next few months, we will exercise caution in light of market volatility and as we enter hurricane season. This will include an ongoing evaluation of share buybacks with an expectation that we will slow down or pause until we have greater visibility. This applies to new M&A evaluations as well.
We plan to provide an update on our 2020 view and our long-term targets once we have more clarity of the economic landscape we're facing. Over the long term, however, we still believe that we can continue to deliver shareholder value through above-market growth and disciplined capital management. This confidence is grounded in the strength of our business portfolio. 
Our installed customer base across Connected Living, Global Automotive, multifamily housing and preneed and our countercyclical lender place business position us well to weather a prolonged crisis. Near term, however, we expect a greater impact to our business as a result of the ongoing market volatility and containment measures and how those could further impact consumer behavior. 
As an example, in late March and throughout April, we saw a reduction in new sales across multifamily housing, auto and preneed. Within mobile, we experienced lower trade-in activity and slower sales growth. 
We are taking actions to mitigate potential impacts. For instance, we've deferred some discretionary spending and delayed staffing of certain open roles in our support areas. While we are deferring some investments as a precautionary measure, we have continued to make progress against key strategic initiatives to support our clients and their customers during this crisis and beyond. These have included, among other things, continued enhancement of our self-service capabilities and our dynamic claims fulfillment to facilitate faster claims resolution as well as our ongoing IT transformation. 
Before turning to Richard, let me provide additional highlights from the quarter for each of our business segments. Within Global Lifestyle, we were pleased to see earnings increase by 20% year-over-year. Our growth has been driven by continued additions of new mobile subscribers, up 15% year-over-year. 
We believe that our ability to offer bundled value-added services to our installed base of more than 54 million subscribers provides a recurring revenue stream, even during an extended period of financial uncertainty. While we may add fewer new subscribers during this crisis, we still expect our count to grow. This should help mitigate impacts from expected lower trade-in volumes. 
Another driver of our success within Global Lifestyle has been our ability to expand partnerships with market leaders and new entrants. For example, this quarter, we enhanced our existing relationship with Rakuten Mobile by launching a new trade-in program in Japan. In addition to offering device protection for their mobile networks, the program provides a completely digital trade-in experience. 
Turning to Global Automotive. We believe the business is relatively well insulated from near-term economic shocks given its significant level of embedded earnings. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $8.2 billion of unearned premium related to this business, which will earn over the next 3 to 7 years. 
Furthermore, approximately 50% of our business comes from service contracts on used car sales, which tend to be less impacted as a result of economic downturns as we saw during the last recession. As such, we remain positive on auto and have continued to look for select opportunities to further scale the business. 
Last week, we closed on the acquisition of our long time partner, American Financial & Automotive Services, or AFAS, for $158 million. This represents an attractive valuation relative to recent transactions in the space and complements our 2018 acquisition of the Warranty Group. AFAS is a provider of finance and insurance products and services, including vehicle service contracts and other ancillary offerings with nearly a 40-year history. AFAS products and services are sold directly through a network of nearly 600 franchise dealerships with a deep footprint in Texas and the Southwest. 
For 2020, we don't expect the acquisition to be a significant contributor to our results. However, in 2021 and beyond, we expect it to further enhance our market position and add scale with the expectation to deliver additional profitable growth over time. 
Moving to Global Housing. Our lender-placed franchise continues to be an integral part of our specialty risk offerings. During the quarter, we renewed another one of our largest lender-placed clients for an additional 4 years. Since the beginning of last year, we've now renewed 17 clients, representing more than 80% of our tracked loans. Our superior customer platform has been a differentiator and will serve us well through economic cycles to support our clients and policyholders. 
In multifamily housing, we now support almost 2.3 million renters across all 50 states. While the business tends to be more resilient during economic downturns as consumers prefer to rent versus buy, beginning in mid-March, we saw a decline in new policies as renters are delaying their moving plans due to the pandemic. 
During the last few weeks, we've seen some tentative signs of stabilization, especially in our affinity channel as tenants may be regaining comfort with moving. We remain cautious, however, as we enter the summer, when we typically see greater activity and sales growth. 
We will continue to monitor sales, persistency and claim trends while also doing what we can to support current policyholders who are experiencing financial hardship during this challenging time. This includes deferring premium where appropriate. 
Moving to Global Preneed, results in the first quarter were largely in line with our expectations. This business benefits from lower mortality risk than traditional life insurance products and act as more of a spread business. 
In light of the current low interest rate environment, we've worked with our partners to make changes to their product as well as help our clients complete the sales process virtually. We will continue to evaluate other actions as appropriate. 
With regards to mortality, experience has been largely consistent with our experience last year. We attribute this to our policy footprint, including the fact that we do not write in New York. 
In summary, despite this uncertainty, we believe our business is resilient and that Assurant will weather this period and emerge strong. 
I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review first quarter results and recent trends in detail. Richard?"
4026111,663837277,1973383,"Assurant, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 06, 2020",2020-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with Global Lifestyle. The segment reported earnings of $121 million in the first quarter.

Let's start with Global Lifestyle. The segment reported earnings of $121 million in the first quarter. Excluding a $6.7 million client recoverable in Connected Living, earnings grew 14%, primarily from continued mobile growth in both new and existing programs. Global Automotive was also a contributor, largely due to $5 million of onetime income related to client recontracting, along with modest growth from prior period sales. 
Global Lifestyle results were partially offset by lower margins for mobile trade-in activity, including some impacts related to COVID-19 from the shutdown of Asian markets earlier in the quarter. Unfavorable foreign exchange also impacted results. 
Looking at total revenue. Net earned premiums and fees were up $265 million or 16%. The increase was driven primarily by higher fee income for mobile trade-in volumes and subscriber growth across North America and Asia Pacific. Expansion within extended service contracts also contributed to growth in the quarter. Within Global Automotive, revenue grew 9%, primarily reflecting prior period sales of vehicle service contracts across all distribution channels. 
Looking ahead, as Alan mentioned, we are continuing to monitor trends and the impact of COVID-19 across the segment. While we believe mobile is well positioned given our large in-force subscriber base, trade-in volumes did decline significantly in the first few weeks of April, reflecting store closures and lower consumer demand for new devices. We expect volumes to rebound when stores reopen, and carriers are able to resume in-store promotional activity, although timing of such widespread recovery remains unclear. 
Looking at our underwriting experience, we have seen a decline in mobile claims as a result of customers staying indoors. In most cases, this favorable experience will not benefit our bottom line due to profit sharing or reinsurance agreements. 
In Global Automotive, near-term earnings should be relatively well protected from a slowdown due to how the business earns. However, we still have exposure related to reductions in vehicle service contract sales, which in April were down by roughly 40% year-over-year due to a decrease in vehicle sales. 
In general, new car sales typically earn a majority of income 3 to 5 years after being sold following the expiration of the manufacturers' warranties, thereby delaying the revenue impact. However, in the event of a prolonged downturn, we would expect to see an uptick in used car sales, which earn more quickly. 
The persistently low interest rate environment also creates some headwind. While Global Automotive does have a longer duration portfolio of 3 to 7 years, we do expect investment income to be pressured from lower investment yields coming from new business.
Throughout Global Lifestyle, we also expect continued pressure from foreign exchange volatility, especially in Latin America, due to the economic environment. So, while we expect Global Lifestyle to be impacted in 2020, this segment should be more resilient during an economic downturn relative to other consumer-type businesses. 
Moving to Global Housing. Net operating income for the quarter totaled $74 million, up slightly year-over-year despite higher reportable catastrophes from the Puerto Rico earthquakes. Excluding catastrophe losses, earnings increased $6 million. This was driven by favorable non-catastrophe loss experience and improved results [Audio Gap] property offerings, largely related to the absence of losses within small commercial as it continues to run off. 
Lender-placed income increased, reflecting higher premium rates, partially offset by a reduction of policies in force, including a loss of loans from the financially insolvent client we previously disclosed. And that portfolio has now completely deboarded. 
Turning to revenue. Global Housing net earned premiums and fees were flat as growth in our special property and multifamily businesses was offset by the reduction in policies referenced earlier. The insolvent client portfolio also contributed to a 7 basis point year-over-year decline in the placement rate. 
As we continue to operate in this environment, we are tracking a few trends in Global Housing. In multifamily housing, we see a decline in new sales starting in mid-March. We continue to monitor sales, policy cancellations as well as the impact from premium deferrals, which today are primarily related to policyholders requesting premium leniency. While we initially saw a dip in claims, we are seeing activity normalize, reflecting the fact that policyholders are at home. 
Within lender-placed, we will continue to monitor the state of the overall housing market, including the potential impact of the current mortgage moratorium, which would delay placement of new policies, but at the same time, reduce lapsation. This business provides critical coverage to both homeowners and their lenders and provides downside protection, should the economy deteriorate significantly. However, we would not anticipate any benefit to our placement rate this year. 
Lastly, our small commercial business continues to run off as expected, with only 8% of the original block of policies remaining. With regard to potential exposure on business interruption coverage associated with this business, we currently believe our risk is low given virus exclusions included in our policies. We will continue to track state actions and their implications. 
In summary, while we remain cautious on multifamily housing, in light of the current uncertainty created by COVID-19, we continue to believe that Global Housing is well positioned to weather a prolonged economic downturn. 
Now let's move to Global Preneed. This segment reported $12 million of net operating income, up slightly year-over-year, driven by continued growth within the business. Revenue for preneed was up 9%, driven by U.S. growth, including final need sales. 
As we look ahead, we expect some pressure from lower yields on new sales through the current interest rate environment. However, given the 10-year average duration of our investment portfolio, our existing block of business should not be significantly impacted for some years to come. 
As Alan mentioned, so far, we haven't seen any significant spikes in mortality due to COVID-19. As a reminder, a large portion of our policies are concentrated in California, Texas, South Carolina and Tennessee. So far, these states have experienced lower mortality from COVID-19 compared to states in the Northeast. 
At Corporate, the net operating loss was $20 million versus $19 million in the prior year period. This was due to lower investment income in the Corporate segment, partially offset by lower employee-related expenses, including travel. We will continue to evaluate additional expense actions as necessary. 
In light of market volatility, I also wanted to provide an overview of our investment portfolio and strategy. In the first quarter, we recorded a $76 million mark-to-market loss in our investment portfolio. This reflects the decline in valuations of our equity securities and our CLOs, each contributing to about half of the total loss. 
Despite these losses, we believe that our $13.6 billion investment portfolio is well diversified and high quality. Approximately 86% of our investments are comprised of fixed maturities and 95% of these securities are investment-grade rated. While interest rates are expected to remain relatively low for the foreseeable future, we believe we are well positioned to navigate this environment given the duration of our existing investment portfolio, along with our conservative, low asset turnover approach. 
Our overall exposure to these sectors that have been hit the hardest by the current market turbulence is not significant. Investments in travel and leisure represent less than 0.5% of our investment portfolio. Energy makes up only 4% of our portfolio, and our investments tend to be in larger and more diversified energy companies. Retail represents 2% of our portfolio and is comprised of mostly large diversified household names. Our auto and airline exposures are each 1% or less of our portfolio. 
I would finish on the investment portfolio by saying we will continue to apply consistent investment approach. While we recognize every crisis is different, this is the same strategy that served us well during the financial crisis over a decade ago. 
Finally, I'd like to mention that in April, we completed the outsourcing of the management of our core investment portfolio to Goldman Sachs Asset Management and Voya Investment Management. We believe that their investment expertise and scaled platforms, coupled with ongoing oversight of our in-house team, should serve us well going forward. 
Turning to the holding company liquidity, we ended March with $433 million or $208 million above our current minimum target level. These figures do not include the $200 million draw from our $450 million revolving credit facility, the proceeds of which are also held at the holding company. 
In the first quarter, dividends from our operating segments totaled $127 million. In addition to our quarterly corporate and interest expenses, key outflows in the first quarter included $57 million in share repurchases and $43 million in common and preferred stock dividends. 
As Alan mentioned, relative to capital deployment, we will exercise even greater caution in light of market volatility and as we enter hurricane season. We have a robust risk management program, including stress testing our capital, cash flows and liquidity under a variety of scenarios, considering this uncertain environment. 
Before wrapping up, I wanted to address 2 additional points. First, as you saw in our release, we booked a onetime tax benefit to net income amounting to $79 million. This was related to the enactment of the Federal CARES Act in March. The benefit is associated with the carryback of losses in 2018 to 5 years prior. This allowed us to accelerate deferred tax assets, which would have been recognized over the next 3 years at a lower tax rate.
Second, we still expect to close on the sale of EK in the second quarter as planned, which will result in an expected net cash outflow of approximately $54 million plus seller financing of up to $40 million. Both the EK and AFAS transactions will be reflected in second quarter holding company capital.
In conclusion, I echo Alan's gratitude to our employees and how they have responded during this unprecedented crisis. We are confident that we will emerge in a position of strength from this period. In the months ahead, we will continue to closely monitor trends and take appropriate steps to sustain our financial strength for the long term.
And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

If you think about mobile, one of the things we've seen over the last few years is that Q1 tends to be a pretty active quarter. And we saw that again in Q1 prior to the slowdown began the second half of March. So normally, Q2 is a slower quarter anyway in terms of buyback and trade-in activity, and that often rolls into Q3 as a slower quarter, just as people are waiting to see what the new phones might be. So I think, certainly, in the second and third quarters, we'll have less activity anyway, even if we start to see a recovery. 
And while we're on mobile, maybe just a couple of other thoughts about what we're seeing in that important line of business. You heard us in the prepared remarks talk about we've seen new sales slow down as stores are closed, largely across the U.S. and in other markets around the world. Even with that, we do expect subscriber growth. As we've talked about previously, we have these programs that have been launched in the last year or 2 that are going to continue to ramp. So even in a slower sales environment, we expect some growth in new subscribers, that will help offset the slowdown that we see in buyback and trade-in.
And then longer term, once we're through this crisis, it really -- whether we have a big bounce back in buyback trade-in or whether it's just a return to normal, it's going to depend a lot on what new phones come to market, what carriers elect to do. So again, we feel well positioned in mobile even as we go through this crisis. But Richard, what would you add?"

So in the March time frame, second half and into early April, we didn't see people moving. And so we don't have an ability to make a new sale. Now again, those moves may just be delayed and it could return if we get through the crisis in a reasonable time period.
The other thing that's unique on multifamily is we are seeing some requests for premium deferral. And that's either being driven, a few states have mandated that, others were voluntarily providing it. It's not significant so far to our overall block, but it is something we're watching, and we are putting up an appropriate reserve in the event of people not being able to pay for their insurance that we're providing.
If we look longer term in multifamily, I think we're pretty optimistic about that business. If we get into any kind of downturn, people tend to rent more. We saw this in the last downturn, which has obviously been positive for that business. But more importantly, we're still early in rolling out our point of lease capability, which helps us provide a better experience and a greater attachment rate. We also see a major opportunity around the connected apartment as people, particularly with what's happened now, connectivity matters more than ever. 
So in both multifamily and in mobile, we're focused on ensuring we're there, we're delivering for our customers. We've been able to sustain our service levels. We're still repairing cellphones and getting them back in a timely basis. And we're doing all we can to help out our customers, both mobile and renters and, of course, across all of our businesses."

Well, I guess the first thing I would say is the business that's on the books today has a relatively long duration, I guess, let's call it, 3 to 5 years. So that business is fairly well matched in terms of asset liability matching. So really, what we're talking about is that income will roll through. And as we have new sales, those new sales will be put up at the new level of interest rates. Obviously, short-term interest rates are very low. Who knows where they'll go over time. But you're exactly right. we would have the opportunity to work with our clients and as there are new sales, to look at what the pricing on the various products would be.
I guess the other thing I would add, Mark, is that a lot of the business that we do in the auto sector is reinsured to captive clients as well. So there is a straight -- a strong alignment of interest for us to really provide the customer with the best product, competitive product at the right pricing."

First of all, lender-placed, it's an important product for the mortgage industry. We're effectively there to support the functioning of the market, to protect policyholders and lenders. But in the short term, we don't really see a lot changing. If you look at the mortgage forbearance that's underway, it's not going to have a big impact on us one way or the other. And so really, if we do get into a downturn, our product tends to be placed later in that cycle. So someone needs to move into seriously delinquent and often into foreclosure. So if you look at the last downturn, which is really the data point we have, which was an extreme housing market downturn, today, we're at about 1.5%, 1.6% placement rate. In the last downturn, we peaked at about just under 3%. So that gives you some sense of at least what happened in the last downturn. Who knows if we'll have a downturn here, and I certainly hope we don't. But if we do, our business is strong. It's well positioned, and we've made significant advancements in the last 5 years on our compliance, our tracking infrastructure.

So the new subscribers are the biggest driver of that business over the last couple of years, and they're really coming from the new clients and programs that we've talked about that have been launched in the last couple of years. So for example, KDDI in Japan, Comcast and Charter in the U.S., et cetera. And those programs, once we launch them, it generally takes anywhere between 3 to 4 years. You need to go through a phone handset replacement cycle. So even if there are fewer sales now in the crisis, sales are still happening to a degree. So that's why they're going to grow.
Buyback trade-in was a big driver of our business back in like '15 and '16 when we really ramped it up. Over the last few years, it's been more stable. We haven't -- in key markets like the U.S. and Japan, you've seen the ownership of handsets lengthening. So people have gone to owning a handset for 3 years or in Japan 4 years. That's offset the growth we've had in subscribers. So that business has been more kind of flattish over the last couple of years. Now if we look forward, we see a significant wave of buyback trading coming. It may be delayed a little bit by the current crisis. But if you think about 5G, when that really starts to roll out, and it was going to start to roll out later this year in the U.S. We'll see how widely that really happens. That will create a wave of activity for the next year or 2 in buyback trade-in, and we're well positioned.
The other important thing in mobile that's really driven our growth is we've been adding more services per subscriber. So if you recall, when in the early days, we have 1 service, now often, we have up to 6 different sources of value with every agreement where we're providing things like Premium Tech support, our onboard diagnostic technology, Pocket Geek, we're doing the buyback trade-in. And increasingly, we're doing an extended warranty for year-3 and year-4 of phone ownership. So overall, again, I think we're encouraged by our position. We expect to have continued growth that just may not be at the same level this year as we've seen in past years."

So consumers have been adapting and adjusting for 7 or 8 weeks now. So it's early to see what really might happen. So what we're really focused on is, first and foremost, being there to service customers. If you think about it, we have this installed base of 300 million or so customers, they still need our support, whether it's for their phone or their car or their renters insurance, and we've been able to quickly pivot to work-from-home for most of our operating roles, and we've been able to meet and maintain meeting all of our service levels, which is really impressive and a huge thank you to our employees across the globe who've done that. So that's important.
Where might we see trends? I think it's too early to say. What we've seen is for most things consumers are just being cautious about going out and buying anything at the moment, either because the stores are closed or they don't feel safe going out. We saw the lows so far in this crisis, the first week or 2 of April, with activity levels dropping 40% or 50% across a lot of the channels we serve. We're starting to see a little bit of recovery in the second half of April, although still well below pre-crisis levels. 
So again, if you look at our businesses, I think we're well positioned to weather this crisis quite well. We've got that installed base. I mentioned we have the diversity of portfolio. As you mentioned, we have LPI, which will be a countercyclical hedge if we get into that kind of downturn. We've got the embedded earnings on the balance sheet in Auto and Preneed. We do have things like if we do end up with an economic downturn out of this crisis, Auto, for example, generally, you have more used car sales in that environment. And if we sell on a used car, we start to earn much sooner than we do on a new car. And we've got that strong balance sheet and conservative investment philosophy that Richard talked about. So at the end of the day, we're going to continue to monitor all these trends, but we feel well positioned to be there to support our customers and to weather this crises well."

When we come out the other side of this, we're going to be as strong with the same kind of track record in front of us as we've had in the last few years as a company. So what we're trying to do is we're being prudent. So things like deferring expenses, holding off on some hiring, being cautious on preserving capital just because you never know. But we are making strategic investments. Now for example, the investment in AFAS, that is one of the industry-leading franchises in Auto. It really fills in for us the geography, particularly in Texas and the Southwest. It also brings capabilities that we can enroll across and it's a very low relative execution risk for an M&A deal because we know the company well, and we know the business well. So we went ahead and made the decision. And that dialogue has been ongoing with them for quite a while. So we felt it was appropriate. We're also investing -- one of the interesting trends that was already happening, but will be accelerated by COVID-19 is the shift to digital, both on sales and service. And we've been investing against that for years. But in this crisis, the acceleration of that has moved forward dramatically. And we've been able to be there and support our clients with that. So we're fortunate we've made that investment, but we're going to continue to invest to move more things to digital. So we're making investments like that, that are against the long-term trends and our kind of strong market positions. And then we're just being cautious because what we don't know and nobody knows is the duration of how long this might go on and whether we'll have multiple ways of this going on.

Before reviewing our results for the quarter, I wanted to share a few comments regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and our ongoing response. From the beginning, Assurant's leadership team acted swiftly and deliberately, led by our guiding principles, to safeguard our employees and their families, to maintain operations and service level for our customers and to support our local communities. 
Early in this crisis, we implemented a global ban on business travel and transitioned the vast majority of our workforce to work from home to help stem the spread of the virus in our communities and to protect our employees. For those employees who need to work from our offices or repair sites due to the essential nature of their roles, we've implemented strong safety and hygiene protocols. These measures include social distancing and the use of personal protective equipment, along with regular cleaning and disinfection of our locations based on the guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control. 
We are committed to doing what we can to protect our employees through this period of uncertainty, always treating them with respect and providing appropriate support given the challenges we are all dealing with at this time. To allay job security concerns as well as to continue to deliver for our customers, we've made commitments to our employees to not eliminate any roles due to COVID-19 in the short term. 
We've also offered financial support where it's most needed. As part of our Assurant Cares Employee Support, or ACES Fund, we've launched a special COVID-19 Emergency Relief program to support eligible employees who are experiencing severe financial hardship caused by the pandemic. We've already raised more than $1 million through the support of our foundation and personal donations from our management committee, the Assurant Board of Directors and the generosity of hundreds of employees. 
Since its inception in late March, the special ACES Fund has helped more than 800 families manage through these turbulent times. Furthermore, our Assurant Foundation is honoring all of its 2020 charitable commitments and has pledged an additional $250,000 to aid core charitable partners that are providing food and emergency support in the communities where we operate. 
I'm exceptionally proud of how our employees have supported not only each other and our communities, but also our customers. We've been able to maintain continuous service for our clients and provide essential support for our customers, like ensuring that their homes remain protected and helping them stay connected through their mobile devices at a time when we are all socially distancing. 
I want to thank our more than 14,000 employees for supporting each other, our customers and our communities throughout this extraordinary time. You have truly made us Assurant proud. 
Now let's move to our first quarter results, which were strong and largely unaffected by COVID-19. We benefited from continued growth in Global Lifestyle as well as improved results in Global Housing. 
For Assurant overall, we reported net operating earnings per share, excluding catastrophes, of $2.84, an increase of 22% from the same period last year. Net operating income, excluding catastrophes, was up 18% to $176 million. 
In the quarter, we incurred about $2 million of incremental expenses directly related to COVID-19, which were reflected in net income. These expenses include, among other things, cost for the standardization of our facilities and the purchase of personal protective equipment and technology to enable work from home. 
Throughout this period, our balance sheet remained strong. At the end of March, we had $433 million of holding company liquidity after returning $95 million to shareholders through dividends and buybacks during the quarter. 
[Audio Gap] provide us with an additional buffer during this crisis, we drew down $200 million from our revolving credit facility in late March, solely as a precautionary measure. We do not expect to use these funds. We are pleased with our first quarter results, which reflect strong momentum across our business pre-crisis.
However, we recognize that they may not be indicative of our performance in the coming quarters as the world continues to grapple with the impact of COVID-19. We have run multiple scenarios looking at the potential duration and severity of this crisis to better understand how our business might perform and to ensure we have the agility to react appropriately. 
Although we believe the long-term fundamentals and resiliency of our business remain strong, we are suspending our 2020 financial outlook until we gain additional clarity on COVID-19's duration and its impact on the broader economy and our business. We believe this is a prudent and sensible action given the current uncertainty. 
Relative to capital deployment, we want to retain maximum flexibility. Over the next few months, we will exercise caution in light of market volatility and as we enter hurricane season. This will include an ongoing evaluation of share buybacks with an expectation that we will slow down or pause until we have greater visibility. This applies to new M&A evaluations as well.
We plan to provide an update on our 2020 view and our long-term targets once we have more clarity of the economic landscape we're facing. Over the long term, however, we still believe that we can continue to deliver shareholder value through above-market growth and disciplined capital management. This confidence is grounded in the strength of our business portfolio. 
Our installed customer base across Connected Living, Global Automotive, multifamily housing and Preneed and our countercyclical lender place business position us well to weather a prolonged crisis. Near term, however, we expect a greater impact to our business as a result of the ongoing market volatility and containment measures and how those could further impact consumer behavior. 
As an example, in late March and throughout April, we saw a reduction in new sales across multifamily housing, Auto and Preneed. Within mobile, we experienced lower trade-in activity and slower sales growth. 
We are taking actions to mitigate potential impacts. For instance, we've deferred some discretionary spending and delayed staffing of certain open roles in our support areas. While we are deferring some investments as a precautionary measure, we have continued to make progress against key strategic initiatives to support our clients and their customers during this crisis and beyond. These have included, among other things, continued enhancement of our self-service capabilities and our dynamic claims fulfillment to facilitate faster claims resolution as well as our ongoing IT transformation. 
Before turning to Richard, let me provide additional highlights from the quarter for each of our business segments. Within Global Lifestyle, we were pleased to see earnings increase by 20% year-over-year. Our growth has been driven by continued additions of new mobile subscribers, up 15% year-over-year. 
We believe that our ability to offer bundled value-added services to our installed base of more than 54 million subscribers provides a recurring revenue stream, even during an extended period of financial uncertainty. While we may add fewer new subscribers during this crisis, we still expect our count to grow. This should help mitigate impacts from expected lower trade-in volumes. 
Another driver of our success within Global Lifestyle has been our ability to expand partnerships with market leaders and new entrants. For example, this quarter, we enhanced our existing relationship with Rakuten Mobile by launching a new trade-in program in Japan. In addition to offering device protection for their mobile networks, the program provides a completely digital trade-in experience. 
Turning to Global Automotive, we believe the business is relatively well insulated from near-term economic shocks given its significant level of embedded earnings. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $8.2 billion of unearned premium related to this business, which we'll earn over the next 3 to 7 years. 
Furthermore, approximately 50% of our business comes from service contracts on used car sales, which tend to be less impacted as a result of economic downturns as we saw during the last recession. As such, we remain positive on auto and have continued to look for select opportunities to further scale the business. 
Last week, we closed on the acquisition of our longtime partner, American Financial & Automotive Services, or AFAS, for $158 million. This represents an attractive valuation relative to recent transactions in the space and complements our 2018 acquisition of The Warranty Group. AFAS is a provider of finance and insurance products and services, including vehicle service contracts and other ancillary offerings, with nearly a 40-year history. AFAS products and services are sold directly through a network of nearly 600 franchise dealerships with a deep footprint in Texas and the Southwest. 
For 2020, we don't expect the acquisition to be a significant contributor to our results. However, in 2021 and beyond, we expect it to further enhance our market position and add scale with the expectation to deliver additional profitable growth over time. 
Moving to Global Housing, our lender-placed franchise continues to be an integral part of our specialty risk offerings. During the quarter, we renewed another one of our largest lender-placed clients for an additional 4 years. Since the beginning of last year, we've now renewed 17 clients, representing more than 80% of our tracked loans. Our superior customer platform has been a differentiator and will serve us well through economic cycles to support our clients and policyholders. 
In multifamily housing, we now support almost 2.3 million renters across all 50 states. While the business tends to be more resilient during economic downturns as consumers prefer to rent versus buy, beginning in mid-March, we saw a decline in new policies as renters are delaying their moving plans due to the pandemic. 
During the last few weeks, we've seen some tentative signs of stabilization, especially in our affinity channel as tenants may be regaining comfort with moving. We remain cautious, however, as we enter the summer, when we typically see greater activity and sales growth. 
We will continue to monitor sales, persistency and claim trends while also doing what we can to support current policyholders who are experiencing financial hardship during this challenging time. This includes deferring premium where appropriate. 
Moving to Global Preneed, results in the first quarter were largely in line with our expectations. This business benefits from lower mortality risk than traditional life insurance products and acts as more of a spread business. 
In light of the current low interest rate environment, we've worked with our partners to make changes to their product as well as help our clients complete the sales process virtually. We will continue to evaluate other actions as appropriate. 
With regards to mortality, experience has been largely consistent with our experience last year. We attribute this to our policy footprint, including the fact that we do not write in New York. 
In summary, despite this uncertainty, we believe our business is resilient and that Assurant will weather this period and emerge strong. 
I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review first quarter results and recent trends in detail. Richard?"

Let's start with Global Lifestyle. The segment reported earnings of $121 million in the first quarter.

Let's start with Global Lifestyle. The segment reported earnings of $121 million in the first quarter. Excluding a $6.7 million client recoverable in Connected Living, earnings grew 14%, primarily from continued mobile growth in both new and existing programs. Global Automotive was also a contributor, largely due to $5 million of onetime income related to client recontracting, along with modest growth from prior-period sales. 
Global Lifestyle results were partially offset by lower margins for mobile trade-in activity, including some impacts related to COVID-19 from the shutdown of Asian markets earlier in the quarter. Unfavorable foreign exchange also impacted results. 
Looking at total revenue, net earned premiums and fees were up $265 million or 16%. The increase was driven primarily by higher fee income for mobile trade-in volumes and subscriber growth across North America and Asia Pacific. Expansion within extended service contracts also contributed to growth in the quarter. Within Global Automotive, revenue grew 9%, primarily reflecting prior-period sales of vehicle service contracts across all distribution channels. 
Looking ahead, as Alan mentioned, we are continuing to monitor trends and the impact of COVID-19 across the segment. While we believe mobile is well positioned given our large in-force subscriber base, trade-in volumes did decline significantly in the first few weeks of April, reflecting store closures and lower consumer demand for new devices. We expect volumes to rebound when stores reopen and carriers are able to resume in-store promotional activity, although timing of such widespread recovery remains unclear. 
Looking at our underwriting experience, we have seen a decline in mobile claims as a result of customers staying indoors. In most cases, this stable experience will not benefit our bottom line due to profit sharing or reinsurance agreements. 
In Global Automotive, near-term earnings should be relatively well protected from a slowdown due to how the business earns. However, we still have exposure related to reductions in vehicle service contract sales, which in April were down by roughly 40% year-over-year due to a decrease in vehicle sales. 
In general, new car sales typically earn a majority of income 3 to 5 years after being sold following the expiration of the manufacturers' warranties, thereby delaying the revenue impact. However, in the event of a prolonged downturn, we would expect to see an uptick in used car sales, which earn more quickly. 
The persistently low interest rate environment also creates some headwind. While Global Automotive does have a longer duration portfolio of 3 to 7 years, we do expect investment income to be pressured from lower investment yields coming from new business.
Throughout Global Lifestyle, we also expect continued pressure from foreign exchange volatility, especially in Latin America, due to the economic environment. So, while we expect Global Lifestyle to be impacted in 2020, this segment should be more resilient during an economic downturn relative to other consumer-type businesses. 
Moving to Global Housing. Net operating income for the quarter totaled $74 million, up slightly year-over-year despite higher reportable catastrophes from the Puerto Rico earthquakes. Excluding catastrophe losses, earnings increased $6 million. This was driven by favorable non-catastrophe loss experience and improved results
[Audio Gap]
property offerings, largely related to the absence of losses within small commercial as it continues to run off. 
Lender-placed income increased, reflecting higher premium rates, partially offset by a reduction of policies in force, including a loss of loans from the financially insolvent client we previously disclosed. That portfolio has now completely deboarded. 
Turning to revenue, Global Housing net earned premiums and fees were flat as growth in our special property and multifamily businesses was offset by the reduction in policies referenced earlier. The insolvent client portfolio also contributed to a 7 basis point year-over-year decline in the placement rate. 
As we continue to operate in this environment, we are tracking a few trends in Global Housing. In multifamily housing, we see a decline in new sales starting in mid-March. We continue to monitor sales, policy cancellations as well as the impact from premium deferrals, which today are primarily related to policyholders requesting premium leniency. While we initially saw a dip in claims, we are seeing activity normalize, reflecting the fact that policyholders are at home. 
Within lender-placed, we will continue to monitor the state of the overall housing market, including the potential impact of the current mortgage moratorium, which would delay placement of new policies but at the same time reduce lapsation. This business provides critical coverage to both homeowners and their lenders and provides downside protection should the economy deteriorate significantly. However, we would not anticipate any benefit to our placement rate this year. 
Lastly, our small commercial business continues to run off as expected, with only 8% of the original block of policies remaining. With regard to potential exposure on business interruption coverage associated with this business, we currently believe our risk is low given virus exclusions included in our policies. We will continue to track state actions and their implications. 
In summary, while we remain cautious on multifamily housing in light of the current uncertainty created by COVID-19, we continue to believe that Global Housing is well positioned to weather a prolonged economic downturn. 
Now let's move to Global Preneed. This segment reported $12 million of net operating income, up slightly year-over-year, driven by continued growth within the business. Revenue for Preneed was up 9%, driven by U.S. growth, including Final Need sales. 
As we look ahead, we expect some pressure from lower yields on new sales through the current interest rate environment. However, given the 10-year average duration of our investment portfolio, our existing block of business should not be significantly impacted for some years to come. 
As Alan mentioned, so far we haven't seen any significant spikes in mortality due to COVID-19. As a reminder, a large portion of our policies are concentrated in California, Texas, South Carolina and Tennessee. So far, these states have experienced lower mortality from COVID-19 compared to states in the Northeast. 
At Corporate, the net operating loss was $20 million versus $19 million in the prior year period. This was due to lower investment income in the Corporate segment, partially offset by lower employee-related expenses, including travel. We will continue to evaluate additional expense actions as necessary. 
In light of market volatility, I also wanted to provide an overview of our investment portfolio and strategy. In the first quarter, we recorded a $76 million mark-to-market loss in our investment portfolio. This reflects the decline in valuations of our equity securities and our CLOs, each contributing to about half of the total loss. 
Despite these losses, we believe that our $13.6 billion investment portfolio is well-diversified and high quality. Approximately 86% of our investments are comprised of fixed maturities and 95% of these securities are investment-grade rated. While interest rates are expected to remain relatively low for the foreseeable future, we believe we are well positioned to navigate this environment given the duration of our existing investment portfolio, along with our conservative low asset turnover approach. 
Our overall exposure to these sectors that have been hit the hardest by the current market turbulence is not significant. Investments in travel and leisure represent less than 0.5% of our investment portfolio. Energy makes up only 4% of our portfolio, and our investments tend to be in larger and more diversified energy companies. Retail represents 2% of our portfolio and is comprised of mostly large diversified household names. Our auto and airline exposures are each 1% or less of our portfolio. 
I would finish on the investment portfolio by saying we will continue to apply consistent investment approach. While we recognize every crisis is different, this is the same strategy that served us well during the financial crisis over a decade ago. 
Finally, I'd like to mention that in April we completed the outsourcing of the management of our core investment portfolio to Goldman Sachs Asset Management and Voya Investment Management. We believe that their investment expertise and scaled platforms coupled with ongoing oversight of our in-house team should serve us well going forward. 
Turning to the holding company liquidity, we ended March with $433 million or $208 million above our current minimum target level. These figures do not include the $200 million draw from our $450 million revolving credit facility, the proceeds of which are also held at the holding company. 
In the first quarter, dividends from our operating segments totaled $127 million. In addition to our quarterly corporate and interest expenses, key outflows in the first quarter included $57 million in share repurchases and $43 million in common and preferred stock dividends. 
As Alan mentioned, relative to capital deployment, we will exercise even greater caution in light of market volatility and as we enter hurricane season. We have a robust risk management program, including stress testing our capital, cash flows and liquidity under a variety of scenarios, considering this uncertain environment. 
Before wrapping up, I wanted to address 2 additional points. First, as you saw in our release, we booked a onetime tax benefit to net income amounting to $79 million. This was related to the enactment of the Federal CARES Act in March. The benefit is associated with the carryback of losses in 2018 to 5 years prior. This allowed us to accelerate deferred tax assets, which would have been recognized over the next 3 years at a lower tax rate.
Second, we still expect to close on the sale of Ike in the second quarter as planned, which will result in an expected net cash outflow of approximately $54 million plus seller financing of up to $40 million. Both the Ike and AFAS transactions will be reflected in second quarter holding company capital.
In conclusion, I echo Alan's gratitude to our employees and how they have responded during this unprecedented crisis. We are confident that we will emerge in a position of strength from this period. In the months ahead, we will continue to closely monitor trends and take appropriate steps to sustain our financial strength for the long term.
And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

Mark, let me start on that and then Richard, as always, feel free to add on some comments. If you think about mobile, one of the things we've seen over the last few years is that Q1 tends to be a pretty active quarter. And we saw that again in Q1 prior to the slowdown began the second half of March. So normally, Q2 is a slower quarter anyway in terms of buyback and trade-in activity, and that often rolls into Q3 as a slower quarter, just as people are waiting to see what the new phones might be. So I think, certainly, in the second and third quarters, we'll have less activity anyway, even if we start to see a recovery. 
And while we're on mobile, maybe just a couple of other thoughts about what we're seeing in that important line of business. You heard us in the prepared remarks talk about we've seen new sales slow down as stores are closed, largely across the U.S. and in other markets around the world. Even with that, we do expect subscriber growth. As we've talked about previously, we have these programs that have been launched in the last year or 2 that are going to continue to ramp. So even in a slower sales environment, we expect some growth in new subscribers. That will help offset the slowdown that we see in buyback and trade-in.
And then longer term, once we're through this crisis, it really -- whether we have a big bounce back in buyback trade-in or whether it's just a return to normal, it's going to depend a lot on what new phones come to market, what carriers elect to do. So again, we feel well positioned in mobile even as we go through this crisis. But Richard, what would you add?"

The other thing that's unique on multifamily is we are seeing some requests for premium deferral. And that's either being driven -- a few states have mandated that, others were voluntarily providing it. It's not significant so far to our overall block, but it is something we're watching, and we are putting up an appropriate reserve in the event of people not being able to pay for their insurance that we're providing.
If we look longer term in multifamily, I think we're pretty optimistic about that business. If we get into any kind of downturn, people tend to rent more. We saw this in the last downturn, which obviously would be positive for that business. But more importantly, we're still early in rolling out our point of lease capability, which helps us provide a better experience and a greater attachment rate. We also see a major opportunity around the connected apartment as people, particularly with what's happened now, connectivity matters more than ever. 
So in both multifamily and in mobile, we're focused on ensuring we're there, we're delivering for our customers. We've been able to sustain our service levels. We're still repairing cellphones and getting them back in a timely basis. And we're doing all we can to help out our customers, both mobile and renters and, of course, across all of our businesses."

First of all, lender-placed, it's an important product for the mortgage industry. We're effectively there to support the functioning of the market, to protect policyholders and lenders. But in the short term, we don't really see a lot changing. If you look at the mortgage forbearance that's underway, it's not going to have a big impact on us one way or the other. And so really, if we do get into a downturn, our product tends to be placed later in that cycle. So someone needs to move into seriously delinquent and often into foreclosure. So if you look at the last downturn, which is really the data point we have, which was an extreme housing market downturn, today, we're at about 1.5%, 1.6% placement rate. In the last downturn, we peaked at about just under 3%. So that gives you some sense of at least what happened in the last downturn. Who knows if we'll have a downturn here, and I certainly hope we don't. But if we do, our business is strong. It's well positioned, and we've made significant advancements in the last 5 years on our compliance, our tracking infrastructure.

So the new subscribers are the biggest driver of that business over the last couple of years, and they're really coming from the new clients and programs that we've talked about that have been launched in the last couple of years. So for example, KDDI in Japan, Comcast and Charter in the U.S., et cetera. And those programs, once we launch them, it generally takes anywhere between 3 to 4 years. You need to go through a phone handset replacement cycle. So even if there are fewer sales now in the crisis, sales are still happening to a degree. So that's why they're going to grow.
Buyback trade-in was a big driver of our business back in like '15 and '16 when we really ramped it up. Over the last few years, it's been more stable. We haven't -- in key markets like the U.S. and Japan, you've seen the ownership of handsets lengthening. So people have gone to owning a handset for 3 years or in Japan 4 years. That's offset the growth we've had in subscribers. So that business has been more kind of flattish over the last couple of years. Now if we look forward, we see a significant wave of buyback trading coming. It may be delayed a little bit by the current crisis. But if you think about 5G, when that really starts to roll out, and it was going to start to roll out later this year in the U.S. -- we'll see how widely that really happens -- that will create a wave of activity for the next year or 2 in buyback trade-in, and we're well positioned.
The other important thing in mobile that's really driven our growth is we've been adding more services per subscriber. So if you recall when in the early days we had 1 service, now often we have up to 6 different sources of value with every agreement, where we're providing things like Premium Tech support, our onboard diagnostic technology in Pocket Geek, we're doing the buyback trade-in. And increasingly, we're doing an extended warranty for year 3 and year 4 of phone ownership. So overall, again, I think we're encouraged by our position. We expect to have continued growth; it just may not be at the same level this year as we've seen in past years."

So consumers have been adapting and adjusting for 7 or 8 weeks now. So it's early to see what really might happen. So what we're really focused on is, first and foremost, being there to service customers. If you think about it, we have this installed base of 300 million or so customers. They still need our support, whether it's for their phone or their car or their renters insurance, and we've been able to quickly pivot to work-from-home for most of our operating roles, and we've been able to meet and maintain meeting all of our service levels, which is really impressive and a huge thank you to our employees across the globe who've done that. So that's important.
Where might we see trends? I think it's too early to say. What we've seen is, for most things consumers are just being cautious about going out and buying anything at the moment, either because the stores are closed or they don't feel safe going out. We saw the lows so far in this crisis, the first week or 2 of April, with activity levels dropping 40% or 50% across a lot of the channels we serve. We're starting to see a little bit of recovery in the second half of April, although still well below pre-crisis levels. 
So again, if you look at our businesses, I think we're well positioned to weather this crisis quite well. We've got that installed base I mentioned. We have the diversity of portfolio. As you mentioned, we have LPI, which will be a countercyclical hedge if we get into that kind of downturn. We've got the embedded earnings on the balance sheet in Auto and Preneed. We do have things like if we do end up with an economic downturn out of this crisis, Auto, for example, generally, you have more used car sales in that environment. And if we sell on a used car, we start to earn much sooner than we do on a new car. And we've got that strong balance sheet and conservative investment philosophy that Richard talked about. So at the end of the day, we're going to continue to monitor all these trends, but we feel well positioned to be there to support our customers and to weather this crisis well."

When we come out the other side of this, we're going to be as strong with the same kind of track record in front of us as we've had in the last few years as a company. So what we're trying to do is we're being prudent. So things like deferring expenses, holding off on some hiring, being cautious on preserving capital just because you never know. But we are making strategic investments. For example, the investment in AFAS, that is one of the industry-leading franchises in auto. It really fills in for us the geography, particularly in Texas and the Southwest. It also brings capabilities that we can roll across and it's a very low relative execution risk for an M&A deal because we know the company well and we know the business well. So we went ahead and made the decision. And that dialogue has been ongoing with them for quite a while. So we felt it was appropriate. We're also investing -- one of the interesting trends that was already happening but will be accelerated by COVID-19 is the shift to digital, both on sales and service. And we've been investing against that for years. But in this crisis, the acceleration of that has moved forward dramatically. And we've been able to be there and support our clients with that. So we're fortunate we've made that investment, but we're going to continue to invest to move more things to digital. So we're making investments like that, that are against the long-term trends and our kind of strong market positions. And then we're just being cautious, because what we don't know and nobody knows is the duration of how long this might go on and whether we'll have multiple waves of this going on.

Before reviewing our results for the quarter, I wanted to share a few comments regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and our ongoing response. From the beginning, Assurant's leadership team acted swiftly and deliberately, led by our guiding principles, to safeguard our employees and their families, to maintain operations and service level for our customers and to support our local communities. 
Early in this crisis, we implemented a global ban on business travel and transitioned the vast majority of our workforce to work from home to help stem the spread of the virus in our communities and to protect our employees. For those employees who need to work from our offices or repair sites due to the essential nature of their roles, we've implemented strong safety and hygiene protocols. These measures include social distancing and the use of personal protective equipment, along with regular cleaning and disinfection of our locations based on the guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control. 
We are committed to doing what we can to protect our employees through this period of uncertainty, always treating them with respect and providing appropriate support given the challenges we are all dealing with at this time. To allay job security concerns as well as to continue to deliver for our customers, we've made commitments to our employees to not eliminate any roles due to COVID-19 in the short term. 
We've also offered financial support where it's most needed. As part of our Assurant Cares Employee Support, or ACES Fund, we've launched a special COVID-19 Emergency Relief program to support eligible employees who are experiencing severe financial hardship caused by the pandemic. We've already raised more than $1 million through the support of our foundation and personal donations from our management committee, the Assurant Board of Directors and the generosity of hundreds of employees. 
Since its inception in late March, the special ACES Fund has helped more than 800 families manage through these turbulent times. Furthermore, our Assurant Foundation is honoring all of its 2020 charitable commitments and has pledged an additional $250,000 to aid core charitable partners that are providing food and emergency support in the communities where we operate. 
I'm exceptionally proud of how our employees have supported not only each other and our communities, but also our customers. We've been able to maintain continuous service for our clients and provide essential support for our customers, like ensuring that their homes remain protected and helping them stay connected through their mobile devices at a time when we are all socially distancing. 
I want to thank our more than 14,000 employees for supporting each other, our customers and our communities throughout this extraordinary time. You have truly made us Assurant proud. 
Now let's move to our first quarter results, which were strong and largely unaffected by COVID-19. We benefited from continued growth in Global Lifestyle as well as improved results in Global Housing. 
For Assurant overall, we reported net operating earnings per share, excluding catastrophes, of $2.84, an increase of 22% from the same period last year. Net operating income, excluding catastrophes, was up 18% to $176 million. 
In the quarter, we incurred about $2 million of incremental expenses directly related to COVID-19, which were reflected in net income. These expenses include, among other things, cost for the standardization of our facilities and the purchase of personal protective equipment and technology to enable work from home. 
Throughout this period, our balance sheet remained strong. At the end of March, we had $433 million of holding company liquidity after returning $95 million to shareholders through dividends and buybacks during the quarter. 
[Audio Gap] provide us with an additional buffer during this crisis, we drew down $200 million from our revolving credit facility in late March, solely as a precautionary measure. We do not expect to use these funds. We are pleased with our first quarter results, which reflect strong momentum across our business pre-crisis.
However, we recognize that they may not be indicative of our performance in the coming quarters as the world continues to grapple with the impact of COVID-19. We have run multiple scenarios looking at the potential duration and severity of this crisis to better understand how our business might perform and to ensure we have the agility to react appropriately. 
Although we believe the long-term fundamentals and resiliency of our business remain strong, we are suspending our 2020 financial outlook until we gain additional clarity on COVID-19's duration and its impact on the broader economy and our business. We believe this is a prudent and sensible action given the current uncertainty. 
Relative to capital deployment, we want to retain maximum flexibility. Over the next few months, we will exercise caution in light of market volatility and as we enter hurricane season. This will include an ongoing evaluation of share buybacks with an expectation that we will slow down or pause until we have greater visibility. This applies to new M&A evaluations as well.
We plan to provide an update on our 2020 view and our long-term targets once we have more clarity of the economic landscape we're facing. Over the long term, however, we still believe that we can continue to deliver shareholder value through above-market growth and disciplined capital management. This confidence is grounded in the strength of our business portfolio. 
Our installed customer base across Connected Living, Global Automotive, multifamily housing and Preneed and our countercyclical lender place business position us well to weather a prolonged crisis. Near term, however, we expect a greater impact to our business as a result of the ongoing market volatility and containment measures and how those could further impact consumer behavior. 
As an example, in late March and throughout April, we saw a reduction in new sales across multifamily housing, Auto and Preneed. Within mobile, we experienced lower trade-in activity and slower sales growth. 
We are taking actions to mitigate potential impacts. For instance, we've deferred some discretionary spending and delayed staffing of certain open roles in our support areas. While we are deferring some investments as a precautionary measure, we have continued to make progress against key strategic initiatives to support our clients and their customers during this crisis and beyond. These have included, among other things, continued enhancement of our self-service capabilities and our dynamic claims fulfillment to facilitate faster claims resolution as well as our ongoing IT transformation. 
Before turning to Richard, let me provide additional highlights from the quarter for each of our business segments. Within Global Lifestyle, we were pleased to see earnings increase by 20% year-over-year. Our growth has been driven by continued additions of new mobile subscribers, up 15% year-over-year. 
We believe that our ability to offer bundled value-added services to our installed base of more than 54 million subscribers provides a recurring revenue stream, even during an extended period of financial uncertainty. While we may add fewer new subscribers during this crisis, we still expect our count to grow. This should help mitigate impacts from expected lower trade-in volumes. 
Another driver of our success within Global Lifestyle has been our ability to expand partnerships with market leaders and new entrants. For example, this quarter, we enhanced our existing relationship with Rakuten Mobile by launching a new trade-in program in Japan. In addition to offering device protection for their mobile networks, the program provides a completely digital trade-in experience. 
Turning to Global Automotive, we believe the business is relatively well insulated from near-term economic shocks given its significant level of embedded earnings. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $8.2 billion of unearned premium related to this business, which we'll earn over the next 3 to 7 years. 
Furthermore, approximately 50% of our business comes from service contracts on used car sales, which tend to be less impacted as a result of economic downturns as we saw during the last recession. As such, we remain positive on auto and have continued to look for select opportunities to further scale the business. 
Last week, we closed on the acquisition of our longtime partner, American Financial & Automotive Services, or AFAS, for $158 million. This represents an attractive valuation relative to recent transactions in the space and complements our 2018 acquisition of The Warranty Group. AFAS is a provider of finance and insurance products and services, including vehicle service contracts and other ancillary offerings, with nearly a 40-year history. AFAS products and services are sold directly through a network of nearly 600 franchise dealerships with a deep footprint in Texas and the Southwest. 
For 2020, we don't expect the acquisition to be a significant contributor to our results. However, in 2021 and beyond, we expect it to further enhance our market position and add scale with the expectation to deliver additional profitable growth over time. 
Moving to Global Housing, our lender-placed franchise continues to be an integral part of our specialty risk offerings. During the quarter, we renewed another one of our largest lender-placed clients for an additional 4 years. Since the beginning of last year, we've now renewed 17 clients, representing more than 80% of our tracked loans. Our superior customer platform has been a differentiator and will serve us well through economic cycles to support our clients and policyholders. 
In multifamily housing, we now support almost 2.3 million renters across all 50 states. While the business tends to be more resilient during economic downturns as consumers prefer to rent versus buy, beginning in mid-March, we saw a decline in new policies as renters are delaying their moving plans due to the pandemic. 
During the last few weeks, we've seen some tentative signs of stabilization, especially in our affinity channel as tenants may be regaining comfort with moving. We remain cautious, however, as we enter the summer, when we typically see greater activity and sales growth. 
We will continue to monitor sales, persistency and claim trends while also doing what we can to support current policyholders who are experiencing financial hardship during this challenging time. This includes deferring premium where appropriate. 
Moving to Global Preneed, results in the first quarter were largely in line with our expectations. This business benefits from lower mortality risk than traditional life insurance products and acts as more of a spread business. 
In light of the current low interest rate environment, we've worked with our partners to make changes to their product as well as help our clients complete the sales process virtually. We will continue to evaluate other actions as appropriate. 
With regards to mortality, experience has been largely consistent with our experience last year. We attribute this to our policy footprint, including the fact that we do not write in New York. 
In summary, despite this uncertainty, we believe our business is resilient and that Assurant will weather this period and emerge strong. 
I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review first quarter results and recent trends in detail. Richard?"

Let's start with Global Lifestyle. The segment reported earnings of $121 million in the first quarter.

Let's start with Global Lifestyle. The segment reported earnings of $121 million in the first quarter. Excluding a $6.7 million client recoverable in Connected Living, earnings grew 14%, primarily from continued mobile growth in both new and existing programs. Global Automotive was also a contributor, largely due to $5 million of onetime income related to client recontracting, along with modest growth from prior-period sales. 
Global Lifestyle results were partially offset by lower margins for mobile trade-in activity, including some impacts related to COVID-19 from the shutdown of Asian markets earlier in the quarter. Unfavorable foreign exchange also impacted results. 
Looking at total revenue, net earned premiums and fees were up $265 million or 16%. The increase was driven primarily by higher fee income for mobile trade-in volumes and subscriber growth across North America and Asia Pacific. Expansion within extended service contracts also contributed to growth in the quarter. Within Global Automotive, revenue grew 9%, primarily reflecting prior-period sales of vehicle service contracts across all distribution channels. 
Looking ahead, as Alan mentioned, we are continuing to monitor trends and the impact of COVID-19 across the segment. While we believe mobile is well positioned given our large in-force subscriber base, trade-in volumes did decline significantly in the first few weeks of April, reflecting store closures and lower consumer demand for new devices. We expect volumes to rebound when stores reopen and carriers are able to resume in-store promotional activity, although timing of such widespread recovery remains unclear. 
Looking at our underwriting experience, we have seen a decline in mobile claims as a result of customers staying indoors. In most cases, this stable experience will not benefit our bottom line due to profit sharing or reinsurance agreements. 
In Global Automotive, near-term earnings should be relatively well protected from a slowdown due to how the business earns. However, we still have exposure related to reductions in vehicle service contract sales, which in April were down by roughly 40% year-over-year due to a decrease in vehicle sales. 
In general, new car sales typically earn a majority of income 3 to 5 years after being sold following the expiration of the manufacturers' warranties, thereby delaying the revenue impact. However, in the event of a prolonged downturn, we would expect to see an uptick in used car sales, which earn more quickly. 
The persistently low interest rate environment also creates some headwind. While Global Automotive does have a longer duration portfolio of 3 to 7 years, we do expect investment income to be pressured from lower investment yields coming from new business.
Throughout Global Lifestyle, we also expect continued pressure from foreign exchange volatility, especially in Latin America, due to the economic environment. So, while we expect Global Lifestyle to be impacted in 2020, this segment should be more resilient during an economic downturn relative to other consumer-type businesses. 
Moving to Global Housing. Net operating income for the quarter totaled $74 million, up slightly year-over-year despite higher reportable catastrophes from the Puerto Rico earthquakes. Excluding catastrophe losses, earnings increased $6 million. This was driven by favorable non-catastrophe loss experience and improved results
[Audio Gap]
property offerings, largely related to the absence of losses within small commercial as it continues to run off. 
Lender-placed income increased, reflecting higher premium rates, partially offset by a reduction of policies in force, including a loss of loans from the financially insolvent client we previously disclosed. That portfolio has now completely deboarded. 
Turning to revenue, Global Housing net earned premiums and fees were flat as growth in our special property and multifamily businesses was offset by the reduction in policies referenced earlier. The insolvent client portfolio also contributed to a 7 basis point year-over-year decline in the placement rate. 
As we continue to operate in this environment, we are tracking a few trends in Global Housing. In multifamily housing, we see a decline in new sales starting in mid-March. We continue to monitor sales, policy cancellations as well as the impact from premium deferrals, which today are primarily related to policyholders requesting premium leniency. While we initially saw a dip in claims, we are seeing activity normalize, reflecting the fact that policyholders are at home. 
Within lender-placed, we will continue to monitor the state of the overall housing market, including the potential impact of the current mortgage moratorium, which would delay placement of new policies but at the same time reduce lapsation. This business provides critical coverage to both homeowners and their lenders and provides downside protection should the economy deteriorate significantly. However, we would not anticipate any benefit to our placement rate this year. 
Lastly, our small commercial business continues to run off as expected, with only 8% of the original block of policies remaining. With regard to potential exposure on business interruption coverage associated with this business, we currently believe our risk is low given virus exclusions included in our policies. We will continue to track state actions and their implications. 
In summary, while we remain cautious on multifamily housing in light of the current uncertainty created by COVID-19, we continue to believe that Global Housing is well positioned to weather a prolonged economic downturn. 
Now let's move to Global Preneed. This segment reported $12 million of net operating income, up slightly year-over-year, driven by continued growth within the business. Revenue for Preneed was up 9%, driven by U.S. growth, including Final Need sales. 
As we look ahead, we expect some pressure from lower yields on new sales through the current interest rate environment. However, given the 10-year average duration of our investment portfolio, our existing block of business should not be significantly impacted for some years to come. 
As Alan mentioned, so far we haven't seen any significant spikes in mortality due to COVID-19. As a reminder, a large portion of our policies are concentrated in California, Texas, South Carolina and Tennessee. So far, these states have experienced lower mortality from COVID-19 compared to states in the Northeast. 
At Corporate, the net operating loss was $20 million versus $19 million in the prior year period. This was due to lower investment income in the Corporate segment, partially offset by lower employee-related expenses, including travel. We will continue to evaluate additional expense actions as necessary. 
In light of market volatility, I also wanted to provide an overview of our investment portfolio and strategy. In the first quarter, we recorded a $76 million mark-to-market loss in our investment portfolio. This reflects the decline in valuations of our equity securities and our CLOs, each contributing to about half of the total loss. 
Despite these losses, we believe that our $13.6 billion investment portfolio is well-diversified and high quality. Approximately 86% of our investments are comprised of fixed maturities and 95% of these securities are investment-grade rated. While interest rates are expected to remain relatively low for the foreseeable future, we believe we are well positioned to navigate this environment given the duration of our existing investment portfolio, along with our conservative low asset turnover approach. 
Our overall exposure to these sectors that have been hit the hardest by the current market turbulence is not significant. Investments in travel and leisure represent less than 0.5% of our investment portfolio. Energy makes up only 4% of our portfolio, and our investments tend to be in larger and more diversified energy companies. Retail represents 2% of our portfolio and is comprised of mostly large diversified household names. Our auto and airline exposures are each 1% or less of our portfolio. 
I would finish on the investment portfolio by saying we will continue to apply consistent investment approach. While we recognize every crisis is different, this is the same strategy that served us well during the financial crisis over a decade ago. 
Finally, I'd like to mention that in April we completed the outsourcing of the management of our core investment portfolio to Goldman Sachs Asset Management and Voya Investment Management. We believe that their investment expertise and scaled platforms coupled with ongoing oversight of our in-house team should serve us well going forward. 
Turning to the holding company liquidity, we ended March with $433 million or $208 million above our current minimum target level. These figures do not include the $200 million draw from our $450 million revolving credit facility, the proceeds of which are also held at the holding company. 
In the first quarter, dividends from our operating segments totaled $127 million. In addition to our quarterly corporate and interest expenses, key outflows in the first quarter included $57 million in share repurchases and $43 million in common and preferred stock dividends. 
As Alan mentioned, relative to capital deployment, we will exercise even greater caution in light of market volatility and as we enter hurricane season. We have a robust risk management program, including stress testing our capital, cash flows and liquidity under a variety of scenarios, considering this uncertain environment. 
Before wrapping up, I wanted to address 2 additional points. First, as you saw in our release, we booked a onetime tax benefit to net income amounting to $79 million. This was related to the enactment of the Federal CARES Act in March. The benefit is associated with the carryback of losses in 2018 to 5 years prior. This allowed us to accelerate deferred tax assets, which would have been recognized over the next 3 years at a lower tax rate.
Second, we still expect to close on the sale of Ike in the second quarter as planned, which will result in an expected net cash outflow of approximately $54 million plus seller financing of up to $40 million. Both the Ike and AFAS transactions will be reflected in second quarter holding company capital.
In conclusion, I echo Alan's gratitude to our employees and how they have responded during this unprecedented crisis. We are confident that we will emerge in a position of strength from this period. In the months ahead, we will continue to closely monitor trends and take appropriate steps to sustain our financial strength for the long term.
And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

Mark, let me start on that and then Richard, as always, feel free to add on some comments. If you think about mobile, one of the things we've seen over the last few years is that Q1 tends to be a pretty active quarter. And we saw that again in Q1 prior to the slowdown began the second half of March. So normally, Q2 is a slower quarter anyway in terms of buyback and trade-in activity, and that often rolls into Q3 as a slower quarter, just as people are waiting to see what the new phones might be. So I think, certainly, in the second and third quarters, we'll have less activity anyway, even if we start to see a recovery. 
And while we're on mobile, maybe just a couple of other thoughts about what we're seeing in that important line of business. You heard us in the prepared remarks talk about we've seen new sales slow down as stores are closed, largely across the U.S. and in other markets around the world. Even with that, we do expect subscriber growth. As we've talked about previously, we have these programs that have been launched in the last year or 2 that are going to continue to ramp. So even in a slower sales environment, we expect some growth in new subscribers. That will help offset the slowdown that we see in buyback and trade-in.
And then longer term, once we're through this crisis, it really -- whether we have a big bounce back in buyback trade-in or whether it's just a return to normal, it's going to depend a lot on what new phones come to market, what carriers elect to do. So again, we feel well positioned in mobile even as we go through this crisis. But Richard, what would you add?"

Similar to mobile, if you look at multifamily, it's a business that is really driven by people doing something, right? So in the March time frame, second half and into early April, we didn't see people moving. And so we don't have an ability to make a new sale. Now again, those moves may just be delayed and it could return if we get through the crisis in a reasonable time period.
The other thing that's unique on multifamily is we are seeing some requests for premium deferral. And that's either being driven -- a few states have mandated that, others were voluntarily providing it. It's not significant so far to our overall block, but it is something we're watching, and we are putting up an appropriate reserve in the event of people not being able to pay for their insurance that we're providing.
If we look longer term in multifamily, I think we're pretty optimistic about that business. If we get into any kind of downturn, people tend to rent more. We saw this in the last downturn, which obviously would be positive for that business. But more importantly, we're still early in rolling out our point of lease capability, which helps us provide a better experience and a greater attachment rate. We also see a major opportunity around the connected apartment as people, particularly with what's happened now, connectivity matters more than ever. 
So in both multifamily and in mobile, we're focused on ensuring we're there, we're delivering for our customers. We've been able to sustain our service levels. We're still repairing cellphones and getting them back in a timely basis. And we're doing all we can to help out our customers, both mobile and renters and, of course, across all of our businesses."

First of all, lender-placed, it's an important product for the mortgage industry. We're effectively there to support the functioning of the market, to protect policyholders and lenders. But in the short term, we don't really see a lot changing. If you look at the mortgage forbearance that's underway, it's not going to have a big impact on us one way or the other. And so really, if we do get into a downturn, our product tends to be placed later in that cycle. So someone needs to move into seriously delinquent and often into foreclosure. So if you look at the last downturn, which is really the data point we have, which was an extreme housing market downturn, today, we're at about 1.5%, 1.6% placement rate. In the last downturn, we peaked at about just under 3%. So that gives you some sense of at least what happened in the last downturn. Who knows if we'll have a downturn here, and I certainly hope we don't. But if we do, our business is strong. It's well positioned, and we've made significant advancements in the last 5 years on our compliance, our tracking infrastructure.

So the new subscribers are the biggest driver of that business over the last couple of years, and they're really coming from the new clients and programs that we've talked about that have been launched in the last couple of years. So for example, KDDI in Japan, Comcast and Charter in the U.S., et cetera. And those programs, once we launch them, it generally takes anywhere between 3 to 4 years. You need to go through a phone handset replacement cycle. So even if there are fewer sales now in the crisis, sales are still happening to a degree. So that's why they're going to grow.
Buyback trade-in was a big driver of our business back in like '15 and '16 when we really ramped it up. Over the last few years, it's been more stable. We haven't -- in key markets like the U.S. and Japan, you've seen the ownership of handsets lengthening. So people have gone to owning a handset for 3 years or in Japan 4 years. That's offset the growth we've had in subscribers. So that business has been more kind of flattish over the last couple of years. Now if we look forward, we see a significant wave of buyback trading coming. It may be delayed a little bit by the current crisis. But if you think about 5G, when that really starts to roll out, and it was going to start to roll out later this year in the U.S. -- we'll see how widely that really happens -- that will create a wave of activity for the next year or 2 in buyback trade-in, and we're well positioned.
The other important thing in mobile that's really driven our growth is we've been adding more services per subscriber. So if you recall when in the early days we had 1 service, now often we have up to 6 different sources of value with every agreement, where we're providing things like Premium Tech support, our onboard diagnostic technology in Pocket Geek, we're doing the buyback trade-in. And increasingly, we're doing an extended warranty for year 3 and year 4 of phone ownership. So overall, again, I think we're encouraged by our position. We expect to have continued growth; it just may not be at the same level this year as we've seen in past years."

So consumers have been adapting and adjusting for 7 or 8 weeks now. So it's early to see what really might happen. So what we're really focused on is, first and foremost, being there to service customers. If you think about it, we have this installed base of 300 million or so customers. They still need our support, whether it's for their phone or their car or their renters insurance, and we've been able to quickly pivot to work-from-home for most of our operating roles, and we've been able to meet and maintain meeting all of our service levels, which is really impressive and a huge thank you to our employees across the globe who've done that. So that's important.
Where might we see trends? I think it's too early to say. What we've seen is, for most things consumers are just being cautious about going out and buying anything at the moment, either because the stores are closed or they don't feel safe going out. We saw the lows so far in this crisis, the first week or 2 of April, with activity levels dropping 40% or 50% across a lot of the channels we serve. We're starting to see a little bit of recovery in the second half of April, although still well below pre-crisis levels. 
So again, if you look at our businesses, I think we're well positioned to weather this crisis quite well. We've got that installed base I mentioned. We have the diversity of portfolio. As you mentioned, we have LPI, which will be a countercyclical hedge if we get into that kind of downturn. We've got the embedded earnings on the balance sheet in Auto and Preneed. We do have things like if we do end up with an economic downturn out of this crisis, Auto, for example, generally, you have more used car sales in that environment. And if we sell on a used car, we start to earn much sooner than we do on a new car. And we've got that strong balance sheet and conservative investment philosophy that Richard talked about. So at the end of the day, we're going to continue to monitor all these trends, but we feel well positioned to be there to support our customers and to weather this crisis well."

When we come out the other side of this, we're going to be as strong with the same kind of track record in front of us as we've had in the last few years as a company. So what we're trying to do is we're being prudent. So things like deferring expenses, holding off on some hiring, being cautious on preserving capital just because you never know. But we are making strategic investments. For example, the investment in AFAS, that is one of the industry-leading franchises in auto. It really fills in for us the geography, particularly in Texas and the Southwest. It also brings capabilities that we can roll across and it's a very low relative execution risk for an M&A deal because we know the company well and we know the business well. So we went ahead and made the decision. And that dialogue has been ongoing with them for quite a while. So we felt it was appropriate. We're also investing -- one of the interesting trends that was already happening but will be accelerated by COVID-19 is the shift to digital, both on sales and service. And we've been investing against that for years. But in this crisis, the acceleration of that has moved forward dramatically. And we've been able to be there and support our clients with that. So we're fortunate we've made that investment, but we're going to continue to invest to move more things to digital. So we're making investments like that, that are against the long-term trends and our kind of strong market positions. And then we're just being cautious, because what we don't know and nobody knows is the duration of how long this might go on and whether we'll have multiple waves of this going on. So we're trying to strike that balance. But we feel really good about where our company is going to be at the other side of this crisis."

We're pleased with our second quarter performance. We reported operating earnings per share, excluding catastrophe losses, of $2.90, up 27% from the prior year period.

We reported operating earnings per share, excluding catastrophe losses, of $2.90, up 27% from the prior year period. Net operating income for the quarter, also excluding catastrophe losses, was $179 million, an increase of 24% from last year, demonstrating the continued strength and resiliency of our business. 
Results were above our expectations, reflecting the stability of our large installed customer base, significant client partnerships and embedded growth in Global Lifestyle. We also benefited from improved results in Global Housing. Declines in investment income and foreign exchange were more than offset by lower claims activity and expense management efforts. 
The initial negative impacts from COVID-19 in April gradually improved in May and June, resulting in a modest net positive to overall net operating income in the quarter. Year-to-date, net operating earnings per share, excluding catastrophe losses, grew 24%, and net operating income increased 21%. Even after adjusting for $16 million of onetime items during the first half of the year, our results came in at the high end of our modeled pandemic scenarios. 
Given our strong performance in the first half and improved visibility for the remainder of the year, we have decided to reinstate and increase our outlook for full year 2020. We now expect 12% to 16% growth in operating earnings per share, excluding catastrophe losses, an increase from our initial outlook of 10% to 14%. This reflects continued growth in Connected Living, expansion within multifamily housing and improved profitability in our specialty business. 
Our outlook assumes a continuation of current business trends, and therefore, does not take into account a material increase in infection rates from COVID-19, which could lead to a significant change in consumer behavior, access to distribution channels or impact to financial markets. While we expect earnings growth in the second half on a year-over-year basis, our outlook for the full year assumes a decline in earnings from the first 6 months of this year as we anticipate more normalized claims activity across most of our businesses and make incremental investments in our digital and customer experience capabilities. The second half of the year will also reflect lower investment income and foreign exchange headwinds, the absence of $16 million of onetime benefits as well as typical mobile seasonality. 
Looking at our balance sheet. Our liquidity position remains strong. In July, we repaid the $200 million credit facility draw in late March, which was done as a precautionary measure. 
Given the attractiveness of our stock and strong capital position, we expect to resume share repurchases in the third quarter, and we continue to expect to reach our objective of returning $1.35 billion of capital to shareholders between 2019 and 2021. As always, this is subject to a variety of factors, including no significant deterioration of economic or market conditions. 
Recent market transactions across our space further reinforce our view that our stock remains attractively priced. Earnings momentum in Global Lifestyle continues to be strong driven in particular by Connected Living. This business had a compound annual earnings growth rate of 38% between 2015 and 2019 led by mobile. 
Our installed base of customers, which represent a significant monthly recurring revenue stream, continues to expand. We are now at over 53 million mobile subscribers, up 70% since 2015. We've continued to provide value to consumers through services like trade in, upgrade and technology support as part of our fee-based offerings, resulting in better ownership experience and multiple profit pools beyond device protection. 
At the same time, we've continued to deepen our partnerships with market leaders to drive long-term profitable growth. We are pleased to announce that as Sprint becomes part of T-Mobile, we'll offer device protection to those new T-Mobile customers. We believe this is another example to support the long-term growth of our Connected Living business, and we are proud of our long-standing partnership with T-Mobile. 
In August, we also strengthened our mobile device trading capabilities in Asia-Pacific through the purchase of Alegre, a leading operator in the preowned mobile device market. After a small initial investment in 2018, we acquired the remaining equity for $12 million. 
Turning to Global Automotive. Our installed base now includes over 48 million vehicles. We've continued to strengthen our client partnerships by working with them to enhance the digital customer experience, offering live online dealer training and sales webinars. We will continue to use our scale and diverse distribution channels to grow the business over the long term, especially as we look at future opportunities with the connected car. 
Moving to Global Housing. Our lender-placed insurance and renters businesses both continue to contribute to our attractive above-market returns. Our lender-placed business plays a unique and vital role within the housing market, protecting both lenders and homeowners. We track over 32 million loans, including for 8 of the top 10 largest U.S. mortgage servicers. Since the beginning of 2019, we have renewed relationships with clients that represent nearly 80% of our loans tracked, solidifying our position as a market leader. 
We've been investing in a new technology platform to improve the customer experience. In addition, we've made progress with our efforts to streamline and reduce our operational cost. 
In our renters business, we've built a leadership position over the last 15 years. We now cover over 2.3 million renters and generate over $400 million in annual revenue. Since 2015, we've grown earnings at an 18% compound annual growth rate, with multifamily now representing roughly 1/3 of Global Housing's 2019 net operating income, excluding catastrophes, illustrating the franchise strength. We'll continue to invest to enhance the customer experience as this remains an important growth business for the company, especially as we think ahead of supporting consumers within the connected world. 
And in Global Preneed, we have more than 2 million policies and growing. This business, over time, gives us strong distributable cash flows with statutory earnings greater than GAAP earnings. Overall, the level of mortality risk remains lower relative to other life insurance-type products, ultimately contributing to above-market returns. 
More recently, we've introduced new fee-for-service offerings to support the growing senior lifestyle market such as Executor Assist. We believe our overall portfolio represents a compelling mix of above-market growth in countercyclical businesses with leading positions and a track record of innovation. 
These businesses generate significant cash flow to reinvest and return capital to shareholders. These are key characteristics which we believe set us apart as a long-term outperformer and enable us to create value for our shareholders even against the backup of uncertainty in the global macro environment. 
Before I turn it over to Richard, I want to take a moment to thank our employees for their unwavering focus in supporting each other and our customers during this time. In the past few months, we've taken additional steps to support our employees through an array of actions. These have included onetime relief payments for work-from-home employees, incentive bonuses for on-site staff, providing additional floating holidays and a number of well-being and mental health support services. The cost for these programs and other incremental expenses directly related to COVID-19 are reflected in net income, similar to last quarter. I'm proud and grateful for the exceptional service our employees have and continue to provide on behalf of our clients and our 300 million customers worldwide. 
While in the midst of grappling with COVID-19, we've also recognized the need to continue to advance diversity and inclusion at Assurant and within the communities we serve, particularly in light of the tragic murder of George Floyd and the others. For us, diversity and inclusion is not only about common decency and common sense, but it is also a strategic and business imperative. 
Building on past initiatives, we've hosted candid, enterprise-wide conversations with our employees on race to ensure that we recognize these issues in our society and within the workplace. We are evaluating additional actions to support a more diverse, equitable and inclusive community. 
All of this has continued to reinforce the criticality of supporting the evolving needs of all of our key stakeholders with purpose and commitment. In July, we announced several organizational changes to enable us to deliver on those objectives more effectively. 
Under the leadership of Francesca Luthi in a newly created role as Chief Administrative Officer, we have realigned human resources, facilities and procurement, along with marketing, communications, Investor Relations and corporate social responsibility, a move, I believe, is critical to ensure we bring a holistic view to integrated stakeholder management while, at the same time, elevating the employee experience to attract and retain the best and most diverse talent for the future. 
We also promoted Jay Rosenblum to Chief Legal Officer. He had been serving in that role in an interim capacity since February after joining us last year to lead our government relations and regulatory affairs team. Jay's diverse experience spans 25 years in various legal and HR roles, and I'm pleased to have him lead our global legal function. 
Overall, I'm exceptionally proud of our leaders and our 14,000 employees in how they have and will continue to live our values. I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review second quarter results, recent trends and our updated 2020 outlook in more detail. Richard?"

The segment reported earnings of $122 million, up 11% compared to the prior year period. This increase was primarily driven by continued mobile growth, mainly from programs added in the last several years in North America and Asia-Pacific. Lower claims activity outside of the U.S. in Connected Living and auto also helped improve results. 
Our mobile trading business benefited from higher average selling prices due to scarce supply for used devices. This was partially offset by lower overall volumes due to COVID-19. 
The Global Automotive reflected a $4 million discrete client benefit in addition to reduced claims equity, mainly from our OEM clients outside of the U.S. as a result of COVID-19 stay-at-home orders. Overall earnings growth was partially offset by a decline in Global Financial Services from weaker results in Canada and anticipated declines in legacy credit insurance. Unfavorable foreign exchange also pressured results in the quarter. 
Looking at total revenue for lifestyle. Net earned premiums and fees were down $40 million or 2%. The decrease was driven primarily by lower mobile trade in volumes due to store closures from COVID-19 and foreign exchange movements. This was partially offset by increased enrollment and new mobile programs, especially as carrier stores began to reopen in the latter part of the quarter. 
Within Globe Automotive, revenue grew 3%, primarily reflecting prior period sales of vehicle service contracts. Sales in auto have rebounded since April and are nearly back to pre-COVID levels year-over-year. We will continue to monitor trends as sales levels today will impact future earnings for the business. 
Looking forward to full year 2020, we expect growth in lifestyle's net operating income compared to full year 2019. However, we also expect that earnings in the second half of the year will be lower compared to the strong first half results. 
This is due to 5 key factors. First, we recognized $16 million of onetime benefits in the first 6 months of the year, $4 million of which was incurred in the second quarter. We do not expect these items to reoccur in the second half of the year. 
Second, we expect claims activity in Connected Living and auto to normalize at higher levels in the coming quarters as the global economy continues to reopen. 
Third, similar to previous years, the timing and availability for new phone introductions will impact trade-in activity in the second half of the year. We are not, though, assuming any material increases in volumes before year-end. 
Fourth, we're ramping up our investments in digital and customer experience capabilities to further increase our competitive differentiation. 
And finally, we expect both foreign exchange and lower investment income to remain headwinds into the second half of the year. 
I will also note that effective July 1, following a change in contract terms, we're transitioning our revenue accounting treatment from a gross sales basis per device to a flat fee per device for one of our mobile trade-in and upgrade programs. This will reduce our fees and other income by approximately $275 million on an annualized basis. Lower cost of goods sold, embedded in lifestyle's SG&A, will substantially offset this decrease. 
We are pleased with this change as it will remove some of the revenue and expense variability we have historically seen in our financial results. It will also mitigate supply and demand pricing risk in the future. 
Moving now to Global housing. Net operating income for the second quarter totaled $85 million, an increase of $14 million or 19% year-over-year despite higher reportable catastrophes. Excluding catastrophe losses, earnings of $96 million represented an increase of $27 million or 39% year-over-year. Just over half of the increase was due to favorable noncat loss experienced across all major products, reflecting lower overall claims frequency and improvements in underwriting, including the benefits from artificial intelligence and claims processing initiatives. Also, the absence of losses from small commercial, along with growth in certain other specialty products, contributed to the increase. 
Lender-placed results increased year-over-year. Higher premium rates and favorable loss experience were partially offset by a reduction of policies in force. This reduction was mainly related to the previously disclosed financially insolvent client and lower REO volumes due to the current foreclosure moratoriums. 
The modest sequential increase in the placement rate to 1.56% was attributable to a shift in business mix. It is not an indication of broader macro housing market shifts. Multifamily housing earnings were up slightly due to favorable noncatastrophe loss experience and modest growth from affinity partners. 
Turning to Global Housing revenues. Net earned premiums and fees decreased 4%, mainly from 3 items: the insolvent client, low REO volumes and the exit of small commercial. This decrease was partially offset by growth in our Specialty Property and multifamily housing businesses. 
Moving to multifamily housing. Revenue increased 4% year-over-year driven mainly by growth from our affinity partners. The impact of COVID-19 has been minimal year-to-date, although we continue to monitor state actions related to premium deferrals. 
At the end of June, we completed our 2020 catastrophe reinsurance program, maintaining our $80 million per event retention and increasing our multiyear coverage to nearly 50% of our U.S. power. We also reduced our overall risk exposure, primarily through the exit of small commercial. Overall, we were able to leverage strong relationships with our reinsurance partners to keep rate increases on the lower end of the overall market, but we also recognize those higher costs may persist into the future. 
Looking forward to the full year 2020, we expect Global Housing net operating income, excluding cats, to increase over full year 2019 earnings driven by improved results in our specialty businesses and growth in multifamily housing. We also believe the results for the second half of the year will be lower than the first half for Global Housing. 
This is due to 4 key factors: first, we expect a more normalized level of claims frequency as previously mentioned; second, we expect REO volumes to continue to be reduced throughout the remainder of the year; third, the absence of income from the financially insolvent client and lender-placed; and finally, this segment will also continue to be impacted by lower investment income due to the lower yields available in the current interest rate environment. 
While lender-placed should grow due to the countercyclical nature of the business if economic conditions worsen, today's mortgage industry and economic environment differs significantly from the housing crisis over 10 years ago. For example, mortgage loan underwriting standards have tightened, with the number of subprime and adjustable rate mortgages down over 60%, and homeowners today have higher rates of home equity compared to that period. 
Now let's move to Global Preneed. The segment reported $14 million of net operating income, a $3 million decrease compared to second quarter of 2019. This was driven by a combination of lower investment yields and a modest increase in mortality due to COVID-19. We continue to monitor mortality trends, especially in California, Texas and South Carolina, given our policy concentration in those areas. So far, we have not experienced significant increases. 
Revenue for preneed was up slightly, supported by sales in the U.S. And while face sales have begun to rebound recently given funeral home reopenings and increased online sales since April, July year-over-year face sales were still down approximately 15%. We would expect new sales to continue to fluctuate. Overall, for Global Preneed, we believe 2020 earnings will increase modestly compared to 2019 reported results. 
For the second half of the year, we expect earnings to be up slightly versus the first half of the year due to more favorable mortality trends. We'll continue to monitor these trends as our current outlook does not assume a significant worsening in COVID-19 cases. We expect the reduction in mortality to be partially offset by investment income declines. 
At corporate, the net operating loss was $27 million versus $24 million in the second quarter of 2019. This was due to a lower tax rate from the consolidating tax rate adjustment and less investment income from lower yields on cash assets. For the full year, we expect the corporate net operating loss to be in the range of $86 million to $90 million as the result of lower investment income and onetime transition costs associated with the outsourcing of our investment management function. 
Across Assurant, our ongoing expense management efforts are contributing to our results. In addition, this year, we benefited from lower travel expenses due to COVID-19 restrictions as well as a reduction in discretionary spending, including deferring hiring for some positions. We are filling all critical roles, particularly those needed to meet our client customer expectations. As we look to sustain profitable growth, we expect to continue to invest in our core capabilities in the upcoming quarters while closely managing discretionary spend, given the continued uncertainty from COVID-19. 
Next, I want to provide a brief update on our investment portfolio. Overall, our $12.6 billion portfolio of fixed maturities is of high-quality, well-diversified and managed for its income yield with low turnover. And as previously mentioned, we have minimal exposure to harder-hit sectors like energy, hospitality, retail stores and airlines. 
Investment yield on our total investment portfolio dropped by 55 basis points year-over-year to 3.62%. This was largely driven by a decline in short-term cash yields. While we continue to manage the portfolio to preserve yield, our expectation is that our investment income will remain under pressure for some time as we do expect interest rates will remain relatively low for the foreseeable future. However, we believe our consistent investment approach will continue to serve us well as it has in the past. 
In conjunction with our decision to outsource the management of our core investment portfolio, we sold our CLO platform for a modest gain in July. The sale will be recorded in the third quarter. While we will still have a small amount of investments in CLOs, our exposure to the asset class has been significantly reduced. 
Turning to holding company liquidity. We ended June with $357 million or $132 million above our current minimum target level. This excludes the $200 million credit facility draw, which was reimbursed in July. 
In the second quarter, dividends from our operating segments totaled $157 million or 71% of segment earnings. In addition to our quarterly corporate and interest expenses, we also bought back $26 million of stock. 
As we have indicated, we slowed and then ultimately paused share repurchases in the second quarter. We paid $44 million in common and preferred stock and dividends. We acquired AFAS for $158 million, and we sold EK, which resulted in a cash outflow of $51 million from the holding company. 
In late July, we also received a onetime tax cash benefit related to the acceleration of our net operating losses, including the CARES Act passed in March. As a result, liquidity at the holding company will increase by $84 million in the third quarter. 
For the full year, we expect segment dividends to approximate segment earnings. This is subject to the growth of the businesses, rating agency and regulatory capital requirements and the performance of the investment portfolio. 
As Alan mentioned, we expect to resume buybacks in the third quarter, and we'll continue to manage our capital prudently. Our approach to buybacks will be measured as we continue to monitor business performance as well as the broader macroeconomic and credit market environments. 
In summary, we demonstrated strong first half performance while navigating the challenges of COVID-19. As we focus on continuing to deliver on our financial commitments for 2020, we will continue to invest in our growth businesses for the future while monitoring global market trends.

So that's very positive. It is only go forward, though, which is typical in our market. So we're starting with 0 former Sprint customers. 
It will take time to grow that book of business, although, obviously, it's a very positive long-term thing.

And what we've seen even in July, for example, if you go through the various sectors, auto new sales of our products in July were back at or above pre-COVID levels even as there's disruption in the U.S. marketplace. If you look at mobile, we mentioned that trading activity in July was back what we expected earlier in the year. Multifamily, we were impacted early by COVID, clearly. But as we've gotten into July, we've again seen the new sales rebound and be back to what we expected to see. So pretty much across the board. The exception is probably preneed. Preneed new sales were still lagging 10% to 15% below where they were same year pre-COVID. 
But our business is strong and really driven by that installed base.

We do always look at a multiyear period because over time, short-term fluctuations might impact any given year. But if you look at net operating earnings growth, so this is ex cat, not EPS, but earnings, we grew earnings 11% last year. If you look at the midpoint of our new outlook, we're looking at, at least 12% earnings growth this year. So we're ahead both in '19 and '20 versus our long term. 
So as we think about 2021, I would say a few things.  We have a strong track record of profitable growth. I think we've demonstrated that we have a resilient business model that's been proven to be able to navigate the pandemic. We have strong cash flow generation, and we still expect to grow in 2021. It's obviously very early. So we haven't completed all of our planning and modeling for next year. But we are ahead. And so we may grow a little slower next year than we might have originally thought just because we've grown more rapidly in '19 and '20. 
But we remain confident that we will continue to grow earnings over time and next year really driven off of our installed base of customers, some of the new programs that we've just won. And we just announced, for example, the Sprint, T-Mobile. And just -- we continue to expand our offerings. The purchase of Alegre in Australia is another example, which really allows us to strengthen our repair and logistics capability, not only in Australia but in Asia-Pacific. So we'll provide an update later, but we feel good about the long-term profitable growth of our company."

We're pleased with our second quarter performance. We reported operating earnings per share, excluding catastrophe losses, of $2.90, up 27% from the prior year period.

We reported operating earnings per share, excluding catastrophe losses, of $2.90, up 27% from the prior year period. Net operating income for the quarter, also excluding catastrophe losses, was $179 million, an increase of 24% from last year, demonstrating the continued strength and resiliency of our business.
Results were above our expectations, reflecting the stability of our large installed customer base, significant client partnerships and embedded growth in Global Lifestyle. We also benefited from improved results in Global Housing. Declines in investment income and foreign exchange were more than offset by lower claims activity and expense management efforts.
The initial negative impacts from COVID-19 in April gradually improved in May and June, resulting in a modest net positive to overall net operating income in the quarter.
Year-to-date, net operating earnings per share, excluding catastrophe losses, grew 24%, and net operating income increased 21%. Even after adjusting for $16 million of onetime items during the first half of the year, our results came in at the high end of our modeled pandemic scenarios.
Given our strong performance in the first half and improved visibility for remainder of the year, we have decided to reinstate and increase our outlook for full year 2020. We now expect 12% to 16% growth in operating earnings per share, excluding catastrophe losses, an increase from our initial outlook of 10% to 14%. This reflects continued growth in Connected Living, expansion within multifamily housing and improved profitability in our specialty business.
Our outlook assumes a continuation of current business trends and, therefore, does not take into account a material increase in infection rates from COVID-19, which could lead to a significant change in consumer behavior, access to distribution channels or impact to financial markets.
While we expect earnings growth in the second half on a year-over-year basis, our outlook for the full year assumes a decline in earnings from the first 6 months of this year as we anticipate more normalized claims activity across most of our businesses and make incremental investments in our digital and customer experience capabilities.
The second half of the year will also reflect lower investment income and foreign exchange headwinds, the absence of $16 million of onetime benefits as well as typical mobile seasonality.
Looking at our balance sheet. Our liquidity position remains strong. In July, we repaid the $200 million credit facility draws in late March, which was done as a precautionary measure.
Given the attractiveness of our stock and strong capital position, we expect to resume share repurchases in the third quarter, and we continue to expect to reach our objective of returning $1.35 billion of capital to shareholders between 2019 and 2021. As always, this is subject to a variety of factors, including no significant deterioration of economic or market conditions.
Recent market transactions across our space further reinforce our view that our stock remains attractively priced. Earnings momentum in Global Lifestyle continues to be strong, driven in particular by Connected Living. This business had a compound annual earnings growth rate of 38% between 2015 and 2019 led by mobile.
Our installed base of customers, which represent a significant monthly recurring revenue stream, continues to expand. We are now at over 53 million mobile subscribers, up 70% since 2015. We've continued to provide value to consumers through services like trade in, upgrade and technology support as part of our fee-based offerings, resulting in a better ownership experience and multiple profit pools beyond device protection.
At the same time, we've continued to deepen our partnerships with market leaders to drive long-term profitable growth. We are pleased to announce that as Sprint becomes part of T-Mobile, we'll offer device protection to those new T-Mobile customers. We believe this is another example to support the long-term growth of our Connected Living business, and we are proud of our long-standing partnership with T-Mobile.
In August, we also strengthened our mobile device trading capabilities in Asia Pacific through the purchase of Alegre, a leading operator in the preowned mobile device market. After a small initial investment in 2018, we acquired the remaining equity for $12 million.
Turning to Global Automotive. Our installed base now includes over 48 million vehicles. We've continued to strengthen our client partnerships by working with them to enhance the digital customer experience, offering live online dealer training and sales webinars. We will continue to use our scale and diverse distribution channels to grow the business over the long term, especially as we look at future opportunities with the connected car.
Moving to Global Housing. Our lender-placed insurance and renters businesses both continue to contribute to our attractive above-market returns. Our lender-placed business plays a unique and vital role within the housing market, protecting both lenders and homeowners. We track over 32 million loans, including for 8 of the top 10 largest U.S. mortgage servicers. Since the beginning of 2019, we have renewed relationships with clients that represent nearly 80% of our loans tracked, solidifying our position as a market leader.
We've been investing in a new technology platform to improve the customer experience. In addition, we've made progress with our efforts to streamline and reduce our operational cost.
In our renters business, we've built a leadership position over the last 15 years. We now cover over 2.3 million renters and generate over $400 million in annual revenue. Since 2015, we've grown earnings at an 18% compound annual growth rate, with multifamily now representing roughly 1/3 of Global Housing's 2019 net operating income, excluding catastrophes, illustrating the franchise strength. We'll continue to invest to enhance the customer experience as this remains an important growth business for the company, especially as we think ahead of supporting consumers within the connected world.
And in Global Preneed, we have more than 2 million policies and growing. This business, over time, gives us strong distributable cash flows with statutory earnings greater than GAAP earnings. Overall, the level of mortality risk remains lower relative to other life insurance-type products, ultimately contributing to above-market returns.
More recently, we've introduced new fee-for-service offerings to support the growing senior lifestyle market such as Executor Assist. We believe our overall portfolio represents a compelling mix of above-market growth in countercyclical businesses with leading positions and a track record of innovation. These businesses generate significant cash flow to reinvest and return capital to shareholders. These are key characteristics, which we believe set us apart as a long-term outperformer and enable us to create value for our shareholders even against the backdrop of uncertainty in the global macro environment.
Before I turn it over to Richard, I want to take a moment to thank our employees for their unwavering focus in supporting each other and our customers during this time. In the past few months, we've taken additional steps to support our employees through an array of actions. These have included onetime relief payments for work-from-home employees, incentive bonuses for on-site staff, providing additional floating holidays and a number of well-being and mental health support services. The cost for these programs and other incremental expenses directly related to COVID-19 are reflected in net income, similar to last quarter. I'm proud and grateful for the exceptional service our employees have and continue to provide on behalf of our clients and our 300 million customers worldwide.
While in the midst of grappling with COVID-19, we've also recognized the need to continue to advance diversity and inclusion at Assurant and within the communities we serve, particularly in light of the tragic murder of George Floyd and many others. For us, diversity and inclusion is not only about common decency and common sense, but is also a strategic and business imperative. Building on past initiatives, we've hosted candid, enterprise-wide conversations with our employees on race to ensure that we recognize these issues in our society and within the workplace. We are evaluating additional actions to support in a more diverse, equitable and inclusive community.
All of this has continued to reinforce the criticality of supporting the evolving needs of all of our key stakeholders with purpose and commitment. In July, we announced several organizational changes to enable us to deliver on those objectives more effectively.
Under the leadership of Francesca Luthi in a newly created role as Chief Administrative Officer, we have realigned human resources, facilities and procurement, along with marketing, communications, Investor Relations and corporate social responsibility, a move, I believe, is critical to ensure we bring a holistic view to integrated stakeholder management, while at the same time, elevating the employee experience to attract and retain the best and most diverse talent for the future.
We also promoted Jay Rosenblum to Chief Legal Officer. He had been serving in that role in an interim capacity since February after joining us last year to lead our government relations and regulatory affairs team. Jay's diverse experience spans 25 years in various legal and HR roles, and I'm pleased to have him lead our global legal function.
Overall, I'm exceptionally proud of our leaders and our 14,000 employees in how they have and will continue to live our values.
I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review second quarter results, recent trends and our updated 2020 outlook in more detail. Richard?"

Let's start with Global Lifestyle. The segment reported earnings of $122 million, up 11% compared to the prior year period.

The segment reported earnings of $122 million, up 11% compared to the prior year period. This increase was primarily driven by continued mobile growth, mainly from programs added in the last several years in North America and Asia Pacific. Lower claims activity outside of the U.S. in Connected Living and auto also drove improved results.
Our mobile trade-in business benefited from higher average selling prices due to scarce supply for used devices. This was partially offset by lower overall volumes due to COVID-19.
Global Automotive reflected a $4 million discrete client benefit in addition to reduced claims activity, mainly from our OEM clients outside of the U.S. as a result of COVID-19 stay-at-home orders.
Overall earnings growth was partially offset by a decline in Global Financial Services from weaker results in Canada and anticipated declines in legacy credit insurance. Unfavorable foreign exchange also pressured results in the quarter.
Looking at total revenue for lifestyle. Net earned premiums and fees were down $40 million or 2%. The decrease was driven primarily by lower mobile trade-in volumes due to store closures from COVID-19 and foreign exchange movements. This was partially offset by increased enrollment in new mobile programs, especially as carrier stores began to reopen in the latter part of the quarter.
Within Globe Automotive, revenue grew 3%, primarily reflecting prior period sales of vehicle service contracts. Sales in auto have rebounded since April and are nearly back to pre-COVID levels year-over-year. We will continue to monitor trends as sales levels today will impact future earnings for the business.
Looking forward to full year 2020, we expect growth in lifestyle's net operating income compared to full year 2019. However, we also expect that earnings in the second half of the year will be lower compared to the strong first half results. This is due to 5 key factors.
First, we recognized $16 million of onetime benefits in the first 6 months of the year, $4 million of which was incurred in the second quarter. We do not expect these items to reoccur in the second half of the year.
Second, we expect claims activity in Connected Living and auto to normalize at higher levels in the coming quarters as the global economy continues to reopen.
Third, similar to previous years, the timing and availability for new phone introductions will impact trade-in activity in the second half of the year. We are not, though, assuming any material increases in volumes before year-end.
Fourth, we're ramping up our investments in digital and customer experience capabilities to further increase our competitive differentiation.
And finally, we expect both foreign exchange and lower investment income to remain headwinds into the second half of the year.
I will also note that effective July 1, following a change in contract terms, we're transitioning our revenue accounting treatment from a gross sales basis per device to a flat fee per device for one of our mobile trade-in and upgrade programs. This will reduce our fees and other income by approximately $275 million on an annualized basis. Lower cost of goods sold, embedded in lifestyle's SG&A, will substantially offset this decrease.
We are pleased with this change as it will remove some of the revenue and expense variability we have historically seen in our financial results. It will also mitigate supply and demand pricing risk in the future.
Moving now to Global Housing. Net operating income for the second quarter totaled $85 million, an increase of $14 million or 19% year-over-year despite higher reportable catastrophes. Excluding catastrophe losses, earnings of $96 million represented an increase of $27 million or 39% year-over-year. Just over half of the increase was due to favorable noncat loss experienced across all major products, reflecting lower overall claims frequency and improvements in underwriting, including the benefits from artificial intelligence and claims processing initiatives. Also, the absence of losses from small commercial, along with growth in certain other specialty products, contributed to the increase.
Lender-placed results increased year-over-year. Higher premium rates and favorable loss experience were partially offset by a reduction of policies in force. This reduction was mainly related to the previously disclosed financially insolvent client and lower REO volumes due to the current foreclosure moratoriums.
The modest sequential increase in the placement rate to 1.56% was attributable to a shift in business mix. It is not an indication of broader macro housing market shifts.
Multifamily housing earnings were up slightly due to favorable noncatastrophe loss experience and modest growth from affinity partners.
Turning to Global Housing revenues. Net earned premiums and fees decreased 4%, mainly from 3 items: insolvent client, low REO volumes and the exit of small commercial. This decrease was partially offset by growth in our Specialty Property and multifamily housing businesses.
Moving to multifamily housing. Revenue increased 4% year-over-year driven mainly by growth from our affinity partners. The impact of COVID-19 has been minimal year-to-date, although we continue to monitor state actions related to premium deferrals.
At the end of June, we completed our 2020 catastrophe reinsurance program, maintaining our $80 million per event retention and increasing our multiyear coverage to nearly 50% of our U.S. power. We also reduced our overall risk exposure, primarily through the exit of small commercial. Overall, we were able to leverage strong relationships with our reinsurance partners to keep rate increases on the lower end of the overall market, but we also recognize those higher costs may persist into the future.
Looking forward to the full year 2020, we expect Global Housing net operating income, excluding cats, to increase over full year 2019 earnings driven by improved results in our specialty businesses and growth in multifamily housing. We also believe the results for the second half of the year will be lower than the first half for Global Housing. This is due to 4 key factors: first, we expect a more normalized level of claims frequency as previously mentioned; second, we expect REO volumes to continue to be reduced throughout the remainder of the year; third, the absence of income from the financially insolvent client and lender-placed; and finally, this segment will also continue to be impacted by lower investment income due to the lower yields available in the current interest rate environment.
While lender-placed should grow due to the countercyclical nature of the business if economic conditions worsen, today's mortgage industry and economic environment differs significantly from the housing crisis over 10 years ago. For example, mortgage loan underwriting standards have tightened, with the number of subprime and adjustable rate mortgages down over 60%, and homeowners today have higher rates of home equity compared to that period.
Now let's move to Global Preneed. The segment reported $14 million of net operating income, a $3 million decrease compared to the second quarter of 2019. This was driven by a combination of lower investment yields and a modest increase in mortality due to COVID-19. We continue to monitor mortality trends, especially in California, Texas and South Carolina, given our policy concentration in those areas. So far, we have not experienced significant increases.
Revenue for Preneed was up slightly, supported by sales in the U.S. And while face sales have begun to rebound recently given funeral home reopenings and increased online sales since April, July year-over-year face sales were still down approximately 15%. We would expect new sales to continue to fluctuate. Overall, for Global Preneed, we believe 2020 earnings will increase modestly compared to 2019 reported results.
For the second half of the year, we expect earnings to be up slightly versus the first half of the year due to more favorable mortality trends. We'll continue to monitor these trends as our current outlook does not assume a significant worsening in COVID-19 cases. We expect the reduction in mortality to be partially offset by investment income declines.
At corporate, the net operating loss was $27 million versus $24 million in the second quarter of 2019. This was due to a lower tax rate from the consolidating tax rate adjustment and less investment income from lower yields on cash assets. For the full year, we expect the corporate net operating loss to be in the range of $86 million to $90 million as the result of lower investment income and onetime transition costs associated with the outsourcing of our investment management function.
Across Assurant, our ongoing expense management efforts are contributing to our results. In addition, this year, we benefited from lower travel expenses due to COVID-19 restrictions as well as a reduction in discretionary spending, including deferring hiring for some positions. We are though filling all critical roles, particularly those needed to meet our client customer expectations. As we look to sustain profitable growth, we expect to continue to invest in our core capabilities in the upcoming quarters, while closely managing discretionary spend, given the continued uncertainty from COVID-19.
Next, I want to provide a brief update on our investment portfolio. Overall, our $12.6 billion portfolio of fixed maturities is of high quality, well diversified and managed for its income yield with low turnover. And as previously mentioned, we have minimal exposure to harder-hit sectors like energy, hospitality, retail stores and airlines.
Investment yield on our total investment portfolio dropped by 55 basis points year-over-year to 3.62%. This was largely driven by a decline in short-term cash yields. While we continue to manage the portfolio to preserve yield, our expectation is that our investment income will remain under pressure for some time as we do expect interest rates will remain relatively low for the foreseeable future. However, we believe our consistent investment approach will continue to serve us well as it has in the past.
In conjunction with our decision to outsource the management of our core investment portfolio, we sold our CLO platform for a modest gain in July. The sale will be recorded in the third quarter. While we will still have a small amount of investments in CLOs, our exposure to the asset class has been significantly reduced.
Turning to holding company liquidity. We ended June with $357 million or $132 million above our current minimum target level. This excludes the $200 million credit facility draw, which was reimbursed in July.
In the second quarter, dividends from our operating segments totaled $157 million or 71% of segment earnings. In addition to our quarterly corporate and interest expenses, we also bought back $26 million of stock.
As we have indicated, we slowed and then ultimately paused share repurchases in the second quarter. We paid $44 million in common and preferred stock and dividends. We acquired AFAS for $158 million, and we sold EK, which resulted in a cash outflow of $51 million from the holding company.
In late July, we also received a onetime tax cash benefit related to the acceleration of our net operating losses, included in the CARES Act passed in March. As a result, liquidity at the holding company will increase by $84 million in the third quarter.
For the full year, we expect segment dividends to approximate segment earnings. This is subject to the growth of the businesses, rating agency and regulatory capital requirements and the performance of the investment portfolio.
As Alan mentioned, we expect to resume buybacks in the third quarter, and we'll continue to manage our capital prudently. Our approach to buybacks will be measured as we continue to monitor business performance as well as the broader macroeconomic and credit market environments.
In summary, we demonstrated strong first half performance, while navigating the challenges of COVID-19. As we focus on continuing to deliver on our financial commitments for 2020, we will continue to invest in our growth businesses for the future while monitoring global market trends.
And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

And what we've seen even in July, for example, if you go through the various sectors, auto new sales of our products in July were back at or above pre-COVID levels even as there's disruption in the U.S. marketplace. If you look at mobile, we mentioned that trade-in activity in July was back what we expected earlier in the year. Multifamily, we were impacted early by COVID, clearly. But as we've gotten into July, we've again seen the new sales rebound and be back to what we expected to see. So pretty much across the board. The exception is probably Preneed. Preneed new sales are still lagging 10% to 15% below where they were same year pre-COVID.
But our business is strong and really driven by that installed base.

We are seeing a little bit lower claims than expected in places like Europe, again, probably a reflection of the shutdown, but we're starting to see that normalize as we head into Q3.

And our sales are pretty much back to what we expect this for in July. So we were off track, but pretty much back on track now. And if I really step back on our multifamily business, we're really proud of the franchise we've built. We now have 2.3 million policyholders. We're profitable. We've been growing that franchise rapidly. Over the last few years, we've outgrown the market, even as different competitors have entered. And it's really driven by our strong diverse distribution with both property management companies as well as our affinity partners. It's driven by our ongoing investments in digital and CX, which helps us sustain a really competitive, attractive product for consumers.
And then we've got a lot of potential over time with our point-of-lease product, which has gone slowly this year just as landlords have been disrupted with COVID-19. But over time, we expect penetration to grow as we roll out our point-of-lease, which really provides a seamless kind of consumer experience as they move into a property."

We do always look at a multiyear period because over time, short-term fluctuations might impact any given year. But if you look at net operating earnings growth, so this is ex cat, not EPS, but earnings, we grew earnings 11% last year. If you look at the midpoint of our new outlook, we're looking at, at least 12% earnings growth this year. So we're ahead both in '19 and '20 versus our long term.
So as we think about 2021, I would say a few things.  We have a strong track record of profitable growth. I think we've demonstrated that we have a resilient business model that's been proven to be able to navigate the pandemic. We have strong cash flow generation, and we still expect to grow in 2021. It's obviously very early. So we haven't completed all of our planning and modeling for next year. But we are ahead. And so we may grow a little slower next year than we might have originally thought just because we've grown more rapidly in '19 and '20.
But we remain confident that we will continue to grow earnings over time and next year really driven off of our installed base of customers, some of the new programs that we've just won. And we just announced, for example, the Sprint, T-Mobile. And just -- we continue to expand our offerings. The purchase of Alegre in Australia is another example, which really allows us to strengthen our repair and logistics capability, not only in Australia but in Asia Pacific. So we'll provide an update later, but we feel good about the long-term profitable growth of our company."

We're pleased with our second quarter performance. We reported operating earnings per share, excluding catastrophe losses, of $2.90, up 27% from the prior year period. Net operating income for the quarter, also exc",1548,"Thanks, Suzanne. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our second quarter performance. We reported operating earnings per share, excluding catastrophe losses, of $2.90, up 27% from the prior year period. Net operating income for the quarter, also excluding catastrophe losses, was $179 million, an increase of 24% from last year, demonstrating the continued strength and resiliency of our business.
Results were above our expectations, reflecting the stability of our large installed customer base, significant client partnerships and embedded growth in Global Lifestyle. We also benefited from improved results in Global Housing. Declines in investment income and foreign exchange were more than offset by lower claims activity and expense management efforts.
The initial negative impacts from COVID-19 in April gradually improved in May and June, resulting in a modest net positive to overall net operating income in the quarter.
Year-to-date, net operating earnings per share, excluding catastrophe losses, grew 24%, and net operating income increased 21%. Even after adjusting for $16 million of onetime items during the first half of the year, our results came in at the high end of our modeled pandemic scenarios.
Given our strong performance in the first half and improved visibility for remainder of the year, we have decided to reinstate and increase our outlook for full year 2020. We now expect 12% to 16% growth in operating earnings per share, excluding catastrophe losses, an increase from our initial outlook of 10% to 14%. This reflects continued growth in Connected Living, expansion within multifamily housing and improved profitability in our specialty business.
Our outlook assumes a continuation of current business trends and therefore, does not take into account a material increase in infection rates from COVID-19, which could lead to a significant change in consumer behavior, access to distribution channels or impact to financial markets.
While we expect earnings growth in the second half on a year-over-year basis, our outlook for the full year assumes a decline in earnings from the first 6 months of this year as we anticipate more normalized claims activity across most of our businesses and make incremental investments in our digital and customer experience capabilities.
The second half of the year will also reflect lower investment income and foreign exchange headwinds, the absence of $16 million of onetime benefits as well as typical mobile seasonality.
Looking at our balance sheet. Our liquidity position remains strong. In July, we repaid the $200 million credit facility draws in late March, which was done as a precautionary measure.
Given the attractiveness of our stock and strong capital position, we expect to resume share repurchases in the third quarter, and we continue to expect to reach our objective of returning $1.35 billion of capital to shareholders between 2019 and 2021. As always, this is subject to a variety of factors, including no significant deterioration of economic or market conditions.
Recent market transactions across our space further reinforce our view that our stock remains attractively priced. Earnings momentum in Global Lifestyle continues to be strong, driven in particular by Connected Living. This business had a compound annual earnings growth rate of 38% between 2015 and 2019 led by mobile.
Our installed base of customers, which represent a significant monthly recurring revenue stream, continues to expand. We are now at over 53 million mobile subscribers, up 70% since 2015. We've continued to provide value to consumers through services like trade in, upgrade and technology support as part of our fee-based offerings, resulting in a better ownership experience and multiple profit pools beyond device protection.
At the same time, we've continued to deepen our partnerships with market leaders to drive long-term profitable growth. We are pleased to announce that as Sprint becomes part of T-Mobile, we'll offer device protection to those new T-Mobile customers. We believe this is another example to support the long-term growth of our Connected Living business, and we are proud of our long-standing partnership with T-Mobile.
In August, we also strengthened our mobile device trading capabilities in Asia Pacific through the purchase of Alegre, a leading operator in the preowned mobile device market. After a small initial investment in 2018, we acquired the remaining equity for $12 million.
Turning to Global Automotive. Our installed base now includes over 48 million vehicles. We've continued to strengthen our client partnerships by working with them to enhance the digital customer experience, offering live online dealer training and sales webinars. We will continue to use our scale and diverse distribution channels to grow the business over the long term, especially as we look at future opportunities with the connected car.
Moving to Global Housing. Our lender-placed insurance and renters businesses both continue to contribute to our attractive above-market returns. Our lender-placed business plays a unique and vital role within the housing market, protecting both lenders and homeowners. We track over 32 million loans, including for 8 of the top 10 largest U.S. mortgage servicers. Since the beginning of 2019, we have renewed relationships with clients that represent nearly 80% of our loans tracked, solidifying our position as a market leader.
We've been investing in a new technology platform to improve the customer experience. In addition, we've made progress with our efforts to streamline and reduce our operational cost.
In our renters business, we've built a leadership position over the last 15 years. We now cover over 2.3 million renters and generate over $400 million in annual revenue. Since 2015, we've grown earnings at an 18% compound annual growth rate, with multifamily now representing roughly 1/3 of Global Housing's 2019 net operating income, excluding catastrophes, illustrating the franchise strength. We'll continue to invest to enhance the customer experience as this remains an important growth business for the company, especially as we think ahead of supporting consumers within the connected world.
And in Global Preneed, we have more than 2 million policies and growing. This business, over time, gives us strong distributable cash flows with statutory earnings greater than GAAP earnings. Overall, the level of mortality risk remains lower relative to other life insurance-type products, ultimately contributing to above-market returns.
More recently, we've introduced new fee-for-service offerings to support the growing senior lifestyle market such as Executor Assist. We believe our overall portfolio represents a compelling mix of above-market growth in countercyclical businesses with leading positions and a track record of innovation. These businesses generate significant cash flow to reinvest and return capital to shareholders. These are key characteristics, which we believe set us apart as a long-term outperformer and enable us to create value for our shareholders even against the backdrop of uncertainty in the global macro environment.
Before I turn it over to Richard, I want to take a moment to thank our employees for their unwavering focus in supporting each other and our customers during this time. In the past few months, we've taken additional steps to support our employees through an array of actions. These have included onetime relief payments for work-from-home employees, incentive bonuses for on-site staff, providing additional floating holidays and a number of well-being and mental health support services. The cost for these programs and other incremental expenses directly related to COVID-19 are reflected in net income, similar to last quarter. I'm proud and grateful for the exceptional service our employees have and continue to provide on behalf of our clients and our 300 million customers worldwide.
While in the midst of grappling with COVID-19, we've also recognized the need to continue to advance diversity and inclusion at Assurant and within the communities we serve, particularly in light of the tragic murder of George Floyd and many others. For us, diversity and inclusion is not only about common decency and common sense, but is also a strategic and business imperative. Building on past initiatives, we've hosted candid, enterprise-wide conversations with our employees on race to ensure that we recognize these issues in our society and within the workplace. We are evaluating additional actions to support in a more diverse, equitable and inclusive community.
All of this has continued to reinforce the criticality of supporting the evolving needs of all of our key stakeholders with purpose and commitment. In July, we announced several organizational changes to enable us to deliver on those objectives more effectively.
Under the leadership of Francesca Luthi in a newly created role as Chief Administrative Officer, we have realigned human resources, facilities and procurement, along with marketing, communications, Investor Relations and corporate social responsibility, a move, I believe, is critical to ensure we bring a holistic view to integrated stakeholder management, while at the same time, elevating the employee experience to attract and retain the best and most diverse talent for the future.
We also promoted Jay Rosenblum to Chief Legal Officer. He had been serving in that role in an interim capacity since February after joining us last year to lead our government relations and regulatory affairs team. Jay's diverse experience spans 25 years in various legal and HR roles, and I'm pleased to have him lead our global legal function.
Overall, I'm exceptionally proud of our leaders and our 14,000 employees in how they have and will continue to live our values.
I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review second quarter results, recent trends and our updated 2020 outlook in more detail. Richard?"

Let's start with Global Lifestyle. The segment reported earnings of $122 million, up 11% compared to the prior year period.

The segment reported earnings of $122 million, up 11% compared to the prior year period. This increase was primarily driven by continued mobile growth, mainly from programs added in the last several years in North America and Asia Pacific. Lower claims activity outside of the U.S. in Connected Living and auto also drove improved results.
Our mobile trade-in business benefited from higher average selling prices due to scarce supply for used devices. This was partially offset by lower overall volumes due to COVID-19.
Global Automotive reflected a $4 million discrete client benefit in addition to reduced claims activity, mainly from our OEM clients outside of the U.S. as a result of COVID-19 stay-at-home orders.
Overall earnings growth was partially offset by a decline in Global Financial Services from weaker results in Canada and anticipated declines in legacy credit insurance. Unfavorable foreign exchange also pressured results in the quarter.
Looking at total revenue for lifestyle. Net earned premiums and fees were down $40 million or 2%. The decrease was driven primarily by lower mobile trade-in volumes due to store closures from COVID-19 and foreign exchange movements. This was partially offset by increased enrollment in new mobile programs, especially as carrier stores began to reopen in the latter part of the quarter.
Within Globe Automotive, revenue grew 3%, primarily reflecting prior period sales of vehicle service contracts. Sales in auto have rebounded since April and are nearly back to pre-COVID levels year-over-year. We will continue to monitor trends as sales levels today will impact future earnings for the business.
Looking forward to full year 2020, we expect growth in lifestyle's net operating income compared to full year 2019. However, we also expect that earnings in the second half of the year will be lower compared to the strong first half results. This is due to 5 key factors.
First, we recognized $16 million of onetime benefits in the first 6 months of the year, $4 million of which was incurred in the second quarter. We do not expect these items to reoccur in the second half of the year.
Second, we expect claims activity in Connected Living and auto to normalize at higher levels in the coming quarters as the global economy continues to reopen.
Third, similar to previous years, the timing and availability for new phone introductions will impact trade-in activity in the second half of the year. We are not, though, assuming any material increases in volumes before year-end.
Fourth, we're ramping up our investments in digital and customer experience capabilities to further increase our competitive differentiation.
And finally, we expect both foreign exchange and lower investment income to remain headwinds into the second half of the year.
I will also note that effective July 1, following a change in contract terms, we're transitioning our revenue accounting treatment from a gross sales basis per device to a flat fee per device for one of our mobile trade-in and upgrade programs. This will reduce our fees and other income by approximately $275 million on an annualized basis. Lower cost of goods sold, embedded in lifestyle's SG&A, will substantially offset this decrease.
We are pleased with this change as it will remove some of the revenue and expense variability we have historically seen in our financial results. It will also mitigate supply and demand pricing risk in the future.
Moving now to Global Housing. Net operating income for the second quarter totaled $85 million, an increase of $14 million or 19% year-over-year despite higher reportable catastrophes. Excluding catastrophe losses, earnings of $96 million represented an increase of $27 million or 39% year-over-year. Just over half of the increase was due to favorable noncat loss experienced across all major products, reflecting lower overall claims frequency and improvements in underwriting, including the benefits from artificial intelligence and claims processing initiatives. Also, the absence of losses from small commercial, along with growth in certain other specialty products, contributed to the increase.
Lender-placed results increased year-over-year. Higher premium rates and favorable loss experience were partially offset by a reduction of policies in force. This reduction was mainly related to the previously disclosed financially insolvent client and lower REO volumes due to the current foreclosure moratoriums.
The modest sequential increase in the placement rate to 1.56% was attributable to a shift in business mix. It is not an indication of broader macro housing market shifts.
Multifamily housing earnings were up slightly due to favorable noncatastrophe loss experience and modest growth from affinity partners.
Turning to Global Housing revenues. Net earned premiums and fees decreased 4%, mainly from 3 items: insolvent client, low REO volumes and the exit of small commercial. This decrease was partially offset by growth in our Specialty Property and multifamily housing businesses.
Moving to multifamily housing. Revenue increased 4% year-over-year driven mainly by growth from our affinity partners. The impact of COVID-19 has been minimal year-to-date, although we continue to monitor state actions related to premium deferrals.
At the end of June, we completed our 2020 catastrophe reinsurance program, maintaining our $80 million per event retention and increasing our multiyear coverage to nearly 50% of our U.S. power. We also reduced our overall risk exposure, primarily through the exit of small commercial. Overall, we were able to leverage strong relationships with our reinsurance partners to keep rate increases on the lower end of the overall market, but we also recognize those higher costs may persist into the future.
Looking forward to the full year 2020, we expect Global Housing net operating income, excluding cats, to increase over full year 2019 earnings driven by improved results in our specialty businesses and growth in multifamily housing. We also believe the results for the second half of the year will be lower than the first half for Global Housing. This is due to 4 key factors: first, we expect a more normalized level of claims frequency as previously mentioned; second, we expect REO volumes to continue to be reduced throughout the remainder of the year; third, the absence of income from the financially insolvent client and lender-placed; and finally, this segment will also continue to be impacted by lower investment income due to the lower yields available in the current interest rate environment.
While lender-placed should grow due to the countercyclical nature of the business if economic conditions worsen, today's mortgage industry and economic environment differs significantly from the housing crisis over 10 years ago. For example, mortgage loan underwriting standards have tightened, with the number of subprime and adjustable rate mortgages down over 60%, and homeowners today have higher rates of home equity compared to that period.
Now let's move to Global Preneed. The segment reported $14 million of net operating income, a $3 million decrease compared to the second quarter of 2019. This was driven by a combination of lower investment yields and a modest increase in mortality due to COVID-19. We continue to monitor mortality trends, especially in California, Texas and South Carolina, given our policy concentration in those areas. So far, we have not experienced significant increases.
Revenue for Preneed was up slightly, supported by sales in the U.S. And while face sales have begun to rebound recently given funeral home reopenings and increased online sales since April, July year-over-year face sales were still down approximately 15%. We would expect new sales to continue to fluctuate. Overall, for Global Preneed, we believe 2020 earnings will increase modestly compared to 2019 reported results.
For the second half of the year, we expect earnings to be up slightly versus the first half of the year due to more favorable mortality trends. We'll continue to monitor these trends as our current outlook does not assume a significant worsening in COVID-19 cases. We expect the reduction in mortality to be partially offset by investment income declines.
At corporate, the net operating loss was $27 million versus $24 million in the second quarter of 2019. This was due to a lower tax rate from the consolidating tax rate adjustment and less investment income from lower yields on cash assets. For the full year, we expect the corporate net operating loss to be in the range of $86 million to $90 million as the result of lower investment income and onetime transition costs associated with the outsourcing of our investment management function.
Across Assurant, our ongoing expense management efforts are contributing to our results. In addition, this year, we benefited from lower travel expenses due to COVID-19 restrictions as well as a reduction in discretionary spending, including deferring hiring for some positions. We are though filling all critical roles, particularly those needed to meet our client customer expectations. As we look to sustain profitable growth, we expect to continue to invest in our core capabilities in the upcoming quarters, while closely managing discretionary spend, given the continued uncertainty from COVID-19.
Next, I want to provide a brief update on our investment portfolio. Overall, our $12.6 billion portfolio of fixed maturities is of high quality, well diversified and managed for its income yield with low turnover. And as previously mentioned, we have minimal exposure to harder-hit sectors like energy, hospitality, retail stores and airlines.
Investment yield on our total investment portfolio dropped by 55 basis points year-over-year to 3.62%. This was largely driven by a decline in short-term cash yields. While we continue to manage the portfolio to preserve yield, our expectation is that our investment income will remain under pressure for some time as we do expect interest rates will remain relatively low for the foreseeable future. However, we believe our consistent investment approach will continue to serve us well as it has in the past.
In conjunction with our decision to outsource the management of our core investment portfolio, we sold our CLO platform for a modest gain in July. The sale will be recorded in the third quarter. While we will still have a small amount of investments in CLOs, our exposure to the asset class has been significantly reduced.
Turning to holding company liquidity. We ended June with $357 million or $132 million above our current minimum target level. This excludes the $200 million credit facility draw, which was reimbursed in July.
In the second quarter, dividends from our operating segments totaled $157 million or 71% of segment earnings. In addition to our quarterly corporate and interest expenses, we also bought back $26 million of stock.
As we have indicated, we slowed and then ultimately paused share repurchases in the second quarter. We paid $44 million in common and preferred stock and dividends. We acquired AFAS for $158 million, and we sold EK, which resulted in a cash outflow of $51 million from the holding company.
In late July, we also received a onetime tax cash benefit related to the acceleration of our net operating losses, included in the CARES Act passed in March. As a result, liquidity at the holding company will increase by $84 million in the third quarter.
For the full year, we expect segment dividends to approximate segment earnings. This is subject to the growth of the businesses, rating agency and regulatory capital requirements and the performance of the investment portfolio.
As Alan mentioned, we expect to resume buybacks in the third quarter, and we'll continue to manage our capital prudently. Our approach to buybacks will be measured as we continue to monitor business performance as well as the broader macroeconomic and credit market environments.
In summary, we demonstrated strong first half performance, while navigating the challenges of COVID-19. As we focus on continuing to deliver on our financial commitments for 2020, we will continue to invest in our growth businesses for the future while monitoring global market trends.

But we definitely have seen lower trade-in volumes, although that's now recovered as we head into June and July. Things have really returned more back to pre-COVID.
If you look at our subscriber count, we feel great about where we are. Our installed base is 53 million. We continue to grow in the U.S. and Japan, which are critical markets.

But as we've gotten into July, we've again seen the new sales rebound and be back to what we expected to see. So pretty much across the board. The exception is probably Preneed. Preneed new sales are still lagging 10% to 15% below where they were same year pre-COVID.
But our business is strong and really driven by that installed base. And so the other important point I'd make is, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we still expect to grow second half of '19 -- sorry, second half of '20 versus second half of '19 despite some of the uncertainty and headwinds from COVID-19. So we'll certainly continue to monitor it, but we feel good about the business trends we're seeing in our portfolio."

So just to clarify on that comment, what we were referring to there is in the first quarter, we had some disruption in our ability to sell phones into Hong Kong and China. This goes back to January and February. That normalized in February. And as the virus migrated from East to West, we've not seen any further disruptions in Asia Pacific.
If you look around the world, the market that's been most disrupted broadly is Latin America. And we've seen a greater impact on new sales in that geography than anywhere else in the world. We are seeing a little bit lower claims than expected in places like Europe, again, probably a reflection of the shutdown, but we're starting to see that normalize as we head into Q3. So at this point, we see things trending kind of back to normal, both on new sales as well as on claims."

We've been growing that franchise rapidly. Over the last few years, we've outgrown the market, even as different competitors have entered. And it's really driven by our strong diverse distribution with both property management companies as well as our affinity partners. It's driven by our ongoing investments in digital and CX, which helps us sustain a really competitive, attractive product for consumers.
And then we've got a lot of potential over time with our point-of-lease product, which has gone slowly this year just as landlords have been disrupted with COVID-19. But over time, we expect penetration to grow as we roll out our point-of-lease, which really provides a seamless kind of consumer experience as they move into a property."

We do always look at a multiyear period because over time, short-term fluctuations might impact any given year. But if you look at net operating earnings growth, so this is ex cat, not EPS, but earnings, we grew earnings 11% last year. If you look at the midpoint of our new outlook, we're looking at, at least 12% earnings growth this year. So we're ahead both in '19 and '20 versus our long term.
So as we think about 2021, I would say a few things.  We have a strong track record of profitable growth. I think we've demonstrated that we have a resilient business model that's been proven to be able to navigate the pandemic. We have strong cash flow generation, and we still expect to grow in 2021. It's obviously very early. So we haven't completed all of our planning and modeling for next year. But we are ahead. And so we may grow a little slower next year than we might have originally thought just because we've grown more rapidly in '19 and '20.
But we remain confident that we will continue to grow earnings over time and next year really driven off of our installed base of customers, some of the new programs that we've just won. And we just announced, for example, the Sprint, T-Mobile. And just -- we continue to expand our offerings. The purchase of Alegre in Australia is another example, which really allows us to strengthen our repair and logistics capability, not only in Australia but in Asia Pacific. So we'll provide an update later, but we feel good about the long-term profitable growth of our company."

4026111,675702595,2117385,"Assurant, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2020",2020-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Suzanne. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our second quarter performance. We reported operating earnings per share, excluding catastrophe losses, of $2.90, up 27% from the prior year period. Net operating income for the quarter, also exc",1548,"Thanks, Suzanne. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our second quarter performance. We reported operating earnings per share, excluding catastrophe losses, of $2.90, up 27% from the prior year period. Net operating income for the quarter, also excluding catastrophe losses, was $179 million, an increase of 24% from last year, demonstrating the continued strength and resiliency of our business.
Results were above our expectations, reflecting the stability of our large installed customer base, significant client partnerships and embedded growth in Global Lifestyle. We also benefited from improved results in Global Housing. Declines in investment income and foreign exchange were more than offset by lower claims activity and expense management efforts.
The initial negative impacts from COVID-19 in April gradually improved in May and June, resulting in a modest net positive to overall net operating income in the quarter.
Year-to-date, net operating earnings per share, excluding catastrophe losses, grew 24%, and net operating income increased 21%. Even after adjusting for $16 million of onetime items during the first half of the year, our results came in at the high end of our modeled pandemic scenarios.
Given our strong performance in the first half and improved visibility for remainder of the year, we have decided to reinstate and increase our outlook for full year 2020. We now expect 12% to 16% growth in operating earnings per share, excluding catastrophe losses, an increase from our initial outlook of 10% to 14%. This reflects continued growth in Connected Living, expansion within multifamily housing and improved profitability in our specialty business.
Our outlook assumes a continuation of current business trends and therefore, does not take into account a material increase in infection rates from COVID-19, which could lead to a significant change in consumer behavior, access to distribution channels or impact to financial markets.
While we expect earnings growth in the second half on a year-over-year basis, our outlook for the full year assumes a decline in earnings from the first 6 months of this year as we anticipate more normalized claims activity across most of our businesses and make incremental investments in our digital and customer experience capabilities.
The second half of the year will also reflect lower investment income and foreign exchange headwinds, the absence of $16 million of onetime benefits as well as typical mobile seasonality.
Looking at our balance sheet. Our liquidity position remains strong. In July, we repaid the $200 million credit facility draws in late March, which was done as a precautionary measure.
Given the attractiveness of our stock and strong capital position, we expect to resume share repurchases in the third quarter, and we continue to expect to reach our objective of returning $1.35 billion of capital to shareholders between 2019 and 2021. As always, this is subject to a variety of factors, including no significant deterioration of economic or market conditions.
Recent market transactions across our space further reinforce our view that our stock remains attractively priced. Earnings momentum in Global Lifestyle continues to be strong, driven in particular by Connected Living. This business had a compound annual earnings growth rate of 38% between 2015 and 2019 led by mobile.
Our installed base of customers, which represent a significant monthly recurring revenue stream, continues to expand. We are now at over 53 million mobile subscribers, up 70% since 2015. We've continued to provide value to consumers through services like trade in, upgrade and technology support as part of our fee-based offerings, resulting in a better ownership experience and multiple profit pools beyond device protection.
At the same time, we've continued to deepen our partnerships with market leaders to drive long-term profitable growth. We are pleased to announce that as Sprint becomes part of T-Mobile, we'll offer device protection to those new T-Mobile customers. We believe this is another example to support the long-term growth of our Connected Living business, and we are proud of our long-standing partnership with T-Mobile.
In August, we also strengthened our mobile device trading capabilities in Asia Pacific through the purchase of Alegre, a leading operator in the preowned mobile device market. After a small initial investment in 2018, we acquired the remaining equity for $12 million.
Turning to Global Automotive. Our installed base now includes over 48 million vehicles. We've continued to strengthen our client partnerships by working with them to enhance the digital customer experience, offering live online dealer training and sales webinars. We will continue to use our scale and diverse distribution channels to grow the business over the long term, especially as we look at future opportunities with the connected car.
Moving to Global Housing. Our lender-placed insurance and renters businesses both continue to contribute to our attractive above-market returns. Our lender-placed business plays a unique and vital role within the housing market, protecting both lenders and homeowners. We track over 32 million loans, including for 8 of the top 10 largest U.S. mortgage servicers. Since the beginning of 2019, we have renewed relationships with clients that represent nearly 80% of our loans tracked, solidifying our position as a market leader.
We've been investing in a new technology platform to improve the customer experience. In addition, we've made progress with our efforts to streamline and reduce our operational cost.
In our renters business, we've built a leadership position over the last 15 years. We now cover over 2.3 million renters and generate over $400 million in annual revenue. Since 2015, we've grown earnings at an 18% compound annual growth rate, with multifamily now representing roughly 1/3 of Global Housing's 2019 net operating income, excluding catastrophes, illustrating the franchise strength. We'll continue to invest to enhance the customer experience as this remains an important growth business for the company, especially as we think ahead of supporting consumers within the connected world.
And in Global Preneed, we have more than 2 million policies and growing. This business, over time, gives us strong distributable cash flows with statutory earnings greater than GAAP earnings. Overall, the level of mortality risk remains lower relative to other life insurance-type products, ultimately contributing to above-market returns.
More recently, we've introduced new fee-for-service offerings to support the growing senior lifestyle market such as Executor Assist. We believe our overall portfolio represents a compelling mix of above-market growth in countercyclical businesses with leading positions and a track record of innovation. These businesses generate significant cash flow to reinvest and return capital to shareholders. These are key characteristics, which we believe set us apart as a long-term outperformer and enable us to create value for our shareholders even against the backdrop of uncertainty in the global macro environment.
Before I turn it over to Richard, I want to take a moment to thank our employees for their unwavering focus in supporting each other and our customers during this time. In the past few months, we've taken additional steps to support our employees through an array of actions. These have included onetime relief payments for work-from-home employees, incentive bonuses for on-site staff, providing additional floating holidays and a number of well-being and mental health support services. The cost for these programs and other incremental expenses directly related to COVID-19 are reflected in net income, similar to last quarter. I'm proud and grateful for the exceptional service our employees have and continue to provide on behalf of our clients and our 300 million customers worldwide.
While in the midst of grappling with COVID-19, we've also recognized the need to continue to advance diversity and inclusion at Assurant and within the communities we serve, particularly in light of the tragic murder of George Floyd and many others. For us, diversity and inclusion is not only about common decency and common sense, but is also a strategic and business imperative. Building on past initiatives, we've hosted candid, enterprise-wide conversations with our employees on race to ensure that we recognize these issues in our society and within the workplace. We are evaluating additional actions to support in a more diverse, equitable and inclusive community.
All of this has continued to reinforce the criticality of supporting the evolving needs of all of our key stakeholders with purpose and commitment. In July, we announced several organizational changes to enable us to deliver on those objectives more effectively.
Under the leadership of Francesca Luthi in a newly created role as Chief Administrative Officer, we have realigned human resources, facilities and procurement, along with marketing, communications, Investor Relations and corporate social responsibility, a move, I believe, is critical to ensure we bring a holistic view to integrated stakeholder management, while at the same time, elevating the employee experience to attract and retain the best and most diverse talent for the future.
We also promoted Jay Rosenblum to Chief Legal Officer. He had been serving in that role in an interim capacity since February after joining us last year to lead our government relations and regulatory affairs team. Jay's diverse experience spans 25 years in various legal and HR roles, and I'm pleased to have him lead our global legal function.
Overall, I'm exceptionally proud of our leaders and our 14,000 employees in how they have and will continue to live our values.
I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review second quarter results, recent trends and our updated 2020 outlook in more detail. Richard?"

The segment reported earnings of $122 million, up 11% compared to the prior year period. This increase was primarily driven by continued mobile growth, mainly from programs added in the last several years in North America and Asia Pacific. Lower claims activity outside of the U.S. in Connected Living and auto also drove improved results.
Our mobile trade-in business benefited from higher average selling prices due to scarce supply for used devices. This was partially offset by lower overall volumes due to COVID-19.
Global Automotive reflected a $4 million discrete client benefit in addition to reduced claims activity, mainly from our OEM clients outside of the U.S. as a result of COVID-19 stay-at-home orders.
Overall earnings growth was partially offset by a decline in Global Financial Services from weaker results in Canada and anticipated declines in legacy credit insurance. Unfavorable foreign exchange also pressured results in the quarter.
Looking at total revenue for lifestyle. Net earned premiums and fees were down $40 million or 2%. The decrease was driven primarily by lower mobile trade-in volumes due to store closures from COVID-19 and foreign exchange movements. This was partially offset by increased enrollment in new mobile programs, especially as carrier stores began to reopen in the latter part of the quarter.
Within Globe Automotive, revenue grew 3%, primarily reflecting prior period sales of vehicle service contracts. Sales in auto have rebounded since April and are nearly back to pre-COVID levels year-over-year. We will continue to monitor trends as sales levels today will impact future earnings for the business.
Looking forward to full year 2020, we expect growth in lifestyle's net operating income compared to full year 2019. However, we also expect that earnings in the second half of the year will be lower compared to the strong first half results. This is due to 5 key factors.
First, we recognized $16 million of onetime benefits in the first 6 months of the year, $4 million of which was incurred in the second quarter. We do not expect these items to reoccur in the second half of the year.
Second, we expect claims activity in Connected Living and auto to normalize at higher levels in the coming quarters as the global economy continues to reopen.
Third, similar to previous years, the timing and availability for new phone introductions will impact trade-in activity in the second half of the year. We are not, though, assuming any material increases in volumes before year-end.
Fourth, we're ramping up our investments in digital and customer experience capabilities to further increase our competitive differentiation.
And finally, we expect both foreign exchange and lower investment income to remain headwinds into the second half of the year.
I will also note that effective July 1, following a change in contract terms, we're transitioning our revenue accounting treatment from a gross sales basis per device to a flat fee per device for one of our mobile trade-in and upgrade programs. This will reduce our fees and other income by approximately $275 million on an annualized basis. Lower cost of goods sold, embedded in lifestyle's SG&A, will substantially offset this decrease.
We are pleased with this change as it will remove some of the revenue and expense variability we have historically seen in our financial results. It will also mitigate supply and demand pricing risk in the future.
Moving now to Global Housing. Net operating income for the second quarter totaled $85 million, an increase of $14 million or 19% year-over-year despite higher reportable catastrophes. Excluding catastrophe losses, earnings of $96 million represented an increase of $27 million or 39% year-over-year. Just over half of the increase was due to favorable noncat loss experienced across all major products, reflecting lower overall claims frequency and improvements in underwriting, including the benefits from artificial intelligence and claims processing initiatives. Also the absence of losses from small commercial, along with growth in certain other specialty products, contributed to the increase.
Lender-placed results increased year-over-year. Higher premium rates and favorable loss experience were partially offset by a reduction of policies in force. This reduction was mainly related to the previously disclosed financially insolvent client and lower REO volumes due to the current foreclosure moratoriums.
The modest sequential increase in the placement rate to 1.56% was attributable to a shift in business mix. It is not an indication of broader macro housing market shifts.
Multifamily housing earnings were up slightly due to favorable noncatastrophe loss experience and modest growth from affinity partners.
Turning to Global Housing revenues. Net earned premiums and fees decreased 4%, mainly from 3 items: insolvent client, low REO volumes and the exit of small commercial. This decrease was partially offset by growth in our Specialty Property and multifamily housing businesses.
Moving to multifamily housing. Revenue increased 4% year-over-year driven mainly by growth from our affinity partners. The impact of COVID-19 has been minimal year-to-date, although we continue to monitor state actions related to premium deferrals.
At the end of June, we completed our 2020 catastrophe reinsurance program, maintaining our $80 million per event retention and increasing our multiyear coverage to nearly 50% of our U.S. power. We also reduced our overall risk exposure, primarily through the exit of small commercial. Overall, we were able to leverage strong relationships with our reinsurance partners to keep rate increases on the lower end of the overall market, but we also recognize those higher costs may persist into the future.
Looking forward to the full year 2020, we expect Global Housing net operating income, excluding cats, to increase over full year 2019 earnings driven by improved results in our specialty businesses and growth in multifamily housing. We also believe the results for the second half of the year will be lower than the first half for Global Housing. This is due to 4 key factors: first, we expect a more normalized level of claims frequency as previously mentioned; second, we expect REO volumes to continue to be reduced throughout the remainder of the year; third, the absence of income from the financially insolvent client and lender-placed; and finally, this segment will also continue to be impacted by lower investment income due to the lower yields available in the current interest rate environment.
While lender-placed should grow due to the countercyclical nature of the business if economic conditions worsen, today's mortgage industry and economic environment differs significantly from the housing crisis over 10 years ago. For example, mortgage loan underwriting standards have tightened, with the number of subprime and adjustable rate mortgages down over 60%, and homeowners today have higher rates of home equity compared to that period.
Now let's move to Global Preneed. The segment reported $14 million of net operating income, a $3 million decrease compared to the second quarter of 2019. This was driven by a combination of lower investment yields and a modest increase in mortality due to COVID-19. We continue to monitor mortality trends, especially in California, Texas and South Carolina, given our policy concentration in those areas. So far, we have not experienced significant increases.
Revenue for Preneed was up slightly, supported by sales in the U.S. And while face sales have begun to rebound recently given funeral home reopenings and increased online sales since April, July year-over-year face sales were still down approximately 15%. We would expect new sales to continue to fluctuate. Overall, for Global Preneed, we believe 2020 earnings will increase modestly compared to 2019 reported results.
For the second half of the year, we expect earnings to be up slightly versus the first half of the year due to more favorable mortality trends. We'll continue to monitor these trends as our current outlook does not assume a significant worsening in COVID-19 cases. We expect the reduction in mortality to be partially offset by investment income declines.
At corporate, the net operating loss was $27 million versus $24 million in the second quarter of 2019. This was due to a lower tax rate from the consolidating tax rate adjustment and less investment income from lower yields on cash assets. For the full year, we expect the corporate net operating loss to be in the range of $86 million to $90 million as the result of lower investment income and onetime transition costs associated with the outsourcing of our investment management function.
Across Assurant, our ongoing expense management efforts are contributing to our results. In addition, this year, we benefited from lower travel expenses due to COVID-19 restrictions as well as a reduction in discretionary spending, including deferring hiring for some positions. We are though filling all critical roles, particularly those needed to meet our client customer expectations. As we look to sustain profitable growth, we expect to continue to invest in our core capabilities in the upcoming quarters, while closely managing discretionary spend, given the continued uncertainty from COVID-19.
Next, I want to provide a brief update on our investment portfolio. Overall, our $12.6 billion portfolio of fixed maturities is of high quality, well diversified and managed for its income yield with low turnover. And as previously mentioned, we have minimal exposure to harder-hit sectors like energy, hospitality, retail stores and airlines.
Investment yield on our total investment portfolio dropped by 55 basis points year-over-year to 3.62%. This was largely driven by a decline in short-term cash yields. While we continue to manage the portfolio to preserve yield, our expectation is that our investment income will remain under pressure for some time as we do expect interest rates will remain relatively low for the foreseeable future. However, we believe our consistent investment approach will continue to serve us well as it has in the past.
In conjunction with our decision to outsource the management of our core investment portfolio, we sold our CLO platform for a modest gain in July. The sale will be recorded in the third quarter. While we will still have a small amount of investments in CLOs, our exposure to the asset class has been significantly reduced.
Turning to holding company liquidity. We ended June with $357 million or $132 million above our current minimum target level. This excludes the $200 million credit facility draw, which was reimbursed in July.
In the second quarter, dividends from our operating segments totaled $157 million or 71% of segment earnings. In addition to our quarterly corporate and interest expenses, we also bought back $26 million of stock.
As we have indicated, we slowed and then ultimately paused share repurchases in the second quarter. We paid $44 million in common and preferred stock and dividends. We acquired AFAS for $158 million, and we sold EK, which resulted in a cash outflow of $51 million from the holding company.
In late July, we also received a onetime tax cash benefit related to the acceleration of our net operating losses, included in the CARES Act passed in March. As a result, liquidity at the holding company will increase by $84 million in the third quarter.
For the full year, we expect segment dividends to approximate segment earnings. This is subject to the growth of the businesses, rating agency and regulatory capital requirements and the performance of the investment portfolio.
As Alan mentioned, we expect to resume buybacks in the third quarter, and we'll continue to manage our capital prudently. Our approach to buybacks will be measured as we continue to monitor business performance as well as the broader macroeconomic and credit market environments.
In summary, we demonstrated strong first half performance, while navigating the challenges of COVID-19. As we focus on continuing to deliver on our financial commitments for 2020, we will continue to invest in our growth businesses for the future while monitoring global market trends.

But we definitely have seen lower trade-in volumes, although that's now recovered as we head into June and July. Things have really returned more back to pre-COVID.
If you look at our subscriber count, we feel great about where we are. Our installed base is 53 million. We continue to grow in the U.S. and Japan, which are critical markets. We did see pressure in Latin America, which is really the most disrupted region globally in terms of new sales.

And that large installed base have nearly 300 million customers, over 300 million customers is there. We have a very resilient business. And what we've seen even in July, for example, if you go through the various sectors, auto new sales of our products in July were back at or above pre-COVID levels even as there's disruption in the U.S. marketplace. If you look at mobile, we mentioned that trade-in activity in July was back what we expected earlier in the year. Multifamily, we were impacted early by COVID, clearly. But as we've gotten into July, we've again seen the new sales rebound and be back to what we expected to see. So pretty much across the board. The exception is probably Preneed. Preneed new sales are still lagging 10% to 15% below where they were same year pre-COVID.
But our business is strong and really driven by that installed base. And so the other important point I'd make is, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we still expect to grow second half of '19 -- sorry, second half of '20 versus second half of '19 despite some of the uncertainty and headwinds from COVID-19. So we'll certainly continue to monitor it, but we feel good about the business trends we're seeing in our portfolio."

If you look around the world, the market that's been most disrupted broadly is Latin America. And we've seen a greater impact on new sales in that geography than anywhere else in the world. We are seeing a little bit lower claims than expected in places like Europe, again, probably a reflection of the shutdown, but we're starting to see that normalize as we head into Q3. So at this point, we see things trending kind of back to normal, both on new sales as well as on claims."

We've been growing that franchise rapidly. Over the last few years, we've outgrown the market, even as different competitors have entered. And it's really driven by our strong diverse distribution with both property management companies as well as our affinity partners. It's driven by our ongoing investments in digital and CX, which helps us sustain a really competitive, attractive product for consumers.
And then we've got a lot of potential over time with our point-of-lease product, which has gone slowly this year just as landlords have been disrupted with COVID-19. But over time, we expect penetration to grow as we roll out our point-of-lease, which really provides a seamless kind of consumer experience as they move into a property."

If you look at the midpoint of our new outlook, we're looking at, at least 12% earnings growth this year. So we're ahead both in '19 and '20 versus our long term.
So as we think about 2021, I would say a few things. We have a strong track record of profitable growth. I think we've demonstrated that we have a resilient business model that's been proven to be able to navigate the pandemic. We have strong cash flow generation, and we still expect to grow in 2021. It's obviously very early. So we haven't completed all of our planning and modeling for next year. But we are ahead. And so we may grow a little slower next year than we might have originally thought just because we've grown more rapidly in '19 and '20.
But we remain confident that we will continue to grow earnings over time and next year really driven off of our installed base of customers, some of the new programs that we've just won. And we just announced, for example, the Sprint, T-Mobile. And just -- we continue to expand our offerings. The purchase of Alegre in Australia is another example, which really allows us to strengthen our repair and logistics capability, not only in Australia but in Asia Pacific. So we'll provide an update later, but we feel good about the long-term profitable growth of our company."

We are pleased with our third quarter operating results, which demonstrate the continued resiliency and strength of our business portfolio. Our track record of delivering strong, profitable growth, not just this",1282,"Thanks, Francesca. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our third quarter operating results, which demonstrate the continued resiliency and strength of our business portfolio. Our track record of delivering strong, profitable growth, not just this quarter but over the past few years, reinforces our strategic direction and our confidence in the future growth prospects of Assurant. 
Last week, we made 2 announcements that underscore our focus on our market-leading lifestyle and housing businesses while capitalizing on the convergence of a connected mobile device, car and home. 
Our Connected Living, Global Automotive and multifamily housing businesses have a history of profitable growth and we believe compelling future growth potential. 
In addition, our specialty P&C offerings, including lender-placed insurance, are extremely well positioned. The countercyclical nature and strong returns of the business continue to make it a critical part of our portfolio. 
Together, lifestyle and housing should drive ongoing above-market growth and superior cash flow generation with the ability to outperform in any economic cycle and, ultimately, to create greater shareholder value over time. 
Our acquisition of HYLA Mobile, a leading provider of smartphone software and trade-in and upgrade services, will strengthen our market position with increased scale, complementary client bases and favorable tailwinds in the global mobile market. We valued HYLA at a multiple of low teens forward EBITDA. The combination of its patented software technology and trading capabilities with Assurant's end-to-end mobile device life cycle management expertise will deliver 3 primary benefits. First, it will enhance the customer experience, making it easier for consumers to get trade-in value for their used mobile devices without an in-person inspection. Second, it will improve program economics and performance for our partners, including higher trade-in attachment rates. And finally, it will further strengthen Assurant's ability to take advantage of the 5G smartphone upgrade cycle. 
HYLA also has strong relationships with marquee partners, complementary to Assurant's client base across our critical distribution channels and geographies, including leading U.S. and Japanese mobile carriers as well as major global OEMs. 
As we announced, we intend to fund our acquisition through a combination of cash on hand at the holding company and new debt issued prior to closing so that we can continue to optimize our capital structure while maintaining investment-grade ratings. 
To better align resources to the best market opportunities within lifestyle and housing, we've also announced a review of strategic alternatives for Global Preneed, including a potential sale. This decision was not an easy one, given the strength of the business and the considerable value its employees brought to Assurant. Global Preneed is a strong business with over 2 million policyholders throughout the U.S. and Canada. It has delivered consistent growth while generating robust cash flow and above-market returns. It has nearly $6 billion in investable assets and is relatively low-risk compared to other life insurance type products. However, we believe the business has been historically undervalued as part of Assurant. So a transaction should unlock significant value by allowing us to deepen our focus on consumers' connected lifestyle and our differentiated P&C businesses. We expect that any proceeds from a potential transaction will be deployed to fund business growth with excess funds returned to shareholders over time. In the months ahead, we will provide updates on our progress as appropriate. And as always, during this time, we will continue to honor our commitments to clients and policyholders while delivering exceptional service. 
Now I'll provide a few key highlights from the third quarter that affirm our continued progress within our lifestyle and housing businesses. 
Within Connected Living, we've grown earnings 22% year-to-date. As we focus on continuing to drive long-term growth, we are moving forward with the build-out of our full-service customer capabilities to deliver superior customer service to our 54 million mobile subscribers. 
This quarter, we also acquired Fixed, providing mobile customers increased choice through a come-to-you repair capability. This acquisition complements last year's purchase of Cell Phone Repair, or CPR, that delivers the same-day local repair option. Like HYLA, these investments will support the acceleration of our strategy by expanding our capabilities and offerings as we anticipate the ever-evolving needs of connected consumers. 
We also recently launched Pocket Geek [indiscernible] , which offers personalized tech support and bundled protection of at-home technology, including laptops, gaming systems and other electronics from accidental damage and mechanical breakdown. While it is still early, we believe this offering is an important step in the development of future connected lifestyle protection products. 
In Global Automotive, we remain focused on opportunities to leverage our leadership position to scale in key global markets. 
In the U.K., we recently launched a new product for electric and hybrid vehicles called [ EV1 ]. This includes a new partnership with the London Electric Vehicle Company that will cover their iconic London black cabs and electric van models. This supports the continued growth of our auto business globally, while also gaining further insights into the evolving electric vehicle market, and it supports the U.K.'s move toward EV as a standard by 2035. 
Within Global Financial Services, we are pleased to announce the launch of a new partnership in Canada with the Bank of Montreal, leveraging our omnichannel customer capabilities as we continue to reposition the business for profitable growth long term. 
Moving to Global Housing. We extended our agreement with yet another client in the lender-placed business. We've now renewed 20 clients, representing more than 85% of our track loans since the beginning of 2019. Lender-placed is a critical part of the mortgage landscape in the U.S. and continues to be an important component of our long-term strategy. 
In multifamily housing, we grew revenue and policies by 8% and 9%, respectively, year-over-year. Our Cover 360 Property Management Solution continues to gain momentum and drive higher penetration of renters insurance with our property management company partners. 
The product, formerly known as Point of Lease, allows the customer to combine their payment of rent and insurance. The solution now includes insurance tracking, verification and policy placement to eliminate coverage gaps. We're now tracking more than 335,000 rental units, which grew 40% since the second quarter. 
We also believe that our increased investments around the connected home and connected apartment will drive new opportunities to increase P&C penetration rates. 
Turning to our key financial metrics. We're pleased with our progress against our 2020 objectives. Through the first 9 months, net operating earnings per share, excluding catastrophes, increased 25% year-over-year to $8.69. 
Net operating income, excluding catastrophes, was up 21% to $527 million. 
COVID-19 did not have a material impact on year-to-date results. 
For the full year, we now expect our operating earnings per share, excluding catastrophes, to grow between 17% to 21% compared to 2019, well ahead of our initial expectations. The revised outlook largely reflects Global Housing's favorable non-catastrophe loss experience through the first 9 months of 2020 as well as continued growth in Connected Living and our disciplined expense management. 
Our capital position has remained strong throughout the pandemic. In the quarter, we resumed buybacks, and we've now returned over 50% of our $1.35 billion objective from 2019 through the end of September. We expect to return the balance by the end of 2021 as we originally planned, primarily supported by the strong cash flow generated by our lifestyle and housing businesses. 
All of this is a reflection of the continued dedication of our 14,000-plus employees globally. They continue to do an outstanding job, managing through the COVID pandemic, while providing exceptional support to our customers, including those impacted by natural disasters this year. 
I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review third quarter results, recent trends and our 2020 outlook in more detail. Richard?"

I'd like to start by saying that we're really pleased with our third quarter. We reported operating earnings per share, excluding catastrophe losses, of $2.85, up 25% from the prior year period. Net operating",1371,"Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by saying that we're really pleased with our third quarter. We reported operating earnings per share, excluding catastrophe losses, of $2.85, up 25% from the prior year period. 
Net operating income for the quarter, also excluding catastrophe losses, was $172 million, an increase of 22% from last year largely due to more favorable noncat loss experience in Global Housing, continued momentum in Global Lifestyle and improved results in Global Preneed. Sales trends across the board have been improving from lows recorded in March and April at the height of the pandemic, and we are seeing more normalized levels of COVID-related claims activity in Global Lifestyle and Global Housing. 
Now let's review segment results in greater detail, starting with Global Lifestyle. This segment reported earnings of $107 million in the third quarter, up 4% compared to the prior year period. This increase was primarily driven by Connected Living, where we benefited from new mobile subscribers. Improved profitability within extended service contracts also contributed to growth in the quarter. 
Within Global Automotive, results reflected continued pressure from lower investment income and investments to support growth. 
Declines in Global Financial Services reflected lower card balances and volumes as well as less favorable loss experience, some of which was attributable to COVID. We also incurred additional expenses to launch new client programs. 
Looking at total revenue, net earned premiums and fees grew by $56 million or 3%. The increase was driven primarily by 14% growth in Global Automotive, including prior period sales of vehicle service contracts. We're continuing to monitor sales trends, which has stabilized but still trail 2019 levels on a year-to-date basis due to impacts from COVID. 
Global Lifestyle revenue growth was partially offset by lower revenue from mobile trading, primarily due to the contract change we disclosed last quarter. This change lowered revenues by $39 million as we changed reporting from a gross sales basis per device to a flat fee per device. As a reminder, this change will remove some of the revenue and expense variability we have historically seen in our financial results and mitigate supply and demand pricing risk. 
Overall, for the full year 2020, we continue to expect Global Lifestyle to grow net operating income when compared to full year 2019. 
Looking ahead, we anticipate an uptick in trading activity in the fourth quarter, which will continue into the beginning of next year. Volumes will depend on the following: the timing and availability of devices for new phone introductions, the level of carrier promotions and the growth from new business. 
Looking ahead to 2021, we expect earnings expansion within lifestyle to moderate from strong 2020 levels, which benefited from 3 items: first, $16 million of onetime benefits year-to-date; second, lower claims during the first few months of the COVID pandemic; and finally, lower expenditures on categories such as travel, given the uncertainty around the pandemic. We also expect ongoing headwinds from low interest rates on investment income. 
Moving now to Global Housing. Net operating income for the third quarter totaled $13 million compared to $42 million in the third quarter of 2019. The decrease was primarily due to $51 million of higher reportable catastrophes. As we preannounced, we incurred a total of $87 million of after-tax cat losses related to several hurricanes and wildfires in the U.S. Nearly half of the losses in the quarter were from Hurricane Laura, with the remainder primarily related to Hurricane Sally and Isaias, as well as wildfires in California and Oregon. 
Excluding catastrophe losses, earnings increased $23 million year-over-year or 30% to $100 million. Approximately 2/3 of the increase was due to favorable non-cat loss experience across specialty products and lender-placed. This included $8 million of favorable experience that we don't expect going forward, including reserve releases related to runoff businesses. Improvements in underwriting and product changes also led to more favorable experience. 
We also benefited from continued growth in multifamily housing from affinity partners. 
Within lender-placed, the results also reflected higher premium rates. Growth was partially offset by reduction in policies in force, driven by declining REO volumes from the current foreclosure moratoriums and the previously disclosed financially insolvent client. 
Looking at placement rates. We recorded a 2 basis point sequential increase in the quarter to 1.58%. This was a [indiscernible] shift in business mix. It's not an indication of a broader macro housing shift. 
[Audio Gap] 
the exit of small commercial, the insolvent lender-placed client, and lower REO volumes. This decrease was partially offset by growth in our multifamily housing and specialty property businesses. 
Multifamily housing revenues increased, driven mainly by growth from our affinity partners. 
For the full year, we expect Global Housing's net operating income, excluding cats, to increase year-over-year, driven by favorable non-GAAP loss experience as well as improved results in each line of business. 
Looking ahead, we expect to see more normalized non-cat loss experience, lower REO volumes due to foreclosure moratoriums that have now been extended through the remainder of 2020 and lower investment income due to lower yields. 
Specifically, in the fourth quarter, we also expect Hurricane Zeta to be a reportable event, likely in the range of $12 million to $20 million pretax, subject to further claims analysis. And while still too early in the claims process to speculate, Hurricane Zeta will likely be a reportable event as well. We will provide an update prior to fourth quarter earnings, if necessary. 
Now let's move to Global Preneed. Overall, the business continues to perform well. The segment reported net operating income of $13 million, an increase of $6 million year-over-year. The absence of a negative onetime accounting adjustment in the third quarter of last year was offset by lower investment income this quarter. 
While market mortality trends have fluctuated during the pandemic, the impact on mortality on earnings continued to be immaterial in the quarter. 
Revenue for preneed was up slightly, primarily due to continued growth in sales of our [ final need ] product, and we are pleased to see a rebound in [indiscernible] sales since the second quarter, reflecting the reopening of [ funeral ] homes. 
Overall, for Global Preneed, we expect 2020 earnings will approximate 2019 reported results. 
Moving to corporate. The net operating loss was $23 million compared to $21 million in the third quarter of 2019. This was primarily due to lower investment income. For the full year, we expect 2020 corporate net operating loss to approximate $90 million, mainly as the result of lower investment income and investments for growth. 
Turning to holding company liquidity. We ended September with $460 million or $235 million above our current minimum target level. In the third quarter, dividends from our operating segments totaled $245 million. 
In addition to our quarterly corporate and interest expenses, we also had outflows from 3 items. First, we bought back $70 million of stock after resuming share repurchases in the quarter. Second, we paid $42 million in common and preferred stock dividends. And finally, we had approximately $10 million of net cash outflows related to the acquisitions of Alegre and Fixed and the sale of our CLO platform. 
In the fourth quarter through October 30, we repurchased an additional 330,000 shares for $41 million. 
Regarding the new debt issuance to support the financing of HYLA, we continue to target an overall debt-to-capital ratio of less than 30% and expect to remain within that target while also maintaining investment-grade ratings. 
For the Global Preneed, we reported a $136 million goodwill impairment charge. This was related to the decision to explore strategic alternatives for this segment, combined with the impact of the low interest rate environment. This is a noncash charge and runs through net income. 
Moving forward. For the year overall, we still expect dividends to approximate segment earnings, subject to: the growth of the businesses, rating agency and regulatory capital requirements and the performance of the investment portfolio. 
In summary, we've delivered solid results and maintained a strong financial position throughout the pandemic. As we approach year-end, we remain focused on meeting our 2020 financial objectives and on building a stronger Assurant for the future. 
And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

On Sprint and T-Mobile, first of all, again, I want to recognize the importance that we have of that relationship with T-Mobile. We've been their partner, supporting their innovation and disruption for the last decade, and that is really the driver of our then now participating in the growth of Sprint. We are starting from 0. And really the premise just began to get going. It took a couple of months after the closing before T-Mobile really began to convert the stores as they wanted to make sure they didn't disrupt things during that conversion phase. So we're starting to see some impact, but it's going to be a gradual ramp. We're also investing, as you might expect, to help all the legacy Sprint stores be in a good position to sell our products as people come in. So not a lot of impact so far, but will be a significant growth driver over the next 2 to 3 years as that program really ramps. 
In terms of the trade and buyback cycle, what we've seen in the last 3 or 4 years is that the volume really begins in the latter part of Q4 and then really into Q1. And that's, again, what we expect to see this year. We'll see some volume beginning in Q4, but the bulk of the volume in the last couple of years has been lagged into the first quarter of next year. And it really is driven by, one, that new iPhones are available. And if you noticed their announcement, a couple of the new models were out right away, but a couple of the new models are still not out. And so we'll see that over time. 
And I mentioned 5G earlier. This is the first year that the iPhones really have 5G capability, which is a real positive. But when will consumers really get excited about 5G, we don't know for sure. But as I mentioned earlier, we're now well positioned to support our carrier partners with 5G when it happens."

The part of your question, which is what will persist or not. We have had within the non-cat loss ratio some positives this year that won't reoccur. For example, some reserve releases of a limited amount that we mentioned in our prepared remarks of about $8 million. Those won't continue. We don't think. 
We've also had a really good run in terms of lower frequency, severity and things like theft and vandalism. Will that continue? That's sort of a question mark in terms of how that will go in the future.

We've reduced exposure by exiting the small commercial business. And so we do feel very good about the portfolio, and it's performing well. If you look at through the third quarter, even with an active cat year, our ROE in housing is something like 14% or 15%. And so it's still performing and delivering well.

Brian, you'd mentioned buying in aggregate, that's obviously something that we look at every year. At the end of the day, there's economics around it, and there's pricing in the market. So we look at that and say, is it thoughtful for us to buy more reinsurance? Or is this a risk we're happy to hold given the pricing out there in the market? As Alan said, we can have a quarter like last quarter, where we do get hit by natural catastrophes. But over a period of time, and I would say just 1 year, our combined operating ratio ends up being well below 100, and the ROEs on this business are very positive.

I mean the business is in a good position today as we've worked to drive efficiencies. We've, for example, been investing in improving various processes, using artificial intelligence and automation, and that has helped us. We are in the middle of converting clients to our single-source processing platform, which really delivers over the next few years a much simpler and better customer experience. 
But I don't think we'll have continued improvement in that ratio. What I mean by that is we've worked with our regulators to kind of agree a normal range combined ratio. And Richard, you may want to talk about that and how we think about that with our regulators. But we feel good about where it is today."

If we think about the last couple of years, we've seen the revenues come down, and now they're coming down very little. I mean we've talked about the financial insolvent client that put a little bit of headwind. But over the 9 months, we're down not much at all, let's call it 5%. So in terms of the expense management, I think we are at the bottom with the discipline we have and what we need to deliver to our customers, which is obviously at the forefront of our thoughts. 
And with regard to the regulators, obviously, the regulators take into account the experience we have. So if there's years where the overall loss ratio is really high, we could go and ask for some pricing improvements. If it's too low, obviously, that gets taken into account. 
So overall, I think even if the loss -- the expense ratio though a lot lower, we would see that come through rate over time. I think where we're looking at the expense ratio was from a competitive point of view to be able to operate and produce the most efficiency for our customers so they get the best experience that we can offer them."

So there'll be a whole set of value that we can deliver through our service contract around keeping you connected. It's basically what we do in mobile today. And we see that coming to auto. So that's one thing. 
And then if you think about electric vehicles, for example, you'll have fewer things that can go wrong, but you'll have much higher severity when something does go wrong. And so we're learning. One of the reasons we've been pushing hard with electric, we've done a deal in China, we've now done the deal in the U.K., is to really develop the data and the learning so we can be the most compelling offer to support what we think for a consumer will be even a greater interest in the service contract, both because of the nature of the risk, but because of the connectivity of the car. And that really is an area where we feel our business being in both mobile and auto gives us a unique set of advantages in the market."

First of all, we'll provide an outlook in Q4 earnings call, so that'd be early February, about what we really expect, and you shall should expect for 2021. 
A couple of comments though. 2020 has been a very strong earnings growth year. I'm really proud. I think we're all really proud of our people have delivered for our customers and our clients and for our shareholders. But the really strong 2020, it does create some year-on-year challenges, if we look at '21. We had about $16 million of onetime benefits in lifestyle earlier this year. We've never assumed a onetime benefit will recur. We had about $8 million of favorable experience we just mentioned in Q3 in housing. We don't really expect that to recur. We did have some other benefits from, for example, our expense management actions, where we deferred some hiring, we reduced travel, that will come back. 
So definitely, 2021, we do expect to grow, but we expect it to moderate from 2020. And overall, if you think back to our Investor Day, we said at Investor Day that, on average, in 2020 and 2021, we would grow operating earnings, so NOI ex cap by 12% on average. At Investor Day, we thought it would be a little bit lower in 2020 relative to the 12% and a little bit higher in 2021. Now we had a stronger 2020, and we now expect to moderate a little bit in 2021. But the combination of the EPS growth that we expect, the 12% on average 2021, we still believe that's appropriate."

And as you imagine, we've spent a fair amount of our time thinking about what are the long-term implications of COVID. 
I think for us, the first thing I'd highlight is just how resilient our business is. It shows the value of kind of an embedded subscriber base, a range of services that really allow consumers to stay connected. And one of the things that I think COVID has highlighted with the move to be at home more, that move to some sort of hybrid working model, and more likely post COVID, being connected is everything. And what we do around connecting your devices, making sure everything your home is working, that's really important. So I think that actually helps us even more as we look to the future. 
A couple of other things we see with COVID, digital. Digital was obviously already a trend that we've been investing against for years. But I think the acceleration of digital is real and permanent. And we, for example, in the last 6 months or so, we really upped our investment in digital everywhere. So today, we feel, like an example, in rental, multifamily, our digital capabilities are at or better than anybody's in the market. So we see digital kind of as an ongoing trend. 
And then the other thing we're thinking about, are there changes, for example, in global supply chain? So we may think about that over time. 
But at the end of the day, I would highlight just how strong our business has performed through this uncertainty and just shows the value of what we're doing for our customers and how much they appreciate being able to stay connected and having everything in their home work the way they wanted it to."

Who knows that, that will be the case here, but that's probably a reasonable way to think about it. 
In terms of the valuation, I wouldn't speculate, but we are confident it's going to be an attractive valuation for our shareholders. We know from other life insurance transactions recently, there is a wide range of interest in assets like our preneed business. And we're confident that it's not valued appropriately in our stock. And that whatever we do here will unlock and create value for our shareholders over the next 4 to 9 months as we work through a process and hopefully a closing.

We are pleased with our third quarter operating results, which demonstrate the continued resiliency and strength of our business portfolio. Our track record of delivering strong, profitable growth, not just this",1281,"Thanks, Francesca. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our third quarter operating results, which demonstrate the continued resiliency and strength of our business portfolio. Our track record of delivering strong, profitable growth, not just this quarter, but over the past few years, reinforces our strategic direction and our confidence in the future growth prospects of Assurant.  
Last week, we made 2 announcements that underscore our focus on our market-leading lifestyle and housing businesses while capitalizing on the convergence of the connected mobile device, car and home. Our Connected Living, Global Automotive and multifamily housing businesses have a history of profitable growth, and we believe compelling future growth potential. In addition, our specialty P&C offerings, including lender-placed insurance, are extremely well positioned. The countercyclical nature and strong returns of the business continue to make it a critical part of our portfolio.  
Together, lifestyle and housing should drive ongoing above-market growth and superior cash flow generation with the ability to outperform in any economic cycle and, ultimately, to create greater shareholder value over time.  
Our acquisition of HYLA Mobile, a leading provider of smartphone software and trade-in and upgrade services, will strengthen our market position with increased scale, complementary client bases and favorable tailwinds in the global mobile market. We value HYLA at the multiple of low teens forward EBITDA. The combination of its patented software technology and trade-in capabilities with Assurant's end-to-end mobile device life cycle management expertise will deliver 3 primary benefits: first, it will enhance the customer experience, making it easier for consumers to get trade-in value for their used mobile devices without an in-person inspection; second, it will improve program economics and performance for our partners, including higher trade-in attachment rates; and finally, it will further strengthen Assurant's ability to take advantage of the 5G smartphone upgrade cycle.  
HYLA also has strong relationships with marquee partners, complementary to Assurant's client base across our critical distribution channels and geographies and including leading U.S. and Japanese mobile carriers as well as major global OEMs.  
As we announced, we intend to fund our acquisition through a combination of cash on hand at the holding company and new debt issued prior to closing so that we can continue to optimize our capital structure while maintaining investment-grade ratings.  
To better align resources to the best market opportunities within lifestyle and housing, we've also announced a review of strategic alternatives for Global Preneed, including a potential sale. This decision was not an easy one, given the strength of the business and the considerable value its employees brought to Assurant. Global Preneed is a strong business with over 2 million policyholders throughout the U.S. and Canada. It has delivered consistent growth while generating robust cash flow and above-market returns. 
It has nearly $6 billion in investable assets and is relatively low-risk compared to other life insurance-type products. However, we believe the business has been historically undervalued as part of Assurant. So a transaction should unlock significant value by allowing us to deepen our focus on consumers' connected lifestyle and our differentiated P&C businesses. We expect that any proceeds from a potential transaction will be deployed to fund business growth with excess funds returned to shareholders over time. In the months ahead, we will provide updates on our progress as appropriate. And as always, during this time, we will continue to honor our commitments to clients and policyholders while delivering exceptional service.  
Now I'll provide a few key highlights from the third quarter that affirm our continued progress within our lifestyle and housing businesses.  
Within Connected Living, we've grown earnings 22% year-to-date. As we focus on continuing to drive long-term growth, we are moving forward with the build-out of our full-service customer capabilities to deliver superior customer service to our 54 million mobile subscribers.  
This quarter, we also acquired Fixt, providing mobile customers increased choice through a come-to-you repair capability. This acquisition complements last year's purchase of Cell Phone Repair, or CPR, that delivers the same-day local repair option.  Like HYLA, these investments will support the acceleration of our strategy by expanding our capabilities and offerings as we anticipate the ever-evolving needs of connected consumers.  
We also recently launched Pocket Geek Home , which offers personalized tech support and bundled protection of at-home technology, including laptops, gaming systems and other electronics from accidental damage and mechanical breakdown. While it is still early, we believe this offering is an important step in the development of future-connected lifestyle protection products.  
In Global Automotive, we remain focused on opportunities to leverage our leadership position to scale in key global markets. 
In the U.K., we recently launched a new product for electric and hybrid vehicles called EV One. This includes a new partnership with a London electric vehicle company that will cover their iconic London black cabs and electric van models. This supports the continued growth of our auto business globally, while also gaining further insights into the evolving electric vehicle market, and it supports the U.K.'s move toward EV as a standard by 2035.  
Within Global Financial Services, we are pleased to announce the launch of a new partnership in Canada with the Bank of Montreal, leveraging our omnichannel customer capabilities as we continue to reposition the business for profitable growth long term.  
Moving to Global Housing. We extended our agreement with yet another client in the lender-placed business. We've now renewed 20 clients, representing more than 85% of our tracked  loans since the beginning of 2019. Lender-placed is a critical part of the mortgage landscape in the U.S. and continues to be an important component of our long-term strategy.  
In multifamily housing, we grew revenue and policies by 8% and 9%, respectively, year-over-year. Our Cover 360 property management solution continues to gain momentum and drive higher penetration of renters insurance with our property management company partners. The product, formerly known as Point of Lease, allows the customer to combine their payment of rent and insurance. The solution now includes insurance tracking, verification and policy placement to eliminate coverage gaps. We're now tracking more than 335,000 rental units, which grew 40% since the second quarter.  
We also believe that our increased investments around the connected home and connected apartment will drive new opportunities to increase P&C penetration rates.  
Turning to our key financial metrics. We're pleased with our progress against our 2020 objectives. Through the first 9 months, net operating earnings per share, excluding catastrophes, increased 25% year-over-year to $8.69.  
Net operating income, excluding catastrophes, was up 21% to $527 million. COVID-19 did not have a material impact on year-to-date results.  
For the full year, we now expect our operating earnings per share, excluding catastrophes, to grow between 17% to 21% compared to 2019, well ahead of our initial expectations. The revised outlook largely reflects Global Housing's favorable non-catastrophe loss experience through the first 9 months of 2020 as well as continued growth in Connected Living and our disciplined expense management.  
Our capital position has remained strong throughout the pandemic. In the quarter, we resumed buybacks, and we've now returned over 50% of our $1.35 billion objective from 2019 through the end of September. We expect to return the balance by the end of 2021 as we originally planned, primarily supported by the strong cash flow generated by our lifestyle and housing businesses.  
All of this is a reflection of the continued dedication of our 14,000-plus employees globally. They continue to do an outstanding job of managing through the COVID pandemic, while providing exceptional support to our customers, including those impacted by natural disasters this year.  
I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review third quarter results, recent trends and our 2020 outlook in more detail. Richard?"
4026111,691597901,2127083,"Assurant, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2020",2020-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by saying that we're really pleased with our third quarter. We reported operating earnings per share, excluding catastrophe losses, of $2.85, up 25% from the prior year period.  Net operatin",1391,"Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by saying that we're really pleased with our third quarter. We reported operating earnings per share, excluding catastrophe losses, of $2.85, up 25% from the prior year period.  
Net operating income for the quarter, also excluding catastrophe losses, was $172 million, an increase of 22% from last year largely due to more favorable noncat loss experienced in Global Housing, continued momentum in Global Lifestyle and improved results in Global Preneed. Sales trends across the board have been improving from lows recorded in March and April at the height of the pandemic, and we are seeing more normalized levels of COVID-related claims activity in Global Lifestyle and Global Housing.  
Now let's review segment results in greater detail, starting with Global Lifestyle. This segment reported earnings of $107 million in the third quarter, up 4% compared to the prior year period. This increase was primarily driven by Connected Living, where we benefited from new mobile subscribers. Improved profitability within extended service contracts also contributed to growth in the quarter.  
Within Global Automotive, results reflected continued pressure from lower investment income and investments to support growth.  
Declines in Global Financial Services reflected lower card balances and volumes as well as less favorable loss experience, some of which was attributable to COVID. We also incurred additional expenses to launch new client programs.  
Looking at total revenue, net earned premiums and fees grew by $56 million or 3%. The increase was driven primarily by 14% growth in Global Automotive, including prior period sales of vehicle service contracts. We're continuing to monitor sales trends, which has stabilized but still trail 2019 levels on a year-to-date basis due to impacts from COVID.  
Global Lifestyle revenue growth was partially offset by lower revenue from mobile trade-in, primarily due to the contract change we disclosed last quarter. This change lowered revenues by $39 million as we changed reporting from a gross sales basis per device to a flat fee per device. As a reminder, this change will remove some of the revenue and expense variability we have historically seen in our financial results and mitigate supply and demand pricing risk.  
Overall, for the full year 2020, we continue to expect Global Lifestyle to grow net operating income when compared to full year 2019.  
Looking ahead, we anticipate an uptick in trade-in activity in the fourth quarter, which will continue into the beginning of next year. Volumes will depend on the following: the timing and availability of devices for new phone introductions, the level of carrier promotions and the growth from new business.  
Looking ahead to 2021, we expect earnings expansion within lifestyle to moderate from the strong 2020 levels, which benefited from 3 items: first, $16 million of onetime benefits year-to-date; second, lower claims during the first few months of the COVID pandemic; and finally, lower expenditures on categories such as travel, given the uncertainty around the pandemic. We also expect ongoing headwinds from low interest rates on investment income.  
Moving now to Global Housing. Net operating income for the third quarter totaled $13 million compared to $42 million in the third quarter of 2019. The decrease was primarily due to $51 million of higher reportable catastrophes. As we preannounced, we incurred a total of $87 million of after-tax cat losses related to several hurricanes and wildfires in the U.S. Nearly half of the losses in the quarter were from Hurricane Laura, with the remainder primarily related to Hurricane Sally and Isaias, as well as wildfires in California and Oregon.  
Excluding catastrophe losses, earnings increased $23 million year-over-year or 30% to $100 million. Approximately 2/3 of the increase was due to favorable non-cat loss experience across specialty products and lender-placed. This included $8 million of favorable experience that we don't expect going forward, including reserve releases related to runoff businesses. Improvements in underwriting and product changes also led to more favorable experience.  
We also benefited from continued growth in multifamily housing from affinity partners. Within lender-placed, the results also reflected higher premium rates. Growth was partially offset by the reduction in policies in force, driven by declining REO volumes from the current foreclosure moratoriums and the previously disclosed financially insolvent client.  
Looking at placement rates. We recorded a 2 basis point sequential increase in the quarter to 1.58%. This was a attributable to a shift in business mix. It's not an indication of a broader macro housing shift.  
Turning to Global Housing revenues. Net earned premiums and fees decreased 4%. Similar to last quarter, this was driven mainly by 3 items:  The exit of small commercial, the insolvent lender-placed client, and lower REO volumes. This decrease was partially offset by growth in our multifamily housing and specialty property businesses. Multifamily housing revenues increased, driven mainly by growth from our affinity partners.  
For the full year, we expect Global Housing's net operating income, excluding cats, to increase year-over-year, driven by favorable non-GAAP loss experience as well as improved results in each line of business.  
Looking ahead, we expect to see more normalized non-cat loss experience, lower REO volumes due to foreclosure moratoriums that have now been extended through the remainder of 2020 and lower investment income due to lower yields.  
Specifically, in the fourth quarter, we also expect Hurricane Delta to be a reportable event, likely in the range of $12 million to $20 million pretax, subject to further claims analysis. And while still too early in the claims process to speculate, Hurricane Zeta will likely be a reportable event as well. We will provide an update prior to fourth quarter earnings, if necessary.  
Now let's move to Global Preneed. Overall, the business continues to perform well. The segment reported net operating income of $13 million, an increase of $6 million year-over-year. The absence of the negative onetime accounting adjustment in the third quarter of last year was offset by lower investment income this quarter.  
While market mortality trends have fluctuated during the pandemic, the impact on mortality on earnings continued to be immaterial in the quarter.  
Revenue for preneed was up slightly, primarily due to continued growth in sales of our Final Need product, and we are pleased to see a rebound in face sales since the second quarter, reflecting the reopening of funeral homes. Overall, for Global Preneed, we expect 2020 earnings will approximate 2019 reported results. 
Moving to corporate. The net operating loss was $23 million compared to $21 million in the third quarter of 2019. This was primarily due to lower investment income. For the full year, we expect 2020 corporate net operating loss to approximate $90 million, mainly as the result of lower investment income and investments for growth.  
Turning to holding company liquidity. We ended September with $460 million or $235 million above our current minimum target level. In the third quarter, dividends from our operating segments totaled $245 million.  
In addition to our quarterly corporate and interest expenses, we also had outflows from 3 items: first, we bought back $70 million of stock after resuming share repurchases in the quarter; second, we paid $42 million in common and preferred stock dividends; and finally, we had approximately $10 million of net cash outflows related to the acquisitions of Alegre and Fixt and the sale of our CLO platform. In the fourth quarter through October 30, we repurchased an additional 330,000 shares for $41 million.  
Regarding the new debt issuance to support the financing of HYLA, we continue to target an overall debt-to-capital ratio of less than 30% and expect to remain within that target while also maintaining investment-grade ratings.  
For Global Preneed, we reported a $136 million goodwill impairment charge. This was related to the decision to explore strategic alternatives for this segment, combined with the impact of the low interest rate environment. This is a noncash charge and runs through net income.  
Moving forward. For the year overall, we still expect dividends to approximate segment earnings, subject to: the growth of the businesses, rating agency and regulatory capital requirements and the performance of the investment portfolio.  
In summary, we've delivered solid results and maintained a strong financial position throughout the pandemic. As we approach year-end, we remain focused on meeting our 2020 financial objectives and on building a stronger Assurant for the future.  
And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

They've delivered strong double-digit growth over the past 3 years within their base. Now they've started to expand. And together, we'll have now more than 30-plus trade-in programs that are operating in key markets around the world and positions us well for the 5G megatrend.

As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we've now renewed the vast majority of our tracked loans.

On Sprint and T-Mobile, first of all, again, I want to recognize the importance that we have of that relationship with T-Mobile. We've been their partner, supporting their innovation and disruption for the last decade, and that is really the driver of our then now participating in the growth of Sprint. 
We are starting from 0. And there really, the program has just began to get going. It took a couple of months after the closing before T-Mobile really began to convert the stores as they wanted to make sure they didn't disrupt things during that conversion phase. So we're starting to see some impact, but it's going to be a gradual ramp. We're also investing, as you might expect, to help all the legacy Sprint stores be in a good position to sell our products as people come in. So not a lot of impact so far, but will be a significant growth driver over the next 2 to 3 years as that program really ramps.  
In terms of the trade-in and buyback cycle, what we've seen in the last 3 or 4 years is that the volume really begins in the latter part of Q4 and then really into Q1. And that's, again, what we expect to see this year. We'll see some volume beginning in Q4, but the bulk of the volume in the last couple of years has been lagged into the first quarter of next year. And it really is driven by, one, that new iPhones are available. And if you noticed their announcement, a couple of the new models were out right away, but a couple of the new models are still not out. And so we'll see that over time.  
And I mentioned 5G earlier. This is the first year that the iPhones really have 5G capability, which is a real positive. But when will consumers really get excited about 5G, we don't know for sure. But as we mentioned earlier, we're now well positioned to support our carrier partners with 5G when it happens."

So again, I think there, we have -- we've gotten good results out of that and are moving forward with positive results.  
The part of your question, which is how -- what will persist or not. We have had, within the non-cat loss ratio, some positives this year that won't reoccur. For example, some reserve releases of a limited amount that we mentioned in our prepared remarks of about $8 million. Those won't continue. We don't think.  
We've also had a really good run in terms of lower frequency, severity and things like theft and vandalism. Will that continue? That's sort of a question mark in terms of how that will go in the future.

We've reduced exposure by exiting the small commercial business. And so we do feel very good about the portfolio, and it's performing well. If you look at through the third quarter, even with an active cat year, our ROE in housing is something like 14% or 15%. And so it's still performing and delivering well.

But every year we look at it, as Alan said. We look at what can we do to manage our exposure, whether it be bringing down our retention. Brian, you'd mentioned buying in aggregate. That's obviously something that we look at every year. At the end of the day, there's economics around it, and there's pricing in the market. So we look at that and say, ""Is it thoughtful for us to buy more reinsurance? Or is this a risk we're happy to hold given the pricing out there in the market?""
As Alan said, we can have a quarter like last quarter, where we do get hit by natural catastrophes. But over a period of time, and I would say just 1 year, our combined operating ratio ends up being well below 100, and the ROEs on this business are very positive.

I mean the business is in a good position today as we've worked to drive efficiencies. We've, for example, been investing in improving various processes, using artificial intelligence and automation, and that has helped us. We are in the middle of converting clients to our single-source processing platform, which really delivers over the next few years a much simpler and better customer experience.  
But I don't think we'll have continued improvement in that ratio. What I mean by that is we've worked with our regulators to kind of agree a normal range combined ratio. And Richard, you may want to talk about that and how we think about that with our regulators. But we feel good about where it is today."

If we think about the last couple of years, we've seen the revenues come down, and now they're coming down very little. I mean we've talked about the financial insolvent client that put a little bit of headwind. But over the 9 months, we're down not much at all, let's call it 5%. So in terms of the expense management, I think we are at the bottom with the discipline we have and what we need to deliver to our customers, which is obviously at the forefront of our thoughts.  
And with regard to the regulators, obviously, the regulators take into account the experience we have. So if there's years where the overall loss ratio is really high, we could go and ask for some pricing improvements. If it's too low, obviously, that gets taken into account.  
So overall, I think even if the loss -- the expense ratio, though a lot lower, we would see that come through rate over time. I think where we're looking at the expense ratio was from a competitive point of view to be able to operate and produce the most efficiency for our customers so they get the best experience that we can offer them."

So there'll be a whole set of value that we can deliver through our service contract around keeping you connected. It's basically what we do in mobile today. And we see that coming to auto. So that's one thing.  
And then if you think about electric vehicles, for example, you'll have fewer things that can go wrong, but you'll have much higher severity when something does go wrong. And so we're learning. One of the reasons we've been pushing hard with electric, we've done a deal in China, we've now done the deal in the U.K., is to really develop the data and the learning so that we can be the most compelling offer to support what we think for a consumer will be even a greater interest in the service contract, both because of the nature of the risk, but because of the connectivity of the car. And that really is an area where we feel our business being in both mobile and auto gives us a unique set of advantages in the market."

First of all, we'll provide an outlook in Q4 earnings call, so that'd be early February, about what we really expect, and you shall -- should expect for 2021. 
A couple of comments though. 2020 has been a very strong earnings growth year. I'm really proud. I think we're all really proud of our people have delivered for our customers and our clients and for our shareholders. But the really strong 2020, it does create some year-on-year challenges, if we look at '21. We had about $16 million of onetime benefits in lifestyle earlier this year. We've never assumed a onetime benefit will recur. We had about $8 million of favorable experience. We just mentioned in Q3 in housing. We don't really expect that to recur. We did have some other benefits from, for example, our expense management actions, where we deferred some hiring. We reduced travel. That will come back. 
So definitely, 2021, we do expect to grow, but we expect it to moderate from 2020. And overall, if you think back to our Investor Day, we said at Investor Day that, on average, in 2020 and 2021, we would grow operating earnings, so NOI ex-cap by 12% on average. Back in Investor Day, we thought it would be a little bit lower in 2020 relative to the 12% and a little bit higher in 2021. Now we had a stronger 2020, and we now expect to moderate a little bit in 2021. But the combination of the EPS growth that we expect, the 12% on average 2021, we still believe that's appropriate."

And as you imagine, we've spent a fair amount of our time thinking about what are the long-term implications of COVID. 
I think for us, the first thing I'd highlight is just how resilient our business is. It shows the value of kind of an embedded subscriber base, a range of services that really allow consumers to stay connected. And one of the things that I think COVID has highlighted with the move to be at home more, then move to some sort of hybrid working model, and more likely post-COVID, being connected is everything. And what we do around connecting your devices, making sure everything your home is working, that's really important. So I think that actually helps us even more as we look to the future. 
A couple of other things we see with COVID, digital. Digital was obviously already a trend that we've been investing against for years. But I think the acceleration of digital is real and permanent. And we, for example, in the last 6 months or so, we really upped our investment in digital everywhere. So today, we feel, like an example, in rental, multifamily, our digital capabilities are at or better than anybody's in the market. So we see digital kind of as an ongoing trend. 
And then the other thing we're thinking about, are there changes, for example, in global supply chain? So we may think about that over time. 
But at the end of the day, I would highlight just how strong our business has performed through this uncertainty and just shows the value of what we're doing for our customers and how much they appreciate being able to stay connected and having everything in their home work the way they wanted it to."

Who knows that, that will be the case here, but that's probably a reasonable way to think about it. 
In terms of the valuation, I wouldn't speculate, but we are confident it's going to be an attractive valuation for our shareholders. We know from other life insurance transactions recently, there is a wide range of interest in assets like our preneed business. And we're confident that it's not valued appropriately in our stock. And that whatever we do here will unlock and create value for our shareholders over the next 4 to 9 months as we work through a process and then hopefully a closing.
