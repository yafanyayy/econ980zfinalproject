It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our third quarter performance. 
For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue growth was 12%, driven by volume and 60 basis points of price. We continue to experience strong underlying growth from our customers and success with new products. A total of $13 million or 180 basis points is included in constant currency organic revenue growth for the quarter from the 8 tuck-in acquisitions we completed this fiscal year. 
Gross margin for the quarter increased 40 basis points to 43.1% and was impacted favorably by productivity, price and mix, somewhat offset by higher labor costs. 
EBIT margin for the quarter was 21.1% of revenue, an increase of 30 basis points from the third quarter last year, despite an increase in expenses relating to higher incentive compensation due to our strong performance and a 9% increase in R&D expenses. 
The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 20%. Net income in the quarter grew 16% to $124 million, and earnings increased to $1.45 per diluted share, benefiting from revenue growth and margin expansion. 
In terms of the balance sheet, we ended December with $199.2 million of cash and $1.1 billion in total debt. During the third quarter, capital expenditures totaled $55.5 million while depreciation and amortization was $49.6 million. 
Free cash flow for the first 9 months declined as anticipated to $231 million -- sorry, $238.1 million, primarily due to the planned increase in capital spending. Our capital expenditures have been lower through the first 3 quarters of the year due to the timing of capital projects. As a result, we are decreasing our full year expectations for capital spending to $240 million and increasing our free cash flow expectations to $340 million. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Walt for his remarks."

As you've already heard, our third quarter continued the trend of outperformance we've seen in the last several quarters. We experienced solid growth across all of our segments and in total, delivered double-digit constant currency organic revenue growth for the third consecutive quarter, exceeding our expectations. 
Our Healthcare Specialty Services segment had a significantly stronger quarter than we anticipated, driven by double-digit growth in the repair business and continued contributions from new outsourced reprocessing centers coming online. Margins in this segment were impacted somewhat by start-up costs for our outsourced reprocessing centers and personnel costs to support future growth. 
Life Science also outperformed in the quarter, with good growth in consumables and a record level of capital equipment shipments. Even with the strong shipments, our increased capital orders allowed us to end the quarter with record backlog levels in Life Science. 
AST continued its outstanding revenue performance this year, growing 15% on a constant currency organic revenue basis for the quarter. We continue to see strong growth from our core medical device customers around the world. 
And lastly, Healthcare Products delivered a solid quarter, with particular strength in consumables. We continue to benefit from our new consumable products as well as recently acquired businesses. Our service maintenance revenue has grown to and was augmented by installation revenue due to the strong capital shipments in the first half of the year. 
Based on our performance year-to-date and expectations for the rest of the fiscal year, we are once again revising our full year outlook. Starting with revenue, we now expect constant currency organic revenue growth of approximately 9% for fiscal 2020, up from the prior 7.5% to 8.5% range. This increase is due to outperformance in the third quarter. Our expectations for the fourth quarter reflect difficult year-over-year comparisons. Recall that, our prior year Q4 constant currency organic revenue growth was 9%. In particular, we expect capital equipment to be roughly flat across the businesses in Q4. 
In Health Care products, which makes up the bulk of our capital equipment revenue, we have very difficult comparisons against the strong fourth quarter last year. As we mentioned in the past, we continue our efforts to level our capital shipments and avoid fourth quarter spikes. 
Given the strength we have seen so far this year and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we now anticipate adjusted earnings per diluted share to be at the high end of our $5.50 to $5.65 range. As a result, we continue to expect another year of record performance in 2020. We believe the short-term and long-term future for STERIS is bright, and we appreciate your ongoing support. 
Now before we open the Q&A, I would like to comment on coronavirus. As you probably know, China is a relatively small piece of STERIS's global revenue. So we don't anticipate any material impact to revenue from the coronavirus as a result of China sales this fiscal year. 
On the supply chain side, although the situation is fluid, we are in regular communication with our Chinese suppliers. At this time, we believe we should be able to mitigate any issues that may arise, so there are no material impacts to revenue due to the supply chain issues this fiscal year as well. 
We are in contact with our customers to understand how the situation is impacting NIM and what we can do to help. We're also in contact with our people and are deeply concerned for their health and safety. Our China operations have been closed since lunar year except for limited operations to support critical products, and we will continue to follow the guidance of the government and do what is best for our people. Like most businesses, we have restricted travel to and from China across the company. 
With that, we are happy to take any questions you may have. Julie, can you open the call for Q&A, please?"

And they've had increased pressure, if you will, or fullness. It has moved from the U.S. to overseas as we're now processing some things that would normally have processed in Americas overseas. So they're getting more full. Having said that, we continue to add capacity. And so there's 2 ways we add. One is by adding facilities or growing the number of chambers inside the facilities. The other is being more efficient with lean approaches inside those facilities. And we're doing both. So although we are more full than normal on the ethylene oxide type facilities, we continue to grow the ability to grow, if you will. By the same token on the radiation side, we can also continue to grow our ability to grow. And there, we've talked about a number of plants that are being built or added or opened across our global network. And we're doing so in a very technology-neutral approach. That is we're adding e-beam technology, we're adding x-ray technology, and we're adding capacity in the Cobalt facility. So we do see that as the approach. We clearly see greater growth in the e-beam and x-ray type facilities in any of the others, actually. And so that's where we're placing our money.

So we see sustained growth for our customers on the unit volume, at least for the foreseeable future. And that creates sustained growth for our AST business as well as our hospital business, our healthcare business. But I would add that given our global network, it is, I think, easier and easier for global type companies to work with someone like us who has broad coverage. We can move from plant plan A to plan B if they need to for whatever reason. And also, they can count on a single quality system and single regulatory system.

So that business has a pretty good growth rate. We think the Life Science business has continued kind of its long-term growth rate on the chemistry side, maybe slightly off of some of the faster years, but still solid growth in that business.

We have to revalidate the fact that the process, which uses oftentimes half the gas that the traditional process is used. It does -- we have to make sure -- we know we're using less gas, but we don't have to validate that part of the question. We know there will be less effluent. So we know that's not an issue. But -- and we also know the FDA pays particular attention to how much residual gas stays in the product. So if it gets implanted into the patient, that's okay. But we know that's better because we're starting out with less gas. So all those things are known. We just need to be absolutely positively sure that we are sterilizing the device when we do that. And that requires validation by the customers and us. We are working with the -- it also currently or historically requires the agency to look at it and improve it. We are working with the agency to lay out templates to make that far simpler for our customers and far less of a regulatory burden for our customers to be able to do that. So I'll call them the switching. The cost of the switching cost is all around validation than any other, I'll call it, material cost. Now obviously, it uses a little less gas, that cost is largely immaterial in the process. So as -- the delta in the gas usage is relatively immaterial. And frankly, in most cases, our total cost is immaterial, rather the transportation cost in the process. So this is not a big cost issue. It is a right issue, and both we and our customers are very serious to make sure that in enhancing what's potentially in the environment that we do not take any risk that the product is not sterile. Right now, we're -- I use the word that's an oxymoron. Today, in many cases, we're over sterilizing. Now once you kill all the bugs, you can't kill them again. So we're overgassing and not really over sterilizing. And to the extent we're over guessing, we don't need to do that. It does -- it takes time, but it's not -- it's measured in months for any specific customer in any specific product, but there's awful lot of customers and awful lot of products out there. So it will take a series of years, we believe. But we do think -- and Mr. , our Chief Operating Officer, who grew up in that business, absolutely believes in the set of target for his team to get down 50% using half the gas we used to use for the same level of requirements at -- and do that inside of 5 years, and we think we can hit those targets."

So as a result, we're as a quarter late versus calendar year kind of projections. So we have not -- we're in our planning processes. We have not concluded those processes yet. As I mentioned, the Chinese thing there's a little fluidity there. But I will say a couple of things to think about, a, we are starting from very nice growth rates, right? I mean, we're approaching double digits for the year, 9%. That gives us tough comps. But the flip side is, last year, we started out with uncertainties and tax, uncertainties and labor rates, uncertainties and trade. And for us, trade is North America, more than China. So the trade uncertainties in terms of NAFTA and Brexit. And last year, we did have some tough comps in Q4, which, again, we have tough comps this year in Q4. So if you look all through that, at a high level, we think about this business for the markets we're in to be in kind of a 4% to 6% constant currency grower. And hopefully, we get a point or so of share. We never know exactly when and how that's going to happen. Hopefully, we get a little price. Hopefully, we get a couple of acquisitions. And the next thing you know, we're in those high single digits. We're pretty comfortable right now with where we sit, that will be toward the high end of that 4% to 6% rates -- in our constant currency growth rates. Again, we haven't done our final analysis. We will obviously talk more about that in 3 months. But we're feeling pretty good about the high side."

And I don't really think we have any great knowledge on that. I will say, and I mentioned it last time, we have been impressed with the way the FDA has taking this bull by the horns, knowing that there is 50-some-odd percent of the devices are sterilized by ethylene oxide that need to be sterile. And so that -- it's very important to them to keep those supply chains moving. And I think they're doing a superb job of working on that. The EPA and particularly because the FDA and the Secretary Health have made it clear the risks that the country takes on if we cannot sterilize with ethylene oxide in the intermediate term. I think they would have done a nice job, but I think they are doing -- taking a nice methodical approach. It would be very easy for them to make a snap judgment. But from what we see, the way they've requested information, the way they're asking all types of players in this space, the manufacturers of the devices, those who sterilize and those who are concerned about those issues in the environment. By the way, we're in 2 of those -- we were all 3 of those 3 buckets. So we're concerned about the environment, we're concerned about sterilization, we're concerned about a device manufacturer being a device manufacturer. So it seems to me they're taking a very balanced approach to this process. We do feel -- our own opinion is we feel that we're at the high end of the industry in terms of the way we handle things. Our move toward sustainably couple of years ago now certainly led the industry, and we're clearly seeing people being very interested in that approach now. We also know about -- know the design of our facilities and the way we handle the gas in the way we remediate the gas is at the high end or the, I'll call it, the good end of the industry. So we are very comfortable that we have been and are safe for our people and our communities. But that doesn't mean we can rest on our laurels. We intend to get safer and safer, which is why we do this 50% reduction. And we're always looking at the way that we handle the gas inside and outside our facilities and we'll continue to do so. And by the way, that's not just a comment about the United States. That's a comment about the world. We are not assuming that they would be really care about it or Americans. And so that's our approach. We're comfortable -- as comfortable one can get, I guess, because you can always have something occur. You are correct in my own view, the bigger risk in the short run, least is the is local and state governments. But I do think now that it's very clear that both the FDA and the EPA are engaged, there's more likelihood that people will wait and see what that what that result is. And then based on that result, we'll take appropriate actions."

And then the second question, Mike, is you talked about 100 basis points or so of growth being added by M&A this quarter -- of this year.

So unfortunately, this year, doing 8 acquisitions that were all individually immaterial, but if you aggregate them all together, they become material. So that's the reason we chose our -- the way we want to disclose that this year is make sure that everybody understands that the impact and there is a pretty significant impact in the third quarter, 180 basis points in the quarter for constant currency organic revenue growth, that it is understood and we're being as transparent as possible. We don't like going down that path. Obviously, we would prefer to do an acquisition and separate that out and go back to our historical reporting, but this year is an anomaly, hopefully.

It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our third quarter performance. 
For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue growth was 12%, driven by volume and 60 basis points of price. We continue to experience strong underlying growth from our customers and success with new products. A total of $13 million or 180 basis points is included in constant currency organic revenue growth for the quarter from the 8 tuck-in acquisitions we completed this fiscal year. 
Gross margin for the quarter increased 40 basis points to 43.1% and was impacted favorably by productivity, price and mix, somewhat offset by higher labor costs. EBIT margin for the quarter was 21.1% of revenue, an increase of 30 basis points from the third quarter last year, despite an increase in expenses relating to higher incentive compensation due to our strong performance and a 9% increase in R&D expenses. 
The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 20%. Net income in the quarter grew 16% to $124 million, and earnings increased to $1.45 per diluted share, benefiting from revenue growth and margin expansion. 
In terms of the balance sheet, we ended December with $199.2 million of cash and $1.1 billion in total debt. During the third quarter, capital expenditures totaled $55.5 million while depreciation and amortization was $49.6 million. 
Free cash flow for the first 9 months declined as anticipated to $231 million -- sorry, $238.1 million, primarily due to the planned increase in capital spending. Our capital expenditures have been lower through the first 3 quarters of the year due to the timing of capital projects. As a result, we are decreasing our full-year expectations for capital spending to $240 million and increasing our free cash flow expectations to $340 million.

As you've already heard, our third quarter continued the trend of outperformance we've seen in the last several quarters. We experienced solid growth across all of our segments and in total delivered double-digit constant currency organic revenue growth for the third consecutive quarter, exceeding our expectations. 
Our Healthcare Specialty Services segment had a significantly stronger quarter than we anticipated, driven by double-digit growth in the repair business and continued contributions from new outsourced reprocessing centers coming online. Margins in this segment were impacted somewhat by start-up costs for outsourced reprocessing centers and personnel costs to support future growth. 
Life Science also outperformed in the quarter with good growth in consumables and a record level of capital equipment shipments. Even with the strong shipments, our increased capital orders allowed us to end the quarter with record backlog levels in Life Science. 
AST continued its outstanding revenue performance this year, growing 15% on a constant currency organic revenue basis for the quarter. We continue to see strong growth from our core medical device customers around the world. 
And lastly, Healthcare Products delivered a solid quarter, with particular strength in consumables. We continue to benefit from our new consumable products as well as recently acquired businesses. Our service maintenance revenue has grown too and was augmented by installation revenue due to the strong capital shipments in the first half of the year. 
Based on our performance year-to-date and expectations for the rest of the fiscal year, we are once again revising our full-year outlook. Starting with revenue, we now expect constant currency organic revenue growth of approximately 9% for fiscal 2020, up from the prior 7.5% to 8.5% range. This increase is due to outperformance in the third quarter. Our expectations for the fourth quarter reflect difficult year-over-year comparisons. Recall that our prior year Q4 constant currency organic revenue growth was 9%. In particular, we expect capital equipment to be roughly flat across the businesses in Q4. 
In Health Care products, which makes up the bulk of our capital equipment revenue, we have very difficult comparisons against the strong fourth quarter last year. As we mentioned in the past, we continue our efforts to level our capital shipments and avoid fourth quarter spikes. 
Given the strength we have seen so far this year and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we now anticipate adjusted earnings per diluted share to be at the high end of our $5.50 to $5.65 range. As a result, we continue to expect another year of record performance in 2020. We believe the short-term and long-term future for STERIS is bright, and we appreciate your ongoing support. 
Now, before we open the Q&A, I would like to comment on Coronavirus. As you probably know, China is a relatively small piece of STERIS' global revenue. So we don't anticipate any material impact to revenue from the Coronavirus as a result of China sales this fiscal year. 
On the supply chain side, although the situation is fluid, we are in regular communication with our Chinese suppliers. At this time, we believe we should be able to mitigate any issues that may arise, so there are no material impacts to revenue due to the supply chain issues this fiscal year as well. 
We are in contact with our customers to understand how the situation is impacting NIM and what we can do to help. We're also in contact with our people and are deeply concerned for their health and safety. Our China operations have been closed since the Lunar New Year except for limited operations to support critical products, and we will continue to follow the guidance of the government and do what is best for our people. Like most businesses, we have restricted travel to and from China across the company. 
With that, we are happy to take any questions you may have. Julie, can you open the call for Q&A, please?"

And they've had increased pressure, if you will, or fullness, and it has moved from the U.S. to overseas as we're now processing some things that would normally have processed in Americas overseas. So they're getting more full. Having said that, we continue to add capacity. And so there's 2 ways we add; one, is by adding facilities or -- for growing the number of chambers inside the facilities. The other is being more efficient with lean approaches inside those facilities. And we're doing both. So, although we are more full than normal on the ethylene oxide type facilities, we continue to grow the ability to grow, if you will. This -- and by the same token, on the radiation side, we can also continue to grow our ability to grow. And there, we've talked about a number of plants that are being built or added or opened across our global network. And we're doing so in a very technology-neutral approach. That is, we're adding e-beam technology, we're adding x-ray technology, and we're adding capacity in the Cobalt facility. So we do see that as the approach. We clearly see greater growth in the e-beam and x-ray type facilities than in the -- in any of the others, actually. And so that's where we're placing our money.

So we see sustained growth for our customers on the unit volume, at least for the foreseeable future. And that creates sustained growth for our AST business as well as our Hospital Business, our Healthcare Business. But I would add that given our global network, it is, I think, easier and easier for global-type companies to work with someone like us who has broad coverage.

So that business has a pretty good growth rate. We think the Life Science business has continued kind of its long-term growth rate on the chemistry side, maybe slightly off of some of the faster years, but still solid growth in that business. And vaccines and biologics, we think, is a good space to be in, and that's where we are.

So that is a non-cost item. It does cost our customers and us working together. We have to revalidate the fact that the process, which uses, oftentimes, half the gas that the traditional processes use, it does -- we have to make sure -- we know we're using less gas, so we don't have to validate that part of the question. We know there will be less effluent. So we know that's not an issue. But -- and we also know the FDA pays particular attention to how much residual gas stays in the product. So if it gets implanted into the patient, that's okay. But we know that's better because we're starting out with less gas. So all those things are known. We just need to be absolutely positively sure that we are sterilizing the device when we do that. And that requires validation by the customers and us. We are working with the -- it also currently or historically requires the agency to look at it and improve it. We are working with the agency to lay out templates to make that far simpler for our customers and far less of a regulatory burden for our customers to be able to do that. So I'll call it the switching the cost or the switching cost is all around validation than any other, I'll call it, material cost. Now obviously, it uses a little less gas, that cost is largely immaterial in the process. So as -- the delta in the gas usage is relatively immaterial. And frankly, in most cases, our total cost is immaterial relative to the transportation cost in the process. So this is not a big cost issue. It is a get-it-right issue, and both we and our customers are very serious to make sure that in enhancing what's potentially in the environment that we do not take any risk that the product is not sterile. Right now, we're -- I mean, use the word that's an oxymoron. Today, in many cases, we're over sterilizing. Now, once you kill all the bugs, you can't kill them again. So we're over-gassing and not really over sterilizing. And to the extent we're over-gassing, we don't need to do that. It does -- it takes time, but it's not -- it's measured in months for any specific customer in any specific product, but there's awful lot of customers and awful lot of products out there. So it will take a series of years, we believe. But we do think -- and Mr. Carestio, our Chief Operating Officer, who grew up in that business, absolutely believes in the set of target for his team to get down 50% using half the gas we used to use for the same level of requirements at -- and do that inside of 5 years. And we think we can hit those targets."

As I mentioned, the Chinese thing, there's a little fluidity there. But I will say a couple of things to think about; a, we are starting from very nice growth rates, right? I mean, we're approaching double digits for the year, 9%. That gives us tough comps. But the flip side is, last year, we started out with uncertainties and device tax, uncertainties in labor rates, uncertainties in trade. And for us, trade is North America, more than China. So the trade uncertainties in terms of NAFTA and then -- and Brexit. And last year, we did have some tough comps in Q4, which, again, we have tough comps this year in Q4. So if you look all through that, at a high level, we think about this business for the markets we're in to be in kind of a 4% to 6% constant currency grower. And hopefully, we get a point or so shared. You never know exactly when and how that's going to happen. Hopefully, we get a little price. Hopefully, we get a couple of acquisitions. And the next thing you know, we're in those high single digits. We're pretty comfortable right now with where we sit, that will be toward the high end of that 4% to 6% rates in our constant currency growth rates. Again, we haven't done our final analysis.

So we're concerned about the environment, we're concerned about sterilization, we're concerned about a device manufacturer -- being a device manufacturer. So it seems to me they're taking a very balanced approach to this process. We do feel -- our own opinion is we feel that we're at the high end of the industry in terms of the way we handle things. Our move toward sustainable EO a couple of years ago now certainly led the industry, and we're clearly seeing people being very interested in that approach now. We also know about -- know the design of our facilities and the way we handle the gas and the way we remediate the gas is at the high end of the -- I'll call it, the good end of the industry. So we are very comfortable that we have been and are safe for our people and our communities. But that doesn't mean we can rest on our laurels. We intend to get safer and safer, which is why we do this 50% reduction. And we're always looking at the way that we handle the gas inside and outside our facilities, and we'll continue to do so. And by the way, that's not just a comment about the United States. That's a comment about the world. We are not assuming that they would be really caring about [indiscernible] we're Americans. And so that's our approach. We're comfortable -- as comfortable one can get, I guess, because you can always have something occur. You are correct in my own view, the bigger risk in the short run at least is the -- is local and state governments. But I do think now that it's very clear that both the FDA and the EPA are engaged that there's more likelihood that people will wait and see what that result is. And then based on that result, we'll take appropriate actions."

So, just again, I want to make sure I'm understanding the investments, it seems pretty straightforward, but I just want to make sure we're understanding that. And then, what's the right way to think about, again, margins for this business going forward? 
And then the second question, Mike, is you talked about 100 basis points or so of growth being added by M&A this quarter -- this year. What is the threshold for when you kind of pull that out of organic growth? Because you still characterize as organic constant currency growth, but there's 100 basis points in there from M&A. So just trying to understand what the threshold is."

So, unfortunately, this year, doing 8 acquisitions that were all individually immaterial, but if you aggregate them all together, they become material. So that's the reason we chose our -- the way we want to disclose that this year is make sure that everybody understands that the impact. And there is a pretty significant impact in the third quarter, 180 basis points in the quarter for constant currency organic revenue growth, that it is understood and we're being as transparent as possible. We don't like going down that path, obviously. We would prefer to do an acquisition and separate that out and go back to our historical reporting, but this year is an anomaly, hopefully. But again, with 8 acquisitions combined being -- in the combination of all being relative, we have to do something so that we're, again, truly being transparent.

It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our third quarter performance. 
For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue growth was 12%, driven by volume and 60 basis points of price. We continue to experience strong underlying growth from our customers and success with new products. A total of $13 million or 180 basis points is included in constant currency organic revenue growth for the quarter from the 8 tuck-in acquisitions we completed this fiscal year. 
Gross margin for the quarter increased 40 basis points to 43.1%and was impacted favorably by productivity, price and mix, somewhat offset by higher labor costs. EBIT margin for the quarter was 21.1% of revenue, an increase of 30 basis points from the third quarter last year, despite an increase in expenses relating to higher incentive compensation due to our strong performance and a 9% increase in R&D expenses. 
The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 20%. Net income in the quarter grew 16% to $124 million, and earnings increased to $1.45 per diluted share, benefiting from revenue growth and margin expansion. 
In terms of the balance sheet, we ended December with $199.2 million of cash and $1.1 billion in total debt. During the third quarter, capital expenditures totaled $55.5 million while depreciation and amortization was $49.6 million. 
Free cash flow for the first 9 months declined as anticipated to $231 million -- sorry, $238.1 million, primarily due to the planned increase in capital spending. Our capital expenditures have been lower through the first 3 quarters of the year due to the timing of capital projects. As a result, we are decreasing our full year expectations for capital spending to $240 million and increasing our free cash flow expectations to $340 million. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Walt for his remarks."

As you've already heard, our third quarter continued the trend of outperformance we've seen in the last several quarters. We experienced solid growth across all of our segments and in total delivered double-digit constant currency organic revenue growth for the third consecutive quarter, exceeding our expectations. 
Our Healthcare Specialty Services segment had a significantly stronger quarter than we anticipated, driven by double-digit growth in the repair business and continued contributions from new outsourced reprocessing centers coming online. Margins in this segment were impacted somewhat by start-up costs for outsourced reprocessing centers and personnel costs to support future growth. 
Life Science also outperformed in the quarter with good growth in consumables and a record level of capital equipment shipments. Even with the strong shipments, our increased capital orders allowed us to end the quarter with record backlog levels in Life Science. 
AST continued its outstanding revenue performance this year, growing 15% on a constant currency organic revenue basis for the quarter. We continue to see strong growth from our core medical device customers around the world. 
And lastly, Healthcare Products delivered a solid quarter with particular strength in consumables. We continue to benefit from our new consumable products as well as recently acquired businesses. Our service maintenance revenue has grown, too, and was augmented by installation revenue due to the strong capital shipments in the first half of the year. 
Based on our performance year-to-date and expectations for the rest of the fiscal year, we are once again revising our full year outlook. Starting with revenue, we now expect constant currency organic revenue growth of approximately 9% for fiscal 2020, up from the prior 7.5% to 8.5% range. This increase is due to outperformance in the third quarter. Our expectations for the fourth quarter reflect difficult year-over-year comparisons. Recall that our prior year Q4 constant currency organic revenue growth was 9%. In particular, we expect capital equipment to be roughly flat across the businesses in Q4. 
In Healthcare Products, which makes up the bulk of our capital equipment revenue, we have very difficult comparisons against the strong fourth quarter last year. As we mentioned in the past, we continue our effort to level our capital shipments and avoid fourth quarter spikes. 
Given the strength we have seen so far this year and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we now anticipate adjusted earnings per diluted share to be at the high end of our $5.50 to $5.65 range. As a result, we continue to expect another year of record performance in 2020. We believe the short-term and long-term future for STERIS is bright, and we appreciate your ongoing support. 
Now, before we open the Q&A, I would like to comment on coronavirus. As you probably know, China is a relatively small piece of STERIS' global revenue. So we don't anticipate any material impact to revenue from the coronavirus as a result of China sales this fiscal year. 
On the supply chain side, although the situation is fluid, we are in regular communication with our Chinese suppliers. At this time, we believe we should be able to mitigate any issues that may arise, so there are no material impacts to revenue due to the supply chain issues this fiscal year as well. 
We are in contact with our customers to understand how the situation is impacting NIM and what we can do to help. We're also in contact with our people and are deeply concerned for their health and safety. Our China operations have been closed since the Lunar New Year, except for limited operations to support critical products, and we will continue to follow the guidance of the government and do what is best for our people. Like most businesses, we have restricted travel to and from China across the company. 
With that, we are happy to take any questions you may have. Julie, can you open the call for Q&A, please?"

And they've had increased pressure, if you will, or fullness. It has moved from the U.S. to overseas as we're now processing some things that would normally have processed in Americas overseas. So they're getting more full. Having said that, we continue to add capacity. And so there's 2 ways we add; one, is by adding facilities or growing the number of chambers inside the facilities. The other is being more efficient with lean approaches inside those facilities. And we're doing both. So although we are more full than normal on the ethylene oxide type facilities, we continue to grow the ability to grow, if you will. This -- and by the same token, on the radiation side, we can also continue to grow our ability to grow. And there, we've talked about a number of plants that are being built or added or opened across our global network. And we're doing so in a very technology-neutral approach. That is, we're adding e-beam technology, we're adding x-ray technology, and we're adding capacity in the Cobalt facility. So we do see that as the approach.

Obviously, that number has come down a little bit because of just the timing of projects, and I think we have about 8 recent projects that are being worked on that we've announced. Our view would be it's just a timing issue. So next year, I would look at CapEx being probably at that elevated level once again and maybe even for the next year or 2 after that. Obviously, with the growth that we're seeing from our customers from a medical device industry, we need to continue to add capacity to maintain the current growth."

We're in the middle of the baby boom right now, and the baby boomers are largely entering -- the biggest part of the baby boom is entering the high health care spending years. And things like orthopedic implants and stents and all those good medical devices to improve our lives get used a lot more when you're 65 and 70 and 75 than when you're 45 and 50 and 55. So we see sustained growth for our customers on the unit volume, at least for the foreseeable future. And that creates sustained growth for our AST business as well as our hospital business or Healthcare Business. But I would add that given our global network, it is, I think, easier and easier for global-type companies to work with someone like us who has broad coverage. We can move from plant A to plant B if they need to for whatever reason. And also, they can count on a single quality system and single regulatory system. So I do think that is helpful for us to grow a bit faster than the market."

So if you walk through it, we talked about the nice growth in the healthcare services business, both the equipment and repair business is growing nicely as we've added and continue to add capacity. The outsourced solutions, as I mentioned before, we think it's going to look a bit different in the Americas than it looks in the U.K. And I think we're getting better at understanding that model and providing what our customers want and need. So that business has a pretty good growth rate, we think. The Life Science business has continued kind of its long-term growth rate on the chemistry side, maybe slightly off of some of the faster years but still solid growth in that business. And vaccines and biologics, we think, is a good space to be in, and that's where we are. 
On the AST side, I think I've already talked about that. But we think that is a good grower. And on the healthcare side of the business, again, we continue to add product to our portfolio. We continue to refine our sales approaches. And, again, particularly in the -- I'll call it industrialized countries, we're facing the middle of the baby boom coming through, and that's going to be like a pig through a python in my opinion for the next 10 to 15 years.

Another might say, ""Gee, we'd like you to run our ORC, but we still need to have centers in -- turn centers in our ambulatory surgery centers.""

So that is a non-cost item. It does cost our customers and us working together. We have to revalidate the fact that the process, which uses, oftentimes, half the gas that the traditional process has used, it does -- we have to make sure -- we know we're using less gas, so we know have to validate that part of the question. We know there will be less effluent. So we know that's not an issue. But -- and we also know the FDA pays particular attention to how much residual gas stays in the product. So if it gets implanted into the patient, that's okay. But we know that's better because we're starting out with less gas. So all those things are known. We just need to be absolutely positively sure that we are sterilizing the device when we do that. And that requires validation by the customers and us. We are working with the -- and also currently or historically requires the agency to look at it and approve it. We are working with the agency to lay out templates to make that far simpler for our customers and far less of a regulatory burden for our customers to be able to do that. So I'll call it the switching -- the cost for the switching costs is all around validation than any other, I'll call it, material cost. Now obviously, it uses a little less gas. That cost is largely immaterial in the process. So as -- the delta in the gas usage is relatively immaterial. And frankly, in most cases, our total cost is immaterial relative to the transportation cost in the process. So this is not a big cost issue. It is a get-it-right issue, and both we and our customers are very serious to make sure that in enhancing what's potentially in the environment that we do not take any risk that the product is not sterile. Right now, we're -- I'm going to use the word that's an oxymoron. Today, in many cases, we're over sterilizing. Now, once you kill all the bugs, you can't kill them again. So we're over gassing and not really over sterilizing. And to the extent we're over gassing, we don't need to do that. It does -- it takes time, but it's not -- it's measured in months for any specific customer and any specific product, but there's awful lot of customers and awful lot of products out there. So it will take a series of years, we believe. But we do think -- and Mr. Carestio, our Chief Operating Officer, who grew up in that business absolutely believes in the set of target for his team to get down 50% using half the gas we used to use for the same level of requirements at -- and do that inside of 5 years. And we think we can hit those targets."

So as a result, we're a quarter late versus calendar year kind of projections. So we have not -- we're in our planning processes. We have not concluded those processes. As I mentioned the Chinese thing, there's a little fluidity there. But I will say a couple of things to think about, a, we are starting from very nice growth rates, right? I mean, we're approaching double digits for the year at 9%. That gives us tough comps. But the flip side is, last year, we started out with uncertainties in device tax, uncertainties in labor rates, uncertainties in trade. And for us, trade is North America, more than China. So the trade uncertainties in terms of NAFTA and then -- and Brexit. And last year, we did have some tough comps in Q4, which, again, we have tough comps this year in Q4. So if you look all through that, at a high level, we think about this business for the markets we're in to be in kind of a 4% to 6% constant currency grower. And hopefully, we get a point or so of share. You never know exactly when and how that's going to happen. Hopefully, we get a little price. Hopefully, we get a couple of acquisitions. And the next thing you know, we're in those high single digits. We're pretty comfortable right now with where we sit, that will be toward the high end of that 4% to 6% rates in our constant currency growth rates. Again, we haven't done our final analysis. We will obviously talk more about that in 3 months, but we're feeling pretty good about the high side."

And I don't really think we have any great knowledge on that. I will say and I mentioned it last time, we have been impressed with the way the FDA has taken this bull by the horns, knowing that there is 50-some-odd percent of the devices are sterilized by ethylene oxide that need to be sterile. And so that -- it's very important to them to keep those supply chains moving. And we -- I think they're doing a superb job of working on that. The EPA and particularly because the FDA and the Secretary of Health have made it clear the risks that the country takes on if we cannot sterilize with ethylene oxide in the intermediate term. I think they would have done a nice job, but I think they are doing -- taking a nice methodical approach. It would be very easy for them to make a snap judgment. But from what we see, the way they've requested information, the way they're asking all types of players in the space, the manufacturers of the devices, those who sterilize and those who are concerned about those issues in the environment. By the way, we're in 2 of those -- we're in all 3 of those 3 buckets. So we're concerned about the environment, we're concerned about sterilization, we're concerned about a device manufacturer -- being a device manufacturer. So it seems to me they're taking a very balanced approach to this process. We do feel -- our own opinion is we feel that we're at the high end of the industry in terms of the way we handle things. Our move toward sustainable EO a couple of years ago now certainly led the industry, and we're clearly seeing people being very interested in that approach now. We also know about -- know the design of our facilities and the way we handle the gas and the way we remediate the gas is at the high end of the -- I'll call it, the good end of the industry. So we are very comfortable that we have been and are safe for our people and our communities. But that doesn't mean we can rest on our laurels. We intend to get safer and safer, which is why we do this 50% reduction. And we're always looking at the way that we handle the gas inside and outside our facilities, and we'll continue to do so. And by the way, that's not just a comment about the United States. That's a comment about the world. We are not assuming that the only people that care about ethylene oxide gas are Americans. And so that's our approach. We're comfortable -- as comfortable one can get, I guess, because you can always have something occur. You are correct in my own view, the bigger risk in the short run at least is the -- is local and state governments. But I do think now that it's very clear that both the FDA and the EPA are engaged that there's more likelihood that people will wait and see what that result is. And then based on that result, we'll take appropriate actions."

It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our third quarter performance. 
For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue growth was 12%, driven by volume and 60 basis points of price. We continue to experience strong underlying growth from our customers and success with new products. A total of $13 million or 180 basis points is included in constant currency organic revenue growth for the quarter from the 8 tuck-in acquisitions we completed this fiscal year. 
Gross margin for the quarter increased 40 basis points to 43.1%and was impacted favorably by productivity, price and mix, somewhat offset by higher labor costs. EBIT margin for the quarter was 21.1% of revenue, an increase of 30 basis points from the third quarter last year, despite an increase in expenses relating to higher incentive compensation due to our strong performance and a 9% increase in R&D expenses. 
The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 20%. Net income in the quarter grew 16% to $124 million, and earnings increased to $1.45 per diluted share, benefiting from revenue growth and margin expansion. 
In terms of the balance sheet, we ended December with $199.2 million of cash and $1.1 billion in total debt. During the third quarter, capital expenditures totaled $55.5 million while depreciation and amortization was $49.6 million. 
Free cash flow for the first 9 months declined as anticipated to $231 million -- sorry, $238.1 million, primarily due to the planned increase in capital spending. Our capital expenditures have been lower through the first 3 quarters of the year due to the timing of capital projects. As a result, we are decreasing our full year expectations for capital spending to $240 million and increasing our free cash flow expectations to $340 million. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Walt for his remarks."

As you've already heard, our third quarter continued the trend of outperformance we've seen in the last several quarters.

As you've already heard, our third quarter continued the trend of outperformance we've seen in the last several quarters. We experienced solid growth across all of our segments and in total delivered double-digit constant currency organic revenue growth for the third consecutive quarter, exceeding our expectations. 
Our Healthcare Specialty Services segment had a significantly stronger quarter than we anticipated, driven by double-digit growth in the repair business and continued contributions from new outsourced reprocessing centers coming online. Margins in this segment were impacted somewhat by start-up costs for outsourced reprocessing centers and personnel costs to support future growth. 
Life Science also outperformed in the quarter with good growth in consumables and a record level of capital equipment shipments. Even with the strong shipments, our increased capital orders allowed us to end the quarter with record backlog levels in Life Science. 
AST continued its outstanding revenue performance this year, growing 15% on a constant currency organic revenue basis for the quarter. We continue to see strong growth from our core medical device customers around the world. 
And lastly, Healthcare Products delivered a solid quarter with particular strength in consumables. We continue to benefit from our new consumable products as well as recently acquired businesses. Our service maintenance revenue has grown, too, and was augmented by installation revenue due to the strong capital shipments in the first half of the year. 
Based on our performance year-to-date and expectations for the rest of the fiscal year, we are once again revising our full year outlook. Starting with revenue, we now expect constant currency organic revenue growth of approximately 9% for fiscal 2020, up from the prior 7.5% to 8.5% range. This increase is due to outperformance in the third quarter. Our expectations for the fourth quarter reflect difficult year-over-year comparisons. Recall that our prior year Q4 constant currency organic revenue growth was 9%. In particular, we expect capital equipment to be roughly flat across the businesses in Q4. 
In Healthcare Products, which makes up the bulk of our capital equipment revenue, we have very difficult comparisons against the strong fourth quarter last year. As we mentioned in the past, we continue our effort to level our capital shipments and avoid fourth quarter spikes. 
Given the strength we have seen so far this year and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we now anticipate adjusted earnings per diluted share to be at the high end of our $5.50 to $5.65 range. As a result, we continue to expect another year of record performance in 2020. We believe the short-term and long-term future for STERIS is bright, and we appreciate your ongoing support. 
Now, before we open the Q&A, I would like to comment on coronavirus. As you probably know, China is a relatively small piece of STERIS' global revenue. So we don't anticipate any material impact to revenue from the coronavirus as a result of China sales this fiscal year. 
On the supply chain side, although the situation is fluid, we are in regular communication with our Chinese suppliers. At this time, we believe we should be able to mitigate any issues that may arise, so there are no material impacts to revenue due to the supply chain issues this fiscal year as well. 
We are in contact with our customers to understand how the situation is impacting NIM and what we can do to help. We're also in contact with our people and are deeply concerned for their health and safety. Our China operations have been closed since the Lunar New Year, except for limited operations to support critical products, and we will continue to follow the guidance of the government and do what is best for our people. Like most businesses, we have restricted travel to and from China across the company. 
With that, we are happy to take any questions you may have. Julie, can you open the call for Q&A, please?"

And they've had increased pressure, if you will, or fullness. It has moved from the U.S. to overseas as we're now processing some things that would normally have processed in Americas overseas. So they're getting more full. Having said that, we continue to add capacity. And so there's 2 ways we add; one, is by adding facilities or growing the number of chambers inside the facilities. The other is being more efficient with lean approaches inside those facilities. And we're doing both. So although we are more full than normal on the ethylene oxide type facilities, we continue to grow the ability to grow, if you will. This -- and by the same token, on the radiation side, we can also continue to grow our ability to grow. And there, we've talked about a number of plants that are being built or added or opened across our global network. And we're doing so in a very technology-neutral approach. That is, we're adding e-beam technology, we're adding x-ray technology, and we're adding capacity in the Cobalt facility. So we do see that as the approach. We clearly see greater growth in the e-beam and x-ray type facilities than in the -- in any of the others, actually. And so that's where we're placing our money. Mike, I don't know if you want to talk about CapEx."

Our view would be it's just a timing issue. So next year, I would look at CapEx being probably at that elevated level once again and maybe even for the next year or 2 after that.

We're in the middle of the baby boom right now, and the baby boomers are largely entering -- the biggest part of the baby boom is entering the high health care spending years. And things like orthopedic implants and stents and all those good medical devices to improve our lives get used a lot more when you're 65 and 70 and 75 than when you're 45 and 50 and 55. So we see sustained growth for our customers on the unit volume, at least for the foreseeable future.

But I would add that given our global network, it is, I think, easier and easier for global-type companies to work with someone like us who has broad coverage. We can move from plant A to plant B if they need to for whatever reason. And also, they can count on a single quality system and single regulatory system.

The outsourced solutions, as I mentioned before, we think it's going to look a bit different in the Americas than it looks in the U.K. And I think we're getting better at understanding that model and providing what our customers want and need. So that business has a pretty good growth rate, we think. The Life Science business has continued kind of its long-term growth rate on the chemistry side, maybe slightly off of some of the faster years but still solid growth in that business. And vaccines and biologics, we think, is a good space to be in, and that's where we are.

I thought you guys did -- at the FDA panel, I thought you did an excellent job. I thought you guys were clearly the -- on EO were clearly the adults in the room. So -- because I wanted to ask some follow-up questions on sustainable EO. I think how long would it take to switch practices from traditional EO to sustainable EO to facility? What is the incremental cost of implementing that at a medium-sized facility? Does it require new equipment? And like what would be the cost savings of using less EO?"

So that is a non-cost item. It does cost our customers and us working together. We have to revalidate the fact that the process, which uses, oftentimes, half the gas that the traditional process has used, it does -- we have to make sure -- we know we're using less gas, so we know have to validate that part of the question. We know there will be less effluent. So we know that's not an issue. But -- and we also know the FDA pays particular attention to how much residual gas stays in the product. So if it gets implanted into the patient, that's okay. But we know that's better because we're starting out with less gas. So all those things are known. We just need to be absolutely positively sure that we are sterilizing the device when we do that. And that requires validation by the customers and us. We are working with the -- and also currently or historically requires the agency to look at it and approve it. We are working with the agency to lay out templates to make that far simpler for our customers and far less of a regulatory burden for our customers to be able to do that. So I'll call it the switching -- the cost for the switching costs is all around validation than any other, I'll call it, material cost. Now obviously, it uses a little less gas. That cost is largely immaterial in the process. So as -- the delta in the gas usage is relatively immaterial. And frankly, in most cases, our total cost is immaterial relative to the transportation cost in the process. So this is not a big cost issue. It is a get-it-right issue, and both we and our customers are very serious to make sure that in enhancing what's potentially in the environment that we do not take any risk that the product is not sterile. Right now, we're -- I'm going to use the word that's an oxymoron. Today, in many cases, we're over sterilizing. Now, once you kill all the bugs, you can't kill them again. So we're over gassing and not really over sterilizing. And to the extent we're over gassing, we don't need to do that. It does -- it takes time, but it's not -- it's measured in months for any specific customer and any specific product, but there's awful lot of customers and awful lot of products out there. So it will take a series of years, we believe. But we do think -- and Mr. Carestio, our Chief Operating Officer, who grew up in that business absolutely believes in the set of target for his team to get down 50% using half the gas we used to use for the same level of requirements at -- and do that inside of 5 years. And we think we can hit those targets."

So as a result, we're a quarter late versus calendar year kind of projections. So we have not -- we're in our planning processes. We have not concluded those processes. As I mentioned the Chinese thing, there's a little fluidity there. But I will say a couple of things to think about, a, we are starting from very nice growth rates, right? I mean, we're approaching double digits for the year at 9%. That gives us tough comps. But the flip side is, last year, we started out with uncertainties in device tax, uncertainties in labor rates, uncertainties in trade. And for us, trade is North America, more than China. So the trade uncertainties in terms of NAFTA and then -- and Brexit. And last year, we did have some tough comps in Q4, which, again, we have tough comps this year in Q4. So if you look all through that, at a high level, we think about this business for the markets we're in to be in kind of a 4% to 6% constant currency grower. And hopefully, we get a point or so of share. You never know exactly when and how that's going to happen. Hopefully, we get a little price. Hopefully, we get a couple of acquisitions. And the next thing you know, we're in those high single digits. We're pretty comfortable right now with where we sit, that will be toward the high end of that 4% to 6% rates in our constant currency growth rates. Again, we haven't done our final analysis. We will obviously talk more about that in 3 months, but we're feeling pretty good about the high side."

And I don't really think we have any great knowledge on that. I will say and I mentioned it last time, we have been impressed with the way the FDA has taken this bull by the horns, knowing that there is 50-some-odd percent of the devices are sterilized by ethylene oxide that need to be sterile. And so that -- it's very important to them to keep those supply chains moving. And we -- I think they're doing a superb job of working on that. The EPA and particularly because the FDA and the Secretary of Health have made it clear the risks that the country takes on if we cannot sterilize with ethylene oxide in the intermediate term. I think they would have done a nice job, but I think they are doing -- taking a nice methodical approach. It would be very easy for them to make a snap judgment. But from what we see, the way they've requested information, the way they're asking all types of players in the space, the manufacturers of the devices, those who sterilize and those who are concerned about those issues in the environment. By the way, we're in 2 of those -- we're in all 3 of those 3 buckets. So we're concerned about the environment, we're concerned about sterilization, we're concerned about a device manufacturer -- being a device manufacturer. So it seems to me they're taking a very balanced approach to this process. We do feel -- our own opinion is we feel that we're at the high end of the industry in terms of the way we handle things. Our move toward sustainable EO a couple of years ago now certainly led the industry, and we're clearly seeing people being very interested in that approach now. We also know about -- know the design of our facilities and the way we handle the gas and the way we remediate the gas is at the high end of the -- I'll call it, the good end of the industry. So we are very comfortable that we have been and are safe for our people and our communities. But that doesn't mean we can rest on our laurels. We intend to get safer and safer, which is why we do this 50% reduction. And we're always looking at the way that we handle the gas inside and outside our facilities, and we'll continue to do so. And by the way, that's not just a comment about the United States. That's a comment about the world. We are not assuming that the only people that care about ethylene oxide gas are Americans. And so that's our approach. We're comfortable -- as comfortable one can get, I guess, because you can always have something occur. You are correct in my own view, the bigger risk in the short run at least is the -- is local and state governments. But I do think now that it's very clear that both the FDA and the EPA are engaged that there's more likelihood that people will wait and see what that result is. And then based on that result, we'll take appropriate actions."

So that's the reason we chose our -- the way we want to disclose that this year is make sure that everybody understands the impact. And there is a pretty significant impact in the third quarter, 180 basis points in the quarter for constant currency organic revenue growth, that it is understood and we're being as transparent as possible. We don't like going down that path, obviously. We would prefer to do an acquisition and separate that out and go back to our historical reporting, but this year is an anomaly, hopefully.

It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our third quarter performance. 
For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue growth was 12%, driven by volume and 60 basis points of price. We continue to experience strong underlying growth from our customers and success with new products. A total of $13 million or 180 basis points is included in constant currency organic revenue growth for the quarter from the 8 tuck-in acquisitions we completed this fiscal year. 
Gross margin for the quarter increased 40 basis points to 43.1%and was impacted favorably by productivity, price and mix, somewhat offset by higher labor costs. EBIT margin for the quarter was 21.1% of revenue, an increase of 30 basis points from the third quarter last year, despite an increase in expenses relating to higher incentive compensation due to our strong performance and a 9% increase in R&D expenses. 
The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 20%. Net income in the quarter grew 16% to $124 million, and earnings increased to $1.45 per diluted share, benefiting from revenue growth and margin expansion. 
In terms of the balance sheet, we ended December with $199.2 million of cash and $1.1 billion in total debt. During the third quarter, capital expenditures totaled $55.5 million while depreciation and amortization was $49.6 million. 
Free cash flow for the first 9 months declined as anticipated to $231 million -- sorry, $238.1 million, primarily due to the planned increase in capital spending. Our capital expenditures have been lower through the first 3 quarters of the year due to the timing of capital projects. As a result, we are decreasing our full year expectations for capital spending to $240 million and increasing our free cash flow expectations to $340 million.

As you've already heard, our third quarter continued the trend of outperformance we've seen in the last several quarters. We experienced solid growth across all of our segments and in total delivered double-digit constant currency organic revenue growth for the third consecutive quarter, exceeding our expectations. 
Our Healthcare Specialty Services segment had a significantly stronger quarter than we anticipated, driven by double-digit growth in the repair business and continued contributions from new outsourced reprocessing centers coming online. Margins in this segment were impacted somewhat by start-up costs for outsourced reprocessing centers and personnel costs to support future growth. 
Life Science also outperformed in the quarter with good growth in consumables and a record level of capital equipment shipments. Even with the strong shipments, our increased capital orders allowed us to end the quarter with record backlog levels in Life Science. 
AST continued its outstanding revenue performance this year, growing 15% on a constant currency organic revenue basis for the quarter. We continue to see strong growth from our core medical device customers around the world. 
And lastly, Healthcare Products delivered a solid quarter with particular strength in consumables. We continue to benefit from our new consumable products as well as recently acquired businesses. Our service maintenance revenue has grown, too, and was augmented by installation revenue due to the strong capital shipments in the first half of the year. 
Based on our performance year-to-date and expectations for the rest of the fiscal year, we are once again revising our full year outlook. Starting with revenue, we now expect constant currency organic revenue growth of approximately 9% for fiscal 2020, up from the prior 7.5% to 8.5% range. This increase is due to outperformance in the third quarter. Our expectations for the fourth quarter reflect difficult year-over-year comparisons. Recall that our prior year Q4 constant currency organic revenue growth was 9%. In particular, we expect capital equipment to be roughly flat across the businesses in Q4. 
In Healthcare Products, which makes up the bulk of our capital equipment revenue, we have very difficult comparisons against the strong fourth quarter last year. As we mentioned in the past, we continue our effort to level our capital shipments and avoid fourth quarter spikes. 
Given the strength we have seen so far this year and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we now anticipate adjusted earnings per diluted share to be at the high end of our $5.50 to $5.65 range. As a result, we continue to expect another year of record performance in 2020. We believe the short-term and long-term future for STERIS is bright, and we appreciate your ongoing support. 
Now, before we open the Q&A, I would like to comment on coronavirus. As you probably know, China is a relatively small piece of STERIS' global revenue. So we don't anticipate any material impact to revenue from the coronavirus as a result of China sales this fiscal year. 
On the supply chain side, although the situation is fluid, we are in regular communication with our Chinese suppliers. At this time, we believe we should be able to mitigate any issues that may arise, so there are no material impacts to revenue due to the supply chain issues this fiscal year as well. 
We are in contact with our customers to understand how the situation is impacting NIM and what we can do to help. We're also in contact with our people and are deeply concerned for their health and safety. Our China operations have been closed since the Lunar New Year, except for limited operations to support critical products, and we will continue to follow the guidance of the government and do what is best for our people. Like most businesses, we have restricted travel to and from China across the company. 
With that, we are happy to take any questions you may have. Julie, can you open the call for Q&A, please?"

And they've had increased pressure, if you will, or fullness. It has moved from the U.S. to overseas as we're now processing some things that would normally have processed in Americas overseas. So they're getting more full. Having said that, we continue to add capacity. And so there's 2 ways we add; one, is by adding facilities or growing the number of chambers inside the facilities. The other is being more efficient with lean approaches inside those facilities. And we're doing both. So although we are more full than normal on the ethylene oxide type facilities, we continue to grow the ability to grow, if you will. This -- and by the same token, on the radiation side, we can also continue to grow our ability to grow. And there, we've talked about a number of plants that are being built or added or opened across our global network. And we're doing so in a very technology-neutral approach. That is, we're adding e-beam technology, we're adding x-ray technology, and we're adding capacity in the Cobalt facility. So we do see that as the approach. We clearly see greater growth in the e-beam and x-ray type facilities than in the -- in any of the others, actually. And so that's where we're placing our money.

We're in the middle of the baby boom right now, and the baby boomers are largely entering -- the biggest part of the baby boom is entering the high health care spending years. And things like orthopedic implants and stents and all those good medical devices to improve our lives get used a lot more when you're 65 and 70 and 75 than when you're 45 and 50 and 55. So we see sustained growth for our customers on the unit volume, at least for the foreseeable future. And that creates sustained growth for our AST business as well as our hospital business or Healthcare Business. But I would add that given our global network, it is, I think, easier and easier for global-type companies to work with someone like us who has broad coverage. We can move from plant A to plant B if they need to for whatever reason. And also, they can count on a single quality system and single regulatory system.

So if you walk through it, we talked about the nice growth in the healthcare services business, both the equipment and repair business is growing nicely as we've added and continue to add capacity. The outsourced solutions, as I mentioned before, we think it's going to look a bit different in the Americas than it looks in the U.K. And I think we're getting better at understanding that model and providing what our customers want and need. So that business has a pretty good growth rate, we think. The Life Science business has continued kind of its long-term growth rate on the chemistry side, maybe slightly off of some of the faster years but still solid growth in that business. And vaccines and biologics, we think, is a good space to be in, and that's where we are. 
On the AST side, I think I've already talked about that. But we think that is a good grower. And on the healthcare side of the business, again, we continue to add product to our portfolio. We continue to refine our sales approaches. And, again, particularly in the -- I'll call it industrialized countries, we're facing the middle of the baby boom coming through, and that's going to be like a pig through a python in my opinion for the next 10 to 15 years.

And so, oftentimes, when we're looking at things, we're able to talk to the hospitals about what their needs are, our healthcare systems and what their needs are. And for one, it might be, ""I add a little more to the CSD that I have."" The other one may say, ""Gee, I'll add some more, but can you take over some?"" Another might say, ""Gee, we'd like you to run our ORC, but we still need to have centers in -- turn centers in our ambulatory surgery centers."" I mean, it is a -- they are evolving their business model in this space. And having the full spectrum of products and services across that space does put us in a different position to give them what they want independent of what we might think is the best thing.

So that is a non-cost item. It does cost our customers and us working together. We have to revalidate the fact that the process, which uses, oftentimes, half the gas that the traditional process has used, it does -- we have to make sure -- we know we're using less gas, so we have to validate that part of the question. We know there will be less effluent. So we know that's not an issue. But -- and we also know the FDA pays particular attention to how much residual gas stays in the product. So if it gets implanted into the patient, that's okay. But we know that's better because we're starting out with less gas. So all those things are known. We just need to be absolutely positively sure that we are sterilizing the device when we do that. And that requires validation by the customers and us. We are working with the -- and also currently or historically requires the agency to look at it and approve it. We are working with the agency to lay out templates to make that far simpler for our customers and far less of a regulatory burden for our customers to be able to do that. So I'll call it the switching -- the cost or the switching costs is all around validation than any other, I'll call it, material cost. Now obviously, it uses a little less gas. That cost is largely immaterial in the process. So as -- the delta in the gas usage is relatively immaterial. And frankly, in most cases, our total cost is immaterial relative to the transportation cost in the process. So this is not a big cost issue. It is a get-it-right issue, and both we and our customers are very serious to make sure that in enhancing what's potentially in the environment that we do not take any risk that the product is not sterile. Right now, we're -- I'm going to use the word that's an oxymoron. Today, in many cases, we're over sterilizing. Now, once you kill all the bugs, you can't kill them again. So we're over gassing and not really over sterilizing. And to the extent we're over gassing, we don't need to do that. It does -- it takes time, but it's not -- it's measured in months for any specific customer in any specific product, but there's awful lot of customers and awful lot of products out there. So it will take a series of years, we believe. But we do think -- and Mr. Carestio, our Chief Operating Officer, who grew up in that business absolutely believes in the set of target for his team to get down 50% using half the gas we used to use for the same level of requirements at -- and do that inside of 5 years. And we think we can hit those targets."

As I mentioned the Chinese thing, there's a little fluidity there. But I will say a couple of things to think about, a, we are starting from very nice growth rates, right? I mean, we're approaching double digits for the year at 9%. That gives us tough comps. But the flip side is, last year, we started out with uncertainties in device tax, uncertainties in labor rates, uncertainties in trade. And for us, trade is North America, more than China. So the trade uncertainties in terms of NAFTA and then -- and Brexit. And last year, we did have some tough comps in Q4, which, again, we have tough comps this year in Q4. So if you look all through that, at a high level, we think about this business for the markets we're in to be in kind of a 4% to 6% constant currency grower. And hopefully, we get a point or so of share. You never know exactly when and how that's going to happen. Hopefully, we get a little price. Hopefully, we get a couple of acquisitions. And the next thing you know, we're in those high single digits. We're pretty comfortable right now with where we sit, that will be toward the high end of that 4% to 6% rates in our constant currency growth rates. Again, we haven't done our final analysis.

And I don't really think we have any great knowledge on that. I will say and I mentioned it last time, we have been impressed with the way the FDA has taken this bull by the horns, knowing that there is 50-some-odd percent of the devices are sterilized by ethylene oxide that need to be sterile. And so that -- it's very important to them to keep those supply chains moving. And we -- I think they're doing a superb job of working on that. The EPA and particularly because the FDA and the Secretary of Health have made it clear the risks that the country takes on if we cannot sterilize with ethylene oxide in the intermediate term. I think they would have done a nice job, but I think they are doing -- taking a nice methodical approach. It would be very easy for them to make a snap judgment. But from what we see, the way they've requested information, the way they're asking all types of players in the space, the manufacturers of the devices, those who sterilize and those who are concerned about those issues in the environment. By the way, we're in 2 of those -- we're in all 3 of those 3 buckets. So we're concerned about the environment, we're concerned about sterilization, we're concerned about a device manufacturer -- being a device manufacturer. So it seems to me they're taking a very balanced approach to this process. We do feel -- our own opinion is we feel that we're at the high end of the industry in terms of the way we handle things. Our move toward sustainable EO a couple of years ago now certainly led the industry, and we're clearly seeing people being very interested in that approach now. We also know about -- know the design of our facilities and the way we handle the gas and the way we remediate the gas is at the high end of the -- I'll call it, the good end of the industry. So we are very comfortable that we have been and are safe for our people and our communities. But that doesn't mean we can rest on our laurels. We intend to get safer and safer, which is why we do this 50% reduction. And we're always looking at the way that we handle the gas inside and outside our facilities, and we'll continue to do so. And by the way, that's not just a comment about the United States. That's a comment about the world. We are not assuming that the only people that care about ethylene oxide gas are Americans. And so that's our approach. We're comfortable -- as comfortable one can get, I guess, because you can always have something occur. You are correct in my own view, the bigger risk in the short run at least is the -- is local and state governments. But I do think now that it's very clear that both the FDA and the EPA are engaged that there's more likelihood that people will wait and see what that result is. And then based on that result, we'll take appropriate actions."

And then, what's the right way to think about, again, margins for this business going forward? 
And then the second question, Mike, is you talked about 100 basis points or so of growth being added by M&A this quarter -- this year. What is the threshold for when you kind of pull that out of organic growth? Because you still characterize as organic constant currency growth, but there's 100 basis points in there from M&A.

So that's the reason we chose our -- the way we want to disclose that this year is make sure that everybody understands the impact. And there is a pretty significant impact in the third quarter, 180 basis points in the quarter for constant currency organic revenue growth, that it is understood and we're being as transparent as possible. We don't like going down that path, obviously. We would prefer to do an acquisition and separate that out and go back to our historical reporting, but this year is an anomaly, hopefully.

It's once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our fourth quarter performance. For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue growth was 8%, driven by volume and 50 basis points of price. We continue to experience strong underlying growth from our customers and success with new products. A total of $14 million from tuck-in acquisitions is included in constant currency organic revenue growth, primarily in health care products, spread across capital, consumables and service. 
Given the timing of our year-end, we were fortunate to have had a relatively limited impact on our business due to COVID-19 during the fourth quarter. We estimate that revenue was negatively impacted by approximately a net $10 million. 
Gross margin for the quarter increased 60 basis points to 44.4% and was impacted favorably by price productivity and somewhat offset by higher labor costs. EBIT margin for the quarter was 21.8% of revenue, a decrease of 30 basis points from the fourth quarter last year due in part to an increase in expenses relating to higher incentive compensation related to our strong performance and an increase in R&D spending. 
The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 17.3%. This includes the benefit related to stock compensation expense and other favorable discrete items. Net income in the quarter grew 7% to $140.5 million and earnings per share increased to $1.64. 
I do want to take a moment to discuss our segment changes announced in yesterday's press release. We recently made some key changes to our management structure and reviewed our go-to-market strategy, focusing on our largest customer group health care providers. These changes include realigning the management of our operations to better serve our health care customers. Effective April 1, and consistent with the way management is now operating and viewing the business, the current Healthcare Products and Healthcare Specialty Services segment will be combined and reported as 1 segment, simply called Healthcare. We have included a recast of quarterly results for fiscal year 2020 in the press release to assist you with your modeling. 
Our balance sheet is a continued source of strength for the company, considering our cash position of $319.6 million, access to avail credit lines and a leverage ratio below 1.5x debt-to-EBITDA, we are well positioned from a liquidity standpoint. 
During the fourth quarter, capital expenditures totaled $60.9 million, while depreciation and amortization was $50.9 million. Given the uncertainty of the impact of COVID-19, one of the first steps we took was to pause capital spending where we could during the quarter. Free cash flow for the year exceeded our expectations due to lower-than-planned capital spending and a reduction in working capital, primarily driven by accounts receivable. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Walt for his remarks."

Before I get into our performance, I would like to take a moment to express our gratitude to the health care providers on the front lines of this pandemic. These are unprecedented times and the challenges facing those caregivers have been unexpected and monumental. I would also like to thank our people, those out in the field and those working behind the scenes in our factories, labs, offices and increasingly from their own homes. They are busy working to support those caregivers with essential products and services. I'm impressed with the way our team has come together during this crisis, helping our customers and each other, fulfilling our mission to create a healthier and safer world. 
At STERIS, we have a clear, long-term approach to running the business. Our customers come first and are followed closely by our people. If we do our jobs well for those 2 groups, we believe we will deliver above-average returns to our shareholders. This philosophy has successfully guided us through several significant challenges over the last decade plus and we are confident it will see us through this pandemic as well. We have chosen a strategy to focus on what we believe to be growth areas in health care, procedures, vaccines, biologics, while we are not immune to the downturn in procedures, which we believe to be temporary in nature. We have developed a nice balance to our business in terms of exposure to these areas and a good mix of recurring and capital equipment revenue. 
Finally, we have employed lean techniques and have been in-sourcing and on shoring to better protect our product and service supply chains for more than a decade, improving quality, delivery reliability and cost. As a result, we've had a long-term positive run. And so far, our business has fared comparatively well amidst the significant disruption in the global economy. 
For fiscal 2020, it is safe to say we would be celebrating this phenomenal record-breaking year we just completed, were it not for the pandemic. We broke the $3 billion revenue mark for the first time. Joined the S&P 500, had very strong growth rates in revenue and profitability, ended the year with a very strong balance sheet and would have been looking forward to another record year and repeat of solid growth performance in fiscal 2021. This puts us in an enviable position to face the challenges before us today. 
Revenue in fiscal 2020 grew 9% as reported and 10% on a constant currency organic basis with solid growth across all segments. This performance was a result of investments we've made in all our businesses as well as the benefit of approximately 100 basis points from small tuck-in acquisitions mostly in health care products. 
Our AST segment led the pack, growing constant currency organic revenue 15% for the year. As we've discussed all year, this segment has experienced increased demand from our core medical device customers. Demand will be strong in the long run, in our view, and we plan to continue investing in this business in fiscal 2021 and beyond. We currently see continued growth in those AST facilities that process for pharma for PPE like gowns and gloves and for personal use medical devices for the home setting, like insulin pumps and blood glucose monitors. We have, however, begun to see declines in time deferrable procedure-related devices like orthopedic implants. 
We expect this to be a relatively short-term phenomenon as health care providers begin doing these procedures again. 
Healthcare Specialty Services had another outstanding year, growing constant currency organic revenue 12% despite difficult comparisons with the prior year. We continue to see success across our spectrum of offerings in the U.S. Specific to the fourth quarter, impact of COVID-19, while our outsourced reprocessing business has been impacted by a decline in procedures, our instrument repair business was relatively insulated as many of our customers took advantage of the downtime for more comprehensive maintenance of their instruments. As you might expect, we saw a significant year-over-year decline in the last week or so of March and into April due to the reduction in nonessential procedures across America. 
Life Sciences had a better year than anticipated, growing revenue 11% on a constant currency organic basis. Capital equipment sales in this business followed a typical lumpy cadence in fiscal 2020, but our full year growth was 10%, which exceeded our expectations. In consumables, we saw high single to low double-digit growth all year with an upward spike in the fourth quarter, at least partially due to COVID 19. Some of our pharma customers appear to have stocked up, resulting in 26% growth for the fourth quarter in our Life Science consumables. We've continued to see strong growth in April. But we expect orders to return to a more normalized level in coming months. 
And finally, Healthcare Products also had a strong year with 7% constant currency organic revenue growth against challenging comparisons to fiscal '19. Organic growth continues to stem from new products, particularly in our infection prevention capital equipment and consumables franchise. 
In addition, as I mentioned earlier, this is the segment with the most significant impact from half a dozen or so tuck-in acquisitions this year, which added approximately 200 basis points to our annual growth. Offsetting the acquisitions, Healthcare Products experienced the most immediate revenue loss from COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in endoscopy products. For the fourth quarter, the positive impact of acquisitions, less the COVID related reductions combined to essentially offset each other in this segment. 
Adjusted operating margins for total STERIS in fiscal 2020 increased 70 basis points to 20.7%, reflecting improved volume and gross margin expansion. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the full year were a record $5.64, the high end of our recent expectations and represent 15% growth over fiscal 2019. We are very pleased with these results, which, in addition to our solid balance sheet position us well for the future. 
As you've heard from many others, the impact of COVID-19 remains fluid, making forecasting revenue and profit daunting at this time. Where not for the pandemic, we are confident we would have been comfortable at the high-end of our traditional revenue growth rates of 4% to 6% for fiscal '21. The impact of COVID-19 to STERIS will depend on the linked and severity of the pullback in health care procedures, offset by the areas of our business that are not impacted or are experiencing increased demand. In lieu of quantitative guidance, we will share our qualitative views and expect to revisit guidance as the year progresses. 
We are fortunate that our business is as diversified as it is across our medical device, pharma and Healthcare Provider customers, which we believe will be a source of strength in the coming months and quarters. Even during the great recession of '08, '09, our worst fiscal year revenue decline was 3%. And you may recall, we had a few other things going on at that time. That decline was spread over 3/4 that happened to be in different fiscal years. If we look at calendar 2009, it contained our 4 worst consecutive quarters of revenue decline during the downturn. This period combined the health care spending uncertainty of ObamaCare beginning with the economic impact of the Great Recession, and our revenue declined about 5% for the year. 
The preponderance of that decline was in capital equipment, and we were more capital equipment heavy at that time than we are today. 
As I mentioned earlier, our businesses fared relatively well so far. In the month of March, we experienced modest declines in our Healthcare business somewhat offset by neutral to positive performance from Life Science and AST. In April, we saw stronger declines in Healthcare with neutral deposit performance again in Life Science and AST. This resulted in a total STERIS revenue decline of less than 10% for April 2020 versus April 2019. 
On a positive note, we are beginning to see a return of procedures. While we expect this return to be gradual early on, we are encouraged by the discussions we are having with hospital leaders. Similar to others in our space, we anticipate ramping back up to more normalized levels by the end of this calendar year and possibly sooner. 
Given our financial strength and our expectation that procedure volumes will start to ramp back up in the coming quarter or so, our underutilized people are on standby ready to meet customer needs. We have not instituted layoffs, although some are on short-term paid furloughs. At this point, every 1 of our people is being paid their basic salary or regular wage for normal working hours, whether they are working full-time or not as long as they are available to work full time. We believe this is the right thing to do at this time and will help us support our customers as they ramp up their procedures to normal levels. We have highly skilled and committed people in our organization, and we want to maintain and grow that skill set. We hope to be able to continue this position until business resumes to more normal levels, but we're taking it week-by-week and will adjust as appropriate. 
We have taken some actions to protect our near-term cash flow from a slowdown. These include implementing a hiring freeze for most positions, deferring executive wage increases, canceling significant travel events, restricting routine travel and deferring capital expenditures except for strategic growth capital. 
For the most part, our plants and service operations have been and are ready to support our customers. We have had limited shutdowns of some facilities and some are operating below normal capacity. We continue to invest in R&D at a normal levels and intend to continue strategic growth capital spending, particularly in AST and outsourced reprocessing. We continue to believe that these investments will pay off in the intermediate and longer term. 
As Mike mentioned, our strong balance sheet remains a strength of the company. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We plan to continue paying dividends and to invest in our businesses drive anticipated future growth. Our M&A activities have become more selective and deferred due to the lack of visibility for near term expectations, but we continue to evaluate opportunities. And lastly, share buybacks have been discontinued for now, even those to offset dilution for executive compensation. 
As you know, STERIS is an essential business supporting health care. We are very fortunate to be in the business we're in and to be in a strong financial position. We need to be nimble and ready to support our customers as clinical procedures restart. We are very pleased to be able to provide some relief on the health care front lines with solutions to disinfect hospital respirators during this crisis. We continue working to enhance the long-term value of your company as we balance the short-term impacts of the pandemic with our longer-term opportunities. We believe the future for STERIS is bright, and thank you for all of your continued support. 
I will now turn the call back over to Julie for Q&A."

I mean, backlog has been -- is, by definition, orders coming in minus shipments going out and plus everyone was already there. So it does reflect all those kind of things. It's very common for us to have last minute pushouts for a couple of weeks or a month because their projects are not coming through on time. Typically, if you think about our capital business in health care, it's divided into what we call turn business or replacement business where you're just ordering a new table because you want 1 or because you're other 1 broke or a new light or something as opposed to a project where they're renovating a major section of the operating room or central sterile department. And typically, that's a 60-40 split, 60% turn replacement business and 40% project type business. We see this several times whenever hospitals become a bit uncertain on capital, the projects actually, if the steel is in the ground, keep moving forward because once in the steel is in the ground, they need to finish the project. It costs them too much to slow down or stop. 
On the other hand, the turn business tends to slow down a little bit until they get more visibility to what is going on. And so that's a typical thing that happens in an economic slowdown for hospitals, not necessarily the general economy, but the health care economy. We saw that -- well, we've seen it many, many times when the hospital is under some kind of financial constraint or financial pressure. If anything, we would expect to see something similar. We have not seen that to date. We've not seen significant pushouts, significant -- cancellations are super rare. We haven't seen any cancellations. And actually, orders have replicated last year for the last couple of months. So we have not seen a change in order pattern. 
Having said that, since our reps can't talk to hospital people face-to-face these days, I would anticipate seeing an order slowdown here in the next month or 2 or 3, it takes time for orders to occur. But the question is, what's the magnitude of that slowdown? And the good news is we had extraordinary backlog, as you said. So at this point, we can produce the backlog, assuming those orders do significantly because usually do not. We're in pretty good shape for a couple of months after that, then we depend more on the incoming orders. And we don't have a great deal of visibility to that yet. And hospitals in a period of uncertainty, there's been a lot more time worrying about how to handle the COVID pandemic right now than what their capital equipment orders are in the next couple of weeks."

I'm just trying to understand are OEMs moving away from in-sourcing the service given the regulatory environment? And then also, I think one of the comments that struck me. I always thought this was more of a med device sterilization business. Can you break down the difference between med device and farm exposure in AST?"

It -- you stated it correctly, it is a med device business that happens to also do some pharma and some other things. But the preponderance of the business is med device. But med devices have various roles. Again, a big, big piece of it are things like hip replacements and knee replacements and the implants for replacements, I should say, and for pacemakers and things like that. So there's a big piece, as you might expect, are implantable devices, and that's because they have to be sterile or implanted. Having said that, there are other components, we generally don't spend a lot of time talking about, but there are other components that kind of travel with those big pieces normally that is surgical gowns and masks and things like that, that may need to be sterile. And the sterile versions, we do process those as well. 
Now in a normal environment, that travels kind of consistently with procedures, as you might expect. Right now, gowns and gloves and masks are not traveling with procedures or traveling with COVID. And so we're getting -- what I would characterize as extraordinary demand increase in those spaces. And that's where we see the split, the people doing that. And then also things like the diabetic supplies and other things that are more home-based, they're still medical devices, but they are more home-based medical devices, chronic devices, if you will, as opposed to procedural devices. Those devices are also seeing a little bit -- I think it's consumer pull forward. If you're diabetic, you're anxious about making sure you have supplies at a time when there's a lot of things that are not very sure. And so I think we're seeing some pull forward of people stocking up a bit in diabetic supplies, whether they will continue that stock up or how they use it downward, if you will, is unclear. 
And then, of course, that space is just a rapidly growing space anyway because the innovation that diabetes companies have had in terms of monitoring the monitoring and having the closed-loop insulin system. So that space is a fast-growing space anyway, and now it's a little bit faster because of people stocking up a bit."

Walt or Michael, if you want to maybe address the combination of the Healthcare Products and the HSS division. I'm just curious if you could give us some additional detail there, how we should think about that combined entity going forward, ex COVID-19 from both a growth and a margin profile, assuming that there's some benefits that you anticipate on getting there. So would like to get some color on that front. And I'll just go ahead and do my second question now as well. In your prepared remarks, you alluded to being comfortable ex COVID-19 with the high end of the historical growth range of 4% to 6% in terms of organic revenue growth. I would appreciate just some color about the components of that? And in particular, maybe some emphasis on the AST segment. There's been a lot of debate whether that can actually sustain high single-digit type growth. So just kind of curious if you could add some color around that, again, independent of COVID-19?"
34783,658589504,1985704,"STERIS plc, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, May 14, 2020",2020-05-14,"Earnings Calls","STERIS plc","Executives","Thanks, Chris, and I appreciate the comments about the year. First, on the organizational side, as I mentioned several times that as we started doing this work in America, we found out that it doesn't -- and not surprisingly, doesn't work exactly as it do",597,"Thanks, Chris, and I appreciate the comments about the year. First, on the organizational side, as I mentioned several times that as we started doing this work in America, we found out that it doesn't -- and not surprisingly, doesn't work exactly as it does in the U.K. And so we've continued to experiment, and we have a number of different approaches to the market that we've been working with and many of those, the people who are in our IPT business, which serve the same set of customers are extraordinarily useful in bringing together. Also, as you might expect, if we're running the CSDs, they typically have STERIS equipment and STERIS products in them. And so the integration of that product set we thought was was worthwhile. 
So all of that business is now under -- in the commercial side of that business is now under the same individual who handles the historic STERIS capital consumables business in North America and the same is true in the rest of the world. So we've combined the commercial operations around the world. And we do believe we gain -- actually, we transfer the STERIS credibility from -- at the commercial level, at the working commercial level. 
Now they're still different sales forces and still different local management groups. But they're all under the commercial head. And we've actually moved some of the products amongst the businesses in terms of the business unit leaders to get them in the appropriate places. And so it's just now a very much combined set of businesses. And as a result, it's harder and harder to know where the revenue and profits really coming from and really going to. So we felt it was logical to combine those businesses, both organizationally and the way we are managing customers. 
And it's all the same customers that if you look at our 3 businesses, we have historically continued to organize backwards from customer in. So our Life Science business is organized around largely pharmaceutical also research, our AST business is organized around med devices and our Healthcare businesses organized around hospitals and inventory surgery at take places. So that's the logic. 
And even the historic U.S. business of IMS, we call IMS and have called Healthcare Specialty Services, that was kind of 2 basic product lines made up most of the business, the one being the outsourced resource -- outsourced reprocessing centers, Outsourced CSDs, if you will, and the instrument repair. And the instruments being repaired are a lot of the same type of businesses or instruments that are in U.S. endoscopy like, and so there's interface between those. So not only is that true of the ORC type businesses, but it's also true of the endoscopy type product line. So we have put those together. 
I don't know that we will see radical changes in cost. This is not a cost reduction move, there may be some minor opportunities, but really it's about continuing to ramp up the efficiency of the revenue generation in those businesses that we're after. So I think that's pretty much the answer to the first question. 
Again, that's now -- we did that a couple of months ago or 3 months ago now maybe, and it is a global organization, very smooth. It's not a lot of change in people or change in management structure. It's just the way that they are reporting up through those businesses now. 
Your second question was -- I've now forgotten since I answered the first one. Do me give me a quick help?"

Thanks, Chris, for the reminder. Like I said, we are confident. We built our business plan pre COVID. And so we are not only confident, we are sure we are thinking about numbers in the high end of that range. And so very, very comfortable there. And specific to AST, as you have seen AST continuing to perform both in March and April for the quarter and going into April, we are quite comfortable that it would have been on the leading edge, if you will, or the higher edge of the businesses. We've been saying that for some time now. We still think there's a runway for those higher single-digit kind of numbers going forward, absent COVID. Now COVID throws everything up in the air. So I would not begin to estimate what our growth rate would be in AST for this year. But as we come out of COVID, we feel comfortable that we're in a strong position. To do that, first of all, the device businesses are doing nicely. And secondly, as we've said before, because a lot of this, I'll call it, supply uncertainty question that was going on even prior to the COVID and certainly now post, I think you will see people that all things being equal, we'd rather have a relationship with someone who can move things from plan to plan to plan inside their organization as opposed to having to move things from plan A to plan B to plan C that are crossing other people. So -- and as I've said this before, I think companies like STERIS and there are other companies that have multiple plans. I think they will be in a stronger position given some of the supply chain things that have occurred in the last 6 to 12 months, I think we're even in a stronger position than we were before."

We can -- we're happy to talk about them generalized specifics, we're probably a little shy. But we continue the product portfolio enhancements that we have done across the business. And we're in the double-digit new products every year in our health care business for a long time now, and I don't see that stopping. So we just think a continuation of that product development stream is a good thing. And it's -- the same basic types of products that we provide today. So it's not a -- that's not something like a whole new division or anything coming out, but it's just more and more products, some of which are new and some of which are enhancements of our current product lines. 
So we just will be continuing that. And if anything, upping the ante. The second area in the HSS business, as I mentioned, we found that there are more than 1 way to skin a cat in the U.S. versus the U.K. version. So we have multiple types of thoughts around how we might help our customers with Outsourced ORC type capabilities. And those all require investment because unless we are just going into their facility and operating it, which is a rare case, we need to be adding capacity. That's the real issue. Whether it is constant capacity or peak capacity or other types of capacity add, we need to be adding capacity, and that takes capital investment. So that's what we're talking about. It's largely to say, Outsourced ORC, but you have to think about that in kind of its broadest context, that's the capacity we'd be adding."

And it certainly feels like capital spending is going to be under a significant pressure here for, I mean it could be 6, 12 months, who knows. But when do you start to see or start to get some visibility on kind of how that may impact your business? It sounds like, as Walt indicated, you haven't had a lot of discussions yet.

Larry, we've seen this movie -- or at least, I've seen this movie lots of time since 1982. When hospitals get put under pressure, the general move is they continue to buy the things they were going to buy, if you will, that were already on the docket. They will put in a capital freeze and just not unlike we do. We put in a capital freeze, but it's a freeze, but it's not a freeze. If they're in the middle of building a hospital, they're going to build it. If they think it's strategic, they're going to do the strategic builds. And then they slow down the replacements. 
Now when stuff breaks, they got to have it. So that will -- they still -- it's not like replacement stop completely. They just slow down. '08, '09 is a great example. In '08, '09, we have the combination, as I mentioned of the ObamaCare uncertainty and capital of Core's uncertainty. And so there was a lot of uncertainty. And then right behind it, the debt window for short-term debt froze up, and many of the hospitals had financed their long-term financing with short-term debt because it was very inexpensive to do so. And literally, they didn't have the cash. 
And so it's exactly what I've described happened. They put on -- in general, they put on some capital freezes. It slowed down a bit for a while. Usually, what happens is it's like truly frozen for a month or 2, that's okay because we go through the backlog and then they start releasing the things they really need slows down a bit. So I would think in the next 6 or 8 months, we would see the impact and begin to have better visibility to the pipeline. 
Right now, our pipeline visibility for the last 4, 5 weeks has been pretty much negligible because there's nothing really going on. Those conversations are not happening right now, except for giving this if I've already -- I've anticipated putting in place in my hospital.

We think our plan is a solid 1 for the future growth of that space, and we don't see a whole lot of reason to be backing off of it. We're pleased to have the capital position that we have. At this moment in time, the only reason we'll spend less capital in that business is because it's -- we can't get permits and things like that because the governments are effectively closed. They're doing other things besides permitting building permits and things like that. So that -- and/or construction company is not being able to provide labor or whatever. I mean, we want to do it on the schedule, we were doing it. We see no reason to be stopping. It takes us 2 years from the time we start to the time we can turn on the gas.

In terms of shifting among modalities, I think we have that pretty well scoped out. And I don't believe we have any great reason to change what our current plans were, but we'll be watching that, of course. We've continued to add capacity in EO in the last 12 months or so and going forward. And the bulk of that has been outside the U.S. just because that's where the business was, not because of any other reason.

Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It's once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our fourth quarter performance. For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue growth was 8%, driven by volume and 50 basis points of price. We continue to experience strong underlying growth from our customers and success with new products. A total of $14 million from tuck-in acquisitions is included in constant currency organic revenue growth, primarily in health care products, spread across capital, consumables and service. Given the timing of our year-end, we were fortunate to have had a relatively limited impact on our business due to COVID-19 during the fourth quarter. We estimate that revenue was negatively impacted by approximately a net $10 million. Gross margin for the quarter increased 60 basis points to 44.4% and was impacted favorably by price, productivity and somewhat offset by higher labor costs. EBIT margin for the quarter was 21.8% of revenue, a decrease of 30 basis points from the fourth quarter last year, due, in part, to an increase in expenses relating to higher incentive compensation related to our strong performance and an increase in R&D spending. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 17.3%. This includes the benefit related to stock compensation expense and other favorable discrete items. Net income in the quarter grew 7% to $140.5 million and earnings per share increased to $1.64. 
I do want to take a moment to discuss our segment changes announced in yesterday's press release. We recently made some key changes to our management structure and reviewed our go-to-market strategy, focusing on our largest customer group health care providers. These changes include realigning the management of our operations to better serve our health care customers. Effective April 1, and consistent with the way management is now operating and viewing the business, the current Healthcare Products and Healthcare Specialty Services segment will be combined and reported as one segment, simply called Healthcare. We have included a recast of quarterly results for fiscal year 2020 in the press release to assist you with your modeling. Our balance sheet is a continued source of strength for the company. Considering our cash position of $319.6 million, access to available credit lines and a leverage ratio below 1.5x debt-to-EBITDA, we are well positioned from a liquidity standpoint. 
During the fourth quarter, capital expenditures totaled $60.9 million, while depreciation and amortization was $50.9 million. Given the uncertainty of the impact of COVID-19, one of the first steps we took was to pause capital spending where we could during the quarter. Free cash flow for the year exceeded our expectations due to lower-than-planned capital spending and a reduction in working capital, primarily driven by accounts receivable. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Walt for his remarks."

Before I get into our performance, I would like to take a moment to express our gratitude to the health care providers on the front lines of this pandemic. These are unprecedented times and the challenges facing those caregivers have been unexpected and monumental. I would also like to thank our people, those out in the field and those working behind the scenes in our factories, labs, offices and increasingly from their own homes. They are busy working to support those caregivers with essential products and services. I'm impressed with the way our team has come together during this crisis, helping our customers and each other, fulfilling our mission to create a healthier and safer world. 
At STERIS, we have a clear, long-term approach to running the business. Our customers come first and are followed closely by our people. If we do our jobs well for those 2 groups, we believe, we will deliver above-average returns to our shareholders. This philosophy has successfully guided us through several significant challenges over the last decade plus, and we are confident it will see us through this pandemic as well. We have chosen a strategy to focus on what we believe to be growth areas in health care, for procedures, vaccines, biologics. While we are not immune to the downturn in procedures, which we believe to be temporary in nature, we have developed a nice balance to our business in terms of exposure to these areas and a good mix of recurring and capital equipment revenue. 
Finally, we have employed lean techniques and have been in-sourcing and on-shoring to better protect our product and service supply chains for more than a decade, improving quality, delivery reliability and cost. As a result, we've had a long-term positive run. And so far, our business has fared comparatively well amidst the significant disruption in the global economy. For fiscal 2020, it is safe to say we would be celebrating this phenomenal, record-breaking year we just completed, were it not for the pandemic. We broke the $3 billion revenue mark for the first time, joined the S&P 500, had very strong growth rates in revenue and profitability, ended the year with a very strong balance sheet and would have been looking forward to another record year and repeat of solid growth performance in fiscal 2021. This puts us in an enviable position to face the challenges before us today. Revenue in fiscal 2020 grew 9% as reported and 10% on a constant currency organic basis with solid growth across all segments. This performance was a result of investments we've made in all our businesses as well as the benefit of approximately 100 basis points from small tuck-in acquisitions mostly in health care products. 
Our AST segment led the pack, growing constant currency organic revenue 15% for the year. As we've discussed all year, this segment has experienced increased demand from our core medical device customers. Demand will be strong in the long run, in our view, and we plan to continue investing in this business in fiscal 2021 and beyond. We currently see continued growth in those AST facilities that process for pharma for PPE like gowns and gloves and for personal use medical devices for the home setting, like insulin pumps and blood glucose monitors. We have, however, begun to see declines in time-deferrable procedure-related devices like orthopedic implants. We expect this to be a relatively short-term phenomenon as health care providers begin doing these procedures again. 
Healthcare Specialty Services had another outstanding year, growing constant currency organic revenue 12%, despite difficult comparisons with the prior year. We continue to see success across our spectrum of offerings in the U.S. Specific to the fourth quarter, impact of COVID-19, while our outsourced reprocessing business has been impacted by a decline in procedures, our instrument repair business was relatively insulated as many of our customers took advantage of the downtime for more comprehensive maintenance of their instruments. As you might expect, we saw a significant year-over-year decline in the last week or so of March and into April, due to the reduction in nonessential procedures across America. 
Life Sciences had a better year than anticipated, growing revenue 11% on a constant currency organic basis. Capital equipment sales in this business followed a typical lumpy cadence in fiscal 2020, but our full year growth was 10%, which exceeded our expectations. In consumables, we saw high single to low double-digit growth all year with an upward spike in the fourth quarter, at least, partially due to COVID-19. Some of our pharma customers appear to have stocked up, resulting in 26% growth for the fourth quarter in our Life Science consumables. We've continued to see strong growth in April. But we expect orders to return to a more normalized level in coming months.
 And finally, Healthcare Products also had a strong year with 7% constant currency organic revenue growth against challenging comparisons to fiscal '19. Organic growth continues to stem from new products, particularly in our infection prevention capital equipment and consumables franchise. In addition, as I mentioned earlier, this is the segment with the most significant impact from half a dozen or so tuck-in acquisitions this year, which added approximately 200 basis points to our annual growth. Offsetting the acquisitions, Healthcare Products experienced the most immediate revenue loss from COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in endoscopy products. For the fourth quarter, the positive impact of acquisitions, less the COVID-related reductions combined to essentially offset each other in this segment. 
Adjusted operating margins for total STERIS in fiscal 2020 increased 70 basis points to 20.7%, reflecting improved volume and gross margin expansion. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the full year were a record $5.64, the high end of our recent expectations and represent 15% growth over fiscal 2019. We are very pleased with these results, which, in addition to our solid balance sheet, position us well for the future. As you've heard from many others, the impact of COVID-19 remains fluid, making forecasting revenue and profit daunting at this time. Where not for the pandemic, we are confident we would have been comfortable at the high-end of our traditional revenue growth rates of 4% to 6% for fiscal '21. The impact of COVID-19 to STERIS will depend on the linked and severity of the pullback in health care procedures, offset by the areas of our business that are not impacted or are experiencing increased demand. In lieu of quantitative guidance, we will share our qualitative views and expect to revisit guidance as the year progresses. We are fortunate that our business is as diversified as it is across our medical device, pharma and healthcare provider customers, which, we believe, will be a source of strength in the coming months and quarters. Even during the Great Recession of '08, '09, our worst fiscal year revenue decline was 3%. And you may recall, we had a few other things going on at that time. That decline was spread over three quarters that happened to be in different fiscal years. If we look at calendar 2009, it contained our 4 worst consecutive quarters of revenue decline during the downturn. This period combined the health care spending uncertainty of Obamacare beginning with the economic impact of the Great Recession, and our revenue declined about 5% for the year. The preponderance of that decline was in capital equipment, and we were more capital equipment heavy at that time than we are today. 
As I mentioned earlier, our businesses fared relatively well so far. In the month of March, we experienced modest declines in our Healthcare business, somewhat offset by neutral to positive performance from Life Science and AST. In April, we saw stronger declines in Healthcare with neutral deposit performance again in Life Science and AST. This resulted in a total STERIS revenue decline of less than 10% for April 2020 versus April 2019. On a positive note, we are beginning to see a return of procedures. While we expect this return to be gradual early on, we are encouraged by the discussions we are having with hospital leaders. Similar to others in our space, we anticipate ramping back up to more normalized levels by the end of this calendar year and possibly sooner. 
Given our financial strength and our expectation that procedure volumes will start to ramp back up in the coming quarter or so, our underutilized people are on standby ready to meet customer needs. We have not instituted layoffs, although some are on short-term paid furloughs. At this point, every one of our people is being paid their basic salary or regular wage for normal working hours, whether they are working full-time or not as long as they are available to work full time. We believe this is the right thing to do at this time and will help us support our customers as they ramp up their procedures to normal levels. We have highly skilled and committed people in our organization, and we want to maintain and grow that skill set. We hope to be able to continue this position until business resumes to more normal levels, but we're taking it week-by-week and will adjust as appropriate. We have taken some actions to protect our near-term cash flow from the slowdown. These include implementing a hiring freeze for most positions, deferring executive wage increases, canceling significant travel events, restricting routine travel and deferring capital expenditures except for strategic growth capital. 
For the most part, our plants and service operations have been and are running to support our customers. We have had limited shutdowns of some facilities and some are operating below normal capacity. We continue to invest in R&D at our normal levels and intend to continue strategic growth capital spending, particularly in AST and outsourced reprocessing. We continue to believe that these investments will pay off in the intermediate and longer term. 
As Mike mentioned, our strong balance sheet remains a strength of the company. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We plan to continue paying dividends and to invest in our businesses to drive anticipated future growth. Our M&A activities have become more selective and deferred due to the lack of visibility for near-term expectations, but we continue to evaluate opportunities. And lastly, share buybacks have been discontinued for now, even those to offset dilution for executive compensation. 
As you know, STERIS is an essential business supporting health care. We are very fortunate to be in the business we're in and to be in a strong financial position. We need to be nimble and ready to support our customers as clinical procedures restart. We are very pleased to be able to provide some relief on the health care front lines with solutions to disinfect hospital respirators during this crisis. We continue working to enhance the long-term value of your company as we balance the short-term impacts of the pandemic with our longer-term opportunities. We believe the future for STERIS is bright, and thank you for all of your continued support. 
I will now turn the call back over to Julie for Q&A."

I mean, backlog has been -- is, by definition, orders coming in minus shipments going out and plus whatever was already there. So it does reflect all those kind of things. It's very common for us to have last minute pushouts for a couple of weeks or a month because their projects are not coming through on time. Typically, if you think about our capital business in health care, it's divided into what we call turn business or replacement business, where you're just ordering a new table because you want one or because you're other one broke or a new light or something as opposed to a project where they're renovating a major section of the operating room or central sterile department. And typically, that's a 60-40 split, 60% turn or replacement business and 40% project type business. We've seen this several times whenever hospitals become a bit uncertain on capital, the projects actually, if the steel is in the ground, keep moving forward because once in -- the steel is in the ground, they need to finish the project. It costs them too much to slow down or stop. On the other hand, the turn business tends to slow down a little bit until they get more visibility to what is going on. And so that's a typical thing that happens in an economic slowdown for hospitals, not necessarily the general economy, but the health care economy. We saw that -- well, we've seen it many, many times when the hospital is under some kind of financial constraint or financial pressure. If anything, we would expect to see something similar. We have not seen that to date. We've not seen significant pushouts, significant -- cancellations are super rare. We haven't seen any cancellations. And actually, orders have replicated last year for the last couple of months. So we have not seen a change in order pattern. 
Having said that, since our reps can't talk to hospital people face-to-face these days, I would anticipate seeing an order slowdown here in the next month or 2 or 3, it takes time for orders to occur. But the question is, what's the magnitude of that slowdown? And the good news is we had extraordinary backlog, as you said. So at this point, we can produce the backlog, assuming those orders don't shift significantly, because they usually do not. We're in pretty good shape for a couple of months after that, then we depend more on the incoming orders. And we don't have a great deal of visibility to that yet. And hospitals, in a period of uncertainty, there's been a lot more time worrying about how to handle the COVID pandemic right now than what their capital equipment orders are in the next couple of weeks."

Can you break down the difference between med device and pharma exposure in AST?"

But the preponderance of the business is med device. But med devices have various roles. Again, a big, big piece of it are things like hip replacements and knee replacements and the implants for replacements, I should say, and for pacemakers and things like that. So there's a big piece, as you might expect, are implantable devices, and that's because they have to be sterile if they're implanted. Having said that, there are other components, we generally don't spend a lot of time talking about, but there are other components that kind of travel with those big pieces normally, that is surgical gowns and masks and things like that, that may need to be sterile. And the sterile versions, we do process those as well. 
Now in a normal environment, that travels kind of consistently with procedures, as you might expect. Right now, gowns and gloves and masks are not traveling with procedures, are traveling with COVID. And so we're getting -- what I would characterize as extraordinary demand increase in those spaces. And that's where we see the split, the people doing that. And then also things like the diabetic supplies and other things that are more home-based, they're still medical devices, but they are more home-based medical devices, chronic devices, if you will, as opposed to procedural devices. Those devices are also seeing a little bit -- I think it's consumer pull-forward. If you're diabetic, you're anxious about making sure you have supplies at a time when there's a lot of things that are not very sure. And so I think we're seeing some pull-forward of people stocking up a bit in diabetic supplies, whether they will continue that stock-up or how they use it downward, if you will, is unclear. And then, of course, that space is just a rapidly growing space anyway because the innovation that diabetes companies have had in terms of monitoring the -- monitoring and having the closed-loop insulin system. So that space is a fast-growing space anyway, and now it's a little bit faster because of people stocking up a bit."

So I would like to get some color on that front. And I'll just go ahead and throw my second question in now as well. In your prepared remarks, you alluded to being comfortable ex COVID-19 with the high end of the historical growth range of 4% to 6% in terms of organic revenue growth. I would appreciate just some color about the components of that. And in particular, maybe some emphasis on the AST segment. There's been a lot of debate whether that can actually sustain high single-digit type growth. So just kind of curious if you could add some color around that, again, independent of COVID-19?"

First, on the organizational side, as -- I have mentioned several times that as we started doing this work in America, we found out that it doesn't -- and not surprisingly, doesn't work exactly",604,"Thanks, Chris, and I appreciate the comments about the year. First, on the organizational side, as -- I have mentioned several times that as we started doing this work in America, we found out that it doesn't -- and not surprisingly, doesn't work exactly as it does in the U.K. And so we've continued to experiment, and we have a number of different approaches to the market that we've been working with and many of those, the people, who are in our IPT business, which serve the same set of customers, are extraordinarily useful in bringing together. Also, as you might expect, if we're running the CSDs, they typically have STERIS equipment and STERIS products in them. And so the integration of that product set we thought was worthwhile. So all of that business is now under -- in term -- the commercial side of that business is now under the same individual who handles the historic STERIS capital consumables business in North America and the same is true in the rest of the world. So we've combined the commercial operations around the world. And we do believe we gain -- actually, we transfer the STERIS credibility from -- at the commercial level, at the working commercial level. Now they're still different sales forces and still different local management groups. But they're all under the Commercial Head. And we've actually moved some of the products amongst the businesses in terms of the business unit leaders to get them in the appropriate places. And so it's just now a very much combined set of businesses. And as a result, it's harder and harder to know where the revenue and profits really coming from and really going to. So we felt it was logical to combine those businesses, both organizationally and the way we are managing customers. And it's all the same customers that if you look at our 3 businesses, we have historically continued to organize backwards from customer in. So our Life Science business is organized around largely pharmaceutical, also research. Our AST business is organized around med devices and our Healthcare business is organized around hospitals and ambulatory surgeries wherever they take place. And so that's the logic. 
And even the historic U.S. business of IMS, we call IMS and have called Healthcare Specialty Services, that was kind of 2 basic product lines made up most of the business, the one being the outsourced resource -- outsourced reprocessing centers, outsourced CSDs, if you will, and the instrument repair. And the instruments being repaired are a lot of the same type of businesses -- or instruments that are in U.S. endoscopy like, and so there's interface between those. So not only is that true of the ORC-type businesses, but it's also true of the endoscopy-type product line. So we have put those together. I don't know that we will see radical changes in cost. This is not a cost reduction move. There may be some minor opportunities, but really it's about continuing to ramp up of the efficiency of the revenue generation in those businesses that we're after. So I think that's pretty much the answer to the first question. Again, that's now -- we did that a couple of months ago or 3 months ago now maybe, and it is a global organization, very smooth. It's not a lot of change in people or change in management structure. It's just the way that they are reporting up through those businesses now. 
Your second question was -- I've now forgotten since I answered the first one. Do you mind give me a quick help?"

Thanks, Chris, for the reminder. Like I said, we are confident. We built our business plan pre-COVID. And so we are not only confident, we are sure we are thinking about numbers in the high end of that range. And so very, very comfortable there. And specific to AST, as you have seen AST continuing to perform both in March and April for the quarter and going into April, we are quite comfortable that it would have been on the leading edge, if you will, or the higher edge of the businesses. We've been saying that for some time now. We still think there's a runway for those higher single-digit kind of numbers going forward absent COVID. Now COVID throws everything up in the air. So I would not begin to estimate what our growth rate would be in AST for this year. But as we come out of COVID, we feel comfortable that we're in a strong position. To do that, first of all, the device businesses are doing nicely. And secondly, as we've said before, because a lot of this, I'll call it, supply uncertainty question that was going on even prior to the COVID and certainly now post, I think you will see people that, all things being equal, would rather have a relationship with someone who can move things from plant to plant to plant inside their organization as opposed to having to move things from plant A to plant B to plant C that are crossing other people. So -- and as I've said this before, I think companies like STERIS, and there are other companies that have multiple plants, I think, they will be in a stronger position given some of the supply chain things that have occurred in the last 6 to 12 months, I think we're even in a stronger position than we were before."

We can -- we're happy to talk about them in generalized specifics, we're probably a little shy. But we continue the product portfolio enhancements that we have done across the business. And we're in the double-digit new products every year in our Healthcare business for a long time now, and I don't see that stopping. So we just think a continuation of that product development stream is a good thing. And it's -- the same basic types of products that we provide today. So it's not a -- that's not something like a whole new division or anything coming out, but it's just more and more products, some of which are new and some of which are enhancements of our current product lines. So we just will be continuing that and if anything upping the ante. 
The second area in the HSS business, as I mentioned, we found that there are more than one way to skin a cat in the U.S. versus the U.K. version. So we have multiple types of thoughts around how we might help our customers with outsourced ORC-type capabilities. And those all require investment because unless we are just going into their facility and operating it, which is a rarer case, we need to be adding capacity. That's the real issue. Whether it is constant capacity or peak capacity or other types of capacity adds, we need to be adding capacity, and that takes capital investment. So that's what we're talking about. And it's largely, to say, outsourced ORC add, but you have to think about that in kind of its broadest context, that's the capacity we'd be adding."

The Life Sciences business was up significantly coming off of a strong backlog and equipment and extremely high demand, as it relates to our disinfectants and chemistries around cleaning. And some of that's pull-forward, we don't anticipate it being sustained. And then in general, in terms of our Healthcare business on capital, those were already planned shipments coming through. We haven't seen any cancellations. And it was normal shipping for the most part early on anyway in terms of our consumable lines. And those have now slowed a bit, but generally speaking, that's the essence."

We're all acutely aware of the negative mix shift that goes along with treating a COVID patient versus losing a surgical procedure. And it certainly feels like capital spending is going to be under a significant pressure here for, I mean, it could be 6, 12 months, who knows. But when do you start to see or start to get some visibility on kind of how that may impact your business? It sounds like, as Walt indicated, you haven't had a lot of discussions yet. Your reps obviously aren't in the hospitals. Hospitals have been focused on treating COVID patients and putting other things aside at this point. But when do you start to really get a flavor for how this may start to shake out in the coming months here?"

Larry, we've seen this movie or at least I've seen this movie lots of time since 1982. When hospitals get put under pressure, the general move is they continue to buy the things they were going to buy, if you will, that were already on the docket. They will put in a capital freeze and just not unlike we do. We put in a capital freeze, but it's a freeze, but it's not a freeze. If they're in the middle of building a hospital, they're going to build it. If they think it's strategic, they're going to do the strategic builds. And then they slow down the replacements. Now when stuff breaks, they got to have it. So that will -- they still -- it's not like replacements stop completely. They just slow down. '08, '09 is a great example. In '08, '09, we have the combination, as I mentioned of the Obamacare uncertainty and capital abhors uncertainty. And so there was a lot of uncertainty. And then right behind it, the debt window for short-term debt froze up, and many of the hospitals had financed their long-term financing with short-term debt because it was very inexpensive to do so. And literally, they didn't have the cash. And so exactly what I've described happened. They put on -- in general, they put on some capital freezes. It slowed down a bit for a while. Usually, what happens is it's like truly frozen for a month or 2, that's okay because we go through the backlog and then they start releasing the things they really need, it slows down a bit. So I would think in the next 6 or 8 months, we would see the impact and begin to have better visibility to the pipeline. 
Right now, our pipeline visibility for the last 4, 5 weeks has been pretty much negligible because there's nothing really going on. Those conversations are not happening right now, except for give me the stuff I've already -- I've anticipated putting in place in my hospital. So the next time we talk, I suspect we'll be able to talk about pipeline."

And we like our competitive position for the reasons I've described. We have a very broad array of technologies. And we have the ability to help customers if something happens in one of their plants and they needed to go to a different plant or if something happens in one of our plants and it needs to go to a different plant, we think that's a good place to be.

We think our plan is a solid one for the future growth of that space, and we don't see a whole lot of reason to be backing off of it. We're pleased to have the capital position that we have. 
At this moment in time, the only reason we'll spend less capital in that business is because it's -- we can't get permits and things like that because the governments are effectively closed. They're doing other things besides permitting, building permits and things like that. So that -- and/or construction companies not being able to provide labor or whatever. I mean, we want to do it on the schedule, we were doing it. We see no reason to be stopping. It takes us 2 years from the time we start to the time we can turn on the gas. We don't see any reason to be stopping gas right now. 
In terms of shifting among modalities, I think we have that pretty well scoped out. And I don't believe we have any great reason to change what our current plans were. But we'll be watching that, of course. We've continued to add capacity in EO in the last 12 months or so and going forward. And the bulk of that has been outside the U.S. just because that's where the business was, not because of any other reason. And we will continue to beef up that space as well as the various radiation modalities."

It's once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our fourth quarter performance. For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue growth was 8%, driven by volume and 50 basis points of price. We continue to experience strong underlying growth from our customers and success with new products. A total of $14 million from tuck-in acquisitions is included in constant currency organic revenue growth, primarily in health care products, spread across capital, consumables and service. Given the timing of our year-end, we were fortunate to have had a relatively limited impact on our business due to COVID-19 during the fourth quarter. We estimate that revenue was negatively impacted by approximately a net $10 million. Gross margin for the quarter increased 60 basis points to 44.4% and was impacted favorably by price, productivity and somewhat offset by higher labor costs. EBIT margin for the quarter was 21.8% of revenue, a decrease of 30 basis points from the fourth quarter last year, due, in part, to an increase in expenses relating to higher incentive compensation related to our strong performance and an increase in R&D spending. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 17.3%. This includes the benefit related to stock compensation expense and other favorable discrete items. Net income in the quarter grew 7% to $140.5 million and earnings per share increased to $1.64. 
I do want to take a moment to discuss our segment changes announced in yesterday's press release. We recently made some key changes to our management structure and reviewed our go-to-market strategy, focusing on our largest customer group health care providers. These changes include realigning the management of our operations to better serve our health care customers. Effective April 1, and consistent with the way management is now operating and viewing the business, the current Healthcare Products and Healthcare Specialty Services segment will be combined and reported as one segment, simply called Healthcare. We have included a recast of quarterly results for fiscal year 2020 in the press release to assist you with your modeling. Our balance sheet is a continued source of strength for the company. Considering our cash position of $319.6 million, access to available credit lines and a leverage ratio below 1.5x debt-to-EBITDA, we are well positioned from a liquidity standpoint. 
During the fourth quarter, capital expenditures totaled $60.9 million, while depreciation and amortization was $50.9 million. Given the uncertainty of the impact of COVID-19, one of the first steps we took was to pause capital spending where we could during the quarter. Free cash flow for the year exceeded our expectations due to lower-than-planned capital spending and a reduction in working capital, primarily driven by accounts receivable. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Walt for his remarks."

Before I get into our performance, I would like to take a moment to express our gratitude to the health care providers on the front lines of this pandemic. These are unprecedented times and the challenges facing those caregivers have been unexpected and monumental. I would also like to thank our people, those out in the field and those working behind the scenes in our factories, labs, offices and increasingly from their own homes. They are busy working to support those caregivers with essential products and services. I'm impressed with the way our team has come together during this crisis, helping our customers and each other, fulfilling our mission to create a healthier and safer world. 
At STERIS, we have a clear, long-term approach to running the business. Our customers come first and are followed closely by our people. If we do our jobs well for those 2 groups, we believe, we will deliver above-average returns to our shareholders. This philosophy has successfully guided us through several significant challenges over the last decade plus, and we are confident it will see us through this pandemic as well. We have chosen a strategy to focus on what we believe to be growth areas in health care, the procedures, vaccines, biologics. While we are not immune to the downturn in procedures, which we believe to be temporary in nature, we have developed a nice balance to our business in terms of exposure to these areas and a good mix of recurring and capital equipment revenue. 
Finally, we have employed lean techniques and have been in-sourcing and on-shoring to better protect our product and service supply chains for more than a decade, improving quality, delivery reliability and cost. As a result, we've had a long-term positive run. And so far, our business has fared comparatively well amidst the significant disruption in the global economy. For fiscal 2020, it is safe to say we would be celebrating this phenomenal, record-breaking year we just completed, were it not for the pandemic. We broke the $3 billion revenue mark for the first time, joined the S&P 500, had very strong growth rates in revenue and profitability, ended the year with a very strong balance sheet and would have been looking forward to another record year and repeat of solid growth performance in fiscal 2021. This puts us in an enviable position to face the challenges before us today. Revenue in fiscal 2020 grew 9% as reported and 10% on a constant currency organic basis with solid growth across all segments. This performance was a result of investments we've made in all our businesses as well as the benefit of approximately 100 basis points from small tuck-in acquisitions mostly in health care products. 
Our AST segment led the pack, growing constant currency organic revenue 15% for the year. As we've discussed all year, this segment has experienced increased demand from our core medical device customers. Demand will be strong in the long run, in our view, and we plan to continue investing in this business in fiscal 2021 and beyond. We currently see continued growth in those AST facilities that process for pharma, for PPE like gowns and gloves and for personal use medical devices for the home setting, like insulin pumps and blood glucose monitors. We have, however, begun to see declines in time-deferrable procedure-related devices like orthopedic implants. We expect this to be a relatively short-term phenomenon as health care providers begin doing these procedures again. 
Healthcare Specialty Services had another outstanding year, growing constant currency organic revenue 12%, despite difficult comparisons with the prior year. We continue to see success across our spectrum of offerings in the U.S. Specific to the fourth quarter, impact of COVID-19, while our outsourced reprocessing business has been impacted by a decline in procedures, our instrument repair business was relatively insulated as many of our customers took advantage of the downtime for more comprehensive maintenance of their instruments. As you might expect, we saw a significant year-over-year decline in the last week or so of March and into April, due to the reduction in nonessential procedures across America. 
Life Sciences had a better year than anticipated, growing revenue 11% on a constant currency organic basis. Capital equipment sales in this business followed a typical lumpy cadence in fiscal 2020, but our full year growth was 10%, which exceeded our expectations. In consumables, we saw high single to low double-digit growth all year with an upward spike in the fourth quarter, at least, partially due to COVID-19. Some of our pharma customers appear to have stocked up, resulting in 26% growth for the fourth quarter in our Life Science consumables. We've continued to see strong growth in April. But we expect orders to return to a more normalized level in coming months.
And finally, Healthcare Products also had a strong year with 7% constant currency organic revenue growth against challenging comparisons to fiscal '19. Organic growth continues to stem from new products, particularly in our infection prevention capital equipment and consumables franchise. In addition, as I mentioned earlier, this is the segment with the most significant impact from half a dozen or so tuck-in acquisitions this year, which added approximately 200 basis points to our annual growth. Offsetting the acquisitions, Healthcare Products experienced the most immediate revenue loss from COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in endoscopy products. For the fourth quarter, the positive impact of acquisitions, less the COVID-related reductions combined to essentially offset each other in this segment. 
Adjusted operating margins for total STERIS in fiscal 2020 increased 70 basis points to 20.7%, reflecting improved volume and gross margin expansion. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the full year were a record $5.64, the high end of our recent expectations and represent 15% growth over fiscal 2019. We are very pleased with these results, which, in addition to our solid balance sheet, position us well for the future. As you've heard from many others, the impact of COVID-19 remains fluid, making forecasting revenue and profit daunting at this time. Where not for the pandemic, we are confident we would have been comfortable at the high-end of our traditional revenue growth rates of 4% to 6% for fiscal '21. The impact of COVID-19 to STERIS will depend on the linked and severity of the pullback in health care procedures, offset by the areas of our business that are not impacted or are experiencing increased demand. In lieu of quantitative guidance, we will share our qualitative views and expect to revisit guidance as the year progresses. We are fortunate that our business is as diversified as it is across our medical device, pharma and healthcare provider customers, which, we believe, will be a source of strength in the coming months and quarters. Even during the Great Recession of '08, '09, our worst fiscal year revenue decline was 3%. And you may recall, we had a few other things going on at that time. That decline was spread over three quarters that happened to be in different fiscal years. If we look at calendar 2009, it contained our 4 worst consecutive quarters of revenue decline during the downturn. This period combined the health care spending uncertainty of Obamacare beginning with the economic impact of the Great Recession, and our revenue declined about 5% for the year. The preponderance of that decline was in capital equipment, and we were more capital equipment heavy at that time than we are today. 
As I mentioned earlier, our businesses fared relatively well so far. In the month of March, we experienced modest declines in our Healthcare business, somewhat offset by neutral to positive performance from Life Science and AST. In April, we saw stronger declines in Healthcare with neutral deposit performance again in Life Science and AST. This resulted in a total STERIS revenue decline of less than 10% for April 2020 versus April 2019. On a positive note, we are beginning to see a return of procedures. While we expect this return to be gradual early on, we are encouraged by the discussions we are having with hospital leaders. Similar to others in our space, we anticipate ramping back up to more normalized levels by the end of this calendar year and possibly sooner. 
Given our financial strength and our expectation that procedure volumes will start to ramp back up in the coming quarter or so, our underutilized people are on standby ready to meet customer needs. We have not instituted layoffs, although some are on short-term paid furloughs. At this point, every one of our people is being paid their basic salary or regular wage for normal working hours, whether they are working full-time or not as long as they are available to work full time. We believe this is the right thing to do at this time and will help us support our customers as they ramp up their procedures to normal levels. We have highly skilled and committed people in our organization, and we want to maintain and grow that skill set. We hope to be able to continue this position until business resumes to more normal levels, but we're taking it week-by-week and will adjust as appropriate. We have taken some actions to protect our near-term cash flow from the slowdown. These include implementing a hiring freeze for most positions, deferring executive wage increases, canceling significant travel events, restricting routine travel and deferring capital expenditures except for strategic growth capital.
For the most part, our plants and service operations have been and are running to support our customers. We have had limited shutdowns of some facilities and some are operating below normal capacity. We continue to invest in R&D at our normal levels and intend to continue strategic growth capital spending, particularly in AST and outsourced reprocessing. We continue to believe that these investments will pay off in the intermediate and longer term. 
As Mike mentioned, our strong balance sheet remains a strength of the company. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We plan to continue paying dividends and to invest in our businesses to drive anticipated future growth. Our M&A activities have become more selective and deferred due to the lack of visibility for near-term expectations, but we continue to evaluate opportunities. And lastly, share buybacks have been discontinued for now, even those to offset dilution for executive compensation. 
As you know, STERIS is an essential business supporting health care. We are very fortunate to be in the business we're in and to be in a strong financial position. We need to be nimble and ready to support our customers as clinical procedures restart. We are very pleased to be able to provide some relief on the health care front lines with solutions to disinfect hospital respirators during this crisis. We continue working to enhance the long-term value of your company as we balance the short-term impacts of the pandemic with our longer-term opportunities. We believe the future for STERIS is bright, and thank you for all of your continued support. 
I will now turn the call back over to Julie for Q&A."

I mean, backlog has been -- is, by definition, orders coming in minus shipments going out and plus whatever was already there. So it does reflect all those kind of things. It's very common for us to have last minute pushouts for a couple of weeks or a month because their projects are not coming through on time. Typically, if you think about our capital business in health care, it's divided into what we call turn business or replacement business, where you're just ordering a new table because you want one or because you're other one broke or a new light or something as opposed to a project where they're renovating a major section of the operating room or central sterile department. And typically, that's a 60-40 split, 60% turn or replacement business and 40% project type business. We've seen this several times whenever hospitals become a bit uncertain on capital, the projects actually, if the steel is in the ground, keep moving forward because once in -- the steel is in the ground, they need to finish the project. It costs them too much to slow down or stop. On the other hand, the turn business tends to slow down a little bit until they get more visibility to what is going on. And so that's a typical thing that happens in an economic slowdown for hospitals, not necessarily the general economy, but the health care economy. We saw that -- well, we've seen it many, many times when the hospital is under some kind of financial constraint or financial pressure. If anything, we would expect to see something similar. We have not seen that to date. We've not seen significant pushouts, significant -- cancellations are super rare. We haven't seen any cancellations. And actually, orders have replicated last year for the last couple of months. So we have not seen a change in order pattern.
Having said that, since our reps can't talk to hospital people face-to-face these days, I would anticipate seeing an order slowdown here in the next month or 2 or 3, it takes time for orders to occur. But the question is, what's the magnitude of that slowdown? And the good news is we had extraordinary backlog, as you said. So at this point, we can produce the backlog, assuming those orders don't shift significantly, because they usually do not. We're in pretty good shape for a couple of months after that, then we depend more on the incoming orders. And we don't have a great deal of visibility to that yet. And hospitals, in a period of uncertainty, they spend a lot more time worrying about how to handle the COVID pandemic right now than what their capital equipment orders are in the next couple of weeks."

But the preponderance of the business is med device. But med devices have various roles. Again, a big, big piece of it are things like hip replacements and knee replacements and the implants for replacements, I should say, and for pacemakers and things like that. So there's a big piece, as you might expect, are implantable devices, and that's because they have to be sterile if they're implanted. Having said that, there are other components, we generally don't spend a lot of time talking about, but there are other components that kind of travel with those big pieces normally, that is surgical gowns and masks and things like that, that may need to be sterile. And the sterile versions, we do process those as well. 
Now in a normal environment, that travels kind of consistently with procedures, as you might expect. Right now, gowns and gloves and masks are not traveling with procedures, are traveling with COVID. And so we're getting -- what I would characterize as extraordinary demand increase in those spaces. And that's where we see the split, the people doing that. And then also things like the diabetic supplies and other things that are more home-based, they're still medical devices, but they are more home-based medical devices, chronic devices, if you will, as opposed to procedural devices. Those devices are also seeing a little bit -- I think it's consumer pull-forward. If you're diabetic, you're anxious about making sure you have supplies at a time when there's a lot of things that are not very sure. And so I think we're seeing some pull-forward of people stocking up a bit in diabetic supplies, whether they will continue that stock-up or how they use it downward, if you will, is unclear. And then, of course, that space is just a rapidly growing space anyway because the innovation that the diabetes companies have had in terms of monitoring the -- monitoring and having the closed-loop insulin system. So that space is a fast-growing space anyway, and now it's a little bit faster because of people stocking up a bit."

Walt or Michael, if you want to maybe address the combination of the Healthcare Products and the HSS division. I'm just curious if you could give us some additional detail there, how we should think about that combined entity going forward ex COVID-19 from both a growth and a margin profile, assuming that there's some benefits that you anticipate on getting there? So I would like to get some color on that front. And I'll just go ahead and throw my second question in now as well. In your prepared remarks, you alluded to being comfortable ex COVID-19 with the high end of the historical growth range of 4% to 6% in terms of organic revenue growth. I would appreciate just some color about the components of that. And in particular, maybe some emphasis on the AST segment. There's been a lot of debate whether that can actually sustain high single-digit type growth. So just kind of curious if you could add some color around that, again, independent of COVID-19?"
34783,658589504,2017573,"STERIS plc, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, May 14, 2020",2020-05-14,"Earnings Calls","STERIS plc","Executives","Thanks, Chris, and I appreciate the comments about the year. First, on the organizational side, as -- I have mentioned several times that as we started doing this work in America, we found out that it doesn't -- and not surprisingly, doesn't work exactly",604,"Thanks, Chris, and I appreciate the comments about the year. First, on the organizational side, as -- I have mentioned several times that as we started doing this work in America, we found out that it doesn't -- and not surprisingly, doesn't work exactly as it does in the U.K. And so we've continued to experiment, and we have a number of different approaches to the market that we've been working with and many of those, the people, who are in our IPT business, which serve the same set of customers, are extraordinarily useful in bringing together. Also, as you might expect, if we're running the CSDs, they typically have STERIS equipment and STERIS products in them. And so the integration of that product set we thought was worthwhile. So all of that business is now under -- in term -- the commercial side of that business is now under the same individual who handles the historic STERIS capital consumables business in North America and the same is true in the rest of the world. So we've combined the commercial operations around the world. And we do believe we gain -- actually, we transfer the STERIS credibility from -- at the commercial level, at the working commercial level. Now they're still different sales forces and still different local management groups. But they're all under the Commercial Head. And we've actually moved some of the products amongst the businesses in terms of the business unit leaders to get them in the appropriate places. And so it's just now a very much combined set of businesses. And as a result, it's harder and harder to know where the revenue and profits really coming from and really going to. So we felt it was logical to combine those businesses, both organizationally and the way we are managing customers. And it's all the same customers that if you look at our 3 businesses, we have historically continued to organize backwards from customer in. So our Life Science business is organized around largely pharmaceutical, also research. Our AST business is organized around med devices and our Healthcare business is organized around hospitals and ambulatory surgeries wherever they take place. And so that's the logic. 
And even the historic U.S. business of IMS, we call IMS and have called Healthcare Specialty Services, that was kind of 2 basic product lines made up most of the business, the one being the outsourced resource -- outsourced reprocessing centers, outsourced CSDs, if you will, and the instrument repair. And the instruments being repaired are a lot of the same type of businesses -- or instruments that are in U.S. endoscopy like, and so there's interface between those. So not only is that true of the ORC-type businesses, but it's also true of the endoscopy-type product line. So we have put those together. I don't know that we will see radical changes in cost. This is not a cost reduction move. There may be some minor opportunities, but really it's about continuing to ramp up of the efficiency of the revenue generation in those businesses that we're after. So I think that's pretty much the answer to the first question. Again, that's now -- we did that a couple of months ago or 3 months ago now maybe, and it is a global organization, very smooth. It's not a lot of change in people or change in management structure. It's just the way that they are reporting up through those businesses now.
Your second question was -- I've now forgotten since I answered the first one. Do you mind giving me a quick help?"

Thanks, Chris, for the reminder. Like I said, we are confident. We built our business plan pre-COVID. And so we are not only confident, we are sure we are thinking about numbers in the high end of that range. And so very, very comfortable there. And specific to AST, as you have seen AST continuing to perform both in March and April for the quarter and going into April, we are quite comfortable that it would have been on the leading edge, if you will, or the higher edge of the businesses. We've been saying that for some time now. We still think there's a runway for those higher single-digit kind of numbers going forward absent COVID. Now COVID throws everything up in the air. So I would not begin to estimate what our growth rate would be in AST for this year. But as we come out of COVID, we feel comfortable that we're in a strong position. To do that, first of all, the device businesses are doing nicely. And secondly, as we've said before, because a lot of this, I'll call it, supply uncertainty question that was going on even prior to the COVID and certainly now post, I think you will see people that, all things being equal, would rather have a relationship with someone who can move things from plant to plant to plant inside their organization as opposed to having to move things from plant A to plant B to plant C that are crossing other people. So -- and as I've said this before, I think companies like STERIS, and there are other companies that have multiple plants, I think, they will be in a stronger position given some of the supply chain things that have occurred in the last 6 to 12 months, I think we're even in a stronger position than we were before."

We can -- we're happy to talk about them in generalized specifics, we're probably a little shy. But we continue the product portfolio enhancements that we have done across the business. And we're in the double-digit new products every year in our Healthcare business for a long time now, and I don't see that stopping. So we just think a continuation of that product development stream is a good thing. And it's -- the same basic types of products that we provide today. So it's not a -- that's not something like a whole new division or anything coming out, but it's just more and more products, some of which are new and some of which are enhancements of our current product lines. So we just will be continuing that and if anything, upping the ante. 
The second area in the HSS business, as I mentioned, we found that there are more than one way to skin a cat in the U.S. versus the U.K. version. So we have multiple types of thoughts around how we might help our customers with outsourced ORC-type capabilities. And those all require investment because unless we are just going into their facility and operating it, which is a rarer case, we need to be adding capacity. That's the real issue. Whether it is constant capacity or peak capacity or other types of capacity adds, we need to be adding capacity, and that takes capital investment. So that's what we're talking about. And it's largely, to say, outsourced ORC, but you have to think about that in kind of its broadest context, that's the capacity we'd be adding."

But when do you start to see or start to get some visibility on kind of how that may impact your business? It sounds like, as Walt indicated, you haven't had a lot of discussions yet.

Larry, we've seen this movie or at least I've seen this movie lots of time since 1982. When hospitals get put under pressure, the general move is they continue to buy the things they were going to buy, if you will, that were already on the docket. They will put in a capital freeze and just not unlike we do. We put in a capital freeze, but it's a freeze, but it's not a freeze. If they're in the middle of building a hospital, they're going to build it. If they think it's strategic, they're going to do the strategic builds. And then they slow down the replacements. Now when stuff breaks, they got to have it. So that will -- they still -- it's not like replacements stop completely. They just slow down. '08, '09 is a great example. In '08, '09, we have the combination, as I mentioned of the Obamacare uncertainty and capital abhors uncertainty. And so there was a lot of uncertainty. And then right behind it, the debt window for short-term debt froze up, and many of the hospitals had financed their long-term financing with short-term debt because it was very inexpensive to do so. And literally, they didn't have the cash. And so exactly what I've described happened. They put on -- in general, they put on some capital freezes. It slowed down a bit for a while. Usually, what happens is it's like truly frozen for a month or 2, that's okay because we go through the backlog and then they start releasing the things they really need, it slows down a bit. So I would think in the next 6 or 8 months, we would see the impact and begin to have better visibility to the pipeline. 
Right now, our pipeline visibility for the last 4, 5 weeks has been pretty much negligible because there's nothing really going on.

And we like our competitive position for the reasons I've described. We have a very broad array of technologies. And we have the ability to help customers if something happens in one of their plants and they needed to go to a different plant or if something happens in one of our plants and it needs to go to a different plant, we think that's a good place to be. And the same with technologies, to the extent you can move across technologies, we have the ability to do that. So we like the business. We think our plan is a solid one for the future growth of that space, and we don't see a whole lot of reason to be backing off of it. We're pleased to have the capital position that we have. 
At this moment in time, the only reason we'll spend less capital in that business is because it's -- we can't get permits and things like that because the governments are effectively closed. They're doing other things besides permitting, building permits and things like that. So that -- and/or construction companies not being able to provide labor or whatever. I mean, we want to do it on the schedule, we were doing it. We see no reason to be stopping. It takes us 2 years from the time we start to the time we can turn on the gas. We don't see any reason to be stopping gas right now. 
In terms of shifting among modalities, I think we have that pretty well scoped out. And I don't believe we have any great reason to change what our current plans were. But we'll be watching that, of course. We've continued to add capacity in EO in the last 12 months or so and going forward. And the bulk of that has been outside the U.S. just because that's where the business was, not because of any other reason. And we will continue to beef up that space as well as the various radiation modalities."

It's once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our fourth quarter performance. For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue growth was 8%, driven by volume and 50 basis points of price. We continue to experience strong underlying growth from our customers and success with new products. A total of $14 million from tuck-in acquisitions is included in constant currency organic revenue growth, primarily in health care products, spread across capital, consumables and service. Given the timing of our year-end, we were fortunate to have had a relatively limited impact on our business due to COVID-19 during the fourth quarter. We estimate that revenue was negatively impacted by approximately a net $10 million. Gross margin for the quarter increased 60 basis points to 44.4% and was impacted favorably by price, productivity and somewhat offset by higher labor costs. EBIT margin for the quarter was 21.8% of revenue, a decrease of 30 basis points from the fourth quarter last year, due, in part, to an increase in expenses relating to higher incentive compensation related to our strong performance and an increase in R&D spending. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 17.3%. This includes the benefit related to stock compensation expense and other favorable discrete items. Net income in the quarter grew 7% to $140.5 million and earnings per share increased to $1.64. 
I do want to take a moment to discuss our segment changes announced in yesterday's press release. We recently made some key changes to our management structure and reviewed our go-to-market strategy, focusing on our largest customer group health care providers. These changes include realigning the management of our operations to better serve our health care customers. Effective April 1, and consistent with the way management is now operating and viewing the business, the current Healthcare Products and Healthcare Specialty Services segment will be combined and reported as one segment, simply called Healthcare. We have included a recast of quarterly results for fiscal year 2020 in the press release to assist you with your modeling. Our balance sheet is a continued source of strength for the company. Considering our cash position of $319.6 million, access to available credit lines and a leverage ratio below 1.5x debt-to-EBITDA, we are well positioned from a liquidity standpoint. 
During the fourth quarter, capital expenditures totaled $60.9 million, while depreciation and amortization was $50.9 million. Given the uncertainty of the impact of COVID-19, one of the first steps we took was to pause capital spending where we could during the quarter. Free cash flow for the year exceeded our expectations due to lower-than-planned capital spending and a reduction in working capital, primarily driven by accounts receivable. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Walt for his remarks."

Before I get into our performance, I would like to take a moment to express our gratitude to the health care providers on the front lines of this pandemic. These are unprecedented times and the challenges facing those caregivers have been unexpected and monumental. I would also like to thank our people, those out in the field and those working behind the scenes in our factories, labs, offices and increasingly from their own homes. They are busy working to support those caregivers with essential products and services. I'm impressed with the way our team has come together during this crisis, helping our customers and each other, fulfilling our mission to create a healthier and safer world. 
At STERIS, we have a clear, long-term approach to running the business. Our customers come first and are followed closely by our people. If we do our jobs well for those 2 groups, we believe, we will deliver above-average returns to our shareholders. This philosophy has successfully guided us through several significant challenges over the last decade plus, and we are confident it will see us through this pandemic as well. We have chosen a strategy to focus on what we believe to be growth areas in health care, the procedures, vaccines, biologics. While we are not immune to the downturn in procedures, which we believe to be temporary in nature, we have developed a nice balance to our business in terms of exposure to these areas and a good mix of recurring and capital equipment revenue. 
Finally, we have employed lean techniques and have been in-sourcing and on-shoring to better protect our product and service supply chains for more than a decade, improving quality, delivery reliability and cost. As a result, we've had a long-term positive run. And so far, our business has fared comparatively well amidst the significant disruption in the global economy. For fiscal 2020, it is safe to say we would be celebrating this phenomenal, record-breaking year we just completed, were it not for the pandemic. We broke the $3 billion revenue mark for the first time, joined the S&P 500, had very strong growth rates in revenue and profitability, ended the year with a very strong balance sheet and would have been looking forward to another record year and repeat of solid growth performance in fiscal 2021. This puts us in an enviable position to face the challenges before us today. Revenue in fiscal 2020 grew 9% as reported and 10% on a constant currency organic basis with solid growth across all segments. This performance was a result of investments we've made in all our businesses as well as the benefit of approximately 100 basis points from small tuck-in acquisitions mostly in health care products. 
Our AST segment led the pack, growing constant currency organic revenue 15% for the year. As we've discussed all year, this segment has experienced increased demand from our core medical device customers. Demand will be strong in the long run, in our view, and we plan to continue investing in this business in fiscal 2021 and beyond. We currently see continued growth in those AST facilities that process for pharma, for PPE like gowns and gloves and for personal use medical devices for the home setting, like insulin pumps and blood glucose monitors. We have, however, begun to see declines in time-deferrable procedure-related devices like orthopedic implants. We expect this to be a relatively short-term phenomenon as health care providers begin doing these procedures again. 
Healthcare Specialty Services had another outstanding year, growing constant currency organic revenue 12%, despite difficult comparisons with the prior year. We continue to see success across our spectrum of offerings in the U.S. Specific to the fourth quarter, impact of COVID-19, while our outsourced reprocessing business has been impacted by a decline in procedures, our instrument repair business was relatively insulated as many of our customers took advantage of the downtime for more comprehensive maintenance of their instruments. As you might expect, we saw a significant year-over-year decline in the last week or so of March and into April, due to the reduction in nonessential procedures across America. 
Life Sciences had a better year than anticipated, growing revenue 11% on a constant currency organic basis. Capital equipment sales in this business followed a typical lumpy cadence in fiscal 2020, but our full year growth was 10%, which exceeded our expectations. In consumables, we saw high single to low double-digit growth all year with an upward spike in the fourth quarter, at least, partially due to COVID-19. Some of our pharma customers appear to have stocked up, resulting in 26% growth for the fourth quarter in our Life Science consumables. We've continued to see strong growth in April. But we expect orders to return to a more normalized level in coming months.
And finally, Healthcare Products also had a strong year with 7% constant currency organic revenue growth against challenging comparisons to fiscal '19. Organic growth continues to stem from new products, particularly in our infection prevention capital equipment and consumables franchise. In addition, as I mentioned earlier, this is the segment with the most significant impact from half a dozen or so tuck-in acquisitions this year, which added approximately 200 basis points to our annual growth. Offsetting the acquisitions, Healthcare Products experienced the most immediate revenue loss from COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in endoscopy products. For the fourth quarter, the positive impact of acquisitions, less the COVID-related reductions combined to essentially offset each other in this segment. 
Adjusted operating margins for total STERIS in fiscal 2020 increased 70 basis points to 20.7%, reflecting improved volume and gross margin expansion. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the full year were a record $5.64, the high end of our recent expectations and represent 15% growth over fiscal 2019. We are very pleased with these results, which, in addition to our solid balance sheet, position us well for the future. As you've heard from many others, the impact of COVID-19 remains fluid, making forecasting revenue and profit daunting at this time. Where not for the pandemic, we are confident we would have been comfortable at the high-end of our traditional revenue growth rates of 4% to 6% for fiscal '21. The impact of COVID-19 to STERIS will depend on the linked and severity of the pullback in health care procedures, offset by the areas of our business that are not impacted or are experiencing increased demand. In lieu of quantitative guidance, we will share our qualitative views and expect to revisit guidance as the year progresses. We are fortunate that our business is as diversified as it is across our medical device, pharma and healthcare provider customers, which, we believe, will be a source of strength in the coming months and quarters. Even during the Great Recession of '08, '09, our worst fiscal year revenue decline was 3%. And you may recall, we had a few other things going on at that time. That decline was spread over three quarters that happened to be in different fiscal years. If we look at calendar 2009, it contained our 4 worst consecutive quarters of revenue decline during the downturn. This period combined the health care spending uncertainty of Obamacare beginning with the economic impact of the Great Recession, and our revenue declined about 5% for the year. The preponderance of that decline was in capital equipment, and we were more capital equipment heavy at that time than we are today. 
As I mentioned earlier, our businesses fared relatively well so far. In the month of March, we experienced modest declines in our Healthcare business, somewhat offset by neutral to positive performance from Life Science and AST. In April, we saw stronger declines in Healthcare with neutral deposit performance again in Life Science and AST. This resulted in a total STERIS revenue decline of less than 10% for April 2020 versus April 2019. On a positive note, we are beginning to see a return of procedures. While we expect this return to be gradual early on, we are encouraged by the discussions we are having with hospital leaders. Similar to others in our space, we anticipate ramping back up to more normalized levels by the end of this calendar year and possibly sooner. 
Given our financial strength and our expectation that procedure volumes will start to ramp back up in the coming quarter or so, our underutilized people are on standby ready to meet customer needs. We have not instituted layoffs, although some are on short-term paid furloughs. At this point, every one of our people is being paid their basic salary or regular wage for normal working hours, whether they are working full-time or not as long as they are available to work full time. We believe this is the right thing to do at this time and will help us support our customers as they ramp up their procedures to normal levels. We have highly skilled and committed people in our organization, and we want to maintain and grow that skill set. We hope to be able to continue this position until business resumes to more normal levels, but we're taking it week-by-week and will adjust as appropriate. We have taken some actions to protect our near-term cash flow from the slowdown. These include implementing a hiring freeze for most positions, deferring executive wage increases, canceling significant travel events, restricting routine travel and deferring capital expenditures except for strategic growth capital.
For the most part, our plants and service operations have been and are running to support our customers. We have had limited shutdowns of some facilities and some are operating below normal capacity. We continue to invest in R&D at our normal levels and intend to continue strategic growth capital spending, particularly in AST and outsourced reprocessing. We continue to believe that these investments will pay off in the intermediate and longer term. 
As Mike mentioned, our strong balance sheet remains a strength of the company. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We plan to continue paying dividends and to invest in our businesses to drive anticipated future growth. Our M&A activities have become more selective and deferred due to the lack of visibility for near-term expectations, but we continue to evaluate opportunities. And lastly, share buybacks have been discontinued for now, even those to offset dilution for executive compensation. 
As you know, STERIS is an essential business supporting health care. We are very fortunate to be in the business we're in and to be in a strong financial position. We need to be nimble and ready to support our customers as clinical procedures restart. We are very pleased to be able to provide some relief on the health care front lines with solutions to disinfect hospital respirators during this crisis. We continue working to enhance the long-term value of your company as we balance the short-term impacts of the pandemic with our longer-term opportunities. We believe the future for STERIS is bright, and thank you for all of your continued support. 
I will now turn the call back over to Julie for Q&A."

I mean, backlog has been -- is, by definition, orders coming in minus shipments going out and plus whatever was already there. So it does reflect all those kind of things. It's very common for us to have last minute pushouts for a couple of weeks or a month because their projects are not coming through on time. Typically, if you think about our capital business in health care, it's divided into what we call turn business or replacement business, where you're just ordering a new table because you want one or because you're other one broke or a new light or something as opposed to a project where they're renovating a major section of the operating room or central sterile department. And typically, that's a 60-40 split, 60% turn or replacement business and 40% project type business. We've seen this several times whenever hospitals become a bit uncertain on capital, the projects actually, if the steel is in the ground, keep moving forward because once in -- the steel is in the ground, they need to finish the project. It costs them too much to slow down or stop. On the other hand, the turn business tends to slow down a little bit until they get more visibility to what is going on. And so that's a typical thing that happens in an economic slowdown for hospitals, not necessarily the general economy, but the health care economy. We saw that -- well, we've seen it many, many times when the hospital is under some kind of financial constraint or financial pressure. If anything, we would expect to see something similar. We have not seen that to date. We've not seen significant pushouts, significant -- cancellations are super rare. We haven't seen any cancellations. And actually, orders have replicated last year for the last couple of months. So we have not seen a change in order pattern.
Having said that, since our reps can't talk to hospital people face-to-face these days, I would anticipate seeing an order slowdown here in the next month or 2 or 3, it takes time for orders to occur. But the question is, what's the magnitude of that slowdown? And the good news is we had extraordinary backlog, as you said. So at this point, we can produce the backlog, assuming those orders don't shift significantly, because they usually do not. We're in pretty good shape for a couple of months after that, then we depend more on the incoming orders. And we don't have a great deal of visibility to that yet. And hospitals, in a period of uncertainty, they spend a lot more time worrying about how to handle the COVID pandemic right now than what their capital equipment orders are in the next couple of weeks."

I'm just trying to understand, are OEMs moving away from in-sourcing the service, given the regulatory environment? And then also, I think, one of the comments that struck me, I always thought this was more of a med device sterilization business. Can you break down the difference between med device and pharma exposure in AST?"

But the preponderance of the business is med device. But med devices have various roles. Again, a big, big piece of it are things like hip replacements and knee replacements and the implants for replacements, I should say, and for pacemakers and things like that. So there's a big piece, as you might expect, are implantable devices, and that's because they have to be sterile if they're implanted. Having said that, there are other components, we generally don't spend a lot of time talking about, but there are other components that kind of travel with those big pieces normally, that is surgical gowns and masks and things like that, that may need to be sterile. And the sterile versions, we do process those as well. 
Now in a normal environment, that travels kind of consistently with procedures, as you might expect. Right now, gowns and gloves and masks are not traveling with procedures, are traveling with COVID. And so we're getting -- what I would characterize as extraordinary demand increase in those spaces. And that's where we see the split, the people doing that. And then also things like the diabetic supplies and other things that are more home-based, they're still medical devices, but they are more home-based medical devices, chronic devices, if you will, as opposed to procedural devices. Those devices are also seeing a little bit -- I think it's consumer pull-forward. If you're diabetic, you're anxious about making sure you have supplies at a time when there's a lot of things that are not very sure. And so I think we're seeing some pull-forward of people stocking up a bit in diabetic supplies, whether they will continue that stock-up or how they use it downward, if you will, is unclear. And then, of course, that space is just a rapidly growing space anyway because the innovation that the diabetes companies have had in terms of monitoring the -- monitoring and having the closed-loop insulin system. So that space is a fast-growing space anyway, and now it's a little bit faster because of people stocking up a bit."

So I would like to get some color on that front. And I'll just go ahead and throw my second question in now as well. In your prepared remarks, you alluded to being comfortable ex COVID-19 with the high end of the historical growth range of 4% to 6% in terms of organic revenue growth. I would appreciate just some color about the components of that. And in particular, maybe some emphasis on the AST segment. There's been a lot of debate whether that can actually sustain high single-digit type growth. So just kind of curious if you could add some color around that, again, independent of COVID-19?"
34783,658589504,2026376,"STERIS plc, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, May 14, 2020",2020-05-14,"Earnings Calls","STERIS plc","Executives","Thanks, Chris. And I appreciate the comments about the year. First, on the organizational side, as -- I have mentioned several times that as we started doing this work in America, we found out that it doesn't -- and not surprisingly, doesn't work exactly",604,"Thanks, Chris. And I appreciate the comments about the year. First, on the organizational side, as -- I have mentioned several times that as we started doing this work in America, we found out that it doesn't -- and not surprisingly, doesn't work exactly as it does in the U.K. And so we've continued to experiment, and we have a number of different approaches to the market that we've been working with and many of those, the people, who are in our IPT business, which serve the same set of customers, are extraordinarily useful in bringing together. Also, as you might expect, if we're running the CSDs, they typically have STERIS equipment and STERIS products in them. And so the integration of that product set we thought was worthwhile. So all of that business is now under -- in term -- the commercial side of that business is now under the same individual who handles the historic STERIS capital consumables business in North America and the same is true in the rest of the world. So we've combined the commercial operations around the world. And we do believe we gain -- actually, we transfer the STERIS credibility from -- at the commercial level, at the working commercial level. Now they're still different sales forces and still different local management groups. But they're all under the Commercial Head. And we've actually moved some of the products amongst the businesses in terms of the business unit leaders to get them in the appropriate places. And so it's just now a very much combined set of businesses. And as a result, it's harder and harder to know where the revenue and profits really coming from and really going to. So we felt it was logical to combine those businesses, both organizationally and the way we are managing customers. And it's all the same customers that if you look at our 3 businesses, we have historically continued to organize backwards from customer in. So our Life Science business is organized around largely pharmaceutical, also research. Our AST business is organized around med devices and our Healthcare business is organized around hospitals and ambulatory surgeries wherever they take place. And so that's the logic. 
And even the historic U.S. business of IMS, we call IMS and have called Healthcare Specialty Services, that was kind of 2 basic product lines made up most of the business, the one being the outsourced resource -- outsourced reprocessing centers, outsourced CSDs, if you will, and the instrument repair. And the instruments being repaired are a lot of the same type of businesses -- or instruments that are in U.S. endoscopy like, and so there's interface between those. So not only is that true of the ORC-type businesses, but it's also true of the endoscopy-type product line. So we have put those together. I don't know that we will see radical changes in cost. This is not a cost reduction move. There may be some minor opportunities, but really it's about continuing to ramp up of the efficiency of the revenue generation in those businesses that we're after. So I think that's pretty much the answer to the first question. Again, that's now -- we did that a couple of months ago or 3 months ago now maybe, and it is a global organization, very smooth. It's not a lot of change in people or change in management structure. It's just the way that they are reporting up through those businesses now.
Your second question was -- I've now forgotten since I answered the first one. Do you mind giving me a quick help?"

Again, just in your prepared comments, you alluded to, ex COVID-19, you would have been comfortable with the 4% to 6% organic growth range, the historical range, but at the higher end of that range. Just was hoping you could maybe give us a little bit of color around the components that would drive you towards the upper end of the range with a little bit of emphasis on the AST franchises. As you know, there's been a lot of debate about the sustainability, at least, in the shorter-term of the kind of historical high single-digit organic growth in that franchise based upon the tougher comp in the year."

We built our business plan pre-COVID. And so we are not only confident, we are sure we are thinking about numbers in the high end of that range. And so very, very comfortable there. And",314,"Yes. Thanks, Chris, for the reminder. Like I said, we are confident. We built our business plan pre-COVID. And so we are not only confident, we are sure we are thinking about numbers in the high end of that range. And so very, very comfortable there. And specific to AST, as you have seen AST continuing to perform both in March and April for the quarter and going into April, we are quite comfortable that it would have been on the leading edge, if you will, or the higher edge of the businesses. We've been saying that for some time now. We still think there's a runway for those higher single-digit kind of numbers going forward absent COVID. Now COVID throws everything up in the air. So I would not begin to estimate what our growth rate would be in AST for this year. But as we come out of COVID, we feel comfortable that we're in a strong position. To do that, first of all, the device businesses are doing nicely. And secondly, as we've said before, because a lot of this, I'll call it, supply uncertainty question that was going on even prior to the COVID and certainly now post, I think you will see people that, all things being equal, would rather have a relationship with someone who can move things from plant to plant to plant inside their organization as opposed to having to move things from plant A to plant B to plant C that are crossing other people. So -- and as I've said this before, I think companies like STERIS, and there are other companies that have multiple plants, I think, they will be in a stronger position given some of the supply chain things that have occurred in the last 6 to 12 months, I think we're even in a stronger position than we were before."

We can -- we're happy to talk about them in generalized specifics, we're probably a little shy. But we continue the product portfolio enhancements that we have done across the business. And we're in the double-digit new products every year in our Healthcare business for a long time now, and I don't see that stopping. So we just think a continuation of that product development stream is a good thing. And it's -- the same basic types of products that we provide today. So it's not a -- that's not something like a whole new division or anything coming out, but it's just more and more products, some of which are new and some of which are enhancements of our current product lines. So we just will be continuing that and if anything, upping the ante. 
The second area in the HSS business, as I mentioned, we found that there are more than one way to skin a cat in the U.S. versus the U.K. version. So we have multiple types of thoughts around how we might help our customers with outsourced ORC-type capabilities. And those all require investment because unless we are just going into their facility and operating it, which is a rarer case, we need to be adding capacity. That's the real issue. Whether it is constant capacity or peak capacity or other types of capacity adds, we need to be adding capacity, and that takes capital investment. So that's what we're talking about. And it's largely, to say, outsourced ORC, but you have to think about that in kind of its broadest context, that's the capacity we'd be adding."

And it certainly feels like capital spending is going to be under a significant pressure here for, I mean, it could be 6, 12 months, who knows. But when do you start to see or start to get some visibility on kind of how that may impact your business? It sounds like, as Walt indicated, you haven't had a lot of discussions yet. Your reps obviously aren't in the hospitals. Hospitals have been focused on treating COVID patients and putting other things aside at this point.

Larry, we've seen this movie or at least I've seen this movie lots of time since 1982. When hospitals get put under pressure, the general move is they continue to buy the things they were going to buy, if you will, that were already on the docket. They will put in a capital freeze and just not unlike we do. We put in a capital freeze, but it's a freeze, but it's not a freeze. If they're in the middle of building a hospital, they're going to build it. If they think it's strategic, they're going to do the strategic builds. And then they slow down the replacements. Now when stuff breaks, they got to have it. So that will -- they still -- it's not like replacements stop completely. They just slow down. '08, '09 is a great example. In '08, '09, we have the combination, as I mentioned of the Obamacare uncertainty and capital abhors uncertainty. And so there was a lot of uncertainty. And then right behind it, the debt window for short-term debt froze up, and many of the hospitals had financed their long-term financing with short-term debt because it was very inexpensive to do so. And literally, they didn't have the cash. And so exactly what I've described happened. They put on -- in general, they put on some capital freezes. It slowed down a bit for a while. Usually, what happens is it's like truly frozen for a month or 2, that's okay because we go through the backlog and then they start releasing the things they really need, it slows down a bit. So I would think in the next 6 or 8 months, we would see the impact and begin to have better visibility to the pipeline. 
Right now, our pipeline visibility for the last 4, 5 weeks has been pretty much negligible because there's nothing really going on. Those conversations are not happening right now, except for give me the stuff I've already -- I've anticipated putting in place in my hospital. So the next time we talk, I suspect we'll be able to talk about pipeline."

We think our plan is a solid one for the future growth of that space, and we don't see a whole lot of reason to be backing off of it. We're pleased to have the capital position that we have. 
At this moment in time, the only reason we'll spend less capital in that business is because it's -- we can't get permits and things like that because the governments are effectively closed. They're doing other things besides permitting, building permits and things like that. So that -- and/or construction companies not being able to provide labor or whatever. I mean, we want to do it on the schedule, we were doing it. We see no reason to be stopping. It takes us 2 years from the time we start to the time we can turn on the gas. We don't see any reason to be stopping gas right now. 
In terms of shifting among modalities, I think we have that pretty well scoped out. And I don't believe we have any great reason to change what our current plans were. But we'll be watching that, of course. We've continued to add capacity in EO in the last 12 months or so and going forward. And the bulk of that has been outside the U.S. just because that's where the business was, not because of any other reason. And we will continue to beef up that space as well as the various radiation modalities."

It's once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our first quarter performance.

It's once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our first quarter performance. 
For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue declined 3%, driven by a decline in volume, offset by 70 basis points of favorable price. As a reminder, healthcare capital equipment revenue in the quarter reflects a onetime benefit of $15 million for a change in the timing of revenue recognition. 
You may recall that when we adopted the new revenue recognition accounting standard at the beginning of fiscal 2019, our operating room integration capital equipment products required significant on-site system configuration during the installation process. As a result, we were required to defer all revenue until installation was complete. Since then, we have enhanced the design of our OR product line, which allows for full assembly and configuration of the equipment in our plant before shipment and simplifies the installation process. As a result, revenue is recognized based on the shipping terms, consistent with other capital equipment products. 
In addition, constant currency organic revenue for the quarter includes a total of about $10 million from prior year tuck-in acquisitions, primarily in health care, spread across capital equipment, consumables and service. Excluding both of these items, total company constant currency organic revenue would have declined 8%. 
Gross margin for the quarter was about flat at 44.1% and was impacted favorably by mix and price, somewhat offset by lower productivity due to reduced volumes. EBIT margin for the quarter was 21.3% of revenue, an increase of 180 basis points from the first quarter last year, due in part to approximately a $5 million benefit from the change in the timing of revenue recognition, as I noted earlier, as well as lower travel expenses, compensation-related costs and sales and marketing expenses. 
The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 17.3% and includes the benefit of stock compensation deduction. Net income in the quarter grew 6% to $111.8 million and earnings increased to $1.31 per diluted share. 
Our balance sheet is a continued source of strength for the company. Considering our cash position of $255.6 million, access to available credit lines and a leverage ratio below 1.5x debt to EBITDA, we are well positioned from a liquidity standpoint. During the quarter, capital expenditures totaled $66.9 million, while depreciation and amortization was $49 million. The increase in capital expenditures versus the prior year is related to expansion projects within the AST segment. 
Free cash flow for the quarter was $67.4 million, an increase over the first quarter of last year, primarily due to improvements in working capital and deferred tax payments under government programs. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Walt for his remarks."

Our solid overall performance in the first quarter reflects the diversified nature of STERIS's business across our medical device pharma and health care customers.

Our solid overall performance in the first quarter reflects the diversified nature of STERIS's business across our medical device pharma and health care customers. Collectively, our constant currency organic revenue declined just 3%, while adjusted earnings increased compared to the same quarter last fiscal year. Given the circumstances, we are very pleased with those overall results. 
Healthcare, our biggest segment, most impacted by the reduction in deferrable procedure revenue, declined 10% with mixed performance across the segment. Healthcare consumables were down 28% for the quarter, but we generally saw monthly sequential increases culminating in near prior year levels by the end of June. As we discussed last quarter, our endoscopy business continued to be one of the most impacted areas for STERIS, but it is following the same trend as the rest of consumables. 
Service declined 10%, but also witnessed similar trends as consumable products, with June returning to prior year levels in our equipment service business. 
In health care capital equipment, which grew 6% in Q1, shipments continued from strong backlog entering the year as well as the $15 million benefit in ORI that Mike mentioned earlier. I would add that this benefit in revenue also reduced health care backlog by the same $15 million as those shipments were recognized. Even with that reduction, we ended the quarter at $164 million of healthcare capital backlog down just $8 million compared to the first quarter of last year when the ORI change is taken into account and up $9 million sequentially from Q4 with the same adjustment. 
As I've commented before, we would not be surprised to see health care capital equipment come under some pressure over the coming quarters, particularly replacement equipment, some of which can be delayed by our customers. 
Turning to AST, which serves medical device customers, that business's revenue was flat with the prior year. This was largely the result of continued elevated demand for PPE sterilization, offsetting a reduction in devices for deferrable procedures. Once again, we experienced increased procedural device processing on a sequential basis within the quarter. 
Life Sciences revenue grew 21% in Q1 as we continue to benefit from our pharma customers' expectations for growth in vaccines and biologics. Supporting that growth, Life Sciences consumables grew 34% versus last year, which is exceptional performance, driven in part by our customers' desire to build inventory. While we would not suggest this growth rate is sustainable, we do continue to see favorable growth trends for this business. 
Our margin and earnings improvement reflected our success in spending reduction, in particular, travel expenses and variable selling costs, which will generally come back as our businesses return to normal. In addition, as we discussed last quarter, we chose to avoid unpaid layoffs. Instead, we placed our underutilized people on short term, fully paid furloughs, some of which were partially subsidized by governments around the world.  We have tracked costs related to that decision, along with other COVID costs, about $9 million net of government subsidies and are excluding these items from adjusted profit in the quarter. 
We believe that maintaining our trained and dedicated staff was the right thing to do and is helping us now support our customers as they ramp up health care procedures to normal levels. Our furloughs have been reduced substantially as businesses come back. 
On another note, we have continued to invest in R&D as originally planned, and we expect to do so going forward. As a result of these factors, we anticipate that our adjusted SG&A dollar spend will rise as business rebounds. Since we last spoke to you in May, we've witnessed a turnaround in deferrable procedure volumes in the United States and Europe. While the recovery is still region-by-region and some COVID hotspots are occurring, we have been pleasantly surprised at how quickly health care providers have been able to bring procedure volumes back. Many of our product lines are now running flat to slightly up as compared to the prior year. 
Although we may see some reductions due to COVID hotspots, we do not expect to return to the low levels of deferrable procedures experienced in April and May, as health care providers have improved their ability to combat the disease. We believe that STERIS' balanced business model will continue to be a benefit and remain optimistic that we are well positioned to respond to changes and uncertainties in the market. 
Now changing gears a bit from our financial performance. Yesterday in our earnings release, we announced the addition of a new Board member, Chris Holland. You may know Chris from his role as CFO at CR Bard prior to their acquisition by Becton Dickinson. Chris brings a great experience to our Board, and we are happy to have the benefit of his insights and perspectives. 
We also announced an increase in our quarterly dividend yesterday, bringing us to $0.40 per share per quarter and representing our 15th consecutive year of dividend increase. As Mike discussed, our balance sheet and cash flow remains strong, and we are pleased to be able to continue returning value directly to our shareholders through our dividend. 
As you know, STERIS is an essential business supporting health care, we are very fortunate to be in the business we are in and to be in strong financial position. Our plans to be nimble and ready to support our customers as needed are already paying off. We believe that our approach to managing through the pandemic leaves us well positioned to capitalize on future opportunities. 
Before we open to questions, we express our respect and gratitude to the health care providers on the frontlines of the pandemic around the world. These are unprecedented times, and the challenges facing caregivers have been unexpected and monumental, and they continue to do remarkable work to this day. 
We also thank the people of STERIS, those working with our customers in the field and those working behind the scenes, the factories, labs, offices and from their own homes in this unusual time. Our team has done a great job of adjusting to this difficult situation while serving customers and their patients. 
Our confidence in our strategic positions and operating capabilities continues to grow. While there is more uncertainty in the near-term given the COVID situation, both potential upside and downside, we stand ready to capture opportunities and mitigate risks. We continue to believe that the long-term future for STERIS is bright. 
I will now turn the call back over to Julie to open Q&A."

And I think the health care systems around the country and around the world have done a fantastic job of assuring patients that it is safe to go to their facilities for procedures. And they've done a number of things and done that in a number of ways. I don't know if you happen to have been into a hospital or surgery center recently, I have and the precautions that they are taking are fantastic, both with their own staffs and with the patients who are coming in. The visitors no longer come in, so they've taken care of that problem pretty straightforwardly. 
There are all kinds of methods that they've used. And again, we're talking to them all the time about this. First, my understanding from speaking with a number of them is that kind of the patient or potential patients, #1 factor in making that decision is their physician. And so they've done great work in outreach using their physicians to -- and their physician offices to give outreach to the patients, reassuring them that the hospital may be one of the safest places to be as opposed to all kinds of other things that people are doing around the country, which is what's causing COVID to be spread. So -- and I think the facts bear that up. They've done a great job with PPE. We know a number of physicians groups who have extraordinarily low amounts of coated in their own staff, even though they are actively involved -- heavily actively involving COVID patients. So it's both the work they've done to make their places safe and the -- of the marketing, but it's marketing to let people know that it's safe to return. It's largely the physicians doing that, not the facility so much. 
The other thing they've done is they have moved more and more procedures into spaces that patients feel more comfortable, so in the ambulatory surgery centers and other types of centers like that as well as the standard operating room. So I mean, really, it's pretty miraculous, the work they've done the last 2 or 3 months to offset this significant concern among potential patients. And of course, the toughest areas were the places like New York City that were overrun early. And it's been, I think, somewhat easier in other spaces where we didn't see that level of burden on the hospitals."

Help us think a little bit, though, about how that business may have shifted structurally such that as we start to see some normalization there in consumable purchasing patterns, how we think about that operating margin? And then, I guess, similar to that, a little bit of a taper in AST, which is to be expected with the shift more towards PPE in some instances. But is that something that we should think about lingering drought the fiscal year and kind of slowly working its way back out? Or is that something that would start to reverse itself, maybe more so in the second half of the fiscal year? Just want to make sure we're thinking about the margin contribution correctly?

So -- and to the extent that, that is sustained, we believe we'll see some sustained benefit for consumables business in particular. To the extent that pharma starts making significant expansion investments in either CMOs or their factories, then we may see some benefit in our capital equipment side of the business in the future.

We've spoken about that and have been very, very consistent over the decade or so, so you've talked about in terms of how we intend to spend our capital. We do intend to provide dividends. We think that's a good discipline of management to grow dividends somewhat in line with the profit and cash flow of the business. We absolutely intend to continue to investing in the businesses we already have. And and you're clearly seeing that we're -- as Mike mentioned, we actually spent more capital this quarter than we did a quarter ago last year. We have significant investments moving forward. And the AST space for growth, which we absolutely believe is coming. And also in the hospital outsourced processing business, we are intending and have and intend to spend significant capital. So those -- and we're spending capital every place. Those 2 are just orders of magnitude, kind of larger than some of the others at this moment in time and that's, in our view, because of the long-term opportunity in those spaces. But in general, I'd rather spend money in the businesses already run to make them either more efficient or new products than running around looking for new things. After that, we want to run around and look for new things. And we did have a number of things on our plate when this little COVID issue hit us. And so we pulled back on that due to the near-term uncertainty in the space. We are feeling more comfortable that our own cash situation is in good shape and that we can kind of go back to the search and hunt. But those things -- timing of those are never known. So I wouldn't suggest something going to happen tomorrow morning, but it would be surprising if over the next year or 2, we don't see things that are worth investing in and that add to our portfolio. We like things that are either in our space or right next door to our space. We don't like stepping out wildly into things we don't understand. So at a high level, that hasn't changed. It's just we took a little pause, but -- and it seems like when it rains at 4, you remember, last year, we did 6, 7. They were relatively small. A couple of years before, we did some relatively large ones. We don't control the timing on those things. Usually, the seller has more control timing than we do. But we certainly continue to see a pipeline of things and intend to be active. And we are far more comfortable today than we were 90 days ago in making those kind of decisions."

But the hospital -- health care capital spending loves change and hates uncertainty. And so we've been in a little bit more uncertain time the last a little bit, but we're also seeing changes. So it's not at all clear exactly how that's going to work out over the next year or 2. As I said, this move -- we already saw the greatest growth rate in our capital spending for health care was moving to ambulatory surgery type of facilities, whether they be a part of a hospital system or not. And so we -- that -- I would not be surprised if that accelerates, given what I said about trying to move patients to places that they feel more comfortable, a, it's closer to their homes; and b, it's -- there's just less traffic, if you will. And so I would not be surprised to see that spending accelerate. We have felt for some time that both particularly into surgery centers, as you see them, take on more and more extensive surgeries, they cannot have the same type of capital equipment, they need stronger infrastructure to do that. So I would expect to see that mix move up in inventory surgery. And again, they can't do orthopedic implants with the sterilization capacity they currently have. So we think that's opportunity, both for capital spending and for our ORC. So we do see the intermediate to longer-term positively in that space. And for every time -- for every surgery that moves out of the hospital, they put in 2 more complex surgeries. Heart, lung -- one heart-lung transplant does not equal to 1 artificial knee. And so even though the numbers may stay constant, the intensity continues to rise. So in the long term, we see it growing with a hospital or health care revenue, generally speaking, as it has for the last 30-some-odd years. In the very short term, there are a number of places just like we did put on capital freezes. But I think as they see -- as they get visibility into their cash flow, they will begin spending again more in their normal fashion. And then the good news for us is we had a very good backlog going in, which we are at cancellations. And then lastly, the the big projects are rarely stopped or slowed down. It may slow down a little bit just for labor, but they rarely stopped or slowed down, and you got to collect the way. Once you put steel in the ground, you need to fill the facility. So those will, I think, will continue as they would have. 
The pipeline is a bit softer right now than what we saw 90 days ago, let's say, or before COVID got serious in the U.S. But for roughly 45 to 60 days, we had no ability for our salespeople to access facilities as they shut down everything, but patient care. And so we're now back in the field working with facilities on their needs. So I think it's early yet to predict the exact strength or lack of strength in capital equipment. But I think the intermediate to longer-term looks pretty good."

So -- and the same our AST business, what we've described is it's basically did last year, but that's not normal for us, right? We would expect to see 5%, 6%, 7% growth. So my answer to that is there's probably some catch-up from the last quarter or so that is going to occur. And then there's also a catch-up of the growth that would have occurred. Now how quickly that all happens, I think, is is a wildcard.

So I don't know that we would have a strong feeling that second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter is going to be our best or worst year-over-year performance. The -- you're absolutely correct about the U.K. At this moment, it tends to be the lagging entity in Europe. The converse is true of the rest of Europe. The rest of Europe has been ahead of the U.S. in bringing back procedures and our businesses, both ASD and ORCs are showing that. So the Continental Europe, for lack of better terms, has been stronger coming back quicker, I should say, and U.K. has been the slowest entity in our space. As you know, the U.K. is a relatively small piece of our business. But it is real, and we have seen the ORCs are coming back from their very low levels, that they were in earlier in the year. But they're not as far back as the ORCs in the United States on average. So at a high level, that's the answer to that question."

And as we did in the fourth quarter, we also had some meeting cancellation costs. We did not hold our annual meeting this year. So we had some cancellation costs associated with that. We had some PP&E, specifically for employees. And we had some above and beyond enhanced cleaning protocols that we've also put into that incremental cost. So the total net cost of all that is $8.7 million in the quarter compared to about $800,000 in the fourth quarter of last year."

34783,678069840,2058473,"STERIS plc, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2020",2020-08-04,"Earnings Calls","STERIS plc","Executives","Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It's once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our first quarter performance.

It's once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our first quarter performance.  
For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue declined 3%, driven by a decline in volume, offset by 70 basis points of favorable price. As a reminder, healthcare capital equipment revenue in the quarter reflects a onetime benefit of $15 million for a change in the timing of revenue recognition.  
You may recall that when we adopted the new revenue recognition accounting standard at the beginning of fiscal 2019, our operating room integration capital equipment products required significant on-site system configuration during the installation process. As a result, we were required to defer all revenue until installation was complete. Since then, we have enhanced the design of our OR product line, which allows for full assembly and configuration of the equipment in our plant before shipment and simplifies the installation process. As a result, revenue is recognized based on the shipping terms, consistent with other capital equipment products.  
In addition, constant currency organic revenue for the quarter includes a total of about $10 million from prior year tuck-in acquisitions, primarily in health care, spread across capital equipment, consumables and service. Excluding both of these items, total company constant currency organic revenue would have declined 8%.  
Gross margin for the quarter was about flat at 44.1% and was impacted favorably by mix and price, somewhat offset by lower productivity due to reduced volumes. EBIT margin for the quarter was 21.3% of revenue, an increase of 180 basis points from the first quarter last year, due in part to approximately a $5 million benefit from the change in the timing of revenue recognition, as I noted earlier, as well as lower travel expenses, compensation-related costs and sales and marketing expenses.  
The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 17.3% and includes the benefit of stock compensation deduction. Net income in the quarter grew 6% to $111.8 million and earnings increased to $1.31 per diluted share.  
Our balance sheet is a continued source of strength for the company. Considering our cash position of $255.6 million, access to available credit lines and a leverage ratio below 1.5x debt to EBITDA, we are well positioned from a liquidity standpoint. During the quarter, capital expenditures totaled $66.9 million, while depreciation and amortization was $49 million. The increase in capital expenditures versus the prior year is related to expansion projects within the AST segment.  
Free cash flow for the quarter was $67.4 million, an increase over the first quarter of last year, primarily due to improvements in working capital and deferred tax payments under government programs.  
With that, I will turn the call over to Walt for his remarks."

Our solid overall performance in the first quarter reflects the diversified nature of STERIS's business across our medical device, pharma and health care customers. Collectively, our constant currency organic revenue declined just 3%, while adjusted earnings increased compared to the same quarter last fiscal year. Given the circumstances, we are very pleased with those overall results.  
Healthcare, our biggest segment, most impacted by the reduction in deferrable procedure revenue, declined 10% with mixed performance across the segment. Healthcare consumables were down 28% for the quarter, but we generally saw monthly sequential increases culminating in near prior year levels by the end of June. As we discussed last quarter, our endoscopy business continued to be one of the most impacted areas for STERIS, but it is following the same trend as the rest of consumables.  
Service declined 10%, but also witnessed similar trends as consumable products, with June returning to prior year levels in our equipment service business.  
In Healthcare capital equipment, which grew 6% in Q1, shipments continued from strong backlog entering the year as well as the $15 million benefit in ORI that Mike mentioned earlier. I would add that this benefit in revenue also reduced Healthcare backlog by the same $15 million as those shipments were recognized. Even with that reduction, we ended the quarter at $164 million of Healthcare capital backlog down just $8 million compared to the first quarter of last year when the ORI change is taken into account and up $9 million sequentially from Q4 with the same adjustment.  
As I've commented before, we would not be surprised to see Healthcare capital equipment come under some pressure over the coming quarters, particularly replacement equipment, some of which can be delayed by our customers.  
Turning to AST, which serves medical device customers, that business's revenue was flat with the prior year. This was largely the result of continued elevated demand for PPE sterilization, offsetting a reduction in devices for deferrable procedures. Once again, we experienced increased procedural device processing on a sequential basis within the quarter.  
Life Sciences revenue grew 21% in Q1 as we continue to benefit from our pharma customers' expectations for growth in vaccines and biologics. Supporting that growth, Life Sciences consumables grew 34% versus last year, which is exceptional performance, driven in part by our customers' desire to build inventory. While we would not suggest this growth rate is sustainable, we do continue to see favorable growth trends for this business.  
Our margin and earnings improvement reflected our success in spending reduction, in particular, travel expenses and variable selling costs, which will generally come back as our businesses return to normal. In addition, as we discussed last quarter, we chose to avoid unpaid layoffs. Instead, we placed our underutilized people on short term, fully paid furloughs, some of which were partially subsidized by governments around the world.  We have tracked the costs related to that decision, along with other COVID costs, about $9 million net of government subsidies and are excluding these items from adjusted profit in the quarter.  
We believe that maintaining our trained and dedicated staff was the right thing to do and is helping us now support our customers as they ramp up health care procedures to normal levels. Our furloughs have been reduced substantially as businesses come back.  
On another note, we have continued to invest in R&D as originally planned, and we expect to do so going forward. As a result of these factors, we anticipate that our adjusted SG&A dollar spend will rise as business rebounds. Since we last spoke to you in May, we've witnessed a turnaround in deferrable procedure volumes in the United States and Europe. While the recovery is still region-by-region and some COVID hotspots are occurring, we have been pleasantly surprised at how quickly health care providers have been able to bring procedure volumes back. Many of our product lines are now running flat to slightly up as compared to the prior year.  
Although we may see some reductions due to COVID hotspots, we do not expect to return to the low levels of deferrable procedures experienced in April and May, as health care providers have improved their ability to combat the disease. We believe that STERIS' balanced business model will continue to be a benefit and remain optimistic that we are well positioned to respond to changes and uncertainties in the market.  
Now changing gears a bit from our financial performance. Yesterday in our earnings release, we announced the addition of a new Board member, Chris Holland. You may know Chris from his role as CFO at C.R. Bard prior to their acquisition by Becton, Dickinson. Chris brings a great experience to our Board, and we are happy to have the benefit of his insights and perspectives.  
We also announced an increase in our quarterly dividend yesterday, bringing us to $0.40 per share per quarter and representing our 15th consecutive year of dividend increase. As Mike discussed, our balance sheet and cash flow remains strong, and we are pleased to be able to continue returning value directly to our shareholders through our dividend.  
As you know, STERIS is an essential business supporting health care. We are very fortunate to be in the business we are in and to be in strong financial position. Our plans to be nimble and ready to support our customers as needed are already paying off. We believe that our approach to managing through the pandemic leaves us well positioned to capitalize on future opportunities.  
Before we open to questions, we express our respect and gratitude to the health care providers on the frontlines of the pandemic around the world. These are unprecedented times, and the challenges facing caregivers have been unexpected and monumental, and they continue to do remarkable work to this day.  
We also thank the people of STERIS, those working with our customers in the field and those working behind the scenes, in our factories, labs, offices and from their own homes in this unusual time. Our team has done a great job of adjusting to this difficult situation while serving customers and their patients.  
Our confidence in our strategic positions and operating capabilities continues to grow. While there is more uncertainty in the near-term given the COVID situation, both potential upside and downside, we stand ready to capture opportunities and mitigate risks. We continue to believe that the long-term future for STERIS is bright.  
I will now turn the call back over to Julie to open Q&A."

I don't know if you happen to have been into a hospital or surgery center recently, I have, and the precautions that they are taking are fantastic, both with their own staffs and with the patients who are coming in. The visitors no longer come in, so they've taken care of that problem pretty straightforwardly.  
There are all kinds of methods that they've used. And again, we're talking to them all the time about this. First, my understanding from speaking with a number of them is that kind of the patient or potential patients, #1 factor in making that decision is their physician. And so they've done great work in outreach using their physicians to -- and their physician offices to give outreach to the patients, reassuring them that the hospital may be one of the safest places to be as opposed to all kinds of other things that people are doing around the country, which is what's causing COVID to be spread. So -- and I think the facts bear that up. They've done a great job with PPE. We know a number of physicians groups who have extraordinarily low amounts of COVID in their own staff, even though they are actively involved -- heavily actively involved with COVID patients. So it's both the work they've done to make their places safe and the -- of the marketing, but it's marketing to let people know that it's safe to return. It's largely the physicians doing that, not the facility so much.  
The other thing they've done is they have moved more and more procedures into spaces that patients feel more comfortable, so in the ambulatory surgery centers and other types of centers like that as well as the standard operating room. So I mean, really, it's pretty miraculous, the work they've done the last 2 or 3 months to offset this significant concern among potential patients. And of course, the toughest areas were the places like New York City that were overrun early. And it's been, I think, somewhat easier in other spaces where we didn't see that level of burden on the hospitals."

And then, I guess, similar to that, a little bit of a taper in AST, which is to be expected with the shift more towards PPE in some instances. But is that something that we should think about lingering throughout the fiscal year and kind of slowly working its way back out? Or is that something that would start to reverse itself, maybe more so in the second half of the fiscal year? Just want to make sure we're thinking about the margin contribution correctly?

You've talked about in terms of how we intend to spend our capital. We do intend to provide dividends. We think that's a good discipline of management to grow dividends somewhat in line with the profit and cash flow of the business. We absolutely intend to continue to investing in the businesses we already have. And  you're clearly seeing that we're -- as Mike mentioned, we actually spent more capital this quarter than we did a quarter ago last year. 
We have significant investments moving forward in the AST space for growth, which we absolutely believe is coming. And also in the hospital outsourced processing business, we are intending and have and intend to spend significant capital. So those -- and we're spending capital every place. Those 2 are just orders of magnitude, kind of larger than some of the others at this moment in time and that's, in our view, because of the long-term opportunity in those spaces. But in general, I'd rather spend money in the businesses already run to make them either more efficient or new products than running around looking for new things. After that, we want to run around and look for new things. And we did have a number of things on our plate when this little COVID issue hit us. And so we pulled back on that due to the near-term uncertainty in the space. 
We are feeling more comfortable that our own cash situation is in good shape and that we can kind of go back to the search and hunt. But those things -- timing of those are never known. So I wouldn't suggest something is going to happen tomorrow morning, but it would be surprising if over the next year or 2, we don't see things that are worth investing in and that add to our portfolio. We like things that are either in our space or right next door to our space. We don't like stepping out wildly into things we don't understand. So at a high level, that hasn't changed. It's just we took a little pause, but -- and it seems like when it [indiscernible], you remember, last year, we did 6 or 7. They were relatively small. A couple of years before, we did some relatively large ones. We don't control the timing on those things. Usually, the seller has more control of timing than we do. But we certainly continue to see a pipeline of things and intend to be active. And we are far more comfortable today than we were 90 days ago in making those kind of decisions."

But the -- health care capital spending loves change and hates uncertainty. And so we've been in a little bit more uncertain time the last little bit, but we're also seeing changes. So it's not at all clear exactly how that's going to work out over the next year or 2. As I said, this move -- we already saw the greatest growth rate in our capital spending for health care was moving to ambulatory surgery type of facilities, whether they be a part of a hospital system or not. And so we -- that -- I would not be surprised if that accelerates, given what I said about trying to move patients to places that they feel more comfortable, a, it's closer to their homes; and b, it's -- there's just less traffic, if you will. And so I would not be surprised to see that spending accelerate. 
We have felt for some time that both particularly into surgery centers, as you see them, take on more and more extensive surgeries, they cannot have the same type of capital equipment, they need stronger infrastructure to do that. So I would expect to see that mix move up in ambulatory surgery. And again, they can't do orthopedic implants with the sterilization capacity they currently have. So we think that's opportunity, both for capital spending and for our ORC. So we do see the intermediate to longer-term positively in that space. And for every time -- for every surgery that moves out of the hospital, they put in 2 more complex surgeries. Heart, lung -- one heart-lung transplant does not equal to one artificial knee. And so even though the numbers may stay constant, the intensity continues to rise. 
So in the long term, we see it growing with hospital or health care revenue, generally speaking, as it has for the last 30-some-odd years. In the very short term, there are a number of places just like we did put on capital freezes. But I think as they see -- as they get visibility into their cash flow, they will begin spending again more in their normal fashion. And then the good news for us is we had a very good backlog going in, which we rarely see cancellations. And then lastly, the big projects are rarely stopped or slowed down. It may slow down a little bit just for labor, but they're rarely stopped or slowed down in a consequential way. Once you put steel in the ground, you need to fill the facility. So those will, I think, will continue as they would have. 
The pipeline is a bit softer right now than what we saw 90 days ago, let's say, or before COVID got serious in the U.S. But for roughly 45 to 60 days, we had no ability for our salespeople to access facilities as they shut down everything, but patient care. And so we're now back in the field working with facilities on their needs. So I think it's early yet to predict the exact strength or lack of strength in capital equipment. But I think the intermediate to longer-term looks pretty good."

34783,678069840,2076501,"STERIS plc, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2020",2020-08-04,"Earnings Calls","STERIS plc","Executives","Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It's once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our first quarter performance.

It's once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our first quarter performance.  
For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue declined 3%, driven by a decline in volume, offset by 70 basis points of favorable price. As a reminder, healthcare capital equipment revenue in the quarter reflects a onetime benefit of $15 million for a change in the timing of revenue recognition.  
You may recall that when we adopted the new revenue recognition accounting standard at the beginning of fiscal 2019, our operating room integration capital equipment products required significant on-site system configuration during the installation process. As a result, we were required to defer all revenue until installation was complete. Since then, we have enhanced the design of our OR product line, which allows for full assembly and configuration of the equipment in our plant before shipment and simplifies the installation process. As a result, revenue is recognized based on the shipping terms, consistent with other capital equipment products.  
In addition, constant currency organic revenue for the quarter includes a total of about $10 million from prior year tuck-in acquisitions, primarily in health care, spread across capital equipment, consumables and service. Excluding both of these items, total company constant currency organic revenue would have declined 8%.  
Gross margin for the quarter was about flat at 44.1% and was impacted favorably by mix and price, somewhat offset by lower productivity due to reduced volumes. EBIT margin for the quarter was 21.3% of revenue, an increase of 180 basis points from the first quarter last year, due in part to approximately a $5 million benefit from the change in the timing of revenue recognition, as I noted earlier, as well as lower travel expenses, compensation-related costs and sales and marketing expenses.  
The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 17.3% and includes the benefit of stock compensation deduction. Net income in the quarter grew 6% to $111.8 million and earnings increased to $1.31 per diluted share.  
Our balance sheet is a continued source of strength for the company. Considering our cash position of $255.6 million, access to available credit lines and a leverage ratio below 1.5x debt to EBITDA, we are well positioned from a liquidity standpoint. During the quarter, capital expenditures totaled $66.9 million, while depreciation and amortization was $49 million. The increase in capital expenditures versus the prior year is related to expansion projects within the AST segment.  
Free cash flow for the quarter was $67.4 million, an increase over the first quarter of last year, primarily due to improvements in working capital and deferred tax payments under government programs.  
With that, I will turn the call over to Walt for his remarks."

Our solid overall performance in the first quarter reflects the diversified nature of STERIS' business across our medical device, pharma and healthcare customers. Collectively, our constant currency organic revenu",1086,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Our solid overall performance in the first quarter reflects the diversified nature of STERIS' business across our medical device, pharma and healthcare customers. Collectively, our constant currency organic revenue declined just 3%, while adjusted earnings increased compared to the same quarter last fiscal year. Given the circumstances, we are very pleased with those overall results.  
Healthcare, our biggest segment, most impacted by the reduction in deferrable procedure revenue, declined 10% with mixed performance across the segment. Healthcare consumables were down 28% for the quarter, but we generally saw monthly sequential increases culminating in near prior year levels by the end of June. As we discussed last quarter, our endoscopy business continued to be one of the most impacted areas for STERIS, but it is following the same trend as the rest of consumables.  
Service declined 10%, but also witnessed similar trends as consumable products, with June returning to prior year levels in our equipment service business.  
In Healthcare capital equipment, which grew 6% in Q1, shipments continued from strong backlog entering the year as well as the $15 million benefit in ORI that Mike mentioned earlier. I would add that this benefit in revenue also reduced Healthcare backlog by the same $15 million as those shipments were recognized. Even with that reduction, we ended the quarter at $164 million of Healthcare capital backlog down just $8 million compared to the first quarter of last year when the ORI change is taken into account and up $9 million sequentially from Q4 with the same adjustment.  
As I've commented before, we would not be surprised to see Healthcare capital equipment come under some pressure over the coming quarters, particularly replacement equipment, some of which can be delayed by our customers.  
Turning to AST, which serves medical device customers, that business's revenue was flat with the prior year. This was largely the result of continued elevated demand for PPE sterilization, offsetting a reduction in devices for deferrable procedures. Once again, we experienced increased procedural device processing on a sequential basis within the quarter.  
Life Sciences revenue grew 21% in Q1 as we continue to benefit from our pharma customers' expectations for growth in vaccines and biologics. Supporting that growth, Life Sciences consumables grew 34% versus last year, which is exceptional performance, driven in part by our customers' desire to build inventory. While we would not suggest this growth rate is sustainable, we do continue to see favorable growth trends for this business.  
Our margin and earnings improvement reflected our success in spending reduction, in particular, travel expenses and variable selling costs, which will generally come back as our businesses return to normal. In addition, as we discussed last quarter, we chose to avoid unpaid layoffs. Instead, we placed our underutilized people on short term, fully paid furloughs, some of which were partially subsidized by governments around the world.  We have tracked the costs related to that decision, along with other COVID costs, about $9 million net of government subsidies and are excluding these items from adjusted profit in the quarter.  
We believe that maintaining our trained and dedicated staff was the right thing to do and is helping us now support our customers as they ramp up healthcare procedures to normal levels. Our furloughs have been reduced substantially as businesses come back.  
On another note, we have continued to invest in R&D as originally planned, and we expect to do so going forward. As a result of these factors, we anticipate that our adjusted SG&A dollar spend will rise as business rebounds. Since we last spoke to you in May, we've witnessed a turnaround in deferrable procedure volumes in the United States and Europe. While the recovery is still region-by-region and some COVID hotspots are occurring, we have been pleasantly surprised at how quickly healthcare providers have been able to bring procedure volumes back. Many of our product lines are now running flat to slightly up as compared to the prior year.  
Although we may see some reductions due to COVID hotspots, we do not expect to return to the low levels of deferrable procedures experienced in April and May, as healthcare providers have improved their ability to combat the disease. We believe that STERIS' balanced business model will continue to be a benefit and remain optimistic that we are well positioned to respond to changes and uncertainties in the market.  
Now changing gears a bit from our financial performance. Yesterday in our earnings release, we announced the addition of a new Board member, Chris Holland. You may know Chris from his role as CFO at C.R. Bard prior to their acquisition by Becton, Dickinson. Chris brings a great experience to our Board, and we are happy to have the benefit of his insights and perspectives.  
We also announced an increase in our quarterly dividend yesterday, bringing us to $0.40 per share per quarter and representing our 15th consecutive year of dividend increase. As Mike discussed, our balance sheet and cash flow remains strong, and we are pleased to be able to continue returning value directly to our shareholders through our dividend.  
As you know, STERIS is an essential business supporting healthcare. We are very fortunate to be in the business we are in and to be in strong financial position. Our plans to be nimble and ready to support our customers as needed are already paying off. We believe that our approach to managing through the pandemic leaves us well positioned to capitalize on future opportunities.  
Before we open to questions, we express our respect and gratitude to the health care providers on the frontlines of the pandemic around the world. These are unprecedented times, and the challenges facing caregivers have been unexpected and monumental, and they continue to do remarkable work to this day.  
We also thank the people of STERIS, those working with our customers in the field and those working behind the scenes, in our factories, labs, offices and from their own homes in this unusual time. Our team has done a great job of adjusting to this difficult situation while serving customers and their patients.  
Our confidence in our strategic positions and operating capabilities continues to grow. While there is more uncertainty in the near-term given the COVID situation, both potential upside and downside, we stand ready to capture opportunities and mitigate risks. We continue to believe that the long-term future for STERIS is bright.
I will now turn the call back over to Julie to open Q&A."

And I think the health care systems around the country and around the world have done a fantastic job of assuring patients that it is safe to go to their facilities for procedures. And they've done a number of things and done that in a number of ways. I don't know if you happen to have been into a hospital or surgery center recently, I have, and the precautions that they are taking are fantastic, both with their own staffs and with the patients who are coming in. The visitors no longer come in, so they've taken care of that problem pretty straightforwardly.  
There are all kinds of methods that they've used. And again, we're talking to them all the time about this. First, my understanding from speaking with a number of them is that kind of the patient or potential patients, #1 factor in making that decision is their physician. And so they've done great work in outreach using their physicians to -- and their physician offices to give outreach to the patients, reassuring them that the hospital may be one of the safest places to be as opposed to all kinds of other things that people are doing around the country, which is what's causing COVID to be spread. So -- and I think the facts bear that up. They've done a great job with PPE. We know a number of physicians groups who have extraordinarily low amounts of COVID in their own staff, even though they are actively involved -- heavily actively involved with COVID patients. So it's both the work they've done to make their places safe and the -- of the marketing, but it's marketing to let people know that it's safe to return. It's largely the physicians doing that, not the facility so much.  
The other thing they've done is they have moved more and more procedures into spaces that patients feel more comfortable, so in the ambulatory surgery centers and other types of centers like that as well as the standard operating room. So I mean, really, it's pretty miraculous, the work they've done the last 2 or 3 months to offset this significant concern among potential patients. And of course, the toughest areas were the places like New York City that were overrun early. And it's been, I think, somewhat easier in other spaces where we didn't see that level of burden on the hospitals."

Maybe if I could, let's take a little bit of a look at the margins for my first question on both Life Sciences and AST. And I appreciate the commentary, Walt, that you saw some stocking of consumables, in particular, in Life Sciences. But you hit a record growth -- I mean up margin there in Life Sciences at 41.5%, which is really enviable. Help us think a little bit, though, about how that business may have shifted structurally such that as we start to see some normalization there in consumable purchasing patterns, how we think about that operating margin? And then, I guess, similar to that, a little bit of a taper in AST, which is to be expected with the shift more towards PPE in some instances. But is that something that we should think about lingering throughout the fiscal year and kind of slowly working its way back out? Or is that something that would start to reverse itself, maybe more so in the second half of the fiscal year? Just want to make sure we're thinking about the margin contribution correctly?

And on the Life Science question, I think the increased margin that you saw in the first quarter was heavily based on the fact that we had a mix of very high consumable revenue stream. Some significant portion of that is stockpiling by our customers just for a surety of supply and some portion of it is actually also increased demand from those customers. With all the investment being dolled out right now in vaccine production, that is an area that is really in STERIS Life Sciences sweet spot for our portfolio because it requires aseptic manufacturing. So -- and to the extent that, that is sustained, we believe we'll see some sustained benefit for consumables business in particular. To the extent that pharma starts making significant expansion investments in either CMOs or their factories, then we may see some benefit in our capital equipment side of the business in the future. But in the interim in short term, we see it as purely a consumable play at this time."

You've talked about in terms of how we intend to spend our capital. We do intend to provide dividends. We think that's a good discipline of management to grow dividends somewhat in line with the profit and cash flow of the business. We absolutely intend to continue to investing in the businesses we already have. And  you're clearly seeing that we're -- as Mike mentioned, we actually spent more capital this quarter than we did a quarter ago last year. 
We have significant investments moving forward in the AST space for growth, which we absolutely believe is coming. And also in the hospital outsourced processing business, we are intending and have and intend to spend significant capital. So those -- and we're spending capital every place. Those 2 are just orders of magnitude, kind of larger than some of the others at this moment in time and that's, in our view, because of the long-term opportunity in those spaces. But in general, I'd rather spend money in the businesses already run to make them either more efficient or new products than running around looking for new things. After that, we want to run around and look for new things. And we did have a number of things on our plate when this little COVID issue hit us. And so we pulled back on that due to the near-term uncertainty in the space. 
We are feeling more comfortable that our own cash situation is in good shape and that we can kind of go back to the search and hunt. But those things -- timing of those are never known. So I wouldn't suggest something is going to happen tomorrow morning, but it would be surprising if over the next year or 2, we don't see things that are worth investing in and that add to our portfolio. We like things that are either in our space or right next door to our space. We don't like stepping out wildly into things we don't understand. So at a high level, that hasn't changed. It's just we took a little pause, but -- and it seems like when [indiscernible], as you remember, last year, we did 6 or 7, they were relatively small. A couple of years before, we did some relatively large ones. We don't control the timing on those things. Usually, the seller has more control of timing than we do. But we certainly continue to see a pipeline of things and intend to be active. And we are far more comfortable today than we were 90 days ago in making those kind of decisions."

But the -- health care capital spending loves change and hates uncertainty. And so we've been in a little bit more uncertain time the last little bit, but we're also seeing changes. So it's not at all clear exactly how that's going to work out over the next year or 2. As I said, this move -- we already saw the greatest growth rate in our capital spending for health care was moving to ambulatory surgery type of facilities, whether they be a part of a hospital system or not. And so we -- that -- I would not be surprised if that accelerates, given what I said about trying to move patients to places that they feel more comfortable, a, it's closer to their homes; and b, it's -- there's just less traffic, if you will. And so I would not be surprised to see that spending accelerate. 
We have felt for some time that both particularly into surgery centers, as you see them, take on more and more extensive surgeries, they cannot have the same type of capital equipment, they need stronger infrastructure to do that. So I would expect to see that mix move up in ambulatory surgery. And again, they can't do orthopedic implants with the sterilization capacity they currently have. So we think that's opportunity, both for capital spending and for our ORC. So we do see the intermediate to longer-term positively in that space. And for every time -- for every surgery that moves out of the hospital, they put in 2 more complex surgeries. Heart, lung -- one heart-lung transplant does not equal to one artificial knee. And so even though the numbers may stay constant, the intensity continues to rise. 
So in the long term, we see it growing with hospital or health care revenue, generally speaking, as it has for the last 30-some-odd years. In the very short term, there are a number of places just like we did put on capital freezes. But I think as they see -- as they get visibility into their cash flow, they will begin spending again more in their normal fashion. And then the good news for us is we had a very good backlog going in, which we rarely see cancellations. And then lastly, the big projects are rarely stopped or slowed down. It may slow down a little bit just for labor, but they're rarely stopped or slowed down in a consequential way. Once you put steel in the ground, you need to fill the facility. So those will, I think, will continue as they would have. 
The pipeline is a bit softer right now than what we saw 90 days ago, [ let's say, ] or before COVID got serious in the U.S. But for roughly 45 to 60 days, we had no ability for our salespeople to access facilities as they shut down everything, but patient care. And so we're now back in the field working with facilities on their needs. So I think it's early yet to predict the exact strength or lack of strength in capital equipment. But I think the intermediate to longer-term looks pretty good."

So -- and the same in our AST business, what we've described is it's basically did last year, but that's not normal for us, right? We would expect to see 5%, 6%, 7% growth. So my answer to that is there's probably some catch-up from the last quarter or so that is going to occur. And then there's also a catch-up of the growth that would have occurred. Now how quickly that all happens, I think, is a wildcard.

The rest of Europe has been ahead of the U.S. in bringing back procedures and our businesses, both AST and ORCs are showing that. So the Continental Europe, for lack of better terms, has been stronger coming back quicker, I should say, and U.K. has been the slowest entity in our space.

Again, if you go back to the original general statement I made, capital flows change and of course, uncertainty.

Less true of tables, but it's very true of lights and all that. Tables, you can move. But if you're 2/3 of the way through with the life, maybe you go ahead and put new tables in this new facility.

34783,678069840,2101959,"STERIS plc, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2020",2020-08-04,"Earnings Calls","STERIS plc","Executives","Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It's once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our first quarter performance.

It's once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our first quarter performance. 
For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue declined 3%, driven by a decline in volume, offset by 70 basis points of favorable price. As a reminder, healthcare capital equipment revenue in the quarter reflects a onetime benefit of $15 million for a change in the timing of revenue recognition. 
You may recall that when we adopted the new revenue recognition accounting standard at the beginning of fiscal 2019, our operating room integration capital equipment products required significant on-site system configuration during the installation process. As a result, we were required to defer all revenue until installation was complete. Since then, we have enhanced the design of our OR product line, which allows for full assembly and configuration of the equipment in our plant before shipment and simplifies the installation process. As a result, revenue is recognized based on the shipping terms, consistent with other capital equipment products. 
In addition, constant currency organic revenue for the quarter includes a total of about $10 million from prior year tuck-in acquisitions, primarily in health care, spread across capital equipment, consumables and service. Excluding both of these items, total company constant currency organic revenue would have declined 8%. 
Gross margin for the quarter was about flat at 44.1% and was impacted favorably by mix and price, somewhat offset by lower productivity due to reduced volumes. EBIT margin for the quarter was 21.3% of revenue, an increase of 180 basis points from the first quarter last year, due in part to approximately a $5 million benefit from the change in the timing of revenue recognition, as I noted earlier, as well as lower travel expenses, compensation-related costs and sales and marketing expenses. 
The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 17.3% and includes the benefit of stock compensation deduction. Net income in the quarter grew 6% to $111.8 million and earnings increased to $1.31 per diluted share. 
Our balance sheet is a continued source of strength for the company. Considering our cash position of $255.6 million, access to available credit lines and a leverage ratio below 1.5x debt to EBITDA, we are well positioned from a liquidity standpoint. During the quarter, capital expenditures totaled $66.9 million, while depreciation and amortization was $49 million. The increase in capital expenditures versus the prior year is related to expansion projects within the AST segment. 
Free cash flow for the quarter was $67.4 million, an increase over the first quarter of last year, primarily due to improvements in working capital and deferred tax payments under government programs. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Walt for his remarks."

Our solid overall performance in the first quarter reflects the diversified nature of STERIS' business across our medical device, pharma and healthcare customers. Collectively, our constant currency organic revenu",1086,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Our solid overall performance in the first quarter reflects the diversified nature of STERIS' business across our medical device, pharma and healthcare customers. Collectively, our constant currency organic revenue declined just 3%, while adjusted earnings increased compared to the same quarter last fiscal year. Given the circumstances, we are very pleased with those overall results. 
Healthcare, our biggest segment, most impacted by the reduction in deferrable procedure revenue, declined 10% with mixed performance across the segment. Healthcare consumables were down 28% for the quarter, but we generally saw monthly sequential increases culminating in near prior year levels by the end of June. As we discussed last quarter, our endoscopy business continued to be one of the most impacted areas for STERIS, but it is following the same trend as the rest of consumables. 
Service declined 10%, but also witnessed similar trends as consumable products, with June returning to prior year levels in our equipment service business. 
In Healthcare capital equipment, which grew 6% in Q1, shipments continued from strong backlog entering the year as well as the $15 million benefit in ORI that Mike mentioned earlier. I would add that this benefit in revenue also reduced Healthcare backlog by the same $15 million as those shipments were recognized. Even with that reduction, we ended the quarter at $164 million of Healthcare capital backlog down just $8 million compared to the first quarter of last year when the ORI change is taken into account and up $9 million sequentially from Q4 with the same adjustment. 
As I've commented before, we would not be surprised to see Healthcare capital equipment come under some pressure over the coming quarters, particularly replacement equipment, some of which can be delayed by our customers. 
Turning to AST, which serves medical device customers, that business's revenue was flat with the prior year. This was largely the result of continued elevated demand for PPE sterilization, offsetting a reduction in devices for deferrable procedures. Once again, we experienced increased procedural device processing on a sequential basis within the quarter. 
Life Sciences revenue grew 21% in Q1 as we continue to benefit from our pharma customers' expectations for growth in vaccines and biologics. Supporting that growth, Life Sciences consumables grew 34% versus last year, which is exceptional performance, driven in part by our customers' desire to build inventory. While we would not suggest this growth rate is sustainable, we do continue to see favorable growth trends for this business. 
Our margin and earnings improvement reflected our success in spending reduction, in particular, travel expenses and variable selling costs, which will generally come back as our businesses return to normal. In addition, as we discussed last quarter, we chose to avoid unpaid layoffs. Instead, we placed our underutilized people on short term, fully paid furloughs, some of which were partially subsidized by governments around the world. We have tracked the costs related to that decision, along with other COVID costs, about $9 million net of government subsidies and are excluding these items from adjusted profit in the quarter. 
We believe that maintaining our trained and dedicated staff was the right thing to do and is helping us now support our customers as they ramp up healthcare procedures to normal levels. Our furloughs have been reduced substantially as businesses come back. 
On another note, we have continued to invest in R&D as originally planned, and we expect to do so going forward. As a result of these factors, we anticipate that our adjusted SG&A dollar spend will rise as business rebounds. Since we last spoke to you in May, we've witnessed a turnaround in deferrable procedure volumes in the United States and Europe. While the recovery is still region-by-region and some COVID hotspots are occurring, we have been pleasantly surprised at how quickly healthcare providers have been able to bring procedure volumes back. Many of our product lines are now running flat to slightly up as compared to the prior year. 
Although we may see some reductions due to COVID hotspots, we do not expect to return to the low levels of deferrable procedures experienced in April and May, as healthcare providers have improved their ability to combat the disease. We believe that STERIS' balanced business model will continue to be a benefit and remain optimistic that we are well positioned to respond to changes and uncertainties in the market. 
Now changing gears a bit from our financial performance. Yesterday in our earnings release, we announced the addition of a new Board member, Chris Holland. You may know Chris from his role as CFO at C.R. Bard prior to their acquisition by Becton, Dickinson. Chris brings a great experience to our Board, and we are happy to have the benefit of his insights and perspectives. 
We also announced an increase in our quarterly dividend yesterday, bringing us to $0.40 per share per quarter and representing our 15th consecutive year of dividend increase. As Mike discussed, our balance sheet and cash flow remains strong, and we are pleased to be able to continue returning value directly to our shareholders through our dividend. 
As you know, STERIS is an essential business supporting healthcare. We are very fortunate to be in the business we are in and to be in strong financial position. Our plans to be nimble and ready to support our customers as needed are already paying off. We believe that our approach to managing through the pandemic leaves us well positioned to capitalize on future opportunities. 
Before we open to questions, we express our respect and gratitude to the health care providers on the frontlines of the pandemic around the world. These are unprecedented times, and the challenges facing caregivers have been unexpected and monumental, and they continue to do remarkable work to this day. 
We also thank the people of STERIS, those working with our customers in the field and those working behind the scenes, in our factories, labs, offices and from their own homes in this unusual time. Our team has done a great job of adjusting to this difficult situation while serving customers and their patients. 
Our confidence in our strategic positions and operating capabilities continues to grow. While there is more uncertainty in the near-term given the COVID situation, both potential upside and downside, we stand ready to capture opportunities and mitigate risks. We continue to believe that the long-term future for STERIS is bright.
I will now turn the call back over to Julie to open Q&A."

And I think the health care systems around the country and around the world have done a fantastic job of assuring patients that it is safe to go to their facilities for procedures. And they've done a number of things and done that in a number of ways. I don't know if you happen to have been into a hospital or surgery center recently, I have, and the precautions that they are taking are fantastic, both with their own staffs and with the patients who are coming in. The visitors no longer come in, so they've taken care of that problem pretty straightforwardly. 
There are all kinds of methods that they've used. And again, we're talking to them all the time about this. First, my understanding from speaking with a number of them is that kind of the patient or potential patients, #1 factor in making that decision is their physician. And so they've done great work in outreach using their physicians to -- and their physician offices to give outreach to the patients, reassuring them that the hospital may be one of the safest places to be as opposed to all kinds of other things that people are doing around the country, which is what's causing COVID to be spread. So -- and I think the facts bear that up. They've done a great job with PPE. We know a number of physicians groups who have extraordinarily low amounts of COVID in their own staff, even though they are actively involved -- heavily actively involved with COVID patients. So it's both the work they've done to make their places safe and the -- of the marketing, but it's marketing to let people know that it's safe to return. It's largely the physicians doing that, not the facility so much. 
The other thing they've done is they have moved more and more procedures into spaces that patients feel more comfortable, so in the ambulatory surgery centers and other types of centers like that as well as the standard operating room. So I mean, really, it's pretty miraculous, the work they've done the last 2 or 3 months to offset this significant concern among potential patients. And of course, the toughest areas were the places like New York City that were overrun early. And it's been, I think, somewhat easier in other spaces where we didn't see that level of burden on the hospitals."

Maybe if I could, let's take a little bit of a look at the margins for my first question on both Life Sciences and AST. And I appreciate the commentary, Walt, that you saw some stocking of consumables, in particular, in Life Sciences. But you hit a record growth -- I mean up margin there in Life Sciences at 41.5%, which is really enviable. Help us think a little bit, though, about how that business may have shifted structurally such that as we start to see some normalization there in consumable purchasing patterns, how we think about that operating margin? And then, I guess, similar to that, a little bit of a taper in AST, which is to be expected with the shift more towards PPE in some instances. But is that something that we should think about lingering throughout the fiscal year and kind of slowly working its way back out? Or is that something that would start to reverse itself, maybe more so in the second half of the fiscal year? Just want to make sure we're thinking about the margin contribution correctly?

With all the investment being dolled out right now in vaccine production, that is an area that is really in STERIS Life Sciences sweet spot for our portfolio because it requires aseptic manufacturing. So -- and to the extent that, that is sustained, we believe we'll see some sustained benefit for consumables business in particular.

We have significant investments moving forward in the AST space for growth, which we absolutely believe is coming. And also in the hospital outsourced processing business, we are intending and have and intend to spend significant capital. So those -- and we're spending capital every place. Those 2 are just orders of magnitude, kind of larger than some of the others at this moment in time and that's, in our view, because of the long-term opportunity in those spaces. But in general, I'd rather spend money in the businesses already run to make them either more efficient or new products than running around looking for new things. After that, we want to run around and look for new things. And we did have a number of things on our plate when this little COVID issue hit us. And so we pulled back on that due to the near-term uncertainty in the space. 
We are feeling more comfortable that our own cash situation is in good shape and that we can kind of go back to the search and hunt. But those things -- timing of those are never known. So I wouldn't suggest something is going to happen tomorrow morning, but it would be surprising if over the next year or 2, we don't see things that are worth investing in and that add to our portfolio. We like things that are either in our space or right next door to our space. We don't like stepping out wildly into things we don't understand. So at a high level, that hasn't changed. It's just we took a little pause, but -- and it seems like when it rains, it pours, as you remember, last year, we did 6 or 7, they were relatively small. A couple of years before, we did some relatively large ones. We don't control the timing on those things. Usually, the seller has more control of timing than we do. But we certainly continue to see a pipeline of things and intend to be active. And we are far more comfortable today than we were 90 days ago in making those kind of decisions."

But the -- health care capital spending loves change and hates uncertainty.

But the -- health care capital spending loves change and hates uncertainty. And so we've been in a little bit more uncertain time the last little bit, but we're also seeing changes. So it's not at all clear exactly how that's going to work out over the next year or 2. As I said, this move -- we already saw the greatest growth rate in our capital spending for health care was moving to ambulatory surgery type of facilities, whether they be a part of a hospital system or not. And so we -- that -- I would not be surprised if that accelerates, given what I said about trying to move patients to places that they feel more comfortable, a, it's closer to their homes; and b, it's -- there's just less traffic, if you will. And so I would not be surprised to see that spending accelerate. 
We have felt for some time that both particularly into surgery centers, as you see them, take on more and more extensive surgeries, they cannot have the same type of capital equipment, they need stronger infrastructure to do that. So I would expect to see that mix move up in ambulatory surgery. And again, they can't do orthopedic implants with the sterilization capacity they currently have. So we think that's opportunity, both for capital spending and for our ORC. So we do see the intermediate to longer-term positively in that space. And for every time -- for every surgery that moves out of the hospital, they put in 2 more complex surgeries. Heart, lung -- one heart-lung transplant does not equal to one artificial knee. And so even though the numbers may stay constant, the intensity continues to rise. 
So in the long term, we see it growing with hospital or health care revenue, generally speaking, as it has for the last 30-some-odd years. In the very short term, there are a number of places just like we did put on capital freezes. But I think as they see -- as they get visibility into their cash flow, they will begin spending again more in their normal fashion. And then the good news for us is we had a very good backlog going in, which we rarely see cancellations. And then lastly, the big projects are rarely stopped or slowed down. It may slow down a little bit just for labor, but they're rarely stopped or slowed down in a consequential way. Once you put steel in the ground, you need to fill the facility. So those will, I think, will continue as they would have. 
The pipeline is a bit softer right now than what we saw 90 days ago, [ let's say ], or before COVID got serious in the U.S. But for roughly 45 to 60 days, we had no ability for our salespeople to access facilities as they shut down everything, but patient care. And so we're now back in the field working with facilities on their needs. So I think it's early yet to predict the exact strength or lack of strength in capital equipment. But I think the intermediate to longer-term looks pretty good."

Just curious how you're thinking about surgical procedure volumes, let's call it, in the second half of the year? I know that things have obviously improved through June and probably there's been at least some stabilization in July. But just trying to understand, do you think surgical procedure volumes actually can grow in the fourth quarter this year? Or do you think they kind of run at levels that are actually down year-over-year?

But the short answer is, I do think procedure volume still has room to grow from where it is. If you think about it, we're approaching last year's levels. I would say most of the places that I've talked to, the facilities are saying they're running 85% or 95% kind of numbers of last year. But typically, we see 3%, 4%, 5% growth. So -- and the same in our AST business, what we've described is it's basically did last year, but that's not normal for us, right? We would expect to see 5%, 6%, 7% growth. So my answer to that is there's probably some catch-up from the last quarter or so that is going to occur. And then there's also a catch-up of the growth that would have occurred. Now how quickly that all happens, I think, is a wildcard. But in general, if you take a more 18- to 24-month view, my view is that the normal growth we would have seen will occur and we're likely to see some catch-up on top of it."

So I don't know that we would have a strong feeling that second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter is going to be our best or worst year-over-year performance. The -- you're absolutely correct about the U.K. At this moment, it tends to be the lagging entity in Europe. The converse is true of the rest of Europe. 
The rest of Europe has been ahead of the U.S. in bringing back procedures and our businesses, both AST and ORCs are showing that. So the Continental Europe, for lack of better terms, has been stronger coming back quicker, I should say, and U.K. has been the slowest entity in our space. 
As you know, the U.K. is relatively small piece of our business. But it is real, and we have seen -- the ORCs are coming back from their very low levels, that they were in earlier in the year.

And as we did in the fourth quarter, we also had some meeting cancellation costs. We did not hold our annual meeting this year. So we had some cancellation costs associated with that. We had some PP&E, specifically for employees. And we had some above and beyond enhanced cleaning protocols that we've also put into that incremental cost.

It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our second quarter performance. For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue increased 2% driven by 100 basis points of volume and 100 basis points of price. Constant currency organic revenue for the quarter includes a total of about $5 million from prior year tuck-in acquisitions, primarily in healthcare, spread across capital equipment, consumables and service. Gross margin for the quarter was up 140 basis points to 45% and benefited from mix, price and productivity. EBIT margin for the quarter was 22.5% of revenue, an increase of 220 basis points from the second quarter last year due to higher gross margin attainment and lower operating expenses mainly for travel, sales and marketing and compensation due in part from business disruption from COVID-19. The adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 21.1% and includes the benefit of stock compensation offset by unfavorable discrete item adjustments. Net income in the quarter grew 13% to $127.3 million and earnings increased to $1.48 per diluted share as compared to $1.32 per diluted share in the prior year. 
Our balance sheet is a continued source of strength for the company, considering our cash position of $312 million, access to available credit lines and a low leverage ratio, we are well positioned from a liquidity standpoint, even reflecting the anticipated additional leverage for the key surgical acquisition, our debt levels remained solidly in our comfort zone. During the second quarter, capital expenditures totaled $43.9 million, while depreciation and amortization was $54.4 million. Free cash flow for the first half was $185.6 million, an increase of $23.6 million over the first half of last year, primarily due to improvements in net income and working capital somewhat offset by higher capital expenditures. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Walt for his remarks."

I hope you all have voted or will later today. We are pleased to be with you to report such encouraging results for our second quarter, which reflect the resilience of our business and the good work done by STERIS associates. In total, constant currency organic revenue grew 2% year-over-year and improved substantially on a sequential basis. We benefited from the continued recovery in procedure volumes during the quarter, as well as continued strength in segments with exposure to COVID-19 related products and services. Our release walks through the details, but I will touch on a few highlights of the quarter. Life Sciences grew 16% in the second quarter, continuing its strong performance, in particular, for consumables. While it's difficult to dissect the 31% consumables growth in the quarter. We believe the underlying growth rate remained in the lower teens, and the balance of the growth is due to COVID-19 pre-buying in anticipation of vaccine production demand. As we've said all year, we do not anticipate maintaining these growth percentage levels in perpetuity. In particular, our fourth quarter has difficult comparisons as last year's fourth quarter was the beginning of the life science consumables significant COVID-19-related revenue uptick. Rebounding from first quarter levels our AST segment grew 9% year-over-year in the quarter, benefiting from continued demand for COVID-19 product sterilization as well as a significant recovery of procedure-related medical device sterilization volumes. As we've said in prior quarters, we continue to invest aggressively in capacity expansions at AST, reflecting our long-term expectations for the growth in this business. 
As anticipated, our Healthcare segment continued to be impacted by some disruption in procedures in the quarter, declining 3% year-over-year but improving nicely on a sequential basis. Both consumables and service rebounded from first quarter levels, with consumables revenue growing 6% year-over-year, while service revenue was flat. Capital equipment shipments in the segment declined as we anticipated. Those shipments were down 14% versus the second quarter of last year. As you know, we break our capital business into either large projects or replacements. We were pleasantly surprised to see replacement orders rebounding sequentially in the quarter, reflecting a return to more normal procedure volumes. Capital equipment orders have grown sequentially through October from the low point in May and have returned to about last year's levels. Like most in our space, while we are pleased to see the sequential improvements in revenue from procedures to date, there is significant uncertainty in the coming months, as the COVID-19 pandemic appears to be escalating in many areas around the world. 
We have seen recent procedure declines in parts of Europe. It is too soon to tell what we will experience going forward in Europe and in the U.S. in the next 6 months. That said, we are not planning a significant disruption of procedure volumes in the second half of our year. As a result, we are planning for sequential revenue growth in the second half to result in about flat year-over-year revenue, excluding any impact from the anticipated key surgical acquisition. While we are quite pleased with recent trends, the situation is fluid and difficult to predict. We still consider our health care capital equipment portfolio to have the greatest downside risk in the near term. If procedures continue to improve and the pandemic subsides, we will expect some costs in our operation to start coming back to more normal levels in the second half of the year, which will limit our bottom line percentage growth somewhat. As we said all along, we manage this business for the long haul. Our actions during this pandemic reflect that approach, including our decision to avoid unpaid layoffs or furloughs related to COVID-19. We've worked hard to maintain jobs and compensation for our people, putting programs in place to take care of those who need extra support and providing paid furlough for those people in operations that were impacted by decline in the business due to the pandemic. Total cost for COVID-19 programs and expenses were $4.5 million in our second fiscal quarter, about half of what we saw in Q1. 
Similarly, our approach to investments has not changed. We continue to expand our AST footprint and to invest in R&D. We have introduced a full suite of surgical products this year, including new operating room lights, several new surgical tables and a next-generation ORI system. On the infection prevention side of our business, recently launched products include our new smaller footprint steam sterilizers and more rapid biological indicators, among others. We do not expect a consequential slowdown in our new product development efforts or in spending for R&D as a result of the pandemic. 
Before we open to Q&A, I would like to again thank STERIS people for their commitment to our customers, who have continued to be the heroes on the front lines of this pandemic. While there is uncertainty in the near term, given the COVID-19 situation, we like the positioning of our global portfolio during the pandemic as well as when we come out of it. We are working toward completing the previously announced acquisition of key surgical by calendar year-end and look forward to welcoming key's people to the STERIS family. We stand ready to capture additional opportunity and continue to believe that the long-term future for STERIS is bright. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Julie to open for Q&A."

I would say that from a working capital improvement standpoint, we've actually been successful in reducing our days sales outstanding pretty significantly this year, although that is a little bit of math, if you will because as EBIT does drop, the days sales outstanding do increase or decrease year-over-year. And we have been offsetting inventory. Inventory is on the rise we continue to have higher inventory levels because we are maintaining both surety and supply and we are level loading. So I would say that DSOs is favorable a couple of days. We should be able to continue to drive that. At least this -- the remainder of this fiscal year, I don't know about next fiscal year. And I would also say that inventory -- our projection is inventory would still be elevated by the end of the fiscal year. So I would say those 2 will pretty much naturally offset, and we will continue to see. As long as we see net income growth, we will continue to see free cash flow generation. In addition, our capital expenditures are also up, and we -- as we've spoken about many times, we do anticipate spending over $100 million in expansion capital growth AST. So don't be surprised if you see year-over-year growth in CapEx by the end of the fiscal year. We were up $13 million in the first half, and we project to be more than that up for the full year."

And so some of that's, I'll call it just natural, but -- and secondly, as most companies, I think we were not at all clear how ugly this thing was going to get when it started. And so we shut down hiring in certain places. We kept spending in the R&D functions. And I call it the long-term future. We kept spending, but on the short intermediate term things. We kind of took a step back. And we'll pick some of that back up as we see the, I'll call it, the long-term look going forward. We're increasingly comfortable, as you might expect. But there's still a lot of uncertainty out there, and we're watching it. Normally, we watch quarter-to-quarter, we watch week-to-week right now. And there are so many things going on, some of which can be very positive and some of which could be not so positive. And so we're just being careful. So we'll lag the spending piece probably a little bit for a while, and then we'll catch up at the appropriate time."

It's a very good investment. But we're putting a lot of money to make that money in place to make that money. So I would not characterize it as over-the-top in terms of when you look at ROIC, so we think there's room for improvement as those new facilities mature. It's -- if you look back and you were with us quite some time ago, when every time we added a plant, we had to knock off 50 to 100 basis points because each plant affected the overall ROS. 
Today, we have over 50 plants, so 1 plant doesn't make that much difference. But if you look plant by plant, those newer plants are not making the kind of money on an ROIC basis. Well, on ROS or ROIC basis that then the older plants are. So it's a function of those things."

There's a lot of, I'll call it, sales and marketing expense that's not going on in the world right now.

So that will have some normalization effect on earnings and cash will follow naturally with that. So I think that's point one. Point 2, though, your points will taken as we growing profitability, and we have mixed more toward some of those higher profit areas, then that profitability will flow through in cash completely. And then the only question is, how much we're spending either in acquisition or for organic growth, in order to -- the use of that cash. And we fully intend to spend as much as we can for those 2 things because that's what the future cash flow generations are. But if you pull out the investment side of it, yes, the cash will grow.

So -- and that's why we're not giving guidance. There are so many uncertainties right now both positive and negative that we think it's uncharacteristically difficult time to forecast. But having said that, in general, we're not anticipating a huge reduction in procedures like we saw in April, May, June or into March, April, May. We're not anticipating that level of reduction, which was pretty catastrophic. But we will -- we do expect temporal changes kind of spot changes around. That's kind of built into our thinking. We -- again, we do expect -- and part of that is, one offsets the other. But if we have a little more of that, we have a little more PPE process. We have a little less. We have a little less PPE and a little more of the procedural devices. So we're balancing those issues and our best view of that is that we come out about flat. Having said that, it is -- we still given the history that we've seen to date, which is about the best thing we have to work off of and how nice a job the facilities have done with the treatment protocols of COVID-19. I think that's kind of misunderstood and underappreciated. The facilities around the globe and the physicians and nurses around the globe have really improved their knowledge of how to deal with this disease. So even as it heats up some, they're a lot better positioned to take care of patients. And as a result, have done things to be able to continue to operate their procedural spaces, it would only be, in my view, unless it goes a lot worse than anticipated, it would only be patients deciding due to concern of COVID that would reduce the -- procedure is a great deal. So we just have to wait that one out. But in general, we are expecting some spot issues around the globe. But not an overwhelming reduction like we saw before. We're expecting to see some additional PPE in processing as a result. And clearly, we're anticipating good growth or good volume in the life science business for vaccine production. So at a high level, I'd say that's pretty much it. We are being a bit cautious in our view of capital. Even though orders have come back quite a bit better than we expected, being flattish recently is better than our anticipation. But capital can bounce a little bit. So we're being a little cautious on our thinking about capital."

If we did, we'd probably be giving differential guidance than what we're giving. But that's a tough call. My experience is in this space that the vaccine or I would call the pharma folks who are running these facilities are the most conservative of our customers when it comes to supply chain. So my suspicion is they're going to hold a fair amount of inventory for a long time until they know that they are in good shape and have -- know what they're running, know how much they're going to have to build and know what their requirements are going to be. So I don't think in the short term, there's going to be a huge reduction. As we work through this, if indeed they're overstocked, they will slow it down. And if they're not, they won't. But generally speaking, they tend to be kind of conservative on supply chain appropriately concerted. Those factories, you shut one of those things down. You're shutting down millions of dollars a day, not millions of dollars a year. So they're pretty careful about their supply chains. 
But again, we do not have perfect visibility. Just like we don't have perfect visibility to who's going to be building when. But I should also mention another effect of this has been our capital and -- I've talked about capital and health care being at risk. Our capital in life sciences with all time records, all-time record backlog, all-time record shipments. I mean, everything you want to look at.

It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our second quarter performance. For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue increased 2%, driven by 100 basis points of volume and 100 basis points of price. Constant currency organic revenue for the quarter includes a total of about $5 million from prior year tuck-in acquisitions, primarily in Healthcare spread across capital equipment, consumables and service. 
Gross margin for the quarter was up 140 basis points to 45% and benefited from mix, price and productivity. EBIT margin for the quarter was 22.5% of revenue, an increase of 220 basis points from the second quarter last year due to higher gross margin attainment and lower operating expenses mainly for travel, sales and marketing and compensation due in part from business disruption from COVID-19. The adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 21.1% and includes the benefit of stock compensation offset by unfavorable discrete item adjustments. Net income in the quarter grew 13% to $127.3 million and earnings increased to $1.48 per diluted share as compared to $1.32 per diluted share in the prior year. 
Our balance sheet is a continued source of strength for the company. Considering our cash position of $312 million, access to available credit lines and a low leverage ratio, we are well positioned from a liquidity standpoint. Even reflecting the anticipated additional leverage for the Key Surgical acquisition, our debt levels remained solidly in our comfort zone. During the second quarter, capital expenditures totaled $43.9 million, while depreciation and amortization was $54.4 million. Free cash flow for the first half was $185.6 million, an increase of $23.6 million over the first half of last year, primarily due to improvements in net income and working capital somewhat offset by higher capital expenditures. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Walt for his remarks."

I hope you all have voted or will later today. We are pleased to be with you to report such encouraging results for our second quarter, which reflect the resilience of our business and the good work done by STERIS associates. 
In total, constant currency organic revenue grew 2% year-over-year and improved substantially on a sequential basis. We benefited from the continued recovery in procedure volumes during the quarter as well as continued strength in segments with exposure to COVID-19-related products and services. 
Our release walks through the details, but I will touch on a few highlights of the quarter. Life Sciences grew 16% in the second quarter, continuing its strong performance, in particular, for consumables. While it's difficult to dissect the 31% consumables growth in the quarter, we believe the underlying growth rate remained in the lower teens and the balance of the growth is due to COVID-19 pre-buying in anticipation of vaccine production demand. As we've said all year, we do not anticipate maintaining these growth percentage levels in perpetuity. In particular, our fourth quarter has difficult comparisons as last year's fourth quarter was the beginning of the Life Science consumables significant COVID-19-related revenue uptick. 
Rebounding from first quarter levels, our AST segment grew 9% year-over-year in the quarter, benefiting from continued demand for COVID-19 product sterilization as well as a significant recovery of procedure-related medical device sterilization volumes. As we've said in prior quarters, we continue to invest aggressively in capacity expansions at AST, reflecting our long-term expectations for the growth in this business. 
As anticipated, our Healthcare segment continued to be impacted by some disruption in procedures in the quarter, declining 3% year-over-year but improving nicely on a sequential basis. Both consumables and service rebounded from first quarter levels, with consumables revenue growing 6% year-over-year while service revenue was flat. 
Capital equipment shipments in the segment declined as we anticipated. Those shipments were down 14% versus the second quarter of last year. As you know, we break our capital business into either large projects or replacements. We were pleasantly surprised to see replacement orders rebounding sequentially in the quarter, reflecting a return to more normal procedure volumes. Capital equipment orders have grown sequentially through October from the low point in May and have returned to about last year's levels. Like most in our space, while we are pleased to see the sequential improvements in revenue from procedures to date, there is significant uncertainty in the coming months, as the COVID-19 pandemic appears to be escalating in many areas around the world. 
We have seen recent procedure declines in parts of Europe. It is too soon to tell what we will experience going forward in Europe and in the U.S. in the next 6 months. That said, we are not planning a significant disruption of procedure volumes in the second half of our year. As a result, we are planning for sequential revenue growth in the second half to result in about flat year-over-year revenue, excluding any impact from the anticipated Key Surgical acquisition. While we are quite pleased with recent trends, the situation is fluid and difficult to predict. We still consider our Healthcare capital equipment portfolio to have the greatest downside risk in the near term. If procedures continue to improve and the pandemic subsides, we will expect some costs in our operation to start coming back to more normal levels in the second half of the year, which will limit our bottom line percentage growth somewhat. 
As we said all along, we manage this business for the long haul. Our actions during this pandemic reflect that approach, including our decision to avoid unpaid layoffs or furloughs related to COVID-19. We've worked hard to maintain jobs and compensation for our people, putting programs in place to take care of those who need extra support and providing paid furlough for those people in operations that were impacted by a decline in the business due to the pandemic. Total cost for COVID-19 programs and expenses were $4.5 million in our second fiscal quarter, about half of what we saw in Q1. 
Similarly, our approach to investments has not changed. We continue to expand our AST footprint and to invest in R&D. We have introduced a full suite of surgical products this year, including new operating room lights, several new surgical tables and a next-generation ORI system. On the infection prevention side of our business, recently launched products include our new smaller footprint steam sterilizers and more rapid biological indicators, among others. We do not expect a consequential slowdown in our new product development efforts or in spending for R&D as a result of the pandemic. 
Before we open to Q&A, I would like to again thank STERIS people for their commitment to our customers, who have continued to be the heroes on the front lines of this pandemic. While there is uncertainty in the near term given the COVID-19 situation, we like the positioning of our global portfolio during the pandemic as well as when we come out of it. We are working toward completing the previously announced acquisition of Key Surgical by calendar year-end and look forward to welcoming Key's people to the STERIS family. We stand ready to capture additional opportunity and continue to believe that the long-term future for STERIS is bright. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Julie to open for Q&A."

I would say that from a working capital improvement standpoint, we've actually been successful in reducing our days sales outstanding pretty significantly this year, although that is a little bit of math, if you will, because as EBIT does drop, the days sales outstanding do increase or decrease year-over-year. And we have been offsetting inventory. Inventory is on the rise. We continue to have higher inventory levels because we are maintaining both surety of supply and we are level loading. 
So I would say that DSOs, favorable a couple of days. We should be able to continue to drive that at least this -- the remainder of this fiscal year, I don't know about next fiscal year. And I would also say that inventory, our projection is inventory would still be elevated by the end of the fiscal year. So I would say those 2 will pretty much naturally offset, and we will continue to see. As long as we see net income growth, we will continue to see free cash flow generation. 
In addition, our capital expenditures are also up, and we -- as we've spoken about many times, we do anticipate spending over $100 million in expansion capital growth for AST. So don't be surprised if you see year-over-year growth in CapEx by the end of the fiscal year. We were up $13 million in the first half, and we project to be more than that up for the full year."

And we did not anticipate pre COVID being flat. So we would have said we would plan on being up. Probably this year, we would have expected to be up high single to maybe even into the low double-digit numbers. 
And as a result, I would argue that it were probably about 10% negative headwind versus tailwind, plus or minus a little bit. So orders of magnitude, that would be our best answer. And it's -- the places are obvious, right? In AST, where we're doing PPE and in Life Science, where we're gearing up for the vaccines. We're getting a nice tailwind but we're a procedural-based company in health care and procedures have gotten beat up. So that's been the opposite side of the equation."

And we'll pick some of that back up as we see the, I'll call it, the long-term look going forward. 
We're increasingly comfortable, as you might expect. But there's still a lot of uncertainty out there, and we're watching it. Normally, we watch quarter-to-quarter, we watch week-to-week right now. And there are so many things going on, some of which can be very positive and some of which could be not so positive. And so we're just being careful.

It's a very good investment. But we're putting a lot of money to make that money in place to make that money. So I would not characterize it as over the top in terms of when you look at ROIC, so we think there's room for improvement as those new facilities mature. It's -- if you look back and you were with us quite some time ago, when every time we added a plant, we had to knock off 50 to 100 basis points because each plant affected the overall ROS. 
Today, we have over 50 plants, so 1 plant doesn't make that much difference. But if you look plant by plant, those newer plants are not making the kind of money on an ROIC basis -- well, on ROS or ROIC basis that the than the older plants are. So it's a function of those things."

There's a lot of, I'll call it, sales and marketing expense that's not going on in the world right now.

But when we return to the more real world, I suspect strongly that we and our competitors are going to put boots on the street more and travel more and do a number of things more that we cannot do. So that will have some normalization effect on earnings and cash will follow naturally with that.  So I think that's point one. 
Point two though, your points well taken as we grow in profitability and we have mixed more toward some of those higher profit areas, then that profitability will flow through in cash completely. And then the only question is, how much we're spending either in acquisition or for organic growth in order to -- the use of that cash? And we fully intend to spend as much as we can for those 2 things because that's what the future cash flow generations are. But if you pull out the investment side of it, yes, the cash will grow.

Chris, again, I'm telling you we were planning, and that plan could change next week or next month. So -- and that's why we're not giving guidance. There are so many uncertainties right now, both positive and negative, that we think it's uncharacteristically difficult time to forecast. But having said that, in general, we're not anticipating a huge reduction in procedures like we saw in April, May, June or into March, April, May. We're not anticipating that level of reduction, which was pretty catastrophic. But we will -- we do expect temporal changes kind of spot changes around. That's kind of built into our thinking. We -- again, we do expect -- and part of that is, one offsets the other a bit. If we have a little more of that, we have a little more PPE process. We have a little less. We have a little less PPE and a little more of the procedural devices. 
So we're balancing those issues and our best view of that is that we come out about flat. Having said that, it is -- we still, given the history that we've seen to date, which is about the best thing we have to work off of and how nice a job the facilities have done with the treatment protocols of COVID-19. I think that's kind of grossly misunderstood and underappreciated. The facilities around the globe and the physicians and nurses around the globe have really improved their knowledge of how to deal with this disease. So even as it heats up some, they're a lot better positioned to take care of patients. And as a result, have done things to be able to continue to operate their procedural spaces. It would only be, in my view, unless it goes a lot worse than anticipated, it would only be patients deciding due to concern of COVID that would reduce the -- procedure is a great deal. So we just have to wait that one out. 
But in general, we are expecting some spot issues around the globe, but not an overwhelming reduction like we saw before. We're expecting to see some additional PPE in processing as a result. And clearly, we're anticipating good growth or good volume in the Life Science business for vaccine production. So at a high level, I'd say that's pretty much it. We are being a bit cautious in our view of capital. Even though orders have come back quite a bit better than we expected, being flattish recently is better than our anticipation. But capital can bounce a little bit, so we're being a little cautious on our thinking about capital."

If we did, we'd probably be giving strong differential guidance than what we're giving. But that's a tough call. My experience is in this space that the vaccine or I would call the pharma folks who are running these facilities are the most conservative of our customers when it comes to supply chain. So my suspicion is they're going to hold a fair amount of inventory for a long time until they know that they are in good shape and have -- know what they're running, know how much they're going to have to build and know what their requirements are going to be. So I don't think in the short term, there's going to be a huge reduction. 
As we work through this, if indeed they're overstocked, they will slow it down. And if they're not, they won't. But generally speaking, they tend to be kind of conservative on supply chain, appropriately conservative. Those factories, you shut one of those things down, you're shutting down millions of dollars a day, not millions of dollars a year. So they're pretty careful about their supply chains. 
But again, we do not have perfect visibility just like we don't have perfect visibility to who's going to be building when. But I should also mention another effect of this has been our capital and -- I've talked about capital in Healthcare being at risk. Our capital in Life Sciences is at all-time records, all-time record backlog, all-time record shipments. I mean everything you want to look at. So the capital equipment in Life Science is quite strong, and we don't see that subsiding in the short to intermediate term."
