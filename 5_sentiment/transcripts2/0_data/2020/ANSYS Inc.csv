Let me focus on annual contract value",1843,"Thank you, Annette, and good morning, everyone. Q4 was yet another exceptional quarter for ANSYS, capping a stellar year. In the fourth quarter, we delivered record revenue, earnings per share and operating cash flow. Let me focus on annual contract value, or ACV, which we believe to be the best indicator of the underlying health of our business. Q4 ACV had well over $0.5 billion in the quarter for the first time in our history, represented growth of 13% in constant currency, which was particularly gratifying considering the strong baseline set in Q4 of 2018. For the full year 2019, ACV grew a robust 12% in constant currency. As we look to 2020, we are guiding to over 12% growth in ACV in constant currency at the midpoint of our range. This gives us further confidence that we will achieve our goal of $2 billion in ACV by 2022 while maintaining our industry-leading margins in the 42% to 44% range. Maria will provide more detail in just a few minutes. 
Now let me provide insight into some of the growth drivers in the fourth quarter and for all of 2019. During Q4, 10 long-standing customers made 8-figure commitments, and nearly all of the deals over $1 million included offerings from at least 3 of our product lines. From a geographic perspective, we saw strength in all our major territories last year. While North America led with 26% revenue growth for the year, I'm delighted that revenue in Europe grew 29% in Q4 and 14% in 2019, both in constant currency. For the full year, Asia Pac revenue grew 15% in constant currency, despite a modest 2% revenue growth in Q4, which was attributable to variations in deal timings. In Japan, we grew revenue 20% in Q4. 
From an industry standpoint, high-tech continues to be our largest sector, fueled by electronics and our semiconductor solutions and supported by a multi-physics portfolio. And as you will hear shortly, we are continuing to add new capabilities to our product offerings so our customers can keep driving innovation in this key industry. 
Moving to automotive. Other vendors have signaled weakness in the sector perhaps because of their focus on legacy programs or their inability to pivot to emerging customer requirements. For ANSYS, however, automotive is an area of strength, in part because we have successfully broadened our offerings to address key growth drivers, namely solutions for autonomous and electric vehicles. We have seen recent evidence of that success in electric vehicles, first with Volkswagen, which we have previously discussed; and now with Porsche. In Q4, we announced that Porsche Motorsport is using ANSYS to create an advanced electric powertrain for its electric racecar. After proving itself on the track,  Porsche expects to use the car's electric powertrain to usher in a new era of commercial e-mobility vehicles. 
Moving to other industries. Although energy is going through a transition, we are seeing increased demand in that sector, including an extended collaboration with leading energy technology company, Baker Hughes. This long-time customer signed a new agreement in Q4 to use ANSYS simulation to drive down design and development costs, including additive manufacturing while sparking innovation. 
We continue to see success in aerospace and defense, driven by increased customer investment in North America. In fact, the aerospace and defense industry is responsible for 4 of our top deals in Q4. The complex product challenges facing aerospace and defense organizations require a true multi-physics approach, including solutions for electromagnetics, fluids and next-generation materials. 
For example, a leading North American gas turbine manufacturer signed an 8-figure deal in Q4 to shorten its design cycle using faster, more reliable and accurate combustion simulations. By deploying our Mosaic meshing and enhanced workflows, this industry leader reduced preparation time from hours to minutes while getting more consistent and robust results, twice as fast. By using ANSYS solutions, we expect this global leader to save millions of dollars a year in reduced labor and related costs. 
Another large aerospace company is also benefiting from our comprehensive multi-physics portfolio. This company faced a complex set of operating conditions that made identifying potential failure mechanisms of challenge. It is using our best-in-class electrical, thermal and mechanical products as well as our electronics reliability simulation solution from last year's acquisition of DFR to improve designs and to mitigate possible failures. This resulted in an 8-figure deal in Q4, and it demonstrates our ability to efficiently integrate new technologies into our selling motion. 
As you can see, our customers are benefiting from the formidable combination of ANSYS solutions across physics. This is a powerful endorsement of the strength of the full portfolio and it is one that we believe other vendors cannot match. We continue to extend our product leadership across the entire portfolio with our recently launched ANSYS 2020 R1. R1 accelerates company's digital transformation by enhancing the interfaces, functionality, workflows and scalability of our products. R1 includes multiple products and technology advances. But in the interest of time, I'll focus on areas of particular interest to the high-tech industry. 
To make 5G a reality, the industry must develop new array and beam steering technologies that overcome millimeter wave impediments such as signal propagation at 28 gigahertz. To overcome those challenges, we continue to make major investments in ANSYS HFSS our flagship product for designing and simulating high-frequency electronic products.  R1 includes groundbreaking new phased array antenna technology that enables 5G designers to model complete antenna arrays, a task that was previously computationally prohibitive. 
Developing modern antennas is only one challenge in realizing 5G systems. Chip designers must develop new architectures to co-locate the chip and the antenna, which introduces topology constraints and electromagnetic cross-dock challenges that did not previously exist. We recently announced new product, ANSYS RaptorH to solve these challenges. With an unparalleled accuracy, it's unmatched capacity and speed and its smooth design flow integration for advanced nanometer integrated circuit design, we believe RaptorH is the most feature-rich electromagnetic tool in the market for system-on-chip flows. RaptorH marries the best-in-class engines from ANSYS RaptorX, which we gained in last year's Helic acquisition and enters HFSS, into a single-chip package system design environment.  Helic was acquired in Q1 2019, and this product shows the speed at which the ANSYS R&D teams can incorporate new technologies into our portfolio. 
Our platform strategy is based on an extensible, vendor-neutral architecture that works both on-premises and in the cloud. ANSYS Minerva is based on this architecture and empowers companies to solve the seemingly intractable problem of dealing with the enormous amount of data created by multiphysics simulations of complex systems such as 5G components and equipment. In R1, Minerva's scalable traceability, configuration management and versioning system ensures reliability and connectivity of simulation data to drive collaboration and insights across the product life cycle and across departmental silos. That traceability is critical to companies like Eaton Corporation that rely on Minerva to streamline their user experience when designing and manufacturing parts using additive manufacturing and other products. 
These innovations are empowering our customers to solve some of their most challenging product problems. Our ongoing commitment to improving our best-in-class solutions is further widening the technology gap between us and our competitors. That gap is certainly evident with ANSYS Discovery Live, where we have significantly broadened structural use cases and expanded generative design capabilities while adding a GPU-based, steady state computational fluid dynamic solver. This breakthrough enables design engineers to predict air flow and heat removal at rates 100x faster than the previous GPU solver within Discovery Live. One customer told us that they reduced component design time from 3 months to less than 2 weeks. 
Q4 marked the first large renewals for the Discovery business, and we are happy to see our early adopters expand their commitment to discovery. On its most recent earnings call, our strategic partner, PTC, announced that it was also seeing a ramp-up of adoption in average deal size with its Creo simulation live product, which incorporates Discovery Live. As I mentioned previously, we expect the near-term financial impact of Discovery Live to be modest, but we see a strong long-term opportunity. 
Over the course of Q4, we also expanded our relationships with industry leaders, Autodesk, Microsoft and Rockwell Automation. With Autodesk, we built on our previously announced automotive workflow between our lighting simulation solution and to -- and Autodesk. Our new connection between ANSYS mechanical and Autodesk Fusion will drive revolutionary design and engineering agility for our customers, helping them expedite products to market. 
Our partnership with Microsoft also expanded, growing beyond our initial collaboration where we empowered customers to access high-performance computing on demand via ANSYS cloud, which runs on Microsoft Azure. In Q4, we grew our collaboration to make it easier for customers to adopt and deploy digital twins. Through our expanded partnership, manufacturers that model and connect assets using Azure digital twins can optimize asset production and operations using ANSYS twin builder. That enables users to slash product maintenance costs and speed, high-quality products to market. 
Similarly, with Rockwell Automation, we're enabling customers to benefit by creating a digital twin of their full manufacturing process to create and test virtual what-if scenarios. In doing so, industrial companies can adapt to market demands with more agility and minimize risk. 
We are also continuing to expand the market for simulation by reaching future users. Over 3,000 universities use our technology for research and teaching, including students at Carnegie Mellon University, who are building and testing their own simulations in the newly opened ANSYS Hall. More than 150,000 people have enrolled in Cornell University's massive online course in simulation based on ANSYS. And I'm pleased to announce that we have seen over 1 million downloads of our student products. 
I'd like to take a moment now to recognize my colleagues at ANSYS. As you know, the coronavirus is a rapidly evolving situation. Our #1 priority remains, of course, the safety and the well-being of our employees and their families around the world. And I am humbled and grateful for the commitment that our colleagues in China and elsewhere is showing as they continue to drive business execution in difficult circumstances. 
Switching to our commitment to environmental, social and governance initiatives for just a moment. I'm proud that Newsweek recently named us to its 2020 list of America's Most Responsible Companies. And I'm delighted that 2020 women on board recognized ANSYS as a winning W company for 2019 with at least 20% women on our Board of Directors. 
To summarize, building on double-digit ACV growth in 2018, 2019 was a record-breaking year for ANSYS. These results, combined with our 2020 forecast of double-digit ACV growth and our continued investment in our market-leading products, give us further confidence that we will achieve our goal of $2 billion in ACV by 2022. So you can understand why I'm excited for 2020 and beyond. As I have told you before, the future for ANSYS is brighter than ever. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Maria. Maria?"

Let me start off by saying that, financially, 2019 was our strongest year ever, and we are very encouraged about 2020 given the momentum in our business. For the full year of 2019, we delivered either above the midpoint or well above the high end of the range on our initial financial guidance, and we raised full year guidance 3x throughout the course of the year. Even more exciting is that we closed the year with a very strong fourth quarter, which included record Q4 results across all of our key financial metrics. This is quite a testament to both our resilient business model and our team's ability to execute, particularly when you consider the very strong comparables for both Q4 and the full year 2018. 
Now I'd like to take a few minutes to provide some additional color on our financial performance, and then I will close with an update on our outlook and key assumptions for Q1 and 2020. And consistent with our standard practice, my comments will be in terms of non-GAAP unless I state otherwise. 
For the fourth quarter, we delivered constant currency revenue growth of 18% and  ACV growth of 13%, coupled with operating margin and EPS results that will grow above the high end of our Q4 guidance ranges. These record results were driven by strong market demand for our industry-leading multiphysics portfolio and by continued positive customer and business momentum. 
Now let's turn to some of the key financial metrics that I'd like to highlight for the quarter and the year beginning with total revenue. We delivered $492.5 million in Q4, and  for the full year, we recognized a record $1.5 billion in total revenue, growing 19% in constant currency. Q4 ACV totaled $541 million with 78% of ACV in the quarter coming from recurring sources. Notably, this is our first quarter ever reporting over $0.5 billion in ACV. For 2019, our ACV totaled $1.46 billion, representing constant currency growth of 12% with recurring sources making up 77% of the total. We remind investors that we believe that our annual ACV is a key metric for gauging our operating performance over time. 
In the quarter, an increase in software lease license sales, combined with strong maintenance renewals, bolstered our deferred revenue and backlog total to $871 million, a 32% increase over last year's comparable balance. 
Moving on to profitability. In Q4, we continued to build on our solid performance throughout every quarter of 2019 with strong top line results that helped to drive a fourth quarter gross margin of 92% and an operating margin of 48%. 
For 2019, we finished the year with a gross margin of 91% and an operating margin of 45%. These results are evident that, first and foremost, we are committed to managing our business with discipline and, secondly, that we are successful in integrating tuck-in acquisitions into our business model while still delivering best-in-class margins. These strong margins helped to drive record fourth quarter and full year EPS of $2.24 and $6.58, both well above our guidance ranges. 
With respect to taxes, our effective tax rate in Q4 was 17% as compared to the 20% to 21% range that we had expected. The Q4 rate was favorably impacted by a $6.7 million benefit related to a December tax law change in a foreign jurisdiction. Please keep in mind that this nonrecurring benefit will impact year-over-year comparisons in 2020. 
Our cash flow from operations totaled $139 million for the fourth quarter and $500 million for 2019 and we closed the year with a total of $872 million in cash and short-term investments. Let me add that the acquisitions of LSTC and Dynardo  had a relatively insignificant impact on the results for the quarter, contributing $9 million of revenue and $7 million of ACV. 
Now let me turn to the topic of guidance. Before I get into the specific numbers, I would like to briefly comment on China, which accounted for just above 4% of our overall revenue in 2019. First, although the trade negotiations between the U.S. and China have somewhat improved with the completion of the Phase I deal, our full year guidance assumes that the U.S. sanctions on the China restricted entities announced in 2019 will not be lifted. We estimate that the sanctions resulted in approximately $20 million of both ACV and revenue primarily booked in the first half of 2019 that we have assumed will not be repeated in 2020. And second, the recent outbreak of the coronavirus is bringing new challenges to China and to other countries in the region. The outbreak could potentially delay some deals originally planned in the first half of 2020 to the second half of the year. This has an insignificant impact on our annual outlook and is factored into our Q1 guidance. 
Before moving to our outlook for 2020, as I have consistently communicated over the past several years, our focus will be on progress against our annual targets as opposed to short-term quarterly results. You should expect, as we do, variability in quarterly financial results because ASC 606 revenue recognition rules could affect both revenue and related growth numbers based on the number, timing, size and duration of multiyear leases. 
As I described in detail in our last call, in any given quarter or year, there can be a disconnect between the revenue and ACV metrics. In some quarters and years, one metric can be ahead of the other. But eventually, and often in the subsequent comparable quarter or year, the other metric must be ahead because the 2 metrics sum to the same number in the long term. In 2019, constant currency revenue growth of 19% disproportionately outpaced ACV growth of 12%, driven by large multiyear lease deals. In 2020, however, we expect constant currency ACV growth of 11% to 14% to outpace annual revenue growth of 8% to 12%. Note also that in both 2018 and in 2019, the second half of the year was stronger than the first, and Q4 was by far our largest quarter. We expect that this trend will continue in 2020. 
Going one level down, there are 3 reasons for why the second half will be stronger than the first. First is seasonality. The second half of the year, most notably the fourth quarter, continues to get seasonally stronger with a number of large multiyear lease deals in the pipeline. This is aligned with the timing of many of our customers' annual budgeting and spending cycles. Second is timing of specific deals. Q1 2019 saw a small number of large multiyear lease contracts that contributed significant revenue in that quarter. Naturally, these contracts will not renew this year and, thus, will not contribute significant revenue in this quarter. Even though we expect the total revenue contribution of our multiyear leases in 2020 to increase as compared to 2019, this timing of Q1 2019 deals, coupled with the seasonality of large deals, means that the first quarter's revenue from multiyear contracts will be lower than Q1 of 2019. Third, the combined effect of the China sanction and coronavirus, which I described earlier, delays first half revenue and further strengthens projected revenue growth in the second half of 2020. 
Let's move on to the details of our outlook. We are initiating our guidance for Q1 and  expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of $300 million to $320 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.75 to $0.88. For 2020, we expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of $1.64 billion to $1.7 billion or constant currency growth in the range of 8% to 12%, and EPS in the range of $6.19 to $6.71. Our ACV outlook for 2020 is a range of $1.605 billion to $1.650 billion. This represents constant currency ACV growth in the range of 11% to 14%. With respect to 2020 annual operating cash flow, our initial outlook in the range of $500 million to $530 million, which considers a full year of interest expense on our term loan. 
Looking ahead to Q1. We are expecting operating margins of 27.5% to 30%, which reflected of the lower revenue contribution in Q1 combined with a lower proportion of variable cost. And for the full year 2020, we expect margins in the range of 42% to 43%. This aligns with the target range of 42% to 44% that we communicated back in September 2019 at our Investor Day event. 
To close out from the topic of our outlook for 2020, let me just say that we have a strong pipeline, diversified business model and a high level of recurring revenues, all of which contribute to our confidence that 2020 will play out similar to the past 2 years. Further details around specific currency rates and other key assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q1 and 2020 are contained in the prepared remarks document. 
In summary, we delivered another quarter and year of record financial performance with strength across our key financial metrics. Our continued track record of delivering on our financial commitment gives us confidence that we will deliver another year of record financial performance in 2020. In addition, we will continue to invest in our business while we execute against our strategic priorities in support of delivering on our longer-term 2022 ambition. Operator, we will now open the phone line to take questions."

I think we have a very strong pipeline. Built into assumptions that there are a couple of headwinds, which perhaps might be relevant. One is we've assumed that currency is approximately up 1 point, so that's approximately $15 million of headwind, and that might be relevant to the conversation. And the other is, of course, is we're assuming from the China sanctions that there's a headwind from a growth perspective, and Maria mentioned that on the call as well, and that's approximately $20 million.

You talked about, if you could, the interplay as you see it between services, including, in particular, technical consulting, on the one hand, and our solver and non-solver businesses, but what is the connection there in terms of services as you see it as either a  leading indicator or coincidental indicator to support and enable the software business?"
24893,652626060,1923417,"ANSYS, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 27, 2020",2020-02-27,"Earnings Calls","ANSYS, Inc.","Executives","So if I understand the question about R&D, and I'll try to answer it as best as I can, and hopefully, this gets to the gist of your question, we -- as any sophisticated company with a broad portfolio of technologies, we rely on a combination of both organ",591,"So if I understand the question about R&D, and I'll try to answer it as best as I can, and hopefully, this gets to the gist of your question, we -- as any sophisticated company with a broad portfolio of technologies, we rely on a combination of both organic development, where we have a road map that we execute against. And in certain occasions, we rely on acquisitions, and the acquisitions could be because there's a technology that we've decided we need which might be better served by going out and buying -- by company, which has already developed that as opposed to developing ourselves. We have an amazingly engaged and capable R&D organization and we continue to drive innovation after innovation, and I gave you an example of some of the innovations in HFSS. And if you look at the R1 release you'll see a chapter and verse of all kinds of new features and capabilities that continue to enhance our products across a number of different dimensions. But at the same time, we believe that acquisitions are an important aspect, that there are a number of startup companies that have interesting ideas, there are other companies that perhaps maybe a little bit more established that have developed great technology like LSTC had. And we are able to bring them in and rapidly incorporate them into our R&D processes and our development processes. We have an internal mechanism to be able to share information. We have a technical conference, for example, where our R&D leaders from around the world and can get together and share information. There's a lot of collaboration. And you're seeing that in the results. I gave the example of RaptorX. You've seen the results in some of our optics technology where we announced  ANSYS -- which brought together some of the work that we had on our solid modeling on the space claims sides together with the capabilities and so on. You can see that in our autonomous offerings where we have brought together core technology that we've developed over the years as well as acquisitions that came in as well as technology that came in from acquisitions. You see that in our platform strategy, which includes capabilities that we've developed, as well as other things that we've acquired. So it's a complex equation, but I think that our team is incredibly sophisticated and we're able to deal with that complexity very well. So I think that's the first piece of the -- that's the first piece of your question. 
The second piece is, with respect to services. We have a -- we are not a services company, a professional services company. That is not our business model. We are a software business. And for us, while we do services -- services are fundamentally in support of driving software sales. Now we do have a small services organization that supports some of our larger opportunities. And especially when it's in a broad -- a new emerging area, we can certainly see an incremental set of requests for the services capabilities that we provide. That's not our business, and we work with service partners around the world who can add to the e-systems. So many of our large channel partners and others can add to the ecosystem to provide service delivery to our customers. This is obviously not an area where we are focusing on trying to significantly increase our share of the business. As I said, our business model is that of a software company."

So we successfully were able to close every single 1 of those and we know that we've got a strong pipeline of deals that are scheduled to close in Q4 of next year just because of the renewal cycle. They're lighter in Q1 just because of the ones that we closed this year that will not repeat. But we are very confident that based on everything that we know today, we've got a strong pipeline. We've got customers that are investing heavily in their own digital transformation to keep pace with market expectations. And so while it may appear on the surface that Q1's light, when you look at the full year and the fact that we're putting up double-digit ACV and revenue growth at the midpoint for the full year, we're very excited about the opportunity that we see ahead."

And the second, if you'll recall, we closed the LSTC acquisition right before we gave guidance in November. And about 100% of that business came through their channel. We were not able to engage with the channel during the diligence, and so as a result, what we discovered once we close that deal, that the forecasting methodologies that their channel used were not necessarily aligned with what a public company would do. And so as a result, that ended up -- the contributions from the acquisitions were a little bit less than we anticipated. So if you take the combination of the forecasting negative, which we have now fixed and have been resolved as we head into 2020 and  the impact currency, the 2 of those essentially would have brought us closer to the midpoint."

And so based upon that and what we're seeing in terms of our ability to move our business forward, we've taken a somewhat conservative.

The area where LTC is a lot of strength in automotive and crash testing. Crash testing, when I meant the more legacy areas I was talking about potentially a transition from electric to the internal combustion engine. And if you start to think about that transition, customers are spending more money on electric drivetrains and thinking about that change versus internal combustion engines. However, when you consider now the fact that you have, say, a battery inside a car, and as I've described in previous calls, the transition to an electric drivetrain and to a battery-operated car fundamentally changes the nature of the design, the chassis changes, weight assumptions change. There's a fundamental redesign taking place across the car in the aggregate. But that means that you have to rethink what it means for collision and response to collisions. And then, of course, the battery, you have to worry about battery explosions and battery fires and things of that nature. So you have to really rethink and spend a lot of effort understanding how collisions -- because collisions might happen. You have to make sure that the collisions are not going to be catastrophic. And that means there continues to be significant demand even in the new world of electric cars for the kind of work that we're doing, and I'm very excited about the opposition there in the marketplace. So that's with respect to the actual end market in automotive for LSTC. 
As far as the integration of the technology and the product is going, the integration is going really well. We are -- the technology is very consistent with what we expected. We were a long time reseller as well of the technology. So we certainly understood it before we did the acquisition it's consistent with what we expected, and it's a great team and they're great people. As far as the channel partners are concerned, we're working with those channel partners. They're integrating into the ANSYS ecosystem, and we're working with the channel partners. We're honoring those relationships and supporting those general partners because they have some really valuable customer relationships and incredible skills and capabilities that we want to maintain within the ANSYS ecosystem.

Virtually, we are able to do continue with telephone calls. We're able to continue working over the Internet. We can do webinars. We can do webcast. Customers have access to demo systems as they need to. All of that activity continues to take place. As I said, our colleagues in China -- and once again, I want to acknowledge our colleagues at China who've been working on the difficult circumstances for a while, our colleagues in China are able to continue to drive the business forward and they are actively working to do that. And so we feel like a lot of the spade work that we need is continuing to happen. We will continue to see -- we will continue to close business in Q1. And -- but we've modeled -- for the sake of being prudent, we've modeled the slippage of some business into the second half of the year. And that's, of course, already in the guidance."

Look, we see simulation is becoming increasingly important for a sector of the health care market. And while it's a relatively small vertical for us today, I think we're making significant progress there,",285,"Yes. So let me just try to take that for a second. Look, we see simulation is becoming increasingly important for a sector of the health care market. And while it's a relatively small vertical for us today, I think we're making significant progress there, especially in Q4. And in the physics, in physics that's based on the health care sector, specifically that we're focused on, which is the like device manufacturing medical devices and so on, we've been working the regulator of the FDA. We've been working with the EU. And we believe that the health care industry is heading more towards things like in silico trials and outcomes like personalized medicine and then physical space simulation will play an even more active role. And we've, frankly, been very active in these fields for a long, long time, maybe for the last decade. And we've been engaging globally with policymakers, with academics, with consortia to try to make sure that we can explain to the industry and bring the industry and the regulations along to the use of in silico trials and I think we've made significant progress. 
Now in Q4, specifically, as I said, we had several larger deals with medical device market leaders, specifically focusing on the use of simulation and leading to products that could be deployed more rapidly and products that could get regulatory approval more rapidly. So that translates into a very specific value proposition to the customers, which is they can get new product to market faster and at lower cost with greater probability through the regulation process. And so that's a low-hanging fruit for us, but we see all kinds of opportunities and that we're working towards."

It is going towards electrification. It is going towards electric systems. It is also going towards electric driving. It's also going towards autonomy. And while we may not necessarily see full autonomy in the short term, as we go on this journey to autonomy, we have improved safety systems. We have autonomy and limited circumstances and so forth. So that level of investment is an ongoing stream of investment that we see happening for multiple years, and we're excited about that. 
That being said, when you look at the full portfolio, I think that we have some tremendous strength in the automotive industry. Outside of these new areas that we've talked about, we talked briefly about crash. That's an area that we continue to be strong. That's obviously through the acquisition, and we continue to be strong in other areas with the portfolio that we've driven. Some other interesting areas like optics have also come into our portfolio through acquisitions. So we have a very strong footprint in the automotive industry today. We have good capabilities, both for the emerging areas, where there's a lot of R&D spend, as well as the more traditional areas. And we're very excited about our position."

24893,652626060,1923570,"ANSYS, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 27, 2020",2020-02-27,"Earnings Calls","ANSYS, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Annette, and good morning, everyone. Q4 was yet another exceptional quarter for ANSYS, capping a stellar year. In the fourth quarter, we delivered record revenue, earnings per share and operating cash flow. Let me focus on annual contract value",1844,"Thank you, Annette, and good morning, everyone. Q4 was yet another exceptional quarter for ANSYS, capping a stellar year. In the fourth quarter, we delivered record revenue, earnings per share and operating cash flow. Let me focus on annual contract value, or ACV, which we believe to be the best indicator of the underlying health of our business. 
Q4 ACV had well over $0.5 billion in the quarter for the first time in our history, represented growth of 13% in constant currency, which was particularly gratifying considering the strong baseline set in Q4 of 2018. For the full year of 2019, ACV grew a robust 12% in constant currency. As we look to 2020, we are guiding to over 12% growth in ACV in constant currency at the midpoint of our range. This gives us further confidence that we will achieve our goal of $2 billion in ACV by 2022 while maintaining our industry-leading margins in the 42% to 44% range. Maria will provide more detail in just a few minutes. 
Now let me provide insight into some of the growth drivers in the fourth quarter and for all of 2019. During Q4, 10 long-standing customers made 8-figure commitments, and nearly all of the deals over $1 million included offerings from at least 3 of our product lines. From a geographic perspective, we saw strength in all our major territories last year. While North America led with 26% revenue growth for the year, I'm delighted that revenue in Europe grew 29% in Q4 and 14% in 2019, both in constant currency. For the full year, Asia Pac revenue grew 15% in constant currency despite a modest 2% revenue growth in Q4, which was attributable to variations in deal timings. In Japan, we grew revenue 20% in Q4. 
From an industry standpoint, high-tech continues to be our largest sector, fueled by electronics and our semiconductor solutions and supported by a multiphysics portfolio. And as you will hear shortly, we are continuing to add new capabilities to our product offerings so our customers can keep driving innovation in this key industry. 
Moving to automotive. Other vendors have signaled weakness in the sector, perhaps because of their focus on legacy programs or their inability to pivot to emerging customer requirements. For ANSYS, however, automotive is an area of strength, in part because we have successfully broadened our offerings to address key growth drivers, namely solutions for autonomous and electric vehicles. We have seen repeated evidence of that success in electric vehicles, first with Volkswagen, which we have previously discussed; and now with Porsche. In Q4, we announced that Porsche Motorsport is using ANSYS to create an advanced electric powertrain for its electric racecar. After proving itself on the track, Porsche expects to use the car's electric powertrain to usher in a new era of commercial e-mobility vehicles. 
Moving to other industries. Although energy is going through a transition, we are seeing increased demand in that sector, including an extended collaboration with leading energy technology company, Baker Hughes. This long-time customer signed a new agreement in Q4 to use ANSYS simulation to drive down design and development costs, including additive manufacturing while sparking innovation. 
We continue to see success in aerospace and defense, driven by increased customer investment in North America. In fact, the aerospace and defense industry is responsible for 4 of our top deals in Q4. The complex product challenges facing aerospace and defense organizations require a true multiphysics approach, including solutions for electromagnetics, fluids and next-generation materials. 
For example, a leading North American gas turbine manufacturer signed an 8-figure deal in Q4 to shorten its design cycle using faster, more reliable and accurate combustion simulations. By deploying our Mosaic Meshing and enhanced workflows, this industry leader reduced preparation time from hours to minutes while getting more consistent and robust results twice as fast. By using ANSYS solutions, we expect this global leader to save millions of dollars a year in reduced labor and related costs. 
Another large aerospace company is also benefiting from our comprehensive multiphysics portfolio. This company faced a complex set of operating conditions that made identifying potential failure mechanisms a challenge. It is using our best-in-class electrical, thermal and mechanical products as well as our electronics reliability simulation solution from last year's acquisition of DfR to improve designs and to mitigate possible failures. This resulted in an 8-figure deal in Q4, and it demonstrates our ability to efficiently integrate new technologies into our selling motion. 
As you can see, our customers are benefiting from the formidable combination of ANSYS solutions across physics. This is a powerful endorsement of the strength of the full portfolio, and it is one that we believe other vendors cannot match. We continue to extend our product leadership across the entire portfolio with our recently launched ANSYS 2020 R1. R1 accelerates company's digital transformation by enhancing the interfaces, functionality, workflows and scalability of our products. R1 includes multiple products and technology advances. But in the interest of time, I'll focus on areas of particular interest to the high-tech industry. 
To make 5G a reality, the industry must develop new array and beam steering technologies that overcome millimeter wave impediments such as signal propagation at 28 gigahertz. To overcome those challenges, we continue to make major investments in ANSYS HFSS, our flagship product for designing and simulating high-frequency electronic products. R1 includes groundbreaking new phased array antenna technology that enables 5G designers to model complete antenna arrays, a task that was previously computationally prohibitive. 
Developing modern antennas is only one challenge in realizing 5G systems. Chip designers must develop new architectures to co-locate the chip and the antenna, which introduces topology constraints and electromagnetic cross-dock challenges that did not previously exist. We recently announced new product, ANSYS RaptorH to solve these challenges. With its unparalleled accuracy, its unmatched capacity and speed and its smooth design flow integration for advanced nanometer integrated circuit design, we believe RaptorH is the most feature-rich electromagnetic tool in the market for system-on-chip flows. RaptorH marries the best-in-class engines from ANSYS RaptorX, which we gained in last year's Helic acquisition, and ANSYS HFSS into a single-chip package system design environment.  Helic was acquired in Q1 2019, and this product shows the speed at which the ANSYS R&D teams can incorporate new technologies into our portfolio. 
Our platform strategy is based on an extensible, vendor-neutral architecture that works both on-premises and in the cloud. ANSYS Minerva is based on this architecture and empowers companies to solve the seemingly intractable problem of dealing with the enormous amount of data created by multiphysics simulations of complex systems, such as 5G components and equipment. In R1, Minerva's scalable traceability, configuration management and versioning system ensures reliability and connectivity of simulation data to drive collaboration and insights across the product life cycle and across departmental silos. That traceability is critical to companies like Eaton Corporation that rely on Minerva to streamline the user experience when designing and manufacturing parts using additive manufacturing and other processes. 
These innovations are empowering our customers to solve some of their most challenging product problems. Our ongoing commitment to improving our best-in-class solutions is further widening the technology gap between us and our competitors. That gap is certainly evident with ANSYS Discovery Live, where we have significantly broadened structural use cases and expanded generative design capabilities while adding a GPU-based, steady-state computational fluid dynamic solver. This breakthrough enables design engineers to predict air flow and heat removal at rates 100 times faster than the previous GPU solver within Discovery Live. One customer told us that they reduced component design time from 3 months to less than 2 weeks. 
Q4 marked the first large renewals for the Discovery business, and we are happy to see our early adopters expand their commitment to Discovery. On its most recent earnings call, our strategic partner, PTC, announced that it was also seeing a ramp-up of adoption in average deal size with its Creo simulation live product, which incorporates Discovery Live. As I mentioned previously, we expect the near-term financial impact of Discovery Live to be modest, but we see a strong long-term opportunity. 
Over the course of Q4, we also expanded our relationships with industry leaders, Autodesk, Microsoft and Rockwell Automation. With Autodesk, we built on our previously announced automotive workflow between our lighting simulation solution, ANSYS SPEOS and Autodesk VRED. Our new connection between ANSYS mechanical and Autodesk Fusion will drive revolutionary design and engineering agility for our customers, helping them expedite products to market. 
Our partnership with Microsoft also expanded, growing beyond our initial collaboration where we empowered customers to access high-performance computing on demand via ANSYS Cloud, which runs on Microsoft Azure. In Q4, we grew our collaboration to make it easier for customers to adopt and deploy Digital Twins. Through our expanded partnership, manufacturers that model and connect ANSYS using Azure Digital Twins can optimize asset production and operations using ANSYS Twin Builder. That enables users to slash product maintenance costs and speed, high-quality products to market. 
Similarly, with Rockwell Automation, we're enabling customers to benefit by creating a digital twin of their full manufacturing process to create and test virtual what-if scenarios. In doing so, industrial companies can adapt to market demands with more agility and minimize risk. 
We are also continuing to expand the market for simulation by reaching future users. Over 3,000 universities use our technology for research and teaching, including students at Carnegie Mellon University, who are building and testing their own simulations in the newly opened ANSYS Hall. More than 150,000 people have enrolled in Cornell University's massive online course in simulation based on ANSYS. And I'm pleased to announce that we have seen over 1 million downloads of our student products. 
I'd like to take a moment now to recognize my colleagues at ANSYS. As you know, the coronavirus is a rapidly evolving situation. Our #1 priority remains, of course, the safety and the well-being of our employees and their families around the world. And I am humbled and grateful for the commitment that our colleagues in China and elsewhere are showing as they continue to drive business execution in difficult circumstances. 
Switching to our commitment to environmental, social and governance initiatives for just a moment. I'm proud that Newsweek recently named us to its 2020 list of America's Most Responsible Companies. And I'm delighted that 2020 Women on Board recognized ANSYS as a winning ""W"" Company for 2019 with at least 20% women on our Board of Directors. 
To summarize, building on double-digit ACV growth in 2018, 2019 was a record-breaking year for ANSYS. These results, combined with our 2020 forecast of double-digit ACV growth and our continued investment in our market-leading products, give us further confidence that we will achieve our goal of $2 billion in ACV by 2022. So you can understand why I'm excited for 2020 and beyond. As I have told you before, the future for ANSYS is brighter than ever. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Maria. Maria?"

Let me start off by saying that, financially, 2019 was our strongest year ever, and we are very encouraged about 2020, given the momentum in our business. For the full year of 2019, we delivered either above the midpoint or well above the high end of the range on our initial financial guidance, and we raised full year guidance 3x throughout the course of the year. Even more exciting is that we closed the year with a very strong fourth quarter, which included record Q4 results across all of our key financial metrics. This is quite a testament to both our resilient business model and our team's ability to execute, particularly when you consider the very strong comparables for both Q4 and the full year 2018. 
Now I'd like to take a few minutes to provide some additional color on our financial performance, and then I will close with an update on our outlook and key assumptions for Q1 and 2020. And consistent with our standard practice, my comments will be in terms of non-GAAP unless I state otherwise. 
For the fourth quarter, we delivered constant currency revenue growth of 18% and ACV growth of 13%, coupled with operating margin and EPS results that will grow above the high end of our Q4 guidance ranges. These record results were driven by strong market demand for our industry-leading multiphysics portfolio and by continued positive customer and business momentum. 
Now let's turn to some of the key financial metrics that I'd like to highlight for the quarter and the year, beginning with total revenue. We delivered $492.5 million in Q4, and for the full year, we recognized a record $1.5 billion in total revenue, growing 19% in constant currency. Q4 ACV totaled $541 million with 78% of ACV in the quarter coming from recurring sources. Notably, this is our first quarter ever reporting over $0.5 billion in ACV. For 2019, our ACV totaled $1.46 billion, representing constant currency growth of 12% with recurring sources making up 77% of the total. We remind investors that we believe that our annual ACV is a key metric for gauging our operating performance over time. 
In the quarter, an increase in software lease license sales, combined with strong maintenance renewals, bolstered our deferred revenue and backlog total to $871 million, a 32% increase over last year's comparable balance. 
Moving on to profitability. In Q4, we continued to build on our solid performance throughout every quarter of 2019 with strong top line results that helped to drive a fourth quarter gross margin of 92% and an operating margin of 48%. 
For 2019, we finished the year with a gross margin of 91% and an operating margin of 45%. These results are evident that, first and foremost, we are committed to managing our business with discipline and, secondly, that we are successful in integrating tuck-in acquisitions into our business model while still delivering best-in-class margins. These strong margins helped to drive record fourth quarter and full year EPS of $2.24 and $6.58, both well above our guidance ranges. 
With respect to taxes, our effective tax rate in Q4 was 17% as compared to the 20% to 21% range that we had expected. The Q4 rate was favorably impacted by a $6.7 million benefit related to a December tax law change in a foreign jurisdiction. Please keep in mind that this nonrecurring benefit will impact year-over-year comparisons in 2020. 
Our cash flow from operations totaled $139 million for the fourth quarter and $500 million for 2019, and we closed the year with a total of $872 million in cash and short-term investments. Let me add that the acquisitions of LSTC and Dynardo  had a relatively insignificant impact on the results for the quarter, contributing $9 million of revenue and $7 million of ACV. 
Now let me turn to the topic of guidance. Before I get into the specific numbers, I would like to briefly comment on China, which accounted for just above 4% of our overall revenue in 2019. First, although the trade negotiations between the U.S. and China have somewhat improved with the completion of the Phase I deal, our full year guidance assumes that the U.S. sanctions on the China restricted entities announced in 2019 will not be lifted. We estimate that the sanctions resulted in approximately $20 million of both ACV and revenue primarily booked in the first half of 2019 that we have assumed will not be repeated in 2020. Second, the recent outbreak of the coronavirus is bringing new challenges to China and to other countries in the region. The outbreak could potentially delay some deals originally planned in the first half of 2020 to the second half of the year. This has an insignificant impact on our annual outlook and is factored into our Q1 guidance. 
Before moving to our outlook for 2020, as I have consistently communicated over the past several years, our focus will be on progress against our annual targets as opposed to short-term quarterly results. You should expect, as we do, variability in quarterly financial results because ASC 606 revenue recognition rules could affect both revenue and related growth numbers based on the number, timing, size and duration of multiyear leases. 
As I described in detail in our last call, in any given quarter or year, there can be a disconnect between the revenue and ACV metrics. In some quarters and years, one metric can be ahead of the other. But eventually and often in the subsequent comparable quarter or year, the other metric must be ahead because the 2 metrics sum to the same number in the long term. In 2019, constant currency revenue growth of 19% disproportionately outpaced ACV growth of 12%, driven by large multiyear lease deals. In 2020, however, we expect constant currency ACV growth of 11% to 14% to outpace annual revenue growth of 8% to 12%. Note also that in both 2018 and in 2019, the second half of the year was stronger than the first, and Q4 was by far our largest quarter. We expect that this trend will continue in 2020. 
Going one level down, there are 3 reasons for why the second half will be stronger than the first. First is seasonality. The second half of the year, most notably the fourth quarter, continues to get seasonally stronger with a number of large multiyear lease deals in the pipeline. This is aligned with the timing of many of our customers' annual budgeting and spending cycles. Second is timing of specific deals. Q1 2019 saw a small number of large multiyear lease contracts that contributed significant revenue in that quarter. Naturally, these contracts will not renew this year and, thus, will not contribute significant revenue in this quarter. Even though we expect the total revenue contribution of our multiyear leases in 2020 to increase as compared to 2019, this timing of Q1 2019 deals, coupled with the seasonality of large deals, means that the first quarter's revenue from multiyear contracts will be lower than Q1 of 2019. Third, the combined effect of the China sanction and coronavirus, which I described earlier, delays first half revenue and further strengthens projected revenue growth in the second half of 2020. 
Let's move on to the details of our outlook. We are initiating our guidance for Q1 and expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of $300 million to $320 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.75 to $0.88. For 2020, we expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of $1.64 billion to $1.7 billion or constant currency growth in the range of 8% to 12% and EPS in the range of $6.19 to $6.71. Our ACV outlook for 2020 is a range of $1.605 billion to $1.650 billion. This represents constant currency ACV growth in the range of 11% to 14%. With respect to 2020 annual operating cash flow, our initial outlook in the range of $500 million to $530 million, which considers a full year of interest expense on our term loan. 
Looking ahead to Q1. We are expecting operating margins of 27.5% to 30%, which are reflected on the lower revenue contribution in Q1 combined with a lower proportion of variable cost. And for the full year 2020, we expect margins in the range of 42% to 43%. This aligns with the target range of 42% to 44% that we communicated back in September 2019 at our Investor Day event. 
To close out from the topic of our outlook for 2020, let me just say that we have a strong pipeline, diversified business model and a high level of recurring revenues, all of which contribute to our confidence that 2020 will play out similar to the past 2 years. Further details around specific currency rates and other key assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q1 and 2020 are contained in the prepared remarks document. 
In summary, we delivered another quarter and year of record financial performance with strength across our key financial metrics. Our continued track record of delivering on our financial commitment gives us confidence that we will deliver another year of record financial performance in 2020. In addition, we will continue to invest in our business while we execute against our strategic priorities in support of delivering on our longer-term 2022 ambition.

I think we have a very strong pipeline. 
Built into assumptions that there are a couple of headwinds, which perhaps might be relevant. One is we've assumed that currency is approximately a point, so that's approximately $15 million of a headwind, and that might be relevant to the conversation. And the other is, of course, is we're assuming from the China sanctions that there's a headwind from a growth perspective, and Maria mentioned that on the call as well, and that's approximately $20 million.

The stronger U.S. dollar. The expectation that we'll have increased tax payments in 2020 related to our strong profitability last year. And one other nuance that you may or may not be aware of that relates to another accounting change, there is a new accounting standard that we adopted and that others will adopt that impacts the treatment of certain items that move from -- historically were treated as investing items that now move into operating, and so those will also have a negative impact relative to the cash flows in 2020. So the combination of all of those elements is what leads us to the $500 million to $530 million that we currently are projecting."

I've asked this question of other companies like Adobe, for example, that have large complex portfolios, that have also been acquisitive. I'd be curious to understand how you, particularly for multiphysics and the non-solver business, have perhaps made some changes, if any, to R&D. 
And then secondly, also for you.

And in certain occasions, we rely on acquisitions, and the acquisitions could be because there's a technology that we've decided we need, which might be better served by going out and buying a company, which has already developed that as opposed to developing ourselves. 
We have an amazingly engaged and capable R&D organization, and we continue to drive innovation after innovation, and I gave you an example of some of the innovations in HFSS. And if you look at the R1 release, you'll see a chapter and verse of all kinds of new features and capabilities that continue to enhance our products across a number of different dimensions. 
But at the same time, we believe that acquisitions are an important aspect, that there are a number of startup companies that have interesting ideas. There are other companies that perhaps maybe a little bit more established that have developed great technology like LSTC had. And we are able to bring them in and rapidly incorporate them into our R&D processes and our development processes. We have an internal mechanism to be able to share information. We have a technical conference, for example, where our R&D leaders from around the world and technical leaders can come get together and share information. There's a lot of collaboration. And you're seeing that in the results. I gave the example of RaptorX. You've seen the results in some of our optics technology where we announced  ANSYS SPEOS, which brought together some of the work that we had on solid modeling, on the SpaceClaim side together with the SPEOS capabilities and so on. You can see that in our autonomous offerings, where we have brought together core technology that we've developed over the years as well as acquisitions that came in -- as well as technology that came in from acquisitions. You see that in our platform strategy, which includes capabilities that we've developed as well as other things that we've acquired. So it's a complex equation, but I think that our team is incredibly sophisticated, and we're able to deal with that complexity very well. So I think that's the first piece of the -- that's the first piece of your question. 
The second piece is with respect to services. We have a -- we are not a services company, a professional services company. That is not our business model. We're a software business. And for us, while we do services, services are fundamentally in support of driving software sales. Now we do have a small services organization that supports some of our larger opportunities. And especially when it's in a broad -- a new emerging area, we can certainly see an incremental set of requests for the services capabilities that we provide. That's not our business, and we work with service partners around the world who can add to the ecosystem. So many of our large channel partners and others can add to the ecosystem to provide service delivery to our customers. This is obviously not an area where we are focusing on trying to significantly increase our share of the business. As I said, our business model is that of a software company."

As far as the first question in terms of the Discovery business in the aggregate, I mean I think that the technology is incredible, and we're going after a market opportunity that continues to evolve and develop, and that's one of the reasons why we've been incredibly cautious about how we imagine the financial impact of this business is going to be. And I think we've been very consistent in saying that this is going to be a relatively modest piece of our business for a long time, and that's in part driven by the fact that the audience that we're going after is a relatively conservative audience. And adoption of these kinds of technologies, unlike the consumer technology, adoption takes time. We continue to drive the new innovation and the innovations that we -- I described some innovations before, I don't want to go through them again, but we continue to drive new innovations and new capabilities and that continues to broaden and strengthen our capability in the market. So I'm excited about where we are. I believe we've made great progress. We have seen progress with customers who have come through the enterprise renewal process. So it wasn't like they were just buying it to evaluate it. They're buying it and they're rebuying it. So that's a really positive sign, and we continue to see that as a tailwind for the business as we go forward."

The area where LSTC has a lot of strength in automotive is in crash testing. Crash testing, when I meant the more legacy areas, I was talking about potentially a transition from electric to the internal combustion engine. And if you start to think about that transition, customers are spending more money on electric drivetrains and thinking about that change versus internal combustion engines. 
However, when you consider now the fact that you have, say, a battery inside a car, and as I've described in previous calls, the transition to an electric drivetrain and to a battery-operated car fundamentally changes the nature of the design. The chassis changes. Weight assumptions change. There's a fundamental redesign taking place across the car in the aggregate. But that means that you have to rethink what it means for collision and response to collisions. And then, of course, the battery, you have to worry about battery explosions and battery fires and things of that nature. So you have to really rethink and spend a lot of effort understanding how collisions -- because collisions might happen. You have to make sure that the collisions are not going to be catastrophic, and that means there continues to be significant demand even in the new world of electric cars for the kind of work that we're doing, and I'm very excited about the opposition there in the marketplace. So that's with respect to the actual end market in automotive for LSTC. 
As far as the integration of the technology and the product is going, the integration is going really well. We are -- the technology is very consistent with what we expected. We were a long-time reseller as well of the technology, so we certainly understood it before we did the acquisition. It's consistent with what we expected, and it's a great team, and they're great people. 
As far as the channel partners are concerned, we're working with those channel partners. They're integrating into the ANSYS ecosystem, and we're working with the channel partners. We're honoring those relationships and supporting those channel partners because they have some really valuable customer relationships and incredible skills and capabilities that we want to maintain within the ANSYS ecosystem. So we want those channel partners to grow and thrive within the ANSYS ecosystem. And the good news is that we have a vibrant channel relationship already, and those channel partners can grow inside, and we are very supportive of them continuing to be able to grow their business as being part of the broader ANSYS family."

Look, we see simulation is becoming increasingly important for a sector of the health care market. And while it's a relatively small vertical for us today, I think we're making significant progress there, especially in Q4. And in the physics, in physics that's based on the health care sector, specifically that we're focused on, which is the like device manufacturing medical devices and so on, we've been working with the regulator of the FDA. We've been working with the EU. And we believe that the health care industry is heading more towards things like in silico trials and outcomes like personalized medicine, and then physics space simulation will play an even more active role. And we've, frankly, been very active in this field for a long, long time, maybe for the last decade. And we've been engaging globally with policymakers, with academics, with consortia to try to make sure that we can explain to the industry and bring the industry and the regulations along to the use of in silico trials, and I think we've made significant progress. 
Now in Q4 specifically, as I said, we had several larger deals with medical device market leaders, specifically focusing on the use of simulation and leading to products that could be deployed more rapidly and products that could get regulatory approval more rapidly. So that translates into a very specific value proposition to the customers, which is they can get new product to market faster and at lower cost with greater probability through the regulation process. And so that's a low-hanging fruit for us, but we see all kinds of opportunity in the healthcare space that we're working towards."

Q4 was yet another exceptional quarter for ANSYS, capping a stellar year. In the fourth quarter, we delivered record revenue, earnings per share and operating cash flow. Let me focus on annual contract value",1843,"Thank you, Annette, and good morning, everyone. Q4 was yet another exceptional quarter for ANSYS, capping a stellar year. In the fourth quarter, we delivered record revenue, earnings per share and operating cash flow. Let me focus on annual contract value, or ACV, which we believe to be the best indicator of the underlying health of our business.
Q4 ACV at well over $0.5 billion in the quarter for the first time in our history, represented growth of 13% in constant currency, which was particularly gratifying considering the strong baseline set in Q4 of 2018. For the full year of 2019, ACV grew a robust 12% in constant currency. As we look to 2020, we are guiding to over 12% growth in ACV in constant currency at the midpoint of our range. This gives us further confidence that we will achieve our goal of $2 billion in ACV by 2022, while maintaining our industry-leading margins in the 42% to 44% range. Maria will provide more detail in just a few minutes. 
Now let me provide insight into some of the growth drivers in the fourth quarter and for all of 2019. During Q4, 10 long-standing customers made 8-figure commitments, and nearly all of the deals over $1 million included offerings from at least 3 of our product lines. From a geographic perspective, we saw strength in all our major territories last year. While North America led with 26% revenue growth for the year, I'm delighted that revenue in Europe grew 29% in Q4 and 14% in 2019, both in constant currency. For the full year, Asia Pac revenue grew 15% in constant currency despite a modest 2% revenue growth in Q4, which was attributable to variations in deal timings. In Japan, we grew revenue 20% in Q4. 
From an industry standpoint, high-tech continues to be our largest sector, fueled by electronics and our semiconductor solutions and supported by a multiphysics portfolio. And as you will hear shortly, we are continuing to add new capabilities to our product offerings so our customers can keep driving innovation in this key industry. 
Moving to automotive. Other vendors have signaled weakness in the sector, perhaps, because of their focus on legacy programs or their inability to pivot to emerging customer requirements. For ANSYS, however, automotive is an area of strength, in part because we have successfully broadened our offerings to address key growth drivers, namely solutions for autonomous and electric vehicles. We have seen repeated evidence of that success in electric vehicles: first with Volkswagen, which we have previously discussed; and now with Porsche. In Q4, we announced that Porsche Motorsport is using ANSYS to create an advanced electric powertrain for its electric racecar. After proving itself on the track, Porsche expects to use the car's electric powertrain to usher in a new era of commercial e-mobility vehicles.
Moving to other industries. Although energy is going through a transition, we are seeing increased demand in that sector, including an extended collaboration with leading energy technology company, Baker Hughes. This long-time customer signed a new agreement in Q4 to use ANSYS simulation to drive down design and development costs, including additive manufacturing while sparking innovation.
We continue to see success in aerospace and defense, driven by increased customer investment in North America. In fact, the aerospace and defense industry is responsible for 4 of our top deals in Q4. The complex product challenges facing aerospace and defense organizations require a true multiphysics approach, including solutions for electromagnetics, fluids and next-generation materials.
For example, a leading North American gas turbine manufacturer signed an 8-figure deal in Q4 to shorten its design cycle using faster, more reliable and accurate combustion simulations. By deploying our Mosaic Meshing and enhanced workflows, this industry leader reduced preparation time from hours to minutes while getting more consistent and robust results twice as fast. By using ANSYS solutions, we expect this global leader to save millions of dollars a year in reduced labor and related costs. 
Another large aerospace company is also benefiting from our comprehensive multiphysics portfolio. This company faced a complex set of operating conditions that made identifying potential failure mechanisms a challenge. It is using our best-in-class electrical, thermal and mechanical products as well as our electronics reliability simulation solution from last year's acquisition of DfR to improve designs and to mitigate possible failures. This resulted in an 8-figure deal in Q4, and it demonstrates our ability to efficiently integrate new technologies into our selling motion. 
As you can see, our customers are benefiting from the formidable combination of ANSYS solutions across physics. This is a powerful endorsement of the strength of the full portfolio, and it is one that we believe other vendors cannot match. We continue to extend our product leadership across the entire portfolio with our recently launched ANSYS 2020 R1. R1 accelerates company's digital transformation by enhancing the interfaces, functionality, workflows and scalability of our products. R1 includes multiple product and technology advances. But in the interest of time, I'll focus on areas of particular interest to the high-tech industry. 
To make 5G a reality, the industry must develop new array and beam steering technologies that overcome millimeter wave impediments such as signal propagation at 28 gigahertz. To overcome those challenges, we continue to make major investments in ANSYS HFSS, our flagship product for designing and simulating high-frequency electronic products. R1 includes groundbreaking new phased array antenna technology that enables 5G designers to model complete antenna arrays, a task that was previously computationally prohibitive.
Developing modern antennas is only one challenge in realizing 5G systems. Chip designers must develop new architectures to co-locate the chip and the antenna, which introduces topology constraints and electromagnetic cross-dock challenges that did not previously exist. We recently announced new product, ANSYS RaptorH to solve these challenges. With its unparalleled accuracy, its unmatched capacity and speed and its smooth design flow integration for advanced nanometer integrated circuit design, we believe RaptorH is the most feature-rich electromagnetic tool in the market for system-on-chip flows. RaptorH marries the best-in-class engines from ANSYS RaptorX, which we gained in last year's Helic acquisition, and ANSYS HFSS into a single-chip package system design environment. Helic was acquired in Q1 2019, and this product shows the speed at which the ANSYS R&D teams can incorporate new technologies into our portfolio. 
Our platform strategy is based on an extensible, vendor-neutral architecture that works both on-premises and in the cloud. ANSYS Minerva is based on this architecture and empowers companies to solve the seemingly intractable problem of dealing with the enormous amount of data created by multiphysics simulations of complex systems, such as 5G components and equipment. In R1, Minerva's scalable traceability, configuration management and versioning system ensures reliability and connectivity of simulation data to drive collaboration and insights across the product life cycle and across departmental silos. That traceability is critical to companies like Eaton Corporation that rely on Minerva to streamline the user experience when designing and manufacturing parts using additive manufacturing and other processes. 
These innovations are empowering our customers to solve some of their most challenging product problems. Our ongoing commitment to improving our best-in-class solutions is further widening the technology gap between us and our competitors. That gap is certainly evident with ANSYS Discovery Live, where we have significantly broadened structural use cases and expanded generative design capabilities while adding a GPU-based, steady-state computational fluid dynamic solver. This breakthrough enables design engineers to predict air flow and heat removal at rates 100x faster than the previous GPU solver within Discovery Live. One customer told us that they reduced component design time from 3 months to less than 2 weeks. 
Q4 marked the first large renewals for the Discovery business, and we are happy to see our early adopters expand their commitment to Discovery. On its most recent earnings call, our strategic partner, PTC, announced that it was also seeing a ramp-up of adoption in average deal size with its Creo Simulation Live product, which incorporates Discovery Live. As I mentioned previously, we expect the near-term financial impact of Discovery Live to be modest, but we see a strong long-term opportunity. 
Over the course of Q4, we also expanded our relationships with industry leaders, Autodesk, Microsoft and Rockwell Automation. With Autodesk, we built on our previously announced automotive workflow between our lighting simulation solution, ANSYS SPEOS and Autodesk VRED. Our new connection between ANSYS mechanical and Autodesk Fusion will drive revolutionary design and engineering agility for our customers, helping them expedite products to market. 
Our partnership with Microsoft also expanded, growing beyond our initial collaboration where we empowered customers to access high-performance computing on demand via ANSYS Cloud, which runs on Microsoft Azure. In Q4, we grew our collaboration to make it easier for customers to adopt and deploy Digital Twins. Through our expanded partnership, manufacturers that model and connect ANSYS using Azure Digital Twins can optimize asset production and operations using ANSYS Twin Builder. That enables users to slash product maintenance costs and speed high-quality products to market. 
Similarly, with Rockwell Automation, we're enabling customers to benefit by creating a digital twin of their full manufacturing process to create and test virtual what-if scenarios. In doing so, industrial companies can adapt to market demands with more agility and minimize risk. 
We are also continuing to expand the market for simulation by reaching future users. Over 3,000 universities use our technology for research and teaching, including students at Carnegie Mellon University, who are building and testing their own simulations in the newly opened ANSYS Hall. More than 150,000 people have enrolled in Cornell University's massive online course in simulation based on ANSYS. And I'm pleased to announce that we have seen over 1 million downloads of our student products.
I'd like to take a moment now to recognize my colleagues at ANSYS. As you know, the coronavirus is a rapidly evolving situation. Our #1 priority remains, of course, the safety and the well-being of our employees and their families around the world. And I am humbled and grateful for the commitment that our colleagues in China and elsewhere are showing as they continue to drive business execution in difficult circumstances. 
Switching to our commitment to environmental, social and governance initiatives for just a moment. I'm proud that Newsweek recently named us to its 2020 list of America's Most Responsible Companies. And I'm delighted that 2020 Women on Board recognized ANSYS as a winning ""W"" Company for 2019 with at least 20% women on our Board of Directors. 
To summarize, building on double-digit ACV growth in 2018, 2019 was a record-breaking year for ANSYS. These results, combined with our 2020 forecast of double-digit ACV growth and our continued investment in our market-leading products, give us further confidence that we will achieve our goal of $2 billion in ACV by 2022. So you can understand why I'm excited for 2020 and beyond. As I have told you before, the future for ANSYS is brighter than ever. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Maria. Maria?"

Let me start off by saying that, financially, 2019 was our strongest year ever, and we are very encouraged about 2020, given the momentum in our business. For the full year of 2019, we delivered either above the midpoint or well above the high end of the range on our initial financial guidance, and we raised full year guidance 3x throughout the course of the year. Even more exciting is that we closed the year with a very strong fourth quarter, which included record Q4 results across all of our key financial metrics. This is quite a testament to both our resilient business model and our team's ability to execute, particularly when you consider the very strong comparables for both Q4 and the full year 2018. 
Now I'd like to take a few minutes to provide some additional color on our financial performance, and then I will close with an update on our outlook and key assumptions for Q1 and 2020. And consistent with our standard practice, my comments will be in terms of non-GAAP unless I state otherwise. 
For the fourth quarter, we delivered constant currency revenue growth of 18% and ACV growth of 13%, coupled with operating margin and EPS results that will grow above the high end of our Q4 guidance ranges. These record results were driven by strong market demand for our industry-leading multiphysics portfolio and by continued positive customer and business momentum. 
Now let's turn to some of the key financial metrics that I'd like to highlight for the quarter and the year, beginning with total revenue. We delivered $492.5 million in Q4, and for the full year, we recognized a record $1.5 billion in total revenue, growing 19% in constant currency. Q4 ACV totaled $541 million with 78% of ACV in the quarter coming from recurring sources. Notably, this is our first quarter ever reporting over $0.5 billion in ACV. For 2019, our ACV totaled $1.46 billion, representing constant currency growth of 12% with recurring sources making up 77% of the total. We remind investors that we believe that our annual ACV is a key metric for gauging our operating performance over time. 
In the quarter, an increase in software lease license sales, combined with strong maintenance renewals, bolstered our deferred revenue and backlog total to $871 million, a 32% increase over last year's comparable balance. 
Moving on to profitability. In Q4, we continued to build on our solid performance throughout every quarter of 2019 with strong top line results that helped to drive a fourth quarter gross margin of 92% and an operating margin of 48%. 
For 2019, we finished the year with a gross margin of 91% and an operating margin of 45%. These results are evident that, first and foremost, we are committed to managing our business with discipline and, secondly, that we are successful in integrating tuck-in acquisitions into our business model while still delivering best-in-class margins. These strong margins helped to drive record fourth quarter and full year EPS of $2.24 and $6.58, both well above our guidance ranges. 
With respect to taxes, our effective tax rate in Q4 was 17% as compared to the 20% to 21% range that we had expected. The Q4 rate was favorably impacted by a $6.7 million benefit related to a December tax law change in a foreign jurisdiction. Please keep in mind that this nonrecurring benefit will impact year-over-year comparisons in 2020. 
Our cash flow from operations totaled $139 million for the fourth quarter and $500 million for 2019, and we closed the year with a total of $872 million in cash and short-term investments. Let me add that the acquisitions of LSTC and Dynardo had a relatively insignificant impact on the results for the quarter, contributing $9 million of revenue and $7 million of ACV. 
Now let me turn to the topic of guidance. Before I get into the specific numbers, I would like to briefly comment on China, which accounted for just above 4% of our overall revenue in 2019. First, although the trade negotiations between the U.S. and China have somewhat improved with the completion of the Phase I deal, our full year guidance assumes that the U.S. sanctions on the China-restricted entities announced in 2019 will not be lifted. We estimate that the sanctions resulted in approximately $20 million of both ACV and revenue primarily booked in the first half of 2019 that we have assumed will not be repeated in 2020. Second, the recent outbreak of the coronavirus is bringing new challenges to China and to other countries in the region. The outbreak could potentially delay some deals originally planned in the first half of 2020 to the second half of the year. This has an insignificant impact on our annual outlook and is factored into our Q1 guidance. 
Before moving to our outlook for 2020, as I have consistently communicated over the past several years, our focus will be on progress against our annual targets as opposed to short-term quarterly results. You should expect, as we do, variability in quarterly financial results because ASC 606 revenue recognition rules could affect both revenue and related growth numbers based on the number, timing, size and duration of multiyear leases.
As I described in detail in our last call, in any given quarter or year, there can be a disconnect between the revenue and ACV metrics. In some quarters and years, one metric can be ahead of the other. But eventually and often in the subsequent comparable quarter or year, the other metric must be ahead because the 2 metrics sum to the same number in the long term. In 2019, constant currency revenue growth of 19% disproportionately outpaced ACV growth of 12%, driven by large multiyear lease deals. In 2020, however, we expect constant currency ACV growth of 11% to 14% to outpace annual revenue growth of 8% to 12%. Note also that in both 2018 and in 2019, the second half of the year was stronger than the first, and Q4 was by far our largest quarter. We expect that this trend will continue in 2020. 
Going one level down, there are 3 reasons for why the second half will be stronger than the first. First is seasonality. The second half of the year, most notably the fourth quarter, continues to get seasonally stronger with a number of large multiyear lease deals in the pipeline. This is aligned with the timing of many of our customers' annual budgeting and spending cycles. Second is timing of specific deals. Q1 2019 saw a small number of large multiyear lease contracts that contributed significant revenue in that quarter. Naturally, these contracts will not renew this year and, thus, will not contribute significant revenue in this quarter. Even though we expect the total revenue contribution of our multiyear leases in 2020 to increase as compared to 2019, this timing of Q1 2019 deals, coupled with the seasonality of large deals, means that the first quarter's revenue from multiyear contracts will be lower than Q1 of 2019. Third, the combined effect of the China sanction and coronavirus, which I described earlier, delays first half revenue and further strengthens projected revenue growth in the second half of 2020. 
Let's move on to the details of our outlook. We are initiating our guidance for Q1 and expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of $300 million to $320 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.75 to $0.88. For 2020, we expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of $1.64 billion to $1.7 billion or constant currency growth in the range of 8% to 12% and EPS in the range of $6.19 to $6.71. Our ACV outlook for 2020 is a range of $1.605 billion to $1.650 billion. This represents constant currency ACV growth in the range of 11% to 14%. With respect to 2020 annual operating cash flow, our initial outlook in the range of $500 million to $530 million, which considers a full year of interest expense on our term loan. 
Looking ahead to Q1. We are expecting operating margins of 27.5% to 30%, which are reflected on the lower revenue contribution in Q1 combined with a lower proportion of variable cost. And for the full year 2020, we expect margins in the range of 42% to 43%. This aligns with the target range of 42% to 44% that we communicated back in September 2019 at our Investor Day event. 
To close out from the topic of our outlook for 2020, let me just say that we have a strong pipeline, diversified business model and a high level of recurring revenues, all of which contribute to our confidence that 2020 will play out similar to the past 2 years. Further details around specific currency rates and other key assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q1 and 2020 are contained in the prepared remarks document. 
In summary, we delivered another quarter and year of record financial performance with strength across our key financial metrics. Our continued track record of delivering on our financial commitment gives us confidence that we will deliver another year of record financial performance in 2020. In addition, we will continue to invest in our business while we execute against our strategic priorities in support of delivering on our longer-term 2022 ambition.

I think we have a very strong pipeline. 
Built into assumptions that there are a couple of headwinds, which perhaps might be relevant. One is we've assumed that currency is approximately a point, so that's approximately $15 million of a headwind, and that might be relevant to the conversation. And the other is, of course, is we're assuming from the China sanctions that there's a headwind from a growth perspective, and Maria mentioned that on the call as well, and that's approximately $20 million.

The question then for that is, could you talk about how you have evolved or may yet have to evolve your internal development processes, R&D management and the like? I've asked this question of other companies like Adobe, for example, that have large complex portfolios, that have also been acquisitive. I'd be curious to understand how you, particularly for multiphysics and the non-solver business, have perhaps made some changes, if any, to R&D. 
And then secondly, also for you. Talk about, if you could, the interplay, as you see it, between services, including, in particular technical consulting on the one hand, and your solver and non-solver businesses. What is the connection there in terms of services as you see it as either a leading indicator or coincidental indicator to support and enable the software business?"
24893,652626060,1931675,"ANSYS, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 27, 2020",2020-02-27,"Earnings Calls","ANSYS, Inc.","Executives","So if I understand the question about R&D, and I'll try to answer it as best as I can, and hopefully, this gets to the gist of your question, we -- as any sophisticated company with a broad portfolio of technologies, we rely on a combination of both organ",593,"So if I understand the question about R&D, and I'll try to answer it as best as I can, and hopefully, this gets to the gist of your question, we -- as any sophisticated company with a broad portfolio of technologies, we rely on a combination of both organic development, where we have a road map that we execute against. And in certain occasions, we rely on acquisitions, and the acquisitions could be because there's a technology that we've decided we need, which might be better served by going out and buying a company, which has already developed that as opposed to developing ourselves. 
We have an amazingly engaged and capable R&D organization, and we continue to drive innovation after innovation, and I gave you an example of some of the innovations in HFSS. And if you look at the R1 release, you'll see a chapter and verse of all kinds of new features and capabilities that continue to enhance our products across a number of different dimensions. 
But at the same time, we believe that acquisitions are an important aspect, that there are a number of startup companies that have interesting ideas. There are other companies that perhaps maybe a little bit more established that have developed great technology like LSTC had. And we are able to bring them in and rapidly incorporate them into our R&D processes and our development processes. We have an internal mechanism to be able to share information. We have a technical conference, for example, where our R&D leaders from around the world and technical leaders can come get together and share information. There's a lot of collaboration. And you're seeing that in the results. I gave the example of RaptorX. You've seen the results in some of our optics technology where we announced ANSYS SPEOS, which brought together some of the work that we had on solid modeling, on the SpaceClaim side together with the SPEOS capabilities and so on. You can see that in our autonomous offerings, where we have brought together core technology that we've developed over the years as well as acquisitions that came in -- as well as technology that came in from acquisitions. You see that in our platform strategy, which includes capabilities that we've developed as well as other things that we've acquired. So it's a complex equation, but I think that our team is incredibly sophisticated, and we're able to deal with that complexity very well. So I think that's the first piece of the -- that's the first piece of your question. 
The second piece is with respect to services. Look, we have a -- we are not a services company, a professional services company. That is not our business model. We're a software business. And for us, while we do services, services are fundamentally in support of driving software sales. Now we do have a small services organization that supports some of our larger opportunities. And especially when it's in a broad -- in new emerging area, we can certainly see an incremental set of requests for the services capabilities that we provide. But that's not our business, and we work with service partners around the world who can add to the ecosystem. So many of our large channel partners and others can add to the ecosystem to provide service delivery to our customers. This is obviously not an area where we are focusing on trying to significantly increase our share of the business. As I said, our business model is that of a software company."

They're lighter in Q1 just because of the ones that we closed this year that will not repeat. But we are very confident that based on everything that we know today, we've got a strong pipeline. We've got customers that are investing heavily in their own digital transformation to keep pace with market expectations.

And the second, if you'll recall, we closed the LSTC acquisition right before we gave guidance in November. And about 100% of that business came through their channel. We were not able to engage with the channel during due diligence, and so as a result, what we discovered once we closed that deal, that the forecasting methodologies that their channel used were not necessarily aligned with what a public company would do. And so as a result, that ended up -- the contributions from the acquisitions were a little bit less than we anticipated. So if you take the combination of the forecasting negative, which we have now fixed and have been resolved as we head into 2020, and the impact of currency, the 2 of those essentially would have brought us closer to the midpoint."

And I think we've been very consistent in saying that this is going to be a relatively modest piece of our business for a long time, and that's in part driven by the fact that the audience that we're going after is a relatively conservative audience. And adoption of these kinds of technologies, unlike the consumer technology, adoption takes time. We continue to drive the new innovation and the innovations that we -- I described some innovations before, I don't want to go through them again. But we continue to drive new innovations and new capabilities and that continues to broaden and strengthen our capability in the market. So I'm excited about where we are.

The area where LSTC has a lot of strength in automotive is in crash testing. Crash testing, when I meant the more legacy areas, I was talking about potentially a transition from electric to the internal combustion engine. And if you start to think about that transition, customers are spending more money on electric drivetrains and thinking about that change versus internal combustion engines. 
However, when you consider now the fact that you have, say, a battery inside a car, and as I've described in previous calls, the transition to an electric drivetrain and to a battery-operated car fundamentally changes the nature of the design. The chassis changes. Weight assumptions change. There's a fundamental redesign taking place across the car in the aggregate. But that means that you have to rethink what it means for collisions and response to collisions. And then, of course, the battery, you have to worry about battery explosions and battery fires and things of that nature. So you have to really rethink and spend a lot of effort understanding how collisions -- because collisions might happen. You have to make sure that the collisions are not going to be catastrophic, and that means there continues to be significant demand even in the new world of electric cars for the kind of work that we're doing, and I'm very excited about the opposition there in the marketplace. So that's with respect to the actual end market in automotive for LSTC. 
As far as the integration of the technology and the product is going, the integration is going really well. We are -- the technology is very consistent with what we expected. We were a long-time reseller as well of the technology, so we certainly understood it before we did the acquisition. It's consistent with what we expected, and it's a great team, and they're great people. 
As far as the channel partners are concerned, we're working with those channel partners. They're integrating into the ANSYS ecosystem, and we're working with the channel partners. We're honoring those relationships and supporting those channel partners because they have some really valuable customer relationships and incredible skills and capabilities that we want to maintain within the ANSYS ecosystem. So we want those channel partners to grow and thrive within the ANSYS ecosystem.

As far as the actual work with the customers, as I said, a lot of that work is taking place right now, where we are able to work with the customer virtually. We are able to do -- continue with telephone calls. We're able to continue working over the Internet. We can do webinars. We can do webcasts. Customers have access to demo systems as they need to. All of that activity continues to take place. As I said, our colleagues in China -- and once again, I want to acknowledge our colleagues in China who've been working on the difficult circumstances for a while. Our colleagues in China are able to continue to drive the business forward, and they are actively working to do that. And so we feel like a lot of the spade work that we need is continuing to happen. We will continue to see -- we will continue to close business in Q1.

And while it's a relatively small vertical for us today, I think we're making significant progress there,",289,"Yes. So let me just try to take that for a second. Look, we see simulation is becoming increasingly important for a sector of the health care market. And while it's a relatively small vertical for us today, I think we're making significant progress there, especially in Q4. In the physics -- in physics that's based on the health care sector, specifically that we're focused on, which is things like device manufacturing -- medical devices and so on, we've been working with the regulator of the FDA. We've been working with the EU. And we believe that the health care industry is heading more towards things like in silico trials and outcomes like personalized medicine, and then physics space simulation will play an even more active role. And we've, frankly, been very active in this field for a long, long time, maybe for the last decade. And we've been engaging globally with policymakers, with academics, with consortia to try to make sure that we can explain to the industry and bring the industry and the regulations along to the use of in silico trials, and I think we've made significant progress. 
Now in Q4 specifically, as I said, we had several larger deals with medical device market leaders, specifically focusing on the use of simulation and leading to products that could be deployed more rapidly and products that could get regulatory approval more rapidly. So that translates into a very specific value proposition to the customers, which is they can get new product to market faster and at lower cost with greater probability through the regulation process. And so that's a low-hanging fruit for us, but we see all kinds of opportunity in the [indiscernible] that we're working towards."

It is going towards electrification. It is going towards electric systems. It is also going towards electric driving. It's also going towards autonomy. And while we may not necessarily see full autonomy in the short term, as we go on this journey to autonomy, we have improved safety systems, we have autonomy and limited circumstances and so forth. So that level of investment is an ongoing stream of investment that we see happening for multiple years, and we're excited about that.
That being said, when you look at the full portfolio, I think that we have some tremendous strength in the automotive industry outside of these new areas that we've talked about. We talked briefly about crash. That's an area that we continue to be strong. That's obviously through the acquisition. And we continue to be strong in other areas with the portfolio that we've driven. Some other interesting areas like optics have also come into our portfolio through acquisitions. So we have a very strong footprint in the automotive industry today. We have good capabilities, both for the emerging areas, where there's a lot of R&D spend, as well as the more traditional areas.

24893,652626060,1934019,"ANSYS, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 27, 2020",2020-02-27,"Earnings Calls","ANSYS, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Annette, and good morning, everyone. Q4 was yet another exceptional quarter for ANSYS, capping a stellar year. In the fourth quarter, we delivered record revenue, earnings per share and operating cash flow. Let me focus on annual contract value",1842,"Thank you, Annette, and good morning, everyone. Q4 was yet another exceptional quarter for ANSYS, capping a stellar year. In the fourth quarter, we delivered record revenue, earnings per share and operating cash flow. Let me focus on annual contract value, or ACV, which we believe to be the best indicator of the underlying health of our business.
Q4 ACV at well over $0.5 billion in the quarter for the first time in our history, represented growth of 13% in constant currency, which was particularly gratifying considering the strong baseline set in Q4 of 2018. For the full year of 2019, ACV grew a robust 12% in constant currency. As we look to 2020, we are guiding to over 12% growth in ACV in constant currency at the midpoint of our range. This gives us further confidence that we will achieve our goal of $2 billion in ACV by 2022, while maintaining our industry-leading margins in the 42% to 44% range. Maria will provide more detail in just a few minutes. 
Now let me provide insight into some of the growth drivers in the fourth quarter and for all of 2019. During Q4, 10 long-standing customers made 8-figure commitments, and nearly all of the deals over $1 million included offerings from at least 3 of our product lines. From a geographic perspective, we saw strength in all our major territories last year. While North America led with 26% revenue growth for the year, I'm delighted that revenue in Europe grew 29% in Q4 and 14% in 2019, both in constant currency. For the full year, Asia Pac revenue grew 15% in constant currency despite a modest 2% revenue growth in Q4, which was attributable to variations in deal timings. In Japan, we grew revenue 20% in Q4. 
From an industry standpoint, high-tech continues to be our largest sector, fueled by electronics and our semiconductor solutions and supported by a multiphysics portfolio. And as you will hear shortly, we are continuing to add new capabilities to our product offerings so our customers can keep driving innovation in this key industry. 
Moving to automotive. Other vendors have signaled weakness in the sector, perhaps, because of their focus on legacy programs or their inability to pivot to emerging customer requirements. For ANSYS, however, automotive is an area of strength, in part because we have successfully broadened our offerings to address key growth drivers, namely solutions for autonomous and electric vehicles. We have seen repeated evidence of that success in electric vehicles: first with Volkswagen, which we have previously discussed; and now with Porsche. In Q4, we announced that Porsche Motorsport is using ANSYS to create an advanced electric powertrain for its electric racecar. After proving itself on the track, Porsche expects to use the car's electric powertrain to usher in a new era of commercial e-mobility vehicles.
Moving to other industries. Although energy is going through a transition, we are seeing increased demand in that sector, including an extended collaboration with leading energy technology company, Baker Hughes. This long-time customer signed a new agreement in Q4 to use ANSYS simulation to drive down design and development costs, including additive manufacturing while sparking innovation.
We continue to see success in aerospace and defense, driven by increased customer investment in North America. In fact, the aerospace and defense industry is responsible for 4 of our top deals in Q4. The complex product challenges facing aerospace and defense organizations require a true multiphysics approach, including solutions for electromagnetics, fluids and next-generation materials.
For example, a leading North American gas turbine manufacturer signed an 8-figure deal in Q4 to shorten its design cycle using faster, more reliable and accurate combustion simulations. By deploying our Mosaic Meshing and enhanced workflows, this industry leader reduced preparation time from hours to minutes while getting more consistent and robust results twice as fast. By using ANSYS solutions, we expect this global leader to save millions of dollars a year in reduced labor and related costs. 
Another large aerospace company is also benefiting from our comprehensive multiphysics portfolio. This company faced a complex set of operating conditions that made identifying potential failure mechanisms a challenge. It is using our best-in-class electrical, thermal and mechanical products as well as our electronics reliability simulation solution from last year's acquisition of DfR to improve designs and to mitigate possible failures. This resulted in an 8-figure deal in Q4, and it demonstrates our ability to efficiently integrate new technologies into our selling motion. 
As you can see, our customers are benefiting from the formidable combination of ANSYS solutions across physics. This is a powerful endorsement of the strength of the full portfolio, and it is one that we believe other vendors cannot match. We continue to extend our product leadership across the entire portfolio with our recently launched ANSYS 2020 R1. R1 accelerates company's digital transformation by enhancing the interfaces, functionality, workflows and scalability of our products. R1 includes multiple product and technology advances. But in the interest of time, I'll focus on areas of particular interest to the high-tech industry. 
To make 5G a reality, the industry must develop new array and beam steering technologies that overcome millimeter wave impediments such as signal propagation at 28 gigahertz. To overcome those challenges, we continue to make major investments in ANSYS HFSS, our flagship product for designing and simulating high-frequency electronic products. R1 includes groundbreaking new phased array antenna technology that enables 5G designers to model complete antenna arrays, a task that was previously computationally prohibitive.
Developing modern antennas is only one challenge in realizing 5G systems. Chip designers must develop new architectures to co-locate the chip and the antenna, which introduces topology constraints and electromagnetic cross-dock challenges that did not previously exist. We recently announced new product, ANSYS RaptorH to solve these challenges. With its unparalleled accuracy, its unmatched capacity and speed and its smooth design flow integration for advanced nanometer integrated circuit design, we believe RaptorH is the most feature-rich electromagnetic tool in the market for system-on-chip flows. RaptorH marries the best-in-class engines from ANSYS RaptorX, which we gained in last year's Helic acquisition, and ANSYS HFSS into a single-chip package system design environment. Helic was acquired in Q1 2019, and this product shows the speed at which the ANSYS R&D teams can incorporate new technologies into our portfolio. 
Our platform strategy is based on an extensible, vendor-neutral architecture that works both on-premises and in the cloud. ANSYS Minerva is based on this architecture and empowers companies to solve the seemingly intractable problem of dealing with the enormous amount of data created by multiphysics simulations of complex systems, such as 5G components and equipment. In R1, Minerva's scalable traceability, configuration management and versioning system ensures reliability and connectivity of simulation data to drive collaboration and insights across the product life cycle and across departmental silos. That traceability is critical to companies like Eaton Corporation that rely on Minerva to streamline the user experience when designing and manufacturing parts using additive manufacturing and other processes. 
These innovations are empowering our customers to solve some of their most challenging product problems. Our ongoing commitment to improving our best-in-class solutions is further widening the technology gap between us and our competitors. That gap is certainly evident with ANSYS Discovery Live, where we have significantly broadened structural use cases and expanded generative design capabilities while adding a GPU-based, steady-state computational fluid dynamic solver. This breakthrough enables design engineers to predict airflow and heat removal at rates 100x faster than the previous GPU solver within Discovery Live. One customer told us that they reduced component design time from 3 months to less than 2 weeks. 
Q4 marked the first large renewals for the Discovery business, and we are happy to see our early adopters expand their commitment to Discovery. On its most recent earnings call, our strategic partner, PTC, announced that it was also seeing a ramp-up of adoption in average deal size with its Creo Simulation Live product, which incorporates Discovery Live. As I mentioned previously, we expect the near-term financial impact of Discovery Live to be modest, but we see a strong long-term opportunity. 
Over the course of Q4, we also expanded our relationships with industry leaders, Autodesk, Microsoft and Rockwell Automation. With Autodesk, we built on our previously announced automotive workflow between our lighting simulation solution, ANSYS SPEOS and Autodesk VRED. Our new connection between ANSYS mechanical and Autodesk Fusion will drive revolutionary design and engineering agility for our customers, helping them expedite products to market. 
Our partnership with Microsoft also expanded, growing beyond our initial collaboration where we empowered customers to access high-performance computing on demand via ANSYS Cloud, which runs on Microsoft Azure. In Q4, we grew our collaboration to make it easier for customers to adopt and deploy Digital Twins. Through our expanded partnership, manufacturers that model and connect ANSYS using Azure Digital Twins can optimize asset production and operations using ANSYS Twin Builder. That enables users to slash product maintenance costs and speed high-quality products to market. 
Similarly, with Rockwell Automation, we're enabling customers to benefit by creating a digital twin of their full manufacturing process to create and test virtual what-if scenarios. In doing so industrial companies can adapt to market demands with more agility and minimize risk. 
We are also continuing to expand the market for simulation by reaching future users. Over 3,000 universities use our technology for research and teaching, including students at Carnegie Mellon University, who are building and testing their own simulations in the newly opened ANSYS Hall. More than 150,000 people have enrolled in Cornell University's massive online course in simulation based on ANSYS. And I'm pleased to announce that we have seen over 1 million downloads of our student products.
I'd like to take a moment now to recognize my colleagues at ANSYS. As you know, the coronavirus is a rapidly evolving situation. Our #1 priority remains, of course, the safety and the well-being of our employees and their families around the world. And I am humbled and grateful for the commitment that our colleagues in China and elsewhere are showing as they continue to drive business execution in difficult circumstances. 
Switching to our commitment to environmental, social and governance initiatives for just a moment. I'm proud that Newsweek recently named us to its 2020 list of America's Most Responsible Companies. And I'm delighted that 2020 Women on Board recognized ANSYS as a winning ""W"" Company for 2019 with at least 20% women on our Board of Directors. 
To summarize, building on double-digit ACV growth in 2018, 2019 was a record-breaking year for ANSYS. These results, combined with our 2020 forecast of double-digit ACV growth and our continued investment in our market-leading products, give us further confidence that we will achieve our goal of $2 billion in ACV by 2022. So you can understand why I'm excited for 2020 and beyond. As I have told you before, the future for ANSYS is brighter than ever. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Maria. Maria?"

Let me start off by saying that, financially, 2019 was our strongest year ever, and we are very encouraged about 2020, given the momentum in our business. For the full year of 2019, we delivered either above the midpoint or well above the high end of the range on our initial financial guidance, and we raised full year guidance 3x throughout the course of the year. Even more exciting is that we closed the year with a very strong fourth quarter, which included record Q4 results across all of our key financial metrics. This is quite a testament to both our resilient business model and our team's ability to execute, particularly when you consider the very strong comparables for both Q4 and the full year 2018. 
Now I'd like to take a few minutes to provide some additional color on our financial performance, and then I will close with an update on our outlook and key assumptions for Q1 and 2020. And consistent with our standard practice, my comments will be in terms of non-GAAP unless I state otherwise. 
For the fourth quarter, we delivered constant currency revenue growth of 18% and ACV growth of 13%, coupled with operating margin and EPS results that will grow above the high end of our Q4 guidance ranges. These record results were driven by strong market demand for our industry-leading multiphysics portfolio and by continued positive customer and business momentum. 
Now let's turn to some of the key financial metrics that I'd like to highlight for the quarter and the year, beginning with total revenue. We delivered $492.5 million in Q4, and for the full year, we recognized a record $1.5 billion in total revenue, growing 19% in constant currency. Q4 ACV totaled $541 million with 78% of ACV in the quarter coming from recurring sources. Notably, this is our first quarter ever reporting over $0.5 billion in ACV. For 2019, our ACV totaled $1.46 billion, representing constant currency growth of 12% with recurring sources making up 77% of the total. We remind investors that we believe that our annual ACV is a key metric for gauging our operating performance over time. 
In the quarter, an increase in software lease license sales, combined with strong maintenance renewals, bolstered our deferred revenue and backlog total to $871 million, a 32% increase over last year's comparable balance. 
Moving on to profitability. In Q4, we continued to build on our solid performance throughout every quarter of 2019 with strong top line results that helped to drive a fourth quarter gross margin of 92% and an operating margin of 48%. 
For 2019, we finished the year with a gross margin of 91% and an operating margin of 45%. These results are evident that, first and foremost, we are committed to managing our business with discipline and, secondly, that we are successful in integrating tuck-in acquisitions into our business model while still delivering best-in-class margins. These strong margins helped to drive record fourth quarter and full year EPS of $2.24 and $6.58, both well above our guidance ranges. 
With respect to taxes, our effective tax rate in Q4 was 17% as compared to the 20% to 21% range that we had expected. The Q4 rate was favorably impacted by a $6.7 million benefit related to a December tax law change in a foreign jurisdiction. Please keep in mind that this nonrecurring benefit will impact year-over-year comparisons in 2020. 
Our cash flow from operations totaled $139 million for the fourth quarter and $500 million for 2019, and we closed the year with a total of $872 million in cash and short-term investments. Let me add that the acquisitions of LSTC and Dynardo had a relatively insignificant impact on the results for the quarter, contributing $9 million of revenue and $7 million of ACV. 
Now let me turn to the topic of guidance. Before I get into the specific numbers, I would like to briefly comment on China, which accounted for just above 4% of our overall revenue in 2019. First, although the trade negotiations between the U.S. and China have somewhat improved with the completion of the Phase I deal, our full year guidance assumes that the U.S. sanctions on the China-restricted entities announced in 2019 will not be lifted. We estimate that the sanctions resulted in approximately $20 million of both ACV and revenue primarily booked in the first half of 2019 that we have assumed will not be repeated in 2020. Second, the recent outbreak of the coronavirus is bringing new challenges to China and to other countries in the region. The outbreak could potentially delay some deals originally planned in the first half of 2020 to the second half of the year. This has an insignificant impact on our annual outlook and is factored into our Q1 guidance. 
Before moving to our outlook for 2020, as I have consistently communicated over the past several years, our focus will be on progress against our annual targets as opposed to short-term quarterly results. You should expect, as we do, variability in quarterly financial results because ASC 606 revenue recognition rules could affect both revenue and related growth numbers based on the number, timing, size and duration of multiyear leases.
As I described in detail in our last call, in any given quarter or year, there can be a disconnect between the revenue and ACV metrics. In some quarters and years, one metric can be ahead of the other. But eventually and often in the subsequent comparable quarter or year, the other metric must be ahead because the 2 metrics sum to the same number in the long term. In 2019, constant currency revenue growth of 19% disproportionately outpaced ACV growth of 12%, driven by large multiyear lease deals. In 2020, however, we expect constant currency ACV growth of 11% to 14% to outpace annual revenue growth of 8% to 12%. Note also that in both 2018 and in 2019, the second half of the year was stronger than the first, and Q4 was by far our largest quarter. We expect that this trend will continue in 2020. 
Going one level down, there are 3 reasons for why the second half will be stronger than the first. First is seasonality. The second half of the year, most notably the fourth quarter, continues to get seasonally stronger with a number of large multiyear lease deals in the pipeline. This is aligned with the timing of many of our customers' annual budgeting and spending cycles. Second is timing of specific deals. Q1 2019 saw a small number of large multiyear lease contracts that contributed significant revenue in that quarter. Naturally, these contracts will not renew this year and, thus, will not contribute significant revenue in this quarter. 
Even though we expect the total revenue contribution of our multiyear leases in 2020 to increase as compared to 2019, this timing of Q1 2019 deals, coupled with the seasonality of large deals, means that the first quarter's revenue from multiyear contracts will be lower than Q1 of 2019. Third, the combined effect of the China sanction and coronavirus, which I described earlier, delays first half revenue and further strengthens projected revenue growth in the second half of 2020. 
Let's move on to the details of our outlook. We are initiating our guidance for Q1 and expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of $300 million to $320 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.75 to $0.88. For 2020, we expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of $1.64 billion to $1.7 billion or constant currency growth in the range of 8% to 12% and EPS in the range of $6.19 to $6.71. Our ACV outlook for 2020 is a range of $1.605 billion to $1.650 billion. This represents constant currency ACV growth in the range of 11% to 14%. With respect to 2020 annual operating cash flow, our initial outlook in the range of $500 million to $530 million, which considers a full year of interest expense on our term loan. 
Looking ahead to Q1. We are expecting operating margins of 27.5% to 30%, which are reflected on the lower revenue contribution in Q1 combined with a lower proportion of variable cost. And for the full year 2020, we expect margins in the range of 42% to 43%. This aligns with the target range of 42% to 44% that we communicated back in September 2019 at our Investor Day event. 
To close out from the topic of our outlook for 2020, let me just say that we have a strong pipeline, diversified business model and a high level of recurring revenues, all of which contribute to our confidence that 2020 will play out similar to the past 2 years. Further details around specific currency rates and other key assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q1 and 2020 are contained in the prepared remarks document. 
In summary, we delivered another quarter and year of record financial performance with strength across our key financial metrics. Our continued track record of delivering on our financial commitment gives us confidence that we will deliver another year of record financial performance in 2020. In addition, we will continue to invest in our business while we execute against our strategic priorities in support of delivering on our longer-term 2022 ambition.

I think we have a very strong pipeline. 
Built into assumptions that there are a couple of headwinds, which perhaps might be relevant. One is we've assumed that currency is approximately a point, so that's approximately $15 million of a headwind, and that might be relevant to the conversation. And the other is, of course, is we're assuming from the China sanctions that there's a headwind from a growth perspective, and Maria mentioned that on the call as well, and that's approximately $20 million. And so taking that -- taken together, that's approximately 2.3% or about 35% -- $35 million headwind coming into ACV for the year.

The stronger U.S. dollar. The expectation that we'll have increased tax payments in 2020 related to our strong profitability last year. And one other nuance that you may or may not be aware of that relates to another accounting change, there is a new accounting standard that we adopted and that others will adopt that impacts the treatment of certain items that move from -- historically were treated as investing items that now move into operating, and so those will also have a negative impact relative to the cash flows in 2020. So the combination of all of those elements is what leads us to the $500 million to $530 million that we currently are projecting."

The question then for that is, could you talk about how you have evolved or may yet have to evolve your internal development processes, R&D management and the like? I've asked this question of other companies like Adobe, for example, that have large complex portfolios, that have also been acquisitive. I'd be curious to understand how you, particularly for multiphysics and the non-solver business, have perhaps made some changes, if any, to R&D. 
And then secondly, also for you. Talk about, if you could, the interplay, as you see it, between services, including, in particular technical consulting on the one hand, and your solver and non-solver businesses. What is the connection there in terms of services as you see it as either a leading indicator or coincidental indicator to support and enable the software business?"

And in certain occasions, we rely on acquisitions, and the acquisitions could be because there's a technology that we've decided we need, which might be better served by going out and buying a company, which has already developed that as opposed to developing ourselves. 
We have an amazingly engaged and capable R&D organization, and we continue to drive innovation after innovation, and I gave you an example of some of the innovations in HFSS. And if you look at the R1 release, you'll see a chapter and verse of all kinds of new features and capabilities that continue to enhance our products across a number of different dimensions. 
But at the same time, we believe that acquisitions are an important aspect, that there are a number of startup companies that have interesting ideas. There are other companies that perhaps maybe a little bit more established that have developed great technology like LSTC had. And we are able to bring them in and rapidly incorporate them into our R&D processes and our development processes. We have an internal mechanism to be able to share information. We have a technical conference, for example, where our R&D leaders from around the world and technical leaders can come get together and share information. There's a lot of collaboration. And you're seeing that in the results. 
I gave the example of RaptorX. You've seen the results in some of our optics technology where we announced ANSYS SPEOS, which brought together some of the work that we had on solid modeling, on the SpaceClaim side together with the SPEOS capabilities and so on. You can see that in our autonomous offerings, where we have brought together core technology that we've developed over the years as well as acquisitions that came in -- as well as technology that came in from acquisitions. You see that in our platform strategy, which includes capabilities that we've developed as well as other things that we've acquired. So it's a complex equation, but I think that our team is incredibly sophisticated, and we're able to deal with that complexity very well. So I think that's the first piece of the -- that's the first piece of your question. 
The second piece is with respect to services. Look, we have a -- we are not a services company, a professional services company. That is not our business model. We're a software business. And for us, while we do services, services are fundamentally in support of driving software sales. Now we do have a small services organization that supports some of our larger opportunities. And especially when it's in a broad -- in new emerging area, we can certainly see an incremental set of requests for the services capabilities that we provide. But that's not our business, and we work with service partners around the world who can add to the ecosystem. So many of our large channel partners and others can add to the ecosystem to provide service delivery to our customers. This is obviously not an area where we are focusing on trying to significantly increase our share of the business. As I said, our business model is that of a software company."

And so as a result, that ended up -- the contributions from the acquisitions were a little bit less than we anticipated.

And we are seeing that our team in China, and I alluded to this in my comments, our team in China is able to -- despite the fact that some of our offices are closed, our team in China is able to go in -- to be able to work from home and to reach our customers, who are also working from home and are able to get access to businesses and so forth. 
And so based upon that and what we're seeing in terms of our ability to move our business forward, we've taken a -- we're somewhat conservative. We're moving -- we believe that there will be obviously some impact in the sense that there will be some business that will be delayed from the first half to the second half. But we believe that the underlying dynamics of the market continue to be strong. The demand for our products continues to be high. We're continuing to be able to make progress against opportunities, and so we've modeled this as essentially a delay of activity that might have otherwise been scheduled for the first half, delaying into the second half.

And obviously, they have recently gone through the acquisition of Onshape, which is the great technology they brought onboard, and we continue to have conversations with them about how our relationship can evolve and grow. So that's an ongoing dialogue we continue to have with our partners at PTC. 
As far as the first question in terms of the Discovery business in the aggregate, I mean I think that the technology is incredible, and we're going after a market opportunity that continues to evolve and develop, and that's one of the reasons why we've been incredibly cautious about how we imagine the financial impact of this business is going to be. And I think we've been very consistent in saying that this is going to be a relatively modest piece of our business for a long time, and that's in part driven by the fact that the audience that we're going after is a relatively conservative audience. And adoption of these kinds of technologies, unlike the consumer technology, adoption takes time. 
We continue to drive the new innovation and the innovations that we -- I described some innovations before, I don't want to go through them again. But we continue to drive new innovations and new capabilities and that continues to broaden and strengthen our capability in the market. So I'm excited about where we are. I believe we've made great progress. We have seen progress with customers who have come through the enterprise renewal process. So it wasn't like they were just buying it to evaluate it. They're buying it and they're rebuying it. So that's a really positive sign, and we continue to see that as a tailwind for the business as we go forward."

The area where LSTC has a lot of strength in automotive is in crash testing. Crash testing, when I meant the more legacy areas, I was talking about potentially a transition from electric to the internal combustion engine. And if you start to think about that transition, customers are spending more money on electric drivetrains and thinking about that change versus internal combustion engines. 
However, when you consider now the fact that you have, say, a battery inside a car, and as I've described in previous calls, the transition to an electric drivetrain and to a battery-operated car fundamentally changes the nature of the design. The chassis changes. Weight assumptions change. There's a fundamental redesign taking place across the car in the aggregate. But that means that you have to rethink what it means for collisions and response to collisions. And then of course, the battery, you have to worry about battery explosions and battery fires and things of that nature. So you have to really rethink and spend a lot of effort understanding how collisions -- because collisions might happen. 
You have to make sure that the collisions are not going to be catastrophic, and that means there continues to be significant demand even in the new world of electric cars for the kind of work that we're doing, and I'm very excited about the opposition there in the marketplace. So that's with respect to the actual end market in automotive for LSTC. 
As far as the integration of the technology and the product is going, the integration is going really well. We are -- the technology is very consistent with what we expected. We were a long-time reseller as well of the technology, so we certainly understood it before we did the acquisition. It's consistent with what we expected, and it's a great team, and they're great people. 
As far as the channel partners are concerned, we're working with those channel partners. They're integrating into the ANSYS ecosystem, and we're working with the channel partners. We're honoring those relationships and supporting those channel partners because they have some really valuable customer relationships and incredible skills and capabilities that we want to maintain within the ANSYS ecosystem. So we want those channel partners to grow and thrive within the ANSYS ecosystem. And the good news is that we have a vibrant channel relationship already, and those channel partners can grow inside it. And we are very supportive of them continuing to be able to grow their business as being part of the broader ANSYS family."

Look, we see simulation is becoming increasingly important for a sector of the health care market. And while it's a relatively small vertical for us today, I think we're making significant progress there, especially in Q4. In the physics -- in physics that's based on the health care sector, specifically that we're focused on, which is things like device manufacturing -- medical devices and so on, we've been working with the regulator of the FDA. We've been working with the EU. And we believe that the health care industry is heading more towards things like in silico trials and outcomes like personalized medicine, and then physics space simulation will play an even more active role. 
And we've, frankly, been very active in this field for a long, long time, maybe for the last decade. And we've been engaging globally with policymakers, with academics, with consortia to try to make sure that we can explain to the industry and bring the industry and the regulations along to the use of in silico trials, and I think we've made significant progress. 
Now in Q4 specifically, as I said, we had several larger deals with medical device market leaders, specifically focusing on the use of simulation and leading to products that could be deployed more rapidly and products that could get regulatory approval more rapidly. So that translates into a very specific value proposition to the customers, which is they can get new product to market faster and at lower cost with greater probability through the regulation process. And so that's a low-hanging fruit for us, but we see all kinds of opportunity in the [indiscernible] still that we're working towards."

And we continue to be strong in other areas with the portfolio that we've driven. Some other interesting areas like optics have also come into our portfolio through acquisitions. So we have a very strong footprint in the automotive industry today. We have good capabilities, both for the emerging areas, where there's a lot of R&D spend, as well as the more traditional areas. And we're very excited about our position."

I hope that you are healthy and safe during these uncertain times. I would like to start by thanking the entire ANSYS team. Their professionalism, commitment during this crisis has been exemplary and it made a tremendous difference for our customers. Let me first talk about how answers responded to COVID-19 and describe our Q1 performance and how we are operating our business in these unusual times. Then I will take a step back and discuss the ANSYS business as a whole, specifically why ANSYS is important to customers and why the business is resilient. 
Finally, I will provide some color on key elements of the business going forward, including a description of some of the headwinds that we are seeing before I turn the call over to Maria. Of course, ANSYS' first responsibility is to the health and safety of our employees and their families and to the ANSYS community around the world. In mid-February, we closed our offices in China and enabled our employees to work from home. As the crisis spread, we closed other locations around the world. Today, with the improving situation in China and Korea, our offices in those countries are open with our employees maintaining appropriate social distances and health and safety protocols. Our offices elsewhere remain closed or open only to essential staff with the vast majority of employees worldwide continuing to work from home. Our employees are quickly adapted to this challenge, and we are fully engaged in driving our business forward in the work-from-home model. In the last several years, we have invested in our infrastructure and business applications, including our networking and remote access capabilities as well as collaboration technology. These investments have turned out to be invaluable and are helping us run our business today. We are continuing to pay all our salaried and hourly workers, and we are not planning any job actions. In fact, we are onboarding new employees remotely and provisioning them to work from home. We have a number of open job requisitions and are seeing a strong flow of candidates who are looking for the stability that a company like ANSYS can provide. We believe that our ongoing investments in our growing team put ANSYS in a strong position to capture additional opportunity once this prices is abated. As you may recall from when we guided in February, we were expecting the first quarter and the first half of the year to be challenging because of tough year-over-year compare, the effect of China sanctions and a back-end loaded full year. Of course, worldwide economic conditions worsened through March. Nonetheless, I am very proud that the solid execution by the ANSYS team, our revenue, earnings and operating margin for Q1 came in just about at the midpoint of our guidance. 
In Q1, we saw strength in a number of industries, including automotive, high-tech and energy. In these verticals, our solutions that support the key initiatives of autonomy, electrification and 5G continue to resonate with our customers. For example, in Asia, we inked a new 3-year contract with an existing consumer electronics customer to expand its usage of our flagship multiphysics solutions as well as to expand into digital twins. In North America, we closed several large deals in the high-tech and semiconductor sectors, including a new global hardware provider that agreed to standardize on ANSYS, displacing several competitors. We also closed a 7-figure deal with new scale power to bring its small modular nuclear reactive design to reality through the power of simulation. We were also able to forge new relationships with organizations that have not previously used ANSYS. For example, we signed a 7-figure contract with a new customer, software motor company, or SNC. By using ANSYS multiphysic Solutions supported by ANSYS Cloud, SNC is developing an automated workflow to rapidly design and analyze motors for use across industries. The enhanced workflow can compress the weeks of simulation and months of protype testing typically required for these virtually silent motors. 
In Q1, we delivered ANSYS 2020 release one, and despite working from home, we will deliver our release to the customers in the summer as originally scheduled. These are major releases and include new capabilities across our multiphysics product portfolio. All products continue to receive recognition and accolades from our customers and partners. For example, industry leader, TSMC recently certified enhances Redhawk SC next-generation system on chip power noise sign off-platform for TSMC's FinFET process nodes. This helps customers verify the power requirements and the reliability of ships we use in artificial intelligence, machine learning, 5G and high-performance computing applications. Similarly, Samsung Foundry has certified the ANSYS RaptorH electromagnetic simulation solution for design using its new 3-dimensional integrated circuit packaging technology. RaptorH marries the best-in-class engines from ANSYS RaptorX, which we gained in last year's Helic acquisition and ANSYS flagship HFSs into a single chip packet system design environment. By validating electromagnetic effects in Samsung's 3D assemblies, RaptorH empowers designers to eliminate critical points of failure and accelerate the rate of new technology adoption. We are continuing to look at opportunities to expand our portfolio through M&A. We recently closed our acquisition of Lumerical, which will enable ANSYS customers to predict the behavior of light within complex photonic devices, structures and systems. This is critical as 5G applications and autonomous vehicles are producing massive amounts of data, forcing organizations to handle even more information faster than ever. Lumerical's products enable designers to develop new, high-throughput optical networks by modeling the most challenging problems in photonics, including interacting optical, electrical and thermal effects. We were able to virtually onboard the Lumerical team, and I'm excited to welcome them into our 1 ANSYS family. 
I'd now like to discuss the ANSYS business and explain it to the soliance. The ANSYS value proposition is compelling, both in good times and in tough economic times because simulation helps our customers drive both top line revenue growth and achieve significant cost savings. Using ANSYS simulation, customers can rapidly innovate, easily validate design ideas and improve cycle time. This means that they can launch more of the right products, and do so at a faster pace related to top line growth. In addition, simulation can help customers get more impact from tight R&D budgets by giving engineers the tools to evaluate multiple design options, cost effectively and in parallel and by reducing or even eliminating the need for costly physical testing. That is particularly relevant during this global crisis when some customers cannot get access to their last physically test products. The compelling value and the mission-critical nature of simulation is why customers continue to rely on ANSYS even during periods of uncertainty. It is important to note that the bulk of customers' investments in simulation comes from their research and development for R&D budgets. R&D is the lifeblood of our customers. It's the key differentiator. Our experience is that in tough economic times, R&D is typically the least impacted by budget cuts and the first restored, primarily because it drives future growth and market success. We believe that this is a commonly accepted perspective, and it is corroborated by studies in the Harvard business review and by the consulting firm, McKinsey. This ongoing investment in R&D and simulation in tough economic times is best illustrated in the automotive industry, where softening demand and worker safety concerns caused by the COVID-19 crisis have forced manufacturers to shut down factories and cut budgets. However, Volkswagen, General Motors, Honda and other attain a competitive product. This is exciting news, indeed, coming just a few months after we closed the acquisition As I also discussed at last year's Investor Day, ANSYS is a resilient model due in part to the number and diversity of customers we serve. We have thousands of customers across multiple industries, including high tech, semiconductor, aerospace, defense, automotive, industrial and energy. And we are well balanced across the geographies with about 40% of our business coming from the Americas and the rest split roughly evenly between Europe and Asia. That diversity means that we can harness growth from a wide variety of sources. And it also means that we are resilient to the business or economic dynamics of any individual customer industry or country. Furthermore, our sales channels are diversified with about 75% coming from our direct force, with the remainder coming from channel partners. We are very flexible in our licensing and consumption models, and customers can purchase a perpetual license, a lease license, or a pay-as-you-go elastic license and can consume our technology on-premises or in the cloud. We believe this diversity and flexibility allows us to reach and support a broad range of customers around the world. I'd now like to give some color on the challenges our users are facing and how we're accommodating that and provide additional comments on the demand environment, including a perspective by industry and by geography. It is important to note that our analysis of demand has already been factored into our Q2 and full year guidance. Let me also caution that with the unprecedented market volatility we are all experiencing, demand could change in either direction as the global situation continues to evolve. We expect the most significant business disruption to occur in the second quarter when our teams and those of our customers work remotely. We are currently assuming a modest recovery in the business environment during the third quarter as states and countries slowly reopen, and business and consumer sentiment begins to improve. We also assume business activity and customer sentiment will continue to improve through the fourth quarter. Comparing this period of disruption with the pre-COVID environment, we expect different kinds of customers will be impacted in different ways. First, it is likely to be more challenging to close deals with brand new customers, primarily because of the difficulty in building new relationships and driving demand with new prospects remotely. Fortunately, for ANSYS, over the course of our 50-year history, we have built a large and loyal customer base. And so while new customers are important, the majority of our business comes from existing customers. Second, we expect larger accounts to perform more strongly than small and medium-sized businesses. This is to our advantage as the majority of our business comes from these larger accounts. Larger customers have stronger liquidity and capital position, and we believe that a majority of them will be able to maintain their R&D cycles. In contrast, smaller customers tend to be more sensitive to liquidity constraints and are more likely to delay purchases. however, that we believe government programs, especially in Europe, will mitigate some of this risk. Furthermore, during this period of disruption, we expect renewal rates to remain strong, although new businesses will come under incremental pressure. Furthermore, during this period of disruption, we expect renewal rates to remain strong, although new business will come under incremental pressure. We also expect customers to prefer leases over perpetual because of the smaller initial financial commitment of the lease. And we will see additional scrutiny given to large multiyear contracts, which could result in delays in signing or perhaps smaller commitments than we had previously expected. This could introduce incremental timing uncertainty into our top line. Our prepared remarks contain a more comprehensive discussion of the attributes affecting our pipeline conversion and their related impact. With that backdrop, I'll shift to an industry view. We are seeing little to no reduction in demand in the high-tech and semiconductor vertical, which accounted for about 1/3 of our business in 2019. Many of these customers have deep pockets and are developing products against a multiyear road map, and they are not willing to let a few quarters of uncertainties slowing down. Other companies in large markets such as 5G, are in a global race for leadership positions within their industry and are unwilling to delay their R&D efforts and thus see their future to a competitor. 
Let me now move to aerospace and defense. We anticipate investments will continue for defense and military aerospace, driven by long-term government programs, and we expect to see little to no reduction in demand for ANSYS technology in this vertical. Commercial aerospace and contracts will be impacted in the short term, driven by both pre-COVID challenges faced by some companies and by the dramatic reduction in passenger air travel as a result of this pandemic. However, in the medium to long term, I believe this will be somewhat mitigated by the continued need of long-term R&D initiatives that address environmental issues and government regulations. 
In the automotive industry, although there has been widespread idling of manufacturing plans, R&D are still receiving funding. And that is particularly true for emerging solutions like autonomy and electrification where ANSYS plays a key role. However, we are expecting to see headwinds on more traditional R&D activities in the sector. Given the need for competitive differentiation, we expect to see ongoing investments in new product introductions for industrial equipment. Although we anticipate a reduction in R&D spending on existing products in this vertical. The low price of oil is causing headwinds in the energy sector. Fortunately, this vertical accounts for a relatively small portion of our business. 
Let me turn now to a geographical view. Relative to our expected performance of the geographies at the time of our last earnings call, we believe North America will fare the best. North America has the largest installed base of big enterprise customers, and a number of these customers are due to renew their leases of ANSYS products in 2020. We expect a high renewal rate for those leases, and we also expect to attach new product sales to the renewals. Our North America customer base includes a good percentage of high-tech and semiconductor companies, and we expect their R&D and simulation initiatives to continue to receive funding. Asia Pacific entered the COVID-19 crisis a few weeks before the rest of the world. We did see an initial reduction in demand activity there. But we're now seeing a return of demand. For example, we saw China and Q1 stronger than we had expected, and it continues to have momentum in Q2. The high-tech and semiconductor industry remains strong throughout the region. However, we do see some headwinds in the more traditional automotive investments and the heavy industrials. We're expecting some disruptions in business in EMEA, in part because of headwinds related to industrial and traditional automotive activities and in part because we saw some customers struggle with the transition to a work-from-home model. Still, we see a relief coming in the form of government programs designed to help companies, especially smaller ones, deals with the near-term financial stress. With all these uncertainties, we are reducing our full year revenue and ACV guidance by mid-single digits, with the greatest impact coming. Maria will go through guidance in more detail. Before I finish, I would like to mention that we are preparing a simulation world, our exciting new online conference that brings together simulation thought leaders and users from around the world. Simulation World will feature a who's who events customers, including Volkswagen motorsports, Baker Hughes, Ericsson and Porsche motorsports. Simulation World already has more than 10,000 registrants, demonstrating the value of simulation in the marketplace. I'm very excited that this quorum gives us a new and unique opportunity to generate demand for our multiphysics portfolio. Despite the uncertainties in the market, we believe that our strategy of pervasive simulation and the value that we deliver to our customers is more important than ever. Our strategy accelerates customers' key research and development initiatives, which are not typically impacted by economic slowdowns, and we support critical emerging areas like electrification, autonomy, 5G and the industrial Internet of Things. And our value proposition is compelling to customers, both in good times and in top economic times because we can help our customers drive both top line revenue growth and achieve significant cost savings. I am confident in our ability to continue to drive long-term growth. And with our continued investment in the business, I believe we are well positioned to emerge from this crisis stronger than ever. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Maria to discuss our financials for Q1 and provide more detail around our outlook and assumptions for the remainder of 2020. Maria?"

I'll begin with a perspective on our first quarter financial performance. Then I'll also provide qualitative and quantitative color and context around our outlook assumptions for Q2 and  the remainder of 2020. In connection with our updated outlook, I will encourage you to please review all of the earnings documents that we have posted to our Investor Relations website. Before I get started, I wanted to take a moment to say thank you to my ANSYS colleagues, who have all successfully navigated the work-from-home transition to enable us to continue to operate our business, support our customers and to be able to meet all of our financial reporting deadlines, including all of the efforts that have gone into supporting today's earnings call. Your teamwork, flexibility, dedication and innovation have been personally inspiring. And for that, I just want to say thank you. Although we faced a more challenging customer demand environment in the latter part of March as compared to our expectations at the time that we provided our February guidance. Our financial results reflect solid execution, which yielded revenue, operating margin and EPS, all towards the midpoint of the guidance ranges that we previously provided for the quarter. 
Our start to the year is very encouraging when considering the tough Q1 2019 comparable, in which we reported double-digit revenue growth and the negative impact that COVID-19 inflicted on global economies in the first quarter. Our key financial metrics begin with Q1 ACV of $301 million, with 82% coming from recurring sources and total revenue of $309 million. I will add that the key currency exchange rates were within the ranges that we provided with our first quarter guidance. We closed the quarter with a total balance of deferred revenue and backlog of $835 million. Representing a 24% increase over last year's first quarter balance. 
During the quarter, we continued to manage our business with fiscal discipline, which yielded a solid first quarter gross margin of 88% and an operating margin of 29%, in line with our Q1 guidance. Margins were positively impacted by a slower pace of hiring than we had planned as well as reduced travel and corporate event spending. These positive variances were partially offset by higher bad debt expense. The net result was first quarter EPS of $0.83, which was slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range. With respect to taxes, our effective tax rate in Q1 was 19.5%. And going forward, we have adopted a normalized effective tax rate approach for non-GAAP reporting and expect our effective tax rate to remain at 19.5% for the full year. Our cash flow from operations totaled $147 million, and we ended the quarter with a total of $718 million in cash and short-term investments. In line with our capital allocation priorities, we repurchased 690,000 shares during the quarter at an average price of $233.48. We have 2.8 million shares available for repurchase under the current authorized program. Against the backdrop of ongoing volatility and uncertainty in the global markets, we will continue to assess both our own financial performance as well as market conditions as they continue to evolve in determining when might be the most opportune time to reinstate any future share repurchases. Through the combination of our current cash position, the additional $500 million that we have available under our undrawn revolver and our projections for 2020 operating cash flow, we believe that we have ample liquidity to continue to progress against our long-term strategy, while at the same time, remaining cognizant of the current environment. 
Now let me turn to the topic of guidance. As this crisis has evolved, our team has created multiple scenarios to build out what we believe is the most appropriate framework for giving investors a forward-looking view of the business based upon everything that we currently know. That being said, because of the very significant market and economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 outbreak, our ranges for outlook are wider than those that we have historically provided. Let me also add that the entirety of our guidance reduction relates to the expected effects of the global pandemic. Factoring in our Q1 results, we are initiating guidance for Q2 and updating our revenue, EPS, ACV and operating cash flow outlook for the full year. This update reflects our current views for the remainder of the year as well as some minor contribution from the Lumerical acquisition that we closed on April 1. I for the second quarter, we expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of $335 million to $375 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.01 to $1.33. This outlook assumes that we will experience the most significant business disruption in the second quarter. Based upon discussions with our customers and channel partners, we anticipate delays in the timing of closing certain transactions and, in particular, larger enterprise deals may be especially challenging. We have also assumed that some customers will delay certain purchases until later in the year. 
For the full year, we are updating both the revenue and EPS outlook to non-GAAP revenue in the range of $1.555 billion to $1.630 billion or constant currency growth of 2% to 7%, and EPS in the range of $5.61 to $6.23. We are also updating our full year ACV outlook to a range of $1.5 billion to $1.575 billion. This represents constant currency ACV growth in the range of 3% to 9%. 
With respect to the remainder of the year, we expect a modest recovery in the business environment in Q3 as employees return to work and businesses begin to resume operations. Our current assumptions anticipate a stronger recovery in the fourth quarter, buoyed by a combination of sales transactions that may have been deferred from earlier quarters, and the sales outlook for multiyear leases that are currently forecasted to close in Q4. With respect to annual operating cash flows, we are updating our outlook for 2020 to a range of $425 million to $470 million. This is reflective of our updated full year ACV, revenue and profitability estimates. We have also factored into our outlook an incremental $10 million to $20 million of customer payments that would have otherwise been made in 2020 that may be delayed into 2021 as a result of extended payment term requests on new contracts and delayed payments on existing contracts. For modeling purposes, we're expecting second quarter operating margins of 33.5% to 39%. And for the full year, we expect operating margins in the range of 40% to 42%. These charges are reflective of our adjusted spending plans for Q2 and the remainder of the year. They include a slower pace of hiring and reduced discretionary spending, as well as decreased spending on certain noncritical facilities and infrastructure projects. 
On the other hand, we will continue to invest in certain digital transformation projects such as our global CRM and HRIS initiatives, as these projects are critical elements in building the foundation to efficiently operate and scale our business over the long term. Further details around specific currency rates and other quantitative and qualitative assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q2 and 2020 are contained in the prepared remarks document. In our effort to provide greater insight and transparency to investors, we have added additional commentary to our prepared remarks and Form 10-Q, specifically related to the impact of COVID-19. As a caveat, I will remind everyone that this information is based upon everything that we know as of today. And given the uncertain and unprecedented environment that we are operating under, our assumptions are subject to change. Our current expectations, as reflected in our updated financial outlook, is that there will be a delay in business with an adverse impact on our Q2 and full year results. 
Beyond the points that Ajei mentioned earlier, regarding the various elements that have contributed to the resiliency of our business model over the long term, from a financial perspective, I'd also like to highlight our high level of recurring ACV, historically stable renewal rates for both leases and maintenance and the strength of our balance sheet and operating cash flow. We are trying to be as transparent as we can and appreciate that you are all seeking information, details and perspective on our future outlook. We have tried to take into account the uncertainty, particularly around the timing of larger enterprise deals. We also trust that you will appreciate that there is no certainty in our assumptions and that things will continue to evolve and change in either direction depending on how will this situation continues to negatively impact global economies, customer sentiment and purchasing decisions as it has since this global pandemic first began in Q1. We will continue to remain focused on the things that we can control, trying to strike a balance between short and long-term strategic initiatives that we believe are critical to our long-term success. 
In closing, we are very fortunate to start the year with solid first quarter financial and operational results. Being able to deliver on our Q1 financial commitments, despite the extreme volatility is a testament to both the resiliency of the ANSYS business model and to the collective efforts and dedication of the broader ANSYS ecosystem that includes our employees, customers and partners. As we look ahead, we remain committed to invest in our business and to continue to execute against our long-term strategic priorities. Our focus and commitment to the long term, combined with our best-in-class product portfolio, long-standing customer relationships and resilient business model give us confidence that we will emerge from this crisis, better positioned to capitalize on our long-term growth aspirations.

And that is, I think, one of the largest, if not the largest simulation event online. And we have a number of speakers signed up for that. We have, I think, over 10,000 people who have registered and the month is about -- and the event is about a month away. So there's a lot of interest in the technology and the capabilities. And obviously, we're driving demand from online events to -- excuse me, from in-person events to online events. With respect to our partnership relationships, we continue to drive our relationships with our partners and with our customers and the importance of what we do together remains unchanged. 
With respect to the first part of your question, the long-term view of our industry, I think it's important to note that the part of the industry where ANSYS lives with a simulation, we believe, is the most important aspect that customers are dealing with. They need simulation in order to be able to validate the design of the products to be able to design the products. Some of the other companies that you mentioned are in other parts of the entire ecosystem. We're in the simulation space. And we believe that this is an extremely valuable part of the end-to-end ecosystem is something that customers do need. Now to your point about platforms, look, I think that there is some in the industry who believe that you need to have a single monolithic platform, which is a single source of truth and ideal single vendor monolithing environment. We don't believe that's the case. Our strategy is completely open. We believe instead in an authoritative source of truth. Which is an ecosystem of open, federated and purpose-built domain-specific solutions, and we participate in that. And I think that's a much more realistic way of addressing the digital transformation needs the scale. It's not about picking 1 platform and locking a vendor or locking a customer into a particular platform, it's vendors like ourselves, playing in an open environment, recognizing that we need to be in a position to support our customers as they understand how to create these complex products in the future."

What we said is we didn't see a material impact only in Q1. So if you look at our Q1 results, they came -- all of the key metrics came in at basically the midpoint or a little bit better than what we had forecasted when we gave guidance at the end of February. Now that being said, when we gave that guidance, we were basically assuming that COVID-19 was somewhat limited to China and perhaps South Korea. But just like everyone in the world, as March progressed, things got progressively worse as this really became a global pandemic. So as a result of that, a lot of stuff has changed in the past 6 weeks. And so that is why we've modified our full year outlook, which now does factor in what we believe is an elongated impact from COVID-19, the most dramatic being Q2."

At the enterprise level, we are still seeing our large customers thinking long-term because R&D is really a long-term investment. And so an example that Ajei spoke to in his remarks is done so. A very long-standing customer that just entered into a 3-year multiyear lease. Where we're really seeing the biggest dynamic right now and what we built into our outlook for 2020 is that at the small-medium business level, that those customers are probably -- and we're seeing some of this going to choose an annual lease versus a paid up just given the current economic environment and their access to capital. But I will also just comment that today, the majority of our leases are still annual leases. That transition to multiyear leases has really been the journey at the enterprise and strategic level because that  customer tends to think longer-term than perhaps smaller businesses do."

But in terms of actual closed contracts, that starts to come in towards the third month of the quarter. And what we're seeing in April, of course, is as customers are transitioning to a work from home model, there was obviously some disruption, I would say, March, as people were thinking through the transition process and trying to make sure that they could get there. But today, we are seeing a number of our customers working from -- all our teams are effectively working from home. We can engage. A lot of the challenges are around being able to do things like demos and so on in our case organization, which is our technical  customer-facing organization is able to deliver those demos and those capabilities.

Number one is that some customers are not able to access physical labs or we're not able to access physical labs. And as a result of that, physical experimentation is suffering. And obviously, simulation does not require you to access a physical lab. You can do all your work on the computer and in a work-from-home scenario. So that has clearly swings away from physical testing towards more simulation activity, and that's obviously a tailwind for us, and that's helpful. The other thing is -- and I think this has been very well established, part of the value proposition, what part of the value proposition of simulation is really being able to address cost, and in particular, you can reduce the number of physical prototypes, and you can test in parallel in sort of serializing a sequence of events. You can test a number of things in parallel on the computer. And the fact that you can reduce cost is an important driver. And again, in these tough economic times, people are looking to reduce costs. And that, again, is a good guide to tailwind for simulation. So I'm pretty excited about those dynamics. 
Another point I'd actually like to make, which is kind of interesting is we've been able to deliver that unique pass situation as the pandemic as we've been able to deliver a number of simulation based insights to out there. People have been using our technology to come up with ideas or assessments of things like social distancing, the creation of PPE, the creation of medical -- the rapid creation of medical devices and a lot of that is being done because of the speed and the rating case at which of this work is being done, it was unexpected. A lot of that work is being done through simulation as well. And that also demonstrates the effectiveness of simulation if you start to think about the agility that we can bring to bear."

Of course, ANSYS' first responsibility is to the health and safety of our employees and their families and to the ANSYS community around the world. In mid-February, we closed our offices in China and enabled our employees to work from home. As the crisis spread, we closed other locations around the world. Today, with the improving situation in China and Korea, our offices in those countries are open with our employees maintaining appropriate social distances and health and safety protocols. Our offices elsewhere remain closed or open only to essential staff with the vast majority of employees worldwide continuing to work from home. Our employees have quickly adapted to the challenge, and we are fully engaged in driving our business forward in the work-from-home model.
In the last several years, we have invested in our infrastructure and business applications, including our networking and remote access capabilities as well as collaboration technology. These investments have turned out to be invaluable and are helping us run our business today. We are continuing to pay all our salaried and hourly workers, and we are not planning any job action. In fact, we are onboarding new employees remotely and provisioning them to work from home. We have a number of open job requisitions and are seeing a strong flow of candidates who are looking for the stability that a company like ANSYS can provide. We believe that our ongoing investments in our growing team put ANSYS in a strong position to capture additional opportunity once this crisis is abated.
As you may recall from when we guided in February, we were expecting the first quarter and the first half of the year to be challenging because of tough year-over-year compare, the effect of China sanctions and a back-end loaded full year. Of course, worldwide economic conditions worsened through March. Nonetheless, I am very proud that the solid execution by the ANSYS team, our revenue, earnings and operating margin for Q1 came in just about at the midpoint of our guidance.
In Q1, we saw strength in a number of industries, including automotive, high-tech and energy. In these verticals, our solutions that support the key initiatives of autonomy, electrification and 5G continue to resonate with our customers. For example, in Asia, we inked a new 3-year contract with an existing consumer electronics customer to expand its usage of our flagship multiphysics solutions as well as to expand into digital twins.
In North America, we closed several large deals in the high-tech and semiconductor sectors, including at a global hardware provider that agreed to standardize on ANSYS, displacing several competitors. We also closed a 7-figure deal with NuScale Power to bring its small modular nuclear reactor designs to reality through the power of simulation. We were also able to forge new relationships with organizations that have not previously used ANSYS.
For example, we signed a 7-figure contract with a new customer, Software Motor Company or SMC. By using ANSYS multiphysics solutions supported by ANSYS Cloud, SMC is developing an automated workflow to rapidly design and analyze motors to be used across industries. The enhanced workflow can compress the weeks of simulation and months of protype testing typically required for these virtually silent motors.  In Q1, we delivered Ansys 2020 Release 1 and despite working from home, we will deliver our release to the customers in the summer as originally scheduled.
These are major releases and include new capabilities across our multiphysics product portfolio. All products continue to receive recognition and accolades from our customers and partners. For example, industry leader, TSMC recently certified ANSYS RedHawk-SC next-generation system-on-chip power noise sign off-platform for TSMC's FinFET process nodes. This helps customers verify the power requirements and the reliability of chips we use in artificial intelligence, machine learning, 5G and high-performance computing applications.
Similarly, Samsung Foundry has certified the ANSYS RaptorH electromagnetic simulation solution for design using its new 3-dimensional integrated circuit packaging technology. RaptorH marries the best-in-class engines from ANSYS RaptorX, which we gained in last year's Helic acquisition and ANSYS flagship HFSS into a single chip packet system design environment. By validating electromagnetic effects in Samsung's 3D assembly, RaptorH empowers designers to eliminate critical points of failure and accelerate the rate of new technology adoption.
We are continuing to look at opportunities to expand our portfolio through M&A. We recently closed our acquisition of Lumerical, which will enable ANSYS customers to predict the behavior of light within complex photonic devices, structures and systems. This is critical as 5G applications and autonomous vehicles are producing massive amounts of data, forcing organizations to handle even more information faster than ever. Lumerical's products enable designers to develop new, high-throughput optical networks by modeling the most challenging problems in photonics, including interacting optical, electrical and thermal effects. We were able to virtually onboard the Lumerical team, and I'm excited to welcome them into our ONE Ansys family.
I'd now like to discuss the ANSYS business and explain it to the zodiacs. The ANSYS value proposition is compelling, both in good times and in tough economic times because simulation helps our customers drive both top line revenue growth and achieve significant cost savings. Using ANSYS simulation, customers can rapidly innovate, easily validate design ideas and improve cycle time. This means that they can launch more of the right products, and do so at a faster pace, which translates to top line growth.
In addition, simulation can help customers get more impact from tight R&D budgets by giving engineers the tools to evaluate multiple design options cost effectively and in parallel and by reducing or even eliminating the need for costly physical testing. That is particularly relevant during this global crisis when some customers cannot get access to their labs physically test products. The compelling value and the mission-critical nature of simulation is why customers continue to rely on ANSYS even during periods of uncertainty. It is important to note that the bulk of customers' investments in simulation comes from their research and development or R&D budgets. R&D is the lifeblood of our customers. It's the key differentiator. Our experience is that in tough economic times, R&D is typically the least impacted by budget cuts and the first restored, primarily because it drives future growth and market success. We believe that this is a commonly accepted perspective, and it is corroborated by studies in the Harvard Business Review and by the consulting firm, MacKenzie. 
This ongoing investment in R&D and in simulation in tough economic times is best illustrated in the automotive industry, where softening demand and worker safety concerns caused by the COVID-19 crisis have forced manufacturers to shut down factories and cut budgets. However, Volkswagen, General Motors, Honda and other automakers have publicly reported continued investments in R&D, especially in next-generation technologies, such as autonomy and electrification. If you recall from earlier discussions, these next-generation technologies are exactly where ANSYS has been making strategic investments through both organic development and acquisitions. At ANSYS, we continue to see investments in simulation by automotive OEMs and their suppliers across geographies.
Let me give you 2 examples from Q2. In Asia, DENSO, the Tier 1 automotive supplier, recently signed a 3-year multimillion-dollar deal to adopt ANSYS solutions for automotive parts development for electrification and autonomy as well as for our platform technologies. In Europe, our channel partner, DYNAmore, recently inked an important deal with a major automotive OEM for the adoption of LS-DYNA for virtual crash testing, replacing a competitive product. This is exciting news, indeed, coming just a few months after we closed the acquisition of LSTC.
As I also discussed at last year's Investor Day, ANSYS is a resilient model due in part to the number and diversity of customers we serve. We have thousands of customers across multiple industries, including high-tech, semiconductor, aerospace, defense, automotive, industrial and energy. And we are well balanced across the geographies with about 40% of our business coming from the Americas and the rest split roughly evenly between Europe and Asia. That diversity means that we can harness growth from a wide variety of sources. And it also means that we are resilient to the business or economic dynamics of any individual customer, industry or country.
Furthermore, our sales channels are diversified with about 75% coming from our direct force, with the remainder coming from channel partners. We are very flexible in our licensing and consumption models, and customers can purchase a perpetual license, a lease license, or a pay-as-you-go elastic license and can consume our technology on-premises or in the cloud. We believe this diversity and flexibility allows us to reach and support a broad range of customers around the world.
I'd now like to give some color on the challenges our users are facing and how we're accommodating them and provide additional comments on the demand environment, including a perspective by industry and by geography. It is important to note that our analysis of demand has already been factored into our Q2 and full year guidance. Let me also caution that with the unprecedented market volatility we are all experiencing, demand could change in either direction as the global situation continues to evolve. We expect the most significant business disruption to occur in the second quarter when our teams and those of our customers work remotely. We are currently assuming a modest recovery in the business environment during the third quarter as states and countries slowly reopen, and business and consumer sentiment begins to improve. We also assume business activity and customer sentiments will continue to improve through the fourth quarter.
Comparing this period of disruption with the pre-COVID environment, we expect different kinds of customers will be impacted in different ways. First, it is likely to be more challenging to close deals with brand new customers, primarily because of the difficulty in building new relationships and driving demand with new prospects remotely. Fortunately, for ANSYS, over the course of our 50-year history, we have built a large and loyal customer base. And so while new customers are important, the majority of our business comes from existing customers.
Second, we expect larger accounts to perform more strongly than small- and medium-sized businesses. This is to our advantage as the majority of our business comes from these larger accounts. Larger customers have stronger liquidity and capital position, and we believe that a majority of them will be able to maintain their R&D cycles. In contrast, smaller customers tend to be more sensitive to liquidity constraints and are more likely to delay purchases. So, however, that we believe government programs, especially in Europe, will mitigate some of this risk.
Furthermore, during this period of disruption, we expect renewal rates to remain strong, although new business will come under incremental pressure. We also expect customers to prefer leases over perpetual because of the smaller initial financial commitment of the lease. And we will see additional scrutiny given to large multiyear contracts, which could result in delays in signing or perhaps smaller commitments than we had previously expected. This could introduce incremental timing uncertainty into our top line. Our prepared remarks contain a more comprehensive discussion of the attributes affecting our pipeline conversion and their related impact.
With that backdrop, I'll shift to an industry view. We are seeing little to no reduction in demand in the high-tech and semiconductor vertical, which accounted for about 1/3 of our business in 2019. Many of these customers have deep pockets and are developing products against a multiyear road map, and they are not willing to let a few quarters of uncertainties slowing down. Other companies in large markets such as 5G are in a global race for leadership positions within their industry and are unwilling to delay their R&D efforts and thus see their future to a competitor.
Let me now move to aerospace and defense. We anticipate investments will continue for defense and military aerospace, driven by long-term government programs, and we expect to see little to no reduction in demand for ANSYS technology in this vertical. Commercial aerospace and contracts will be impacted in the short term, driven by both pre-COVID challenges faced by some companies and by the dramatic reduction in passenger air travel as a result of this pandemic. However, in the medium to long term, I believe this will be somewhat mitigated by the continued need of long-term R&D initiatives that address environmental issues and government regulations.
In the automotive industry, although there has been widespread idling of manufacturing plans, R&D are still receiving funding. And that is particularly true for emerging solutions like autonomy and electrification where ANSYS plays a key role. However, we are expecting to see headwinds on more traditional R&D activities in the sector. Given the need for competitive differentiation, we expect to see ongoing investments in new product introductions for industrial equipment. Although we anticipate a reduction in R&D spending on existing products in this vertical. The low price of oil is causing headwinds in the energy sector. Fortunately, this vertical accounts for a relatively small portion of our business.
Let me turn now to a geographical view. Relative to our expected performance of the geographies at the time of our last earnings call, we believe North America will fare the best. North America has a largest installed base of big enterprise customers, and a number of these customers are due to renew their leases of ANSYS products in 2020. We expect a high renewal rate for those leases, and we also expect to attach new product sales to the renewals. Our North America customer base includes a good percentage of high-tech and semiconductor companies, and we expect their R&D and simulation initiatives to continue to receive funding.
Asia Pacific entered the COVID-19 crisis a few weeks before the rest of the world. We did see an initial reduction in demand activity there, but we're now seeing a return of demand. For example, we saw China end Q1 stronger than we had expected, and it continues to have momentum in Q2. The high-tech and semiconductor industry remains strong throughout the region. However, we do see some headwinds in the more traditional automotive investments and the heavy industrials.
We're expecting some disruptions in business in EMEA, in part because of headwinds related to industrial and traditional automotive activities and in part because we saw some customers struggle with the transition to a work-from-home model. Still, we see relief coming in the form of government programs designed to help companies, especially smaller ones deal with the near-term financial stress.
With all these uncertainties, we are reducing our full year revenue and ACV guidance by mid-single digits, with the greatest impact coming in Q2. Maria will go through guidance in more detail.
Before I finish, I would like to mention that we are preparing a simulation world, our exciting new online conference that brings together simulation thought leaders and users from around the world. Simulation World will feature a who's who event as customers, including Volkswagen Motorsport, Baker Hughes, Ericsson and Porsche Motorsport. Simulation World already has more than 10,000 registrants, demonstrating the value of simulation in the marketplace. I'm very excited that this forum gives us a new and unique opportunity to generate demand for our multiphysics portfolio.
Despite the uncertainties in the market, we believe that our strategy of pervasive simulation and the value that we deliver to our customers is more important than ever. Our strategy accelerates customers' key research and development initiatives, which are not typically impacted by economic slowdowns, and we support critical emerging areas like electrification, autonomy, 5G and the industrial Internet of Things. And our value proposition is compelling to customers, both in good times and in tough economic times because we can help our customers drive both top line revenue growth and achieve significant cost savings. I am confident in our ability to continue to drive long-term growth. And with our continued investment in the business, I believe we are well positioned to emerge from this crisis stronger than ever.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Maria to discuss our financials for Q1 and provide more detail around our outlook and assumptions for the remainder of 2020. Maria?"

I'll begin with a perspective on our first quarter financial performance. Then I'll also provide qualitative and quantitative color and context around our outlook assumptions for Q2 and the remainder of 2020.  In connection with our updated outlook, I will encourage you to please review all of the earnings documents that we have posted to our Investor Relations website.
Before I get started, I wanted to take a moment to say thank you to my ANSYS colleagues, who have all successfully navigated the work-from-home transition to enable us to continue to operate our business, support our customers and to be able to meet all of our financial reporting deadlines, including all of the efforts that have gone into supporting today's earnings call. Your teamwork, flexibility, dedication and innovation have been personally inspiring. And for that, I just want to say thank you.
Although we faced a more challenging customer demand environment in the latter part of March as compared to our expectations at the time that we provided our February guidance, our financial results reflect solid execution, which yielded revenue, operating margin and EPS, all towards the midpoint of the guidance ranges that we previously provided for the quarter.
Our start to the year is very encouraging when considering the tough Q1 2019 comparable, in which we reported double-digit revenue growth and the negative impact that COVID-19 inflicted on global economies in the first quarter.
Our key financial metrics begin with Q1 ACV of $301 million, with 82% coming from recurring sources and total revenue of $309 million. I will add that the key currency exchange rates were within the ranges that we provided with our first quarter guidance. We closed the quarter with a total balance of deferred revenue and backlog of $835 million, representing a 24% increase over last year's first quarter balance.
During the quarter, we continued to manage our business with fiscal discipline, which yielded a solid first quarter gross margin of 88% and an operating margin of 29%, in line with our Q1 guidance. Margins were positively impacted by a slower pace of hiring than we had planned as well as reduced travel and corporate event spending. These positive variances were partially offset by higher bad debt expense.  The net result was first quarter EPS of $0.83, which was slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range.
With respect to taxes, our effective tax rate in Q1 was 19.5%. And going forward, we have adopted a normalized effective tax rate approach for non-GAAP reporting and expect our effective tax rate to remain at 19.5% for the full year. Our cash flow from operations totaled $147 million, and we ended the quarter with a total of $718 million in cash and short-term investments.
In line with our capital allocation priorities, we repurchased 690,000 shares during the quarter at an average price of $233.48. We have 2.8 million shares available for repurchase under the current authorized program. Against the backdrop of ongoing volatility and uncertainty in the global markets, we will continue to assess both our own financial performance as well as market conditions as they continue to evolve in determining when might be the most opportune time to reinstate any future share repurchases.
Through the combination of our current cash position, the additional $500 million that we have available under our undrawn revolver and our projections for 2020 operating cash flow, we believe that we have ample liquidity to continue to progress against our long-term strategy, while at the same time, remaining cognizant of the current environment.
Now let me turn to the topic of guidance. As this crisis has evolved, our team has created multiple scenarios to build out what we believe is the most appropriate framework for giving investors a forward-looking view of the business based upon everything that we currently know. That being said, because of the very significant market and economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 outbreak, our ranges for outlook are wider than those that we have historically provided.
Let me also add that the entirety of our guidance reduction relates to the expected effects of the global pandemic. Factoring in our Q1 results, we are initiating guidance for Q2 and updating our revenue, EPS, ACV and operating cash flow outlook for the full year. This update reflects our current views for the remainder of the year as well as the minor contribution from the Lumerical acquisition that we closed on April 1.
For the second quarter, we expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of $335 million to $375 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.01 to $1.33. This outlook assumes that we will experience the most significant business disruption in the second quarter. Based upon discussions with our customers and channel partners, we anticipate delays in the timing of closing certain transactions and, in particular, larger enterprise deals may be especially challenging. We have also assumed that some customers will delay certain purchases until later in the year.
For the full year, we are updating both the revenue and EPS outlook to non-GAAP revenue in the range of $1.555 billion to $1.630 billion or constant currency growth of 2% to 7%, and EPS in the range of $5.61 to $6.23. We are also updating our full year ACV outlook to a range of $1.5 billion to $1.575 billion. This represents constant currency ACV growth in the range of 3% to 9%.
With respect to the remainder of the year, we expect a modest recovery in the business environment in Q3 as employees return to work and businesses begin to resume operations. Our current assumptions anticipate a stronger recovery in the fourth quarter, buoyed by a combination of sales transactions that may have been deferred from earlier quarters, and the sales outlook for multiyear leases that are currently forecasted to close in Q4.
With respect to annual operating cash flows, we are updating our outlook for 2020 to a range of $425 million to $470 million. This is reflective of our updated full year ACV, revenue and profitability estimates. We have also factored into our outlook an incremental $10 million to $20 million of customer payments that would have otherwise been made in 2020 that may be delayed into 2021 as a result of extended payment term requests on new contracts and delayed payments on existing contracts.
For modeling purposes, we're expecting second quarter operating margins of 33.5% to 39%. And for the full year, we expect operating margins in the range of 40% to 42%. These charges are reflective of our adjusted spending plans for Q2 and the remainder of the year. They include a slower pace of hiring and reduced discretionary spending, as well as decreased spending on certain noncritical facilities and infrastructure projects.
On the other hand, we will continue to invest in certain digital transformation projects such as our global CRM and HRIS initiatives, as these projects are critical elements in building the foundation to efficiently operate and scale our business over the long term.
Further details around specific currency rates and other quantitative and qualitative assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q2 and 2020 are contained in the prepared remarks document.
In our effort to provide greater insight and transparency to investors, we have added additional commentary to our prepared remarks and Form 10-Q, specifically related to the impacts of COVID-19. As a caveat, I will remind everyone that this information is based upon everything that we know as of today. And given the uncertain and unprecedented environment that we are operating under, our assumptions are subject to change. Our current expectations, as reflected in our updated financial outlook, is that there will be a delay in business with an adverse impact on our Q2 and full year results.
Beyond the points that Ajei mentioned earlier, regarding the various elements that have contributed to the resiliency of our business model over the long term, from a financial perspective, I'd also like to highlight our high level of recurring ACV, historically stable renewal rates for both leases and maintenance and the strength of our balance sheet and operating cash flow. We are trying to be as transparent as we can and appreciate that you are all seeking information, details and perspectives on our future outlook. We have tried to take into account the uncertainty, particularly around the timing of larger enterprise deals.
We also trust that you will appreciate that there is no certainty in our assumptions and that things will continue to evolve and change in either direction depending on how will this situation continues to negatively impact global economies, customer sentiment and purchasing decisions as it has since this global pandemic first began in Q1. We will continue to remain focused on the things that we can control, trying to strike a balance between short and long-term strategic initiatives that we believe are critical to our long-term success.
In closing, we are very fortunate to start the year with solid first quarter financial and operational results. Being able to deliver on our Q1 financial commitments, despite the extreme volatility is a testament to both the resiliency of the ANSYS business model and to the collective efforts and dedication of the broader ANSYS ecosystem that includes our employees, customers and partners.
As we look ahead, we remain committed to invest in our business and to continue to execute against our long-term strategic priorities. Our focus and commitment to the long term, combined with our best-in-class product portfolio, long-standing customer relationships and resilient business model give us confidence that we will emerge from this crisis better positioned to capitalize on our long-term growth aspirations.

Meaning where you and your peers seem to be going or ought to go over the next half decade or more. So the question is, there seems to be an incipient arms race going on among engineering software companies in terms of their underlying architectures and data platforms as their future architectures. You have Minerva, PTC recently alluded to Atlas, AUTOBEST Forge. And so, of course, is 3Dx. So the question is, how are you thinking about the long-term impact or importance to you in terms of maintaining or gaining share from this new architecture that you have? And are there any implications in terms of your moving from a highly discrete deliverable schedule, as you just alluded to in your remarks, to more of a continuous flow of deliverables over time?
And then secondly, the question has to do with COVID. And at the risk of extrapolation, are there any attributes of the business that you think might go on indefinitely or that you would have to think about doing more on an ongoing basis? For example, investing more in inside sales, potentially even an e-store or some kind or in some way, all 3 or doing things differently with your many partners like Microsoft, Rockwell, et cetera?"

Let me try to address that -- address the second part first, and then I'll get to the first part. With respect to what you do in a COVID world, as you may have -- as I mentioned in my comments, we have a very large event Simulation World that we're running online. And that is, I think, one of the largest, if not the largest simulation event online. And we have a number of speakers signed up for that. We have, I think, over 10,000 people who have registered and the month is about -- and the event is about a month away. So there's a lot of interest in the technology and the capabilities. And obviously, we're driving demand from online events to -- excuse me, from in-person events to online events.
With respect to our partnership relationships, we continue to drive our relationships with our partners and with our customers and the importance of what we do together remains unchanged.
With respect to the first part of your question, the long-term view of our industry, I think it's important to note that the part of the industry where ANSYS lives which is simulation, we believe, is the most important aspect that customers are dealing with. They need simulation in order to be able to validate the design of the products to be able to design the products. Some of the other companies that you mentioned are in other parts of the end-to-end ecosystem. We're in the simulation space. And we believe that this is an extremely valuable part of the end-to-end ecosystem is something that customers do need.
Now to your point about platforms, look, I think that there is some in the industry who believe that you need to have a single monolithic platform, which is a single source of truth and ideal single vendor monolithic environment. We don't believe that's the case. Our strategy is completely open. We believe instead in an authoritative source of truth, which is an ecosystem of open, federated and purpose-built domain-specific solutions, and we participate in that. And I think that's a much more realistic way of addressing the digital transformation needs of scale. It's not about picking one platform and locking a vendor or locking a customer into a particular platform, it's vendors like ourselves playing in an open environment, recognizing that we need to be in a position to support our customers as they understand how to create these complex products of the future."

Number one is that some customers are not able to access physical labs or were not able to access physical labs. And as a result of that, physical experimentation is suffering. And obviously, simulation does not require you to access a physical lab. You can do all your work on the computer and in a work-from-home scenario. So that has clearly swings away from physical testing towards more simulation activity, and that's obviously a tailwind for us, and that's helpful.
The other thing is -- and I think this has been very well established, part of the value proposition, what part of the value proposition of simulation is really being able to address cost, and in particular, you can reduce the number of physical prototypes, and you can test in parallel instead of serializing a sequence of events, you can test a number of things in parallel on the computer. And the fact that you can reduce cost is an important driver. And again, in these tough economic times, people are looking to reduce costs. And that, again, is a good guide to tailwind for simulation. So I'm pretty excited about those dynamics.
Another point I'd actually like to make, which is kind of interesting is we've been able to deliver that unique pass situation as the pandemic as we've been able to deliver a number of simulation-based insights to out there. People have been using our technology to come up with ideas or assessments of things like social distancing, the creation of PPE, the creation of medical -- rapid creation of medical devices and a lot of that is being done because of the speed and the rating case at which of this work is being done, it was unexpected. A lot of that work is being done through simulation as well. And that also demonstrates the effectiveness of simulation if you start to think about the agility that we can bring to bear."

I hope that you are healthy and safe during these uncertain times. I would like to start by thanking the entire ANSYS team. Their professionalism, commitment during this crisis has been exemplary and it made a tremendous difference for our customers.
Let me first talk about how ANSYS responded to COVID-19 and describe our Q1 performance and how we are operating our business in these unusual times. Then I will take a step back and discuss the ANSYS business as a whole, specifically why ANSYS is important to customers and why the business is resilient. Finally, I will provide some color on key elements of the business going forward, including a description of some of the headwinds that we are seeing before I turn the call over to Maria.
Of course, ANSYS' first responsibility is to the health and safety of our employees and their families and to the ANSYS community around the world. In mid-February, we closed our offices in China and enabled our employees to work from home. As the crisis spread, we closed other locations around the world. Today, with the improving situation in China and Korea, our offices in those countries are open with our employees maintaining appropriate social distances and health and safety protocols. Our offices elsewhere remain closed or open only to essential staff with the vast majority of employees worldwide continuing to work from home. Our employees have quickly adapted to the challenge, and we are fully engaged in driving our business forward in the work-from-home model.
In the last several years, we have invested in our infrastructure and business applications, including our networking and remote access capabilities as well as collaboration technology. These investments have turned out to be invaluable and are helping us run our business today. We are continuing to pay all our salaried and hourly workers, and we are not planning any job action. In fact, we are onboarding new employees remotely and provisioning them to work from home. We have a number of open job requisitions and are seeing a strong flow of candidates who are looking for the stability that a company like ANSYS can provide. We believe that our ongoing investments in our growing team put ANSYS in a strong position to capture additional opportunity once this crisis is abated.
As you may recall from when we guided in February, we were expecting the first quarter and the first half of the year to be challenging because of tough year-over-year compare, the effect of China sanctions and a back-end loaded full year. Of course, worldwide economic conditions worsened through March. Nonetheless, I am very proud that the solid execution by the ANSYS team, our revenue, earnings and operating margin for Q1 came in just about at the midpoint of our guidance.
In Q1, we saw strength in a number of industries, including automotive, high-tech and energy. In these verticals, our solutions that support the key initiatives of autonomy, electrification and 5G continue to resonate with our customers. For example, in Asia, we inked a new 3-year contract with an existing consumer electronics customer to expand its usage of our flagship multiphysics solutions as well as to expand into digital twins.
In North America, we closed several large deals in the high-tech and semiconductor sectors, including at a global hardware provider that agreed to standardize on ANSYS, displacing several competitors. We also closed a 7-figure deal with NuScale Power to bring its small modular nuclear reactor designs to reality through the power of simulation. We were also able to forge new relationships with organizations that have not previously used ANSYS.
For example, we signed a 7-figure contract with a new customer, Software Motor Company or SMC. By using ANSYS multiphysics solutions supported by ANSYS Cloud, SMC is developing an automated workflow to rapidly design and analyze motors to be used across industries. The enhanced workflow can compress the weeks of simulation and months of prototype testing typically required for these virtually silent motors.  In Q1, we delivered Ansys 2020 Release 1 and despite working from home, we will deliver our release to the customers in the summer as originally scheduled.
These are major releases and include new capabilities across our multiphysics product portfolio. All products continue to receive recognition and accolades from our customers and partners. For example, industry leader, TSMC recently certified ANSYS RedHawk-SC next-generation system-on-chip power noise sign off-platform for TSMC's FinFET process nodes. This helps customers verify the power requirements and the reliability of chips we use in artificial intelligence, machine learning, 5G and high-performance computing applications.
Similarly, Samsung Foundry has certified the ANSYS RaptorH electromagnetic simulation solution for design using its new 3-dimensional integrated circuit packaging technology. RaptorH marries the best-in-class engines from ANSYS RaptorX, which we gained in last year's Helic acquisition and ANSYS flagship HFSS into a single chip packet system design environment. By validating electromagnetic effects in Samsung's 3D assembly, RaptorH empowers designers to eliminate critical points of failure and accelerate the rate of new technology adoption.
We are continuing to look at opportunities to expand our portfolio through M&A. We recently closed our acquisition of Lumerical, which will enable ANSYS customers to predict the behavior of light within complex photonic devices, structures and systems. This is critical as 5G applications and autonomous vehicles are producing massive amounts of data, forcing organizations to handle even more information faster than ever. Lumerical's products enable designers to develop new, high-throughput optical networks by modeling the most challenging problems in photonics, including interacting optical, electrical and thermal effects. We were able to virtually onboard the Lumerical team, and I'm excited to welcome them into our ONE Ansys family.
I'd now like to discuss the ANSYS business and explain its resilience. The ANSYS value proposition is compelling, both in good times and in tough economic times because simulation helps our customers drive both top line revenue growth and achieve significant cost savings. Using ANSYS simulation, customers can rapidly innovate, easily validate design ideas and improve cycle time. This means that they can launch more of the right products, and do so at a faster pace, which translates to top line growth.
In addition, simulation can help customers get more impact from tight R&D budgets by giving engineers the tools to evaluate multiple design options cost effectively and in parallel and by reducing or even eliminating the need for costly physical testing. That is particularly relevant during this global crisis when some customers cannot get access to their labs physically test products. The compelling value and the mission-critical nature of simulation is why customers continue to rely on ANSYS even during periods of uncertainty. It is important to note that the bulk of customers' investments in simulation comes from their research and development or R&D budgets. R&D is the lifeblood of our customers. It's the key differentiator. Our experience is that in tough economic times, R&D is typically the least impacted by budget cuts and the first restored, primarily because it drives future growth and market success. We believe that this is a commonly accepted perspective, and it is corroborated by studies in the Harvard Business Review and by the consulting firm, MacKenzie. 
This ongoing investment in R&D and in simulation in tough economic times is best illustrated in the automotive industry, where softening demand and worker safety concerns caused by the COVID-19 crisis have forced manufacturers to shut down factories and cut budgets. However, Volkswagen, General Motors, Honda and other automakers have publicly reported continued investments in R&D, especially in next-generation technologies, such as autonomy and electrification. If you recall from earlier discussions, these next-generation technologies are exactly where ANSYS has been making strategic investments through both organic development and acquisitions. At ANSYS, we continue to see investments in simulation by automotive OEMs and their suppliers across geographies.
Let me give you 2 examples from Q2. In Asia, DENSO, the Tier 1 automotive supplier, recently signed a 3-year multimillion-dollar deal to adopt ANSYS solutions for automotive parts development for electrification and autonomy as well as for our platform technologies. In Europe, our channel partner, DYNAmore, recently inked an important deal with a major automotive OEM for the adoption of LS-DYNA for virtual crash testing, replacing a competitive product. This is exciting news, indeed, coming just a few months after we closed the acquisition of LSTC.
As I also discussed at last year's Investor Day, ANSYS is a resilient model due in part to the number and diversity of customers we serve. We have thousands of customers across multiple industries, including high-tech, semiconductor, aerospace, defense, automotive, industrial and energy. And we are well balanced across the geographies with about 40% of our business coming from the Americas and the rest split roughly evenly between Europe and Asia. That diversity means that we can harness growth from a wide variety of sources. And it also means that we are resilient to the business or economic dynamics of any individual customer, industry or country.
Furthermore, our sales channels are diversified with about 75% coming from our direct force, with the remainder coming from channel partners. We are very flexible in our licensing and consumption models, and customers can purchase a perpetual license, a lease license, or a pay-as-you-go elastic license and can consume our technology on-premises or in the cloud. We believe this diversity and flexibility allows us to reach and support a broad range of customers around the world.
I'd now like to give some color on the challenges our users are facing and how we're accommodating them and provide additional comments on the demand environment, including a perspective by industry and by geography. It is important to note that our analysis of demand has already been factored into our Q2 and full year guidance. Let me also caution that with the unprecedented market volatility we are all experiencing, demand could change in either direction as the global situation continues to evolve. We expect the most significant business disruption to occur in the second quarter when our teams and those of our customers work remotely. We are currently assuming a modest recovery in the business environment during the third quarter as states and countries slowly reopen, and business and consumer sentiment begins to improve. We also assume business activity and customer sentiments will continue to improve through the fourth quarter.
Comparing this period of disruption with the pre-COVID environment, we expect different kinds of customers will be impacted in different ways. First, it is likely to be more challenging to close deals with brand new customers, primarily because of the difficulty in building new relationships and driving demand with new prospects remotely. Fortunately, for ANSYS, over the course of our 50-year history, we have built a large and loyal customer base. And so while new customers are important, the majority of our business comes from existing customers.
Second, we expect larger accounts to perform more strongly than small- and medium-sized businesses. This is to our advantage as the majority of our business comes from these larger accounts. Larger customers have stronger liquidity and capital position, and we believe that a majority of them will be able to maintain their R&D cycles. In contrast, smaller customers tend to be more sensitive to liquidity constraints and are more likely to delay purchases. So, however, that we believe government programs, especially in Europe, will mitigate some of this risk.
Furthermore, during this period of disruption, we expect renewal rates to remain strong, although new business will come under incremental pressure. We also expect customers to prefer leases over perpetual because of the smaller initial financial commitment of the lease. And we will see additional scrutiny given to large multiyear contracts, which could result in delays in signing or perhaps smaller commitments than we had previously expected. This could introduce incremental timing uncertainty into our top line. Our prepared remarks contain a more comprehensive discussion of the attributes affecting our pipeline conversion and their related impact.
With that backdrop, I'll shift to an industry view. We are seeing little to no reduction in demand in the high-tech and semiconductor vertical, which accounted for about 1/3 of our business in 2019. Many of these customers have deep pockets and are developing products against a multiyear road map, and they are not willing to let a few quarters of uncertainties slowing down. Other companies in large markets such as 5G are in a global race for leadership positions within their industry and are unwilling to delay their R&D efforts and thus see their future to a competitor.
Let me now move to aerospace and defense. We anticipate investments will continue for defense and military aerospace, driven by long-term government programs, and we expect to see little to no reduction in demand for ANSYS technology in this vertical. Commercial aerospace and contracts will be impacted in the short term, driven by both pre-COVID challenges faced by some companies and by the dramatic reduction in passenger air travel as a result of this pandemic. However, in the medium to long term, I believe this will be somewhat mitigated by the continued need of long-term R&D initiatives that address environmental issues and government regulations.
In the automotive industry, although there has been widespread idling of manufacturing plans, R&D are still receiving funding. And that is particularly true for emerging solutions like autonomy and electrification where ANSYS plays a key role. However, we are expecting to see headwinds on more traditional R&D activities in the sector. Given the need for competitive differentiation, we expect to see ongoing investments in new product introductions for industrial equipment. Although we anticipate a reduction in R&D spending on existing products in this vertical. The low price of oil is causing headwinds in the energy sector. Fortunately, this vertical accounts for a relatively small portion of our business.
Let me turn now to a geographical view. Relative to our expected performance of the geographies at the time of our last earnings call, we believe North America will fare the best. North America has a largest installed base of big enterprise customers, and a number of these customers are due to renew their leases of ANSYS products in 2020. We expect a high renewal rate for those leases, and we also expect to attach new product sales to the renewals. Our North America customer base includes a good percentage of high-tech and semiconductor companies, and we expect their R&D and simulation initiatives to continue to receive funding.
Asia Pacific entered the COVID-19 crisis a few weeks before the rest of the world. We did see an initial reduction in demand activity there, but we're now seeing a return of demand. For example, we saw China end Q1 stronger than we had expected, and it continues to have momentum in Q2. The high-tech and semiconductor industry remains strong throughout the region. However, we do see some headwinds in the more traditional automotive investments and the heavy industrials.
We're expecting some disruptions in business in EMEA, in part because of headwinds related to industrial and traditional automotive activities and in part because we saw some customers struggle with the transition to a work-from-home model. Still, we see relief coming in the form of government programs designed to help companies, especially smaller ones deal with the near-term financial stress.
With all these uncertainties, we are reducing our full year revenue and ACV guidance by mid-single digits, with the greatest impact coming in Q2. Maria will go through guidance in more detail.
Before I finish, I would like to mention that we are preparing a simulation world, our exciting new online conference that brings together simulation thought leaders and users from around the world. Simulation World will feature a who's who event as customers, including Volkswagen Motorsport, Baker Hughes, Ericsson and Porsche Motorsport. Simulation World already has more than 10,000 registrants, demonstrating the value of simulation in the marketplace. I'm very excited that this forum gives us a new and unique opportunity to generate demand for our multiphysics portfolio.
Despite the uncertainties in the market, we believe that our strategy of pervasive simulation and the value that we deliver to our customers is more important than ever. Our strategy accelerates customers' key research and development initiatives, which are not typically impacted by economic slowdowns, and we support critical emerging areas like electrification, autonomy, 5G and the industrial Internet of Things. And our value proposition is compelling to customers, both in good times and in tough economic times because we can help our customers drive both top line revenue growth and achieve significant cost savings. I am confident in our ability to continue to drive long-term growth. And with our continued investment in the business, I believe we are well positioned to emerge from this crisis stronger than ever.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Maria to discuss our financials for Q1 and provide more detail around our outlook and assumptions for the remainder of 2020. Maria?"

I'll begin with a perspective on our first quarter financial performance. Then I'll also provide qualitative and quantitative color and context around our outlook assumptions for Q2 and the remainder of 2020.  In connection with our updated outlook, I will encourage you to please review all of the earnings documents that we have posted to our Investor Relations website.
Before I get started, I wanted to take a moment to say thank you to my ANSYS colleagues, who have all successfully navigated the work-from-home transition to enable us to continue to operate our business, support our customers and to be able to meet all of our financial reporting deadlines, including all of the efforts that have gone into supporting today's earnings call. Your teamwork, flexibility, dedication and innovation have been personally inspiring. And for that, I just want to say thank you.
Although we faced a more challenging customer demand environment in the latter part of March as compared to our expectations at the time that we provided our February guidance, our financial results reflect solid execution, which yielded revenue, operating margin and EPS, all towards the midpoint of the guidance ranges that we previously provided for the quarter.
Our start to the year is very encouraging when considering the tough Q1 2019 comparable, in which we reported double-digit revenue growth and the negative impact that COVID-19 inflicted on global economies in the first quarter.
Our key financial metrics begin with Q1 ACV of $301 million, with 82% coming from recurring sources and total revenue of $309 million. I will add that the key currency exchange rates were within the ranges that we provided with our first quarter guidance. We closed the quarter with a total balance of deferred revenue and backlog of $835 million, representing a 24% increase over last year's first quarter balance.
During the quarter, we continued to manage our business with fiscal discipline, which yielded a solid first quarter gross margin of 88% and an operating margin of 29%, in line with our Q1 guidance. Margins were positively impacted by a slower pace of hiring than we had planned as well as reduced travel and corporate event spending. These positive variances were partially offset by higher bad debt expense.  The net result was first quarter EPS of $0.83, which was slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range.
With respect to taxes, our effective tax rate in Q1 was 19.5%. And going forward, we have adopted a normalized effective tax rate approach for non-GAAP reporting and expect our effective tax rate to remain at 19.5% for the full year. Our cash flow from operations totaled $147 million, and we ended the quarter with a total of $718 million in cash and short-term investments.
In line with our capital allocation priorities, we repurchased 690,000 shares during the quarter at an average price of $233.48. We have 2.8 million shares available for repurchase under the current authorized program. Against the backdrop of ongoing volatility and uncertainty in the global markets, we will continue to assess both our own financial performance as well as market conditions as they continue to evolve in determining when might be the most opportune time to reinstate any future share repurchases.
Through the combination of our current cash position, the additional $500 million that we have available under our undrawn revolver and our projections for 2020 operating cash flow, we believe that we have ample liquidity to continue to progress against our long-term strategy, while at the same time, remaining cognizant of the current environment.
Now let me turn to the topic of guidance. As this crisis has evolved, our team has created multiple scenarios to build out what we believe is the most appropriate framework for giving investors a forward-looking view of the business based upon everything that we currently know. That being said, because of the very significant market and economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 outbreak, our ranges for outlook are wider than those that we have historically provided.
Let me also add that the entirety of our guidance reduction relates to the expected effects of the global pandemic. Factoring in our Q1 results, we are initiating guidance for Q2 and updating our revenue, EPS, ACV and operating cash flow outlook for the full year. This update reflects our current views for the remainder of the year as well as the minor contribution from the Lumerical acquisition that we closed on April 1.
For the second quarter, we expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of $335 million to $375 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.01 to $1.33. This outlook assumes that we will experience the most significant business disruption in the second quarter. Based upon discussions with our customers and channel partners, we anticipate delays in the timing of closing certain transactions and, in particular, larger enterprise deals may be especially challenging. We have also assumed that some customers will delay certain purchases until later in the year.
For the full year, we are updating both the revenue and EPS outlook to non-GAAP revenue in the range of $1.555 billion to $1.630 billion or constant currency growth of 2% to 7%, and EPS in the range of $5.61 to $6.23. We are also updating our full year ACV outlook to a range of $1.5 billion to $1.575 billion. This represents constant currency ACV growth in the range of 3% to 9%.
With respect to the remainder of the year, we expect a modest recovery in the business environment in Q3 as employees return to work and businesses begin to resume operations. Our current assumptions anticipate a stronger recovery in the fourth quarter, buoyed by a combination of sales transactions that may have been deferred from earlier quarters, and the sales outlook for multiyear leases that are currently forecasted to close in Q4.
With respect to annual operating cash flows, we are updating our outlook for 2020 to a range of $425 million to $470 million. This is reflective of our updated full year ACV, revenue and profitability estimates. We have also factored into our outlook an incremental $10 million to $20 million of customer payments that would have otherwise been made in 2020 that may be delayed into 2021 as a result of extended payment term requests on new contracts and delayed payments on existing contracts.
For modeling purposes, we're expecting second quarter operating margins of 33.5% to 39%. And for the full year, we expect operating margins in the range of 40% to 42%. These charges are reflective of our adjusted spending plans for Q2 and the remainder of the year. They include a slower pace of hiring and reduced discretionary spending, as well as decreased spending on certain noncritical facilities and infrastructure projects.
On the other hand, we will continue to invest in certain digital transformation projects such as our global CRM and HRIS initiatives, as these projects are critical elements in building the foundation to efficiently operate and scale our business over the long term.
Further details around specific currency rates and other quantitative and qualitative assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q2 and 2020 are contained in the prepared remarks document.
In our effort to provide greater insight and transparency to investors, we have added additional commentary to our prepared remarks and Form 10-Q, specifically related to the impacts of COVID-19. As a caveat, I will remind everyone that this information is based upon everything that we know as of today. And given the uncertain and unprecedented environment that we are operating under, our assumptions are subject to change. Our current expectations, as reflected in our updated financial outlook, is that there will be a delay in business with an adverse impact on our Q2 and full year results.
Beyond the points that Ajei mentioned earlier, regarding the various elements that have contributed to the resiliency of our business model over the long term, from a financial perspective, I'd also like to highlight our high level of recurring ACV, historically stable renewal rates for both leases and maintenance and the strength of our balance sheet and operating cash flow. We are trying to be as transparent as we can and appreciate that you are all seeking information, details and perspectives on our future outlook. We have tried to take into account the uncertainty, particularly around the timing of larger enterprise deals.
We also trust that you will appreciate that there is no certainty in our assumptions and that things will continue to evolve and change in either direction depending on how will this situation continues to negatively impact global economies, customer sentiment and purchasing decisions as it has since this global pandemic first began in Q1. We will continue to remain focused on the things that we can control, trying to strike a balance between short and long-term strategic initiatives that we believe are critical to our long-term success.
In closing, we are very fortunate to start the year with solid first quarter financial and operational results. Being able to deliver on our Q1 financial commitments, despite the extreme volatility is a testament to both the resiliency of the ANSYS business model and to the collective efforts and dedication of the broader ANSYS ecosystem that includes our employees, customers and partners.
As we look ahead, we remain committed to invest in our business and to continue to execute against our long-term strategic priorities. Our focus and commitment to the long term, combined with our best-in-class product portfolio, long-standing customer relationships and resilient business model give us confidence that we will emerge from this crisis better positioned to capitalize on our long-term growth aspirations.

Meaning where you and your peers seem to be going or ought to go over the next half decade or more. So the question is, there seems to be an incipient arms race going on among engineering software companies in terms of their underlying architectures and data platforms as their future architectures. You have Minerva, PTC recently alluded to Atlas, AUTOBEST Forge. And so, of course, is 3Dx. So the question is, how are you thinking about the long-term impact or importance to you in terms of maintaining or gaining share from this new architecture that you have? And are there any implications in terms of your moving from a highly discrete deliverable schedule, as you just alluded to in your remarks, to more of a continuous flow of deliverables over time?
And then secondly, the question has to do with COVID. And at the risk of extrapolation, are there any attributes of the business that you think might go on indefinitely or that you would have to think about doing more on an ongoing basis? For example, investing more in inside sales, potentially even an e-store or some kind or in some way, all 3 or doing things differently with your many partners like Microsoft, Rockwell, et cetera?"

Let me try to address that -- address the second part first, and then I'll get to the first part. With respect to what you do in a COVID world, as you may have -- as I mentioned in my comments, we have a very large event Simulation World that we're running online. And that is, I think, one of the largest, if not the largest simulation event online. And we have a number of speakers signed up for that. We have, I think, over 10,000 people who have registered and the month is about -- and the event is about a month away. So there's a lot of interest in the technology and the capabilities. And obviously, we're driving demand from online events to -- excuse me, from in-person events to online events.
With respect to our partnership relationships, we continue to drive our relationships with our partners and with our customers and the importance of what we do together remains unchanged.
With respect to the first part of your question, the long-term view of our industry, I think it's important to note that the part of the industry where ANSYS lives which is simulation, we believe, is the most important aspect that customers are dealing with. They need simulation in order to be able to validate the design of the products to be able to design the products. Some of the other companies that you mentioned are in other parts of the end-to-end ecosystem. We're in the simulation space. And we believe that this is an extremely valuable part of the end-to-end ecosystem is something that customers do need.
Now to your point about platforms, look, I think that there is some in the industry who believe that you need to have a single monolithic platform, which is a single source of truth and ideal single vendor monolithic environment. We don't believe that's the case. Our strategy is completely open. We believe instead in an authoritative source of truth, which is an ecosystem of open, federated and purpose-built domain-specific solutions, and we participate in that. And I think that's a much more realistic way of addressing the digital transformation needs of scale. It's not about picking one platform and locking a vendor or locking a customer into a particular platform, it's vendors like ourselves playing in an open environment, recognizing that we need to be in a position to support our customers as they understand how to create these complex products of the future."

And also thanks by the way for the detailed guidance during this uncertain time, certainly not everybody is doing that, so I wanted to acknowledge. Maybe first for you, Maria. And I think you touched on this in a prior question, but just to ask it expressly. Clearly, we've seen more of a shift to lease contracts in this environment versus perpetual for a range of reasons. But I'm wondering what you've seen on contract terms and how are you thinking about that in the guide this year? So specifically, are your lease customers still largely opting for multiyear contracts? Or have some maybe opted to shorten that given the current environment?"

At the enterprise level, we are still seeing our large customers thinking long-term because R&D is really a long-term investment. And so an example that Ajei spoke to in his remarks is DENSO, a very long-standing customer that just entered into a 3-year multiyear lease. Where we're really seeing the biggest dynamic right now and what we built into our outlook for 2020 is that at the small-medium business level, that those customers are probably -- and we're seeing some of this going to choose an annual lease versus a paid up just given the current economic environment and their access to capital. But I will also just comment that today, the majority of our leases are still annual leases. That transition to multiyear leases has really been the journey at the enterprise and strategic level because that  customer tends to think longer term than perhaps smaller businesses do."

Number one is that some customers are not able to access physical labs or were not able to access physical labs. And as a result of that, physical experimentation is suffering. And obviously, simulation does not require you to access a physical lab. You can do all your work on the computer and in a work-from-home scenario. So that has clearly swings away from physical testing towards more simulation activity, and that's obviously a tailwind for us, and that's helpful.
The other thing is -- and I think this has been very well established, part of the value proposition, what part of the value proposition of simulation is really being able to address cost, and in particular, you can reduce the number of physical prototypes, and you can test in parallel instead of serializing a sequence of events, you can test a number of things in parallel on the computer. And the fact that you can reduce cost is an important driver. And again, in these tough economic times, people are looking to reduce costs. And that, again, is a good guide to tailwind for simulation. So I'm pretty excited about those dynamics.
Another point I'd actually like to make, which is kind of interesting is we've been able to deliver that unique pass situation as the pandemic as we've been able to deliver a number of simulation-based insights to out there. People have been using our technology to come up with ideas or assessments of things like social distancing, the creation of PPE, the creation of medical -- rapid creation of medical devices and a lot of that is being done because of the speed and the rating case at which of this work is being done, it was unexpected. A lot of that work is being done through simulation as well. And that also demonstrates the effectiveness of simulation if you start to think about the agility that we can bring to bear."

I hope that you are healthy and safe during these uncertain times. I would like to start by thanking the entire ANSYS team. Their professionalism, commitment during this crisis has been exemplary and it made a tremendous difference for our customers.
Let me first talk about how ANSYS responded to COVID-19 and describe our Q1 performance and how we are operating our business in these unusual times. Then I will take a step back and discuss the ANSYS business as a whole, specifically why ANSYS is important to customers and why the business is resilient. Finally, I will provide some color on key elements of the business going forward, including a description of some of the headwinds that we are seeing before I turn the call over to Maria.
Of course, ANSYS' first responsibility is to the health and safety of our employees and their families and to the ANSYS community around the world. In mid-February, we closed our offices in China and enabled our employees to work from home. As the crisis spread, we closed other locations around the world. Today, with the improving situation in China and Korea, our offices in those countries are open with our employees maintaining appropriate social distances and health and safety protocols. Our offices elsewhere remain closed or open only to essential staff with the vast majority of employees worldwide continuing to work from home. Our employees have quickly adapted to the challenge, and we are fully engaged in driving our business forward in the work-from-home model.
In the last several years, we have invested in our infrastructure and business applications, including our networking and remote access capabilities as well as collaboration technology. These investments have turned out to be invaluable and are helping us run our business today. We are continuing to pay all our salaried and hourly workers, and we are not planning any job action. In fact, we are onboarding new employees remotely and provisioning them to work from home. We have a number of open job requisitions and are seeing a strong flow of candidates who are looking for the stability that a company like ANSYS can provide. We believe that our ongoing investments in our growing team put ANSYS in a strong position to capture additional opportunity once this crisis is abated.
As you may recall from when we guided in February, we were expecting the first quarter and the first half of the year to be challenging because of tough year-over-year compare, the effect of China sanctions and a back-end loaded full year. Of course, worldwide economic conditions worsened through March. Nonetheless, I am very proud that the solid execution by the ANSYS team, our revenue, earnings and operating margin for Q1 came in just about at the midpoint of our guidance.
In Q1, we saw strength in a number of industries, including automotive, high-tech and energy. In these verticals, our solutions that support the key initiatives of autonomy, electrification and 5G continue to resonate with our customers. For example, in Asia, we inked a new 3-year contract with an existing consumer electronics customer to expand its usage of our flagship multiphysics solutions as well as to expand into digital twins.
In North America, we closed several large deals in the high-tech and semiconductor sectors, including at a global hardware provider that agreed to standardize on ANSYS, displacing several competitors. We also closed a 7-figure deal with NuScale Power to bring its small modular nuclear reactor designs to reality through the power of simulation. We were also able to forge new relationships with organizations that have not previously used ANSYS.
For example, we signed a 7-figure contract with a new customer, Software Motor Company or SMC. By using ANSYS multiphysics solutions supported by ANSYS Cloud, SMC is developing an automated workflow to rapidly design and analyze motors to be used across industries. The enhanced workflow can compress the weeks of simulation and months of prototype testing typically required for these virtually silent motors.  In Q1, we delivered Ansys 2020 Release 1 and despite working from home, we will deliver our Release 2 to customers in the summer as originally scheduled.
These are major releases and include new capabilities across our multiphysics product portfolio. All products continue to receive recognition and accolades from our customers and partners. For example, industry leader, TSMC recently certified ANSYS RedHawk-SC next-generation system-on-chip power noise sign off-platform for TSMC's FinFET process nodes. This helps customers verify the power requirements and the reliability of chips we use in artificial intelligence, machine learning, 5G and high-performance computing applications.
Similarly, Samsung Foundry has certified the ANSYS RaptorH electromagnetic simulation solution for design using its new 3-dimensional integrated circuit packaging technology. RaptorH marries the best-in-class engines from ANSYS RaptorX, which we gained in last year's Helic acquisition and ANSYS flagship HFSS into a single chip packet system design environment. By validating electromagnetic effects in Samsung's 3D assembly, RaptorH empowers designers to eliminate critical points of failure and accelerate the rate of new technology adoption.
We are continuing to look at opportunities to expand our portfolio through M&A. We recently closed our acquisition of Lumerical, which will enable ANSYS customers to predict the behavior of light within complex photonic devices, structures and systems. This is critical as 5G applications and autonomous vehicles are producing massive amounts of data, forcing organizations to handle even more information faster than ever. Lumerical's products enable designers to develop new, high-throughput optical networks by modeling the most challenging problems in photonics, including interacting optical, electrical and thermal effects. We were able to virtually onboard the Lumerical team, and I'm excited to welcome them into our ONE Ansys family.
I'd now like to discuss the ANSYS business and explain its resilience. The ANSYS value proposition is compelling, both in good times and in tough economic times because simulation helps our customers drive both top line revenue growth and achieve significant cost savings. Using ANSYS simulation, customers can rapidly innovate, easily validate design ideas and improve cycle time. This means that they can launch more of the right products, and do so at a faster pace, which translates to top line growth.
In addition, simulation can help customers get more impact from tight R&D budgets by giving engineers the tools to evaluate multiple design options cost effectively and in parallel and by reducing or even eliminating the need for costly physical testing. That is particularly relevant during this global crisis when some customers cannot get access to their labs to physically test products. The compelling value and the mission-critical nature of simulation is why customers continue to rely on ANSYS even during periods of uncertainty. It is important to note that the bulk of customers' investments in simulation comes from their research and development or R&D budgets. R&D is the lifeblood of our customers. It's the key differentiator. Our experience is that in tough economic times, R&D is typically the least impacted by budget cuts and the first restored, primarily because it drives future growth and market success. We believe that this is a commonly accepted perspective, and it is corroborated by studies in the Harvard Business Review and by the consulting firm, McKinsey. 
This ongoing investment in R&D and in simulation in tough economic times is best illustrated in the automotive industry, where softening demand and worker safety concerns caused by the COVID-19 crisis have forced manufacturers to shut down factories and cut budgets. However, Volkswagen, General Motors, Honda and other automakers have publicly reported continued investments in R&D, especially in next-generation technologies, such as autonomy and electrification. If you recall from earlier discussions, these next-generation technologies are exactly where ANSYS has been making strategic investments through both organic development and acquisitions. At ANSYS, we continue to see investments in simulation by automotive OEMs and their suppliers across geographies.
Let me give you 2 examples from Q2. In Asia, DENSO, the Tier 1 automotive supplier, recently signed a 3-year multimillion-dollar deal to adopt ANSYS solutions for automotive parts development for electrification and autonomy as well as for our platform technologies. In Europe, our channel partner, DYNAmore, recently inked an important deal with a major automotive OEM for the adoption of LS-DYNA for virtual crash testing, replacing a competitive product. This is exciting news, indeed, coming just a few months after we closed the acquisition of LSTC.
As I also discussed at last year's Investor Day, ANSYS is a resilient model due in part to the number and diversity of customers we serve. We have thousands of customers across multiple industries, including high-tech, semiconductor, aerospace, defense, automotive, industrial and energy. And we are well balanced across the geographies with about 40% of our business coming from the Americas and the rest split roughly evenly between Europe and Asia. That diversity means that we can harness growth from a wide variety of sources. And it also means that we are resilient to the business or economic dynamics of any individual customer, industry or country.
Furthermore, our sales channels are diversified with about 75% coming from our direct force, with the remainder coming from channel partners. We are very flexible in our licensing and consumption models, and customers can purchase a perpetual license, a lease license, or a pay-as-you-go elastic license and can consume our technology on-premises or in the cloud. We believe this diversity and flexibility allows us to reach and support a broad range of customers around the world.
I'd now like to give some color on the challenges our users are facing and how we're accommodating them and provide additional comments on the demand environment, including a perspective by industry and by geography. It is important to note that our analysis of demand has already been factored into our Q2 and full year guidance. Let me also caution that with the unprecedented market volatility we are all experiencing, demand could change in either direction as the global situation continues to evolve. We expect the most significant business disruption to occur in the second quarter when our teams and those of our customers work remotely. We are currently assuming a modest recovery in the business environment during the third quarter as states and countries slowly reopen, and business and consumer sentiment begins to improve. We also assume business activity and customer sentiments will continue to improve through the fourth quarter.
Comparing this period of disruption with the pre-COVID environment, we expect different kinds of customers will be impacted in different ways. First, it is likely to be more challenging to close deals with brand new customers, primarily because of the difficulty in building new relationships and driving demand with new prospects remotely. Fortunately, for ANSYS, over the course of our 50-year history, we have built a large and loyal customer base. And so while new customers are important, the majority of our business comes from existing customers.
Second, we expect larger accounts to perform more strongly than small- and medium-sized businesses. This is to our advantage as the majority of our business comes from these larger accounts. Larger customers have stronger liquidity and capital position, and we believe that a majority of them will be able to maintain their R&D cycles. In contrast, smaller customers tend to be more sensitive to liquidity constraints and are more likely to delay purchases. So, however, that we believe government programs, especially in Europe, will mitigate some of this risk.
Furthermore, during this period of disruption, we expect renewal rates to remain strong, although new business will come under incremental pressure. We also expect customers to prefer leases over perpetual because of the smaller initial financial commitment of the lease. And we will see additional scrutiny given to large multiyear contracts, which could result in delays in signing or perhaps smaller commitments than we had previously expected. This could introduce incremental timing uncertainty into our top line. Our prepared remarks contain a more comprehensive discussion of the attributes affecting our pipeline conversion and their related impact.
With that backdrop, I'll shift to an industry view. We are seeing little to no reduction in demand in the high-tech and semiconductor vertical, which accounted for about 1/3 of our business in 2019. Many of these customers have deep pockets and are developing products against a multiyear road map, and they are not willing to let a few quarters of uncertainties slow them down. Other companies in large markets such as 5G are in a global race for leadership positions within their industry and are unwilling to delay their R&D efforts and thus cede their future to a competitor.
Let me now move to aerospace and defense. We anticipate investments will continue for defense and military aerospace, driven by long-term government programs, and we expect to see little to no reduction in demand for ANSYS technology in this vertical. Commercial aerospace and contracts will be impacted in the short term, driven by both pre-COVID challenges faced by some companies and by the dramatic reduction in passenger air travel as a result of this pandemic. However, in the medium to long term, I believe this will be somewhat mitigated by the continued need of long-term R&D initiatives that address environmental issues and government regulations.
In the automotive industry, although there has been widespread idling of manufacturing plans, R&D are still receiving funding. And that is particularly true for emerging solutions like autonomy and electrification where ANSYS plays a key role. However, we are expecting to see headwinds on more traditional R&D activities in the sector. Given the need for competitive differentiation, we expect to see ongoing investments in new product introductions for industrial equipment. Although we anticipate a reduction in R&D spending on existing products in this vertical. The low price of oil is causing headwinds in the energy sector. Fortunately, this vertical accounts for a relatively small portion of our business.
Let me turn now to a geographical view. Relative to our expected performance of the geographies at the time of our last earnings call, we believe North America will fare the best. North America has the largest installed base of big enterprise customers, and a number of these customers are due to renew their leases of ANSYS products in 2020. We expect a high renewal rate for those leases, and we also expect to attach new product sales to the renewals. Our North America customer base includes a good percentage of high-tech and semiconductor companies, and we expect their R&D and simulation initiatives to continue to receive funding.
Asia Pacific entered the COVID-19 crisis a few weeks before the rest of the world. We did see an initial reduction in demand activity there, but we're now seeing a return of demand. For example, we saw China end Q1 stronger than we had expected, and it continues to have momentum in Q2. The high-tech and semiconductor industry remains strong throughout the region. However, we do see some headwinds in the more traditional automotive investments and the heavy industrials.
We're expecting some disruptions in business in EMEA, in part because of headwinds related to industrial and traditional automotive activities and in part because we saw some customers struggle with the transition to a work-from-home model. Still, we see relief coming in the form of government programs designed to help companies, especially smaller ones deal with the near-term financial stress.
With all these uncertainties, we are reducing our full year revenue and ACV guidance by mid-single digits, with the greatest impact coming in Q2. Maria will go through guidance in more detail.
Before I finish, I would like to mention that we are preparing a Simulation World, our exciting new online conference that brings together simulation thought leaders and users from around the world. Simulation World will feature a who's who of ANSYS customers, including Volkswagen Motorsport, Baker Hughes, Ericsson and Porsche Motorsport. Simulation World already has more than 10,000 registrants, demonstrating the value of simulation in the marketplace. I'm very excited that this forum gives us a new and unique opportunity to generate demand for our multiphysics portfolio.
Despite the uncertainties in the market, we believe that our strategy of pervasive simulation and the value that we deliver to our customers is more important than ever. Our strategy accelerates customers' key research and development initiatives, which are not typically impacted by economic slowdowns, and we support critical emerging areas like electrification, autonomy, 5G and the industrial Internet of Things. And our value proposition is compelling to customers, both in good times and in tough economic times because we can help our customers drive both top line revenue growth and achieve significant cost savings. I am confident in our ability to continue to drive long-term growth. And with our continued investment in the business, I believe we are well positioned to emerge from this crisis stronger than ever.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Maria to discuss our financials for Q1 and provide more detail around our outlook and assumptions for the remainder of 2020. Maria?"

I'll begin with a perspective on our first quarter financial performance. Then I'll also provide qualitative and quantitative color and context around our outlook assumptions for Q2 and the remainder of 2020.  In connection with our updated outlook, I will encourage you to please review all of the earnings documents that we have posted to our Investor Relations website.
Before I get started, I wanted to take a moment to say thank you to my ANSYS colleagues, who have all successfully navigated the work-from-home transition to enable us to continue to operate our business, support our customers and to be able to meet all of our financial reporting deadlines, including all of the efforts that have gone into supporting today's earnings call. Your teamwork, flexibility, dedication and innovation have been personally inspiring. And for that, I just want to say thank you.
Although we faced a more challenging customer demand environment in the latter part of March as compared to our expectations at the time that we provided our February guidance, our financial results reflect solid execution, which yielded revenue, operating margin and EPS, all towards the midpoint of the guidance ranges that we previously provided for the quarter.
Our start to the year is very encouraging when considering the tough Q1 2019 comparable, in which we reported double-digit revenue growth and the negative impact that COVID-19 inflicted on global economies in the first quarter.
Our key financial metrics begin with Q1 ACV of $301 million, with 82% coming from recurring sources and total revenue of $309 million. I will add that the key currency exchange rates were within the ranges that we provided with our first quarter guidance. We closed the quarter with a total balance of deferred revenue and backlog of $835 million, representing a 24% increase over last year's first quarter balance.
During the quarter, we continued to manage our business with fiscal discipline, which yielded a solid first quarter gross margin of 88% and an operating margin of 29%, in line with our Q1 guidance. Margins were positively impacted by a slower pace of hiring than we had planned as well as reduced travel and corporate event spending. These positive variances were partially offset by higher bad debt expense.  The net result was first quarter EPS of $0.83, which was slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range.
With respect to taxes, our effective tax rate in Q1 was 19.5%. And going forward, we have adopted a normalized effective tax rate approach for non-GAAP reporting and expect our effective tax rate to remain at 19.5% for the full year. Our cash flow from operations totaled $147 million, and we ended the quarter with a total of $718 million in cash and short-term investments.
In line with our capital allocation priorities, we repurchased 690,000 shares during the quarter at an average price of $233.48. We have 2.8 million shares available for repurchase under the current authorized program. Against the backdrop of ongoing volatility and uncertainty in the global markets, we will continue to assess both our own financial performance as well as market conditions as they continue to evolve in determining when might be the most opportune time to reinstate any future share repurchases.
Through the combination of our current cash position, the additional $500 million that we have available under our undrawn revolver and our projections for 2020 operating cash flow, we believe that we have ample liquidity to continue to progress against our long-term strategy, while at the same time, remaining cognizant of the current environment.
Now let me turn to the topic of guidance. As this crisis has evolved, our team has created multiple scenarios to build out what we believe is the most appropriate framework for giving investors a forward-looking view of the business based upon everything that we currently know. That being said, because of the very significant market and economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 outbreak, our ranges for outlook are wider than those that we have historically provided.
Let me also add that the entirety of our guidance reduction relates to the expected effects of the global pandemic. Factoring in our Q1 results, we are initiating guidance for Q2 and updating our revenue, EPS, ACV and operating cash flow outlook for the full year. This update reflects our current views for the remainder of the year as well as the minor contribution from the Lumerical acquisition that we closed on April 1.
For the second quarter, we expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of $335 million to $375 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.01 to $1.33. This outlook assumes that we will experience the most significant business disruption in the second quarter. Based upon discussions with our customers and channel partners, we anticipate delays in the timing of closing certain transactions and, in particular, larger enterprise deals may be especially challenging. We have also assumed that some customers will delay certain purchases until later in the year.
For the full year, we are updating both the revenue and EPS outlook to non-GAAP revenue in the range of $1.555 billion to $1.630 billion or constant currency growth of 2% to 7%, and EPS in the range of $5.61 to $6.23. We are also updating our full year ACV outlook to a range of $1.5 billion to $1.575 billion. This represents constant currency ACV growth in the range of 3% to 9%.
With respect to the remainder of the year, we expect a modest recovery in the business environment in Q3 as employees return to work and businesses begin to resume operations. Our current assumptions anticipate a stronger recovery in the fourth quarter, buoyed by a combination of sales transactions that may have been deferred from earlier quarters, and the sales outlook for multiyear leases that are currently forecasted to close in Q4.
With respect to annual operating cash flows, we are updating our outlook for 2020 to a range of $425 million to $470 million. This is reflective of our updated full year ACV, revenue and profitability estimates. We have also factored into our outlook an incremental $10 million to $20 million of customer payments that would have otherwise been made in 2020 that may be delayed into 2021 as a result of extended payment term requests on new contracts and delayed payments on existing contracts.
For modeling purposes, we're expecting second quarter operating margins of 33.5% to 39%. And for the full year, we expect operating margins in the range of 40% to 42%. These charges are reflective of our adjusted spending plans for Q2 and the remainder of the year. They include a slower pace of hiring and reduced discretionary spending, as well as decreased spending on certain noncritical facilities and infrastructure projects.
On the other hand, we will continue to invest in certain digital transformation projects such as our global CRM and HRIS initiatives, as these projects are critical elements in building the foundation to efficiently operate and scale our business over the long term.
Further details around specific currency rates and other quantitative and qualitative assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q2 and 2020 are contained in the prepared remarks document.
In our effort to provide greater insight and transparency to investors, we have added additional commentary to our prepared remarks and Form 10-Q, specifically related to the impacts of COVID-19. As a caveat, I will remind everyone that this information is based upon everything that we know as of today. And given the uncertain and unprecedented environment that we are operating under, our assumptions are subject to change. Our current expectations, as reflected in our updated financial outlook, is that there will be a delay in business with an adverse impact on our Q2 and full year results.
Beyond the points that Ajei mentioned earlier, regarding the various elements that have contributed to the resiliency of our business model over the long term, from a financial perspective, I'd also like to highlight our high level of recurring ACV, historically stable renewal rates for both leases and maintenance and the strength of our balance sheet and operating cash flow. We are trying to be as transparent as we can and appreciate that you are all seeking information, details and perspectives on our future outlook. We have tried to take into account the uncertainty, particularly around the timing of larger enterprise deals.
We also trust that you will appreciate that there is no certainty in our assumptions and that things will continue to evolve and change in either direction depending on how long this situation continues to negatively impact global economies, customer sentiment and purchasing decisions as it has since this global pandemic first began in Q1. We will continue to remain focused on the things that we can control, trying to strike a balance between short and long-term strategic initiatives that we believe are critical to our long-term success.
In closing, we are very fortunate to start the year with solid first quarter financial and operational results. Being able to deliver on our Q1 financial commitments, despite the extreme volatility is a testament to both the resiliency of the ANSYS business model and to the collective efforts and dedication of the broader ANSYS ecosystem that includes our employees, customers and partners.
As we look ahead, we remain committed to invest in our business and to continue to execute against our long-term strategic priorities. Our focus and commitment to the long term, combined with our best-in-class product portfolio, long-standing customer relationships and resilient business model give us confidence that we will emerge from this crisis better positioned to capitalize on our long-term growth aspirations.

Meaning where you and your peers seem to be going or ought to go over the next half decade or more. So the question is, there seems to be an incipient arms race going on among engineering software companies in terms of their underlying architectures and data platforms as their future architectures. You have Minerva, PTC recently alluded to Atlas, AUTOBEST Forge. Dassault, of course, has 3Dex. So the question is, how are you thinking about the long-term impact or importance to you in terms of maintaining or gaining share from this new architecture that you have? And are there any implications in terms of your moving from a highly discrete deliverable schedule, as you just alluded to in your remarks, to more of a continuous flow of deliverables over time?
And then secondly, the question has to do with COVID. And at the risk of extrapolation, are there any attributes of the business that you think might go on indefinitely or that you would have to think about doing more on an ongoing basis? For example, investing more in inside sales, potentially even an e-store or some kind or in some way, all 3 or doing things differently with your many partners like Microsoft, Rockwell, et cetera?"

Let me try to address that -- address the second part first, and then I'll get to the first part. With respect to what you do in a COVID world, as you may have -- as I mentioned in my comments, we have a very large event Simulation World that we're running online. And that is, I think, one of the largest, if not the largest simulation event online. And we have a number of speakers signed up for that. We have, I think, over 10,000 people who have registered and the month is about -- and the event is about a month away. So there's a lot of interest in the technology and the capabilities. And obviously, we're driving demand from online events to -- excuse me, from in-person events to online events.
With respect to our partnership relationships, we continue to drive our relationships with our partners and with our customers and the importance of what we do together remains unchanged.
With respect to the first part of your question, the long-term view of our industry, I think it's important to note that the part of the industry where ANSYS lives which is simulation, we believe, is the most important aspect that customers are dealing with. They need simulation in order to be able to validate the design of the products to be able to design the products. Some of the other companies that you mentioned are in other parts of the end-to-end ecosystem. We're in the simulation space. And we believe that this is an extremely valuable part of the end-to-end ecosystem, it’s something that customers do need.
Now to your point about platforms, look, I think that there is some in the industry who believe that you need to have a single monolithic platform, which is a single source of truth and ideal single vendor monolithic environment. We don't believe that's the case. Our strategy is completely open. We believe instead in an authoritative source of truth, which is an ecosystem of open, federated and purpose-built domain-specific solutions, and we participate in that. And I think that's a much more realistic way of addressing the digital transformation needs of scale. It's not about picking one platform and locking a vendor or locking a customer into a particular platform, it's vendors like ourselves playing in an open environment, recognizing that we need to be in a position to support our customers as they understand how to create these complex products of the future."

Now that being said, when we gave that guidance, we were basically assuming that COVID-19 was somewhat limited to China and perhaps South Korea. But just like everyone in the world, as March progressed, things got progressively worse as this really became a global pandemic. So as a result of that, a lot of stuff has changed in the past 6 weeks. And so that is why we've modified our full year outlook, which now does factor in what we believe is an elongated impact from COVID-19, the most dramatic being Q2."

Number one is that some customers are not able to access physical labs or were not able to access physical labs. And as a result of that, physical experimentation is suffering. And obviously, simulation does not require you to access a physical lab. You can do all your work on the computer and in a work-from-home scenario. So that has clearly swings away from physical testing towards more simulation activity, and that's obviously a tailwind for us, and that's helpful.
The other thing is -- and I think this has been very well established, part of the value proposition, what part of the value proposition of simulation is really being able to address cost, and in particular, you can reduce the number of physical prototypes, and you can test in parallel instead of serializing a sequence of events, you can test a number of things in parallel on the computer. And the fact that you can reduce cost is an important driver. And again, in these tough economic times, people are looking to reduce costs. And that, again, is a good guide to tailwind for simulation. So I'm pretty excited about those dynamics.
Another point I'd actually like to make, which is kind of interesting is we've been able to deliver that unique pass situation as the pandemic as we've been able to deliver a number of simulation-based insights to out there. People have been using our technology to come up with ideas or assessments of things like social distancing, the creation of PPE, the creation of medical -- rapid creation of medical devices and a lot of that is being done because of the speed and the rate in case at which of this work is being done, it was unexpected. A lot of that work is being done through simulation as well. And that also demonstrates the effectiveness of simulation if you start to think about the agility that we can bring to bear."

I hope that you are healthy and safe during these uncertain times. I would like to start by thanking the entire ANSYS team. Their professionalism, commitment during this crisis has been exemplary and it made a tremendous difference for our customers.
Let me first talk about how ANSYS responded to COVID-19 and describe our Q1 performance and how we are operating our business in these unusual times. Then I will take a step back and discuss the ANSYS business as a whole, specifically why ANSYS is important to customers and why the business is resilient. Finally, I will provide some color on key elements of the business going forward, including a description of some of the headwinds that we are seeing before I turn the call over to Maria.
Of course, ANSYS' first responsibility is to the health and safety of our employees and their families and to the ANSYS community around the world. In mid-February, we closed our offices in China and enabled our employees to work from home. As the crisis spread, we closed other locations around the world. Today, with the improving situation in China and Korea, our offices in those countries are open with our employees maintaining appropriate social distances and health and safety protocols. Our offices elsewhere remain closed or open only to essential staff with the vast majority of employees worldwide continuing to work from home. Our employees have quickly adapted to the challenge, and we are fully engaged in driving our business forward in the work-from-home model.
In the last several years, we have invested in our infrastructure and business applications, including our networking and remote access capabilities as well as collaboration technology. These investments have turned out to be invaluable and are helping us run our business today. We are continuing to pay all our salaried and hourly workers, and we are not planning any job action. In fact, we are onboarding new employees remotely and provisioning them to work from home. We have a number of open job requisitions and are seeing a strong flow of candidates who are looking for the stability that a company like ANSYS can provide. We believe that our ongoing investments in our growing team put ANSYS in a strong position to capture additional opportunity once this crisis is abated.
As you may recall from when we guided in February, we were expecting the first quarter and the first half of the year to be challenging because of tough year-over-year compare, the effect of China sanctions and a back-end loaded full year. Of course, worldwide economic conditions worsened through March. Nonetheless, I am very proud that the solid execution by the ANSYS team, our revenue, earnings and operating margin for Q1 came in just about at the midpoint of our guidance.
In Q1, we saw strength in a number of industries, including automotive, high-tech and energy. In these verticals, our solutions that support the key initiatives of autonomy, electrification and 5G continue to resonate with our customers. For example, in Asia, we inked a new 3-year contract with an existing consumer electronics customer to expand its usage of our flagship multiphysics solutions as well as to expand into digital twins.
In North America, we closed several large deals in the high-tech and semiconductor sectors, including at a global hardware provider that agreed to standardize on ANSYS, displacing several competitors. We also closed a 7-figure deal with NuScale Power to bring its small modular nuclear reactor designs to reality through the power of simulation. We were also able to forge new relationships with organizations that have not previously used ANSYS.
For example, we signed a 7-figure contract with a new customer, Software Motor Company or SMC. By using ANSYS multiphysics solutions supported by ANSYS Cloud, SMC is developing an automated workflow to rapidly design and analyze motors to be used across industries. The enhanced workflow can compress the weeks of simulation and months of prototype testing typically required for these virtually silent motors.  In Q1, we delivered Ansys 2020 Release 1 and despite working from home, we will deliver our Release 2 to customers in the summer as originally scheduled.
These are major releases and include new capabilities across our multiphysics product portfolio. All products continue to receive recognition and accolades from our customers and partners. For example, industry leader, TSMC recently certified ANSYS RedHawk-SC next-generation system-on-chip power noise sign off-platform for TSMC's FinFET process nodes. This helps customers verify the power requirements and the reliability of chips we use in artificial intelligence, machine learning, 5G and high-performance computing applications.
Similarly, Samsung Foundry has certified the ANSYS RaptorH electromagnetic simulation solution for design using its new 3-dimensional integrated circuit packaging technology. RaptorH marries the best-in-class engines from ANSYS RaptorX, which we gained in last year's Helic acquisition and ANSYS flagship HFSS into a single chip packet system design environment. By validating electromagnetic effects in Samsung's 3D assembly, RaptorH empowers designers to eliminate critical points of failure and accelerate the rate of new technology adoption.
We are continuing to look at opportunities to expand our portfolio through M&A. We recently closed our acquisition of Lumerical, which will enable ANSYS customers to predict the behavior of light within complex photonic devices, structures and systems. This is critical as 5G applications and autonomous vehicles are producing massive amounts of data, forcing organizations to handle even more information faster than ever. Lumerical's products enable designers to develop new, high-throughput optical networks by modeling the most challenging problems in photonics, including interacting optical, electrical and thermal effects. We were able to virtually onboard the Lumerical team, and I'm excited to welcome them into our ONE Ansys family.
I'd now like to discuss the ANSYS business and explain its resilience. The ANSYS value proposition is compelling, both in good times and in tough economic times because simulation helps our customers drive both top line revenue growth and achieve significant cost savings. Using ANSYS simulation, customers can rapidly innovate, easily validate design ideas and improve cycle time. This means that they can launch more of the right products, and do so at a faster pace, which translates to top line growth.
In addition, simulation can help customers get more impact from tight R&D budgets by giving engineers the tools to evaluate multiple design options cost effectively and in parallel and by reducing or even eliminating the need for costly physical testing. That is particularly relevant during this global crisis when some customers cannot get access to their labs to physically test products. The compelling value and the mission-critical nature of simulation is why customers continue to rely on ANSYS even during periods of uncertainty. It is important to note that the bulk of customers' investments in simulation comes from their research and development or R&D budgets. R&D is the lifeblood of our customers. It's the key differentiator. Our experience is that in tough economic times, R&D is typically the least impacted by budget cuts and the first restored, primarily because it drives future growth and market success. We believe that this is a commonly accepted perspective, and it is corroborated by studies in the Harvard Business Review and by the consulting firm, McKinsey. 
This ongoing investment in R&D and in simulation in tough economic times is best illustrated in the automotive industry, where softening demand and worker safety concerns caused by the COVID-19 crisis have forced manufacturers to shut down factories and cut budgets. However, Volkswagen, General Motors, Honda and other automakers have publicly reported continued investments in R&D, especially in next-generation technologies, such as autonomy and electrification. If you recall from earlier discussions, these next-generation technologies are exactly where ANSYS has been making strategic investments through both organic development and acquisitions. At ANSYS, we continue to see investments in simulation by automotive OEMs and their suppliers across geographies.
Let me give you 2 examples from Q2. In Asia, DENSO, the Tier 1 automotive supplier, recently signed a 3-year multimillion-dollar deal to adopt ANSYS solutions for automotive parts development for electrification and autonomy as well as for our platform technologies. In Europe, our channel partner, DYNAmore, recently inked an important deal with a major automotive OEM for the adoption of LS-DYNA for virtual crash testing, replacing a competitive product. This is exciting news, indeed, coming just a few months after we closed the acquisition of LSTC.
As I also discussed at last year's Investor Day, ANSYS is a resilient model due in part to the number and diversity of customers we serve. We have thousands of customers across multiple industries, including high-tech, semiconductor, aerospace, defense, automotive, industrial and energy. And we are well balanced across the geographies with about 40% of our business coming from the Americas and the rest split roughly evenly between Europe and Asia. That diversity means that we can harness growth from a wide variety of sources. And it also means that we are resilient to the business or economic dynamics of any individual customer, industry or country.
Furthermore, our sales channels are diversified with about 75% coming from our direct force, with the remainder coming from channel partners. We are very flexible in our licensing and consumption models, and customers can purchase a perpetual license, a lease license, or a pay-as-you-go elastic license and can consume our technology on-premises or in the cloud. We believe this diversity and flexibility allows us to reach and support a broad range of customers around the world.
I'd now like to give some color on the challenges our users are facing and how we're accommodating them and provide additional comments on the demand environment, including a perspective by industry and by geography. It is important to note that our analysis of demand has already been factored into our Q2 and full year guidance. Let me also caution that with the unprecedented market volatility we are all experiencing, demand could change in either direction as the global situation continues to evolve. We expect the most significant business disruption to occur in the second quarter when our teams and those of our customers work remotely. We are currently assuming a modest recovery in the business environment during the third quarter as states and countries slowly reopen, and business and consumer sentiment begins to improve. We also assume business activity and customer sentiments will continue to improve through the fourth quarter.
Comparing this period of disruption with the pre-COVID environment, we expect different kinds of customers will be impacted in different ways. First, it is likely to be more challenging to close deals with brand new customers, primarily because of the difficulty in building new relationships and driving demand with new prospects remotely. Fortunately, for ANSYS, over the course of our 50-year history, we have built a large and loyal customer base. And so while new customers are important, the majority of our business comes from existing customers.
Second, we expect larger accounts to perform more strongly than small- and medium-sized businesses. This is to our advantage as the majority of our business comes from these larger accounts. Larger customers have stronger liquidity and capital position, and we believe that a majority of them will be able to maintain their R&D cycles. In contrast, smaller customers tend to be more sensitive to liquidity constraints and are more likely to delay purchases. So, however, that we believe government programs, especially in Europe, will mitigate some of this risk.
Furthermore, during this period of disruption, we expect renewal rates to remain strong, although new business will come under incremental pressure. We also expect customers to prefer leases over perpetual because of the smaller initial financial commitment of the lease. And we will see additional scrutiny given to large multiyear contracts, which could result in delays in signing or perhaps smaller commitments than we had previously expected. This could introduce incremental timing uncertainty into our top line. Our prepared remarks contain a more comprehensive discussion of the attributes affecting our pipeline conversion and their related impact.
With that backdrop, I'll shift to an industry view. We are seeing little to no reduction in demand in the high-tech and semiconductor vertical, which accounted for about 1/3 of our business in 2019. Many of these customers have deep pockets and are developing products against a multiyear road map, and they are not willing to let a few quarters of uncertainties slow them down. Other companies in large markets such as 5G are in a global race for leadership positions within their industry and are unwilling to delay their R&D efforts and thus cede their future to a competitor.
Let me now move to aerospace and defense. We anticipate investments will continue for defense and military aerospace, driven by long-term government programs, and we expect to see little to no reduction in demand for ANSYS technology in this vertical. Commercial aerospace and contracts will be impacted in the short term, driven by both pre-COVID challenges faced by some companies and by the dramatic reduction in passenger air travel as a result of this pandemic. However, in the medium to long term, I believe this will be somewhat mitigated by the continued need of long-term R&D initiatives that address environmental issues and government regulations.
In the automotive industry, although there has been widespread idling of manufacturing plans, R&D are still receiving funding. And that is particularly true for emerging solutions like autonomy and electrification where ANSYS plays a key role. However, we are expecting to see headwinds on more traditional R&D activities in the sector. Given the need for competitive differentiation, we expect to see ongoing investments in new product introductions for industrial equipment. Although we anticipate a reduction in R&D spending on existing products in this vertical. The low price of oil is causing headwinds in the energy sector. Fortunately, this vertical accounts for a relatively small portion of our business.
Let me turn now to a geographical view. Relative to our expected performance of the geographies at the time of our last earnings call, we believe North America will fare the best. North America has the largest installed base of big enterprise customers, and a number of these customers are due to renew their leases of ANSYS products in 2020. We expect a high renewal rate for those leases, and we also expect to attach new product sales to the renewals. Our North America customer base includes a good percentage of high-tech and semiconductor companies, and we expect their R&D and simulation initiatives to continue to receive funding.
Asia Pacific entered the COVID-19 crisis a few weeks before the rest of the world. We did see an initial reduction in demand activity there, but we're now seeing a return of demand. For example, we saw China end Q1 stronger than we had expected, and it continues to have momentum in Q2. The high-tech and semiconductor industry remains strong throughout the region. However, we do see some headwinds in the more traditional automotive investments and the heavy industrials.
We're expecting some disruptions in business in EMEA, in part because of headwinds related to industrial and traditional automotive activities and in part because we saw some customers struggle with the transition to a work-from-home model. Still, we see relief coming in the form of government programs designed to help companies, especially smaller ones deal with the near-term financial stress.
With all these uncertainties, we are reducing our full year revenue and ACV guidance by mid-single digits, with the greatest impact coming in Q2. Maria will go through guidance in more detail.
Before I finish, I would like to mention that we are preparing a Simulation World, our exciting new online conference that brings together simulation thought leaders and users from around the world. Simulation World will feature a who's who of ANSYS customers, including Volkswagen Motorsport, Baker Hughes, Ericsson and Porsche Motorsport. Simulation World already has more than 10,000 registrants, demonstrating the value of simulation in the marketplace. I'm very excited that this forum gives us a new and unique opportunity to generate demand for our multiphysics portfolio.
Despite the uncertainties in the market, we believe that our strategy of pervasive simulation and the value that we deliver to our customers is more important than ever. Our strategy accelerates customers' key research and development initiatives, which are not typically impacted by economic slowdowns, and we support critical emerging areas like electrification, autonomy, 5G and the industrial Internet of Things. And our value proposition is compelling to customers, both in good times and in tough economic times because we can help our customers drive both top line revenue growth and achieve significant cost savings. I am confident in our ability to continue to drive long-term growth. And with our continued investment in the business, I believe we are well positioned to emerge from this crisis stronger than ever.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Maria to discuss our financials for Q1 and provide more detail around our outlook and assumptions for the remainder of 2020. Maria?"

I'll begin with a perspective on our first quarter financial performance. Then I'll also provide qualitative and quantitative color and context around our outlook assumptions for Q2 and the remainder of 2020.  In connection with our updated outlook, I will encourage you to please review all of the earnings documents that we have posted to our Investor Relations website.
Before I get started, I wanted to take a moment to say thank you to my ANSYS colleagues, who have all successfully navigated the work-from-home transition to enable us to continue to operate our business, support our customers and to be able to meet all of our financial reporting deadlines, including all of the efforts that have gone into supporting today's earnings call. Your teamwork, flexibility, dedication and innovation have been personally inspiring. And for that, I just want to say thank you.
Although we faced a more challenging customer demand environment in the latter part of March as compared to our expectations at the time that we provided our February guidance, our financial results reflect solid execution, which yielded revenue, operating margin and EPS, all towards the midpoint of the guidance ranges that we previously provided for the quarter.
Our start to the year is very encouraging when considering the tough Q1 2019 comparable, in which we reported double-digit revenue growth and the negative impact that COVID-19 inflicted on global economies in the first quarter.
Our key financial metrics begin with Q1 ACV of $301 million, with 82% coming from recurring sources and total revenue of $309 million. I will add that the key currency exchange rates were within the ranges that we provided with our first quarter guidance. We closed the quarter with a total balance of deferred revenue and backlog of $835 million, representing a 24% increase over last year's first quarter balance.
During the quarter, we continued to manage our business with fiscal discipline, which yielded a solid first quarter gross margin of 88% and an operating margin of 29%, in line with our Q1 guidance. Margins were positively impacted by a slower pace of hiring than we had planned as well as reduced travel and corporate event spending. These positive variances were partially offset by higher bad debt expense.  The net result was first quarter EPS of $0.83, which was slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range.
With respect to taxes, our effective tax rate in Q1 was 19.5%. And going forward, we have adopted a normalized effective tax rate approach for non-GAAP reporting and expect our effective tax rate to remain at 19.5% for the full year. Our cash flow from operations totaled $147 million, and we ended the quarter with a total of $718 million in cash and short-term investments.
In line with our capital allocation priorities, we repurchased 690,000 shares during the quarter at an average price of $233.48. We have 2.8 million shares available for repurchase under the current authorized program. Against the backdrop of ongoing volatility and uncertainty in the global markets, we will continue to assess both our own financial performance as well as market conditions as they continue to evolve in determining when might be the most opportune time to reinstate any future share repurchases.
Through the combination of our current cash position, the additional $500 million that we have available under our undrawn revolver and our projections for 2020 operating cash flow, we believe that we have ample liquidity to continue to progress against our long-term strategy, while at the same time, remaining cognizant of the current environment.
Now let me turn to the topic of guidance. As this crisis has evolved, our team has created multiple scenarios to build out what we believe is the most appropriate framework for giving investors a forward-looking view of the business based upon everything that we currently know. That being said, because of the very significant market and economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 outbreak, our ranges for outlook are wider than those that we have historically provided.
Let me also add that the entirety of our guidance reduction relates to the expected effects of the global pandemic. Factoring in our Q1 results, we are initiating guidance for Q2 and updating our revenue, EPS, ACV and operating cash flow outlook for the full year. This update reflects our current views for the remainder of the year as well as the minor contribution from the Lumerical acquisition that we closed on April 1.
For the second quarter, we expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of $335 million to $375 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.01 to $1.33. This outlook assumes that we will experience the most significant business disruption in the second quarter. Based upon discussions with our customers and channel partners, we anticipate delays in the timing of closing certain transactions and, in particular, larger enterprise deals may be especially challenging. We have also assumed that some customers will delay certain purchases until later in the year.
For the full year, we are updating both the revenue and EPS outlook to non-GAAP revenue in the range of $1.555 billion to $1.630 billion or constant currency growth of 2% to 7%, and EPS in the range of $5.61 to $6.23. We are also updating our full year ACV outlook to a range of $1.5 billion to $1.575 billion. This represents constant currency ACV growth in the range of 3% to 9%.
With respect to the remainder of the year, we expect a modest recovery in the business environment in Q3 as employees return to work and businesses begin to resume operations. Our current assumptions anticipate a stronger recovery in the fourth quarter, buoyed by a combination of sales transactions that may have been deferred from earlier quarters, and the sales outlook for multiyear leases that are currently forecasted to close in Q4.
With respect to annual operating cash flows, we are updating our outlook for 2020 to a range of $425 million to $470 million. This is reflective of our updated full year ACV, revenue and profitability estimates. We have also factored into our outlook an incremental $10 million to $20 million of customer payments that would have otherwise been made in 2020 that may be delayed into 2021 as a result of extended payment term requests on new contracts and delayed payments on existing contracts.
For modeling purposes, we're expecting second quarter operating margins of 33.5% to 39%. And for the full year, we expect operating margins in the range of 40% to 42%. These charges are reflective of our adjusted spending plans for Q2 and the remainder of the year. They include a slower pace of hiring and reduced discretionary spending, as well as decreased spending on certain noncritical facilities and infrastructure projects.
On the other hand, we will continue to invest in certain digital transformation projects such as our global CRM and HRIS initiatives, as these projects are critical elements in building the foundation to efficiently operate and scale our business over the long term.
Further details around specific currency rates and other quantitative and qualitative assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q2 and 2020 are contained in the prepared remarks document.
In our effort to provide greater insight and transparency to investors, we have added additional commentary to our prepared remarks and Form 10-Q, specifically related to the impacts of COVID-19. As a caveat, I will remind everyone that this information is based upon everything that we know as of today. And given the uncertain and unprecedented environment that we are operating under, our assumptions are subject to change. Our current expectations, as reflected in our updated financial outlook, is that there will be a delay in business with an adverse impact on our Q2 and full year results.
Beyond the points that Ajei mentioned earlier, regarding the various elements that have contributed to the resiliency of our business model over the long term, from a financial perspective, I'd also like to highlight our high level of recurring ACV, historically stable renewal rates for both leases and maintenance and the strength of our balance sheet and operating cash flow. We are trying to be as transparent as we can and appreciate that you are all seeking information, details and perspectives on our future outlook. We have tried to take into account the uncertainty, particularly around the timing of larger enterprise deals.
We also trust that you will appreciate that there is no certainty in our assumptions and that things will continue to evolve and change in either direction depending on how long this situation continues to negatively impact global economies, customer sentiment and purchasing decisions as it has since this global pandemic first began in Q1. We will continue to remain focused on the things that we can control, trying to strike a balance between short and long-term strategic initiatives that we believe are critical to our long-term success.
In closing, we are very fortunate to start the year with solid first quarter financial and operational results. Being able to deliver on our Q1 financial commitments, despite the extreme volatility is a testament to both the resiliency of the ANSYS business model and to the collective efforts and dedication of the broader ANSYS ecosystem that includes our employees, customers and partners.
As we look ahead, we remain committed to invest in our business and to continue to execute against our long-term strategic priorities. Our focus and commitment to the long term, combined with our best-in-class product portfolio, long-standing customer relationships and resilient business model give us confidence that we will emerge from this crisis better positioned to capitalize on our long-term growth aspirations.
Operator, we will now open the phone lines to take questions."

Meaning where you and your peers seem to be going or ought to go over the next half decade or more. So the question is, there seems to be an incipient arms race going on among engineering software companies in terms of their underlying architectures and data platforms as their future architectures. You have Minerva, PTC recently alluded to Atlas, AUTOBEST Forge. Dassault, of course, has 3Dex. So the question is, how are you thinking about the long-term impact or importance to you in terms of maintaining or gaining share from this new architecture that you have? And are there any implications in terms of your moving from a highly discrete deliverable schedule, as you just alluded to in your remarks, to more of a continuous flow of deliverables over time?
And then secondly, the question has to do with COVID. And at the risk of extrapolation, are there any attributes of the business that you think might go on indefinitely or that you would have to think about doing more on an ongoing basis? For example, investing more in inside sales, potentially even an e-store or some kind or in some way, all 3 or doing things differently with your many partners like Microsoft, Rockwell, et cetera?"

Let me try to address that -- address the second part first, and then I'll get to the first part. With respect to what you do in a COVID world, as you may have -- as I mentioned in my comments, we have a very large event Simulation World that we're running online. And that is, I think, one of the largest, if not the largest simulation event online. And we have a number of speakers signed up for that. We have, I think, over 10,000 people who have registered and the month is about -- and the event is about a month away. So there's a lot of interest in the technology and the capabilities. And obviously, we're driving demand from online events to -- excuse me, from in-person events to online events.
With respect to our partnership relationships, we continue to drive our relationships with our partners and with our customers and the importance of what we do together remains unchanged.
With respect to the first part of your question, the long-term view of our industry, I think it's important to note that the part of the industry where ANSYS lives which is simulation, we believe, is the most important aspect that customers are dealing with. They need simulation in order to be able to validate the design of the products to be able to design the products. Some of the other companies that you mentioned are in other parts of the end-to-end ecosystem. We're in the simulation space. And we believe that this is an extremely valuable part of the end-to-end ecosystem, it’s something that customers do need.
Now to your point about platforms, look, I think that there is some in the industry who believe that you need to have a single monolithic platform, which is a single source of truth and ideal single vendor monolithic environment. We don't believe that's the case. Our strategy is completely open. We believe instead in an authoritative source of truth, which is an ecosystem of open, federated and purpose-built domain-specific solutions, and we participate in that. And I think that's a much more realistic way of addressing the digital transformation needs of scale. It's not about picking one platform and locking a vendor or locking a customer into a particular platform, it's vendors like ourselves playing in an open environment, recognizing that we need to be in a position to support our customers as they understand how to create these complex products of the future."

But just like everyone in the world, as March progressed, things got progressively worse as this really became a global pandemic.

Number one is that some customers are not able to access physical labs or were not able to access physical labs. And as a result of that, physical experimentation is suffering. And obviously, simulation does not require you to access a physical lab. You can do all your work on the computer and in a work-from-home scenario. So that has clearly swings away from physical testing towards more simulation activity, and that's obviously a tailwind for us, and that's helpful.
The other thing is -- and I think this has been very well established, part of the value proposition, what part of the value proposition of simulation is really being able to address cost, and in particular, you can reduce the number of physical prototypes, and you can test in parallel instead of serializing a sequence of events, you can test a number of things in parallel on the computer. And the fact that you can reduce cost is an important driver. And again, in these tough economic times, people are looking to reduce costs. And that, again, is a good guide to tailwind for simulation. So I'm pretty excited about those dynamics.
Another point I'd actually like to make, which is kind of interesting is we've been able to deliver that unique pass situation as the pandemic as we've been able to deliver a number of simulation-based insights to out there. People have been using our technology to come up with ideas or assessments of things like social distancing, the creation of PPE, the creation of medical -- rapid creation of medical devices and a lot of that is being done because of the speed and the rate in case at which of this work is being done, it was unexpected. A lot of that work is being done through simulation as well. And that also demonstrates the effectiveness of simulation if you start to think about the agility that we can bring to bear."

I hope that you are healthy and safe during these uncertain times. I would like to start by thanking the entire ANSYS team. Their professionalism, commitment during this crisis has been exemplary and it made a tremendous difference for our customers.
Let me first talk about how ANSYS responded to COVID-19 and describe our Q1 performance and how we are operating our business in these unusual times. Then I will take a step back and discuss the ANSYS business as a whole, specifically why ANSYS is important to customers and why the business is resilient. Finally, I will provide some color on key elements of the business going forward, including a description of some of the headwinds that we are seeing before I turn the call over to Maria.
Of course, ANSYS' first responsibility is to the health and safety of our employees and their families and to the ANSYS community around the world. In mid-February, we closed our offices in China and enabled our employees to work from home. As the crisis spread, we closed other locations around the world. Today, with the improving situation in China and Korea, our offices in those countries are open with our employees maintaining appropriate social distances and health and safety protocols. Our offices elsewhere remain closed or open only to essential staff with the vast majority of employees worldwide continuing to work from home. Our employees have quickly adapted to the challenge, and we are fully engaged in driving our business forward in the work-from-home model.
In the last several years, we have invested in our infrastructure and business applications, including our networking and remote access capabilities as well as collaboration technology. These investments have turned out to be invaluable and are helping us run our business today. We are continuing to pay all our salaried and hourly workers, and we are not planning any job action. In fact, we are onboarding new employees remotely and provisioning them to work from home. We have a number of open job requisitions and are seeing a strong flow of candidates who are looking for the stability that a company like ANSYS can provide. We believe that our ongoing investments in our growing team put ANSYS in a strong position to capture additional opportunity once this crisis is abated.
As you may recall from when we guided in February, we were expecting the first quarter and the first half of the year to be challenging because of tough year-over-year compare, the effect of China sanctions and a back-end loaded full year. Of course, worldwide economic conditions worsened through March. Nonetheless, I am very proud that the solid execution by the ANSYS team, our revenue, earnings and operating margin for Q1 came in just about at the midpoint of our guidance.
In Q1, we saw strength in a number of industries, including automotive, high-tech and energy. In these verticals, our solutions that support the key initiatives of autonomy, electrification and 5G continue to resonate with our customers. For example, in Asia, we inked a new 3-year contract with an existing consumer electronics customer to expand its usage of our flagship multiphysics solutions as well as to expand into digital twins.
In North America, we closed several large deals in the high-tech and semiconductor sectors, including at a global hardware provider that agreed to standardize on ANSYS, displacing several competitors. We also closed a 7-figure deal with NuScale Power to bring its small modular nuclear reactor designs to reality through the power of simulation. We were also able to forge new relationships with organizations that have not previously used ANSYS.
For example, we signed a 7-figure contract with a new customer, Software Motor Company or SMC. By using ANSYS multiphysics solutions supported by ANSYS Cloud, SMC is developing an automated workflow to rapidly design and analyze motors to be used across industries. The enhanced workflow can compress the weeks of simulation and months of prototype testing typically required for these virtually silent motors.  In Q1, we delivered Ansys 2020 Release 1 and despite working from home, we will deliver our Release 2 to customers in the summer as originally scheduled.
These are major releases and include new capabilities across our multiphysics product portfolio. All products continue to receive recognition and accolades from our customers and partners. For example, industry leader, TSMC recently certified ANSYS RedHawk-SC next-generation system-on-chip power noise sign off-platform for TSMC's FinFET process nodes. This helps customers verify the power requirements and the reliability of chips we use in artificial intelligence, machine learning, 5G and high-performance computing applications.
Similarly, Samsung Foundry has certified the ANSYS RaptorH electromagnetic simulation solution for design using its new 3-dimensional integrated circuit packaging technology. RaptorH marries the best-in-class engines from ANSYS RaptorX, which we gained in last year's Helic acquisition and ANSYS flagship HFSS into a single chip packet system design environment. By validating electromagnetic effects in Samsung's 3D assembly, RaptorH empowers designers to eliminate critical points of failure and accelerate the rate of new technology adoption.
We are continuing to look at opportunities to expand our portfolio through M&A. We recently closed our acquisition of Lumerical, which will enable ANSYS customers to predict the behavior of light within complex photonic devices, structures and systems. This is critical as 5G applications and autonomous vehicles are producing massive amounts of data, forcing organizations to handle even more information faster than ever. Lumerical's products enable designers to develop new, high-throughput optical networks by modeling the most challenging problems in photonics, including interacting optical, electrical and thermal effects. We were able to virtually onboard the Lumerical team, and I'm excited to welcome them into our ONE Ansys family.
I'd now like to discuss the ANSYS business and explain its resilience. The ANSYS value proposition is compelling, both in good times and in tough economic times because simulation helps our customers drive both top line revenue growth and achieve significant cost savings. Using ANSYS simulation, customers can rapidly innovate, easily validate design ideas and improve cycle time. This means that they can launch more of the right products, and do so at a faster pace, which translates to top line growth.
In addition, simulation can help customers get more impact from tight R&D budgets by giving engineers the tools to evaluate multiple design options cost effectively and in parallel and by reducing or even eliminating the need for costly physical testing. That is particularly relevant during this global crisis when some customers cannot get access to their labs to physically test products. The compelling value and the mission-critical nature of simulation is why customers continue to rely on ANSYS even during periods of uncertainty. It is important to note that the bulk of customers' investments in simulation comes from their research and development or R&D budgets. R&D is the lifeblood of our customers. It's the key differentiator. Our experience is that in tough economic times, R&D is typically the least impacted by budget cuts and the first restored, primarily because it drives future growth and market success. We believe that this is a commonly accepted perspective, and it is corroborated by studies in the Harvard Business Review and by the consulting firm, McKinsey. 
This ongoing investment in R&D and in simulation in tough economic times is best illustrated in the automotive industry, where softening demand and worker safety concerns caused by the COVID-19 crisis have forced manufacturers to shut down factories and cut budgets. However, Volkswagen, General Motors, Honda and other automakers have publicly reported continued investments in R&D, especially in next-generation technologies, such as autonomy and electrification. If you recall from earlier discussions, these next-generation technologies are exactly where ANSYS has been making strategic investments through both organic development and acquisitions. At ANSYS, we continue to see investments in simulation by automotive OEMs and their suppliers across geographies.
Let me give you 2 examples from Q2. In Asia, DENSO, the Tier 1 automotive supplier, recently signed a 3-year multimillion-dollar deal to adopt ANSYS solutions for automotive parts development for electrification and autonomy as well as for our platform technologies. In Europe, our channel partner, DYNAmore, recently inked an important deal with a major automotive OEM for the adoption of LS-DYNA for virtual crash testing, replacing a competitive product. This is exciting news, indeed, coming just a few months after we closed the acquisition of LSTC.
As I also discussed at last year's Investor Day, ANSYS is a resilient model due in part to the number and diversity of customers we serve. We have thousands of customers across multiple industries, including high-tech, semiconductor, aerospace, defense, automotive, industrial and energy. And we are well balanced across the geographies with about 40% of our business coming from the Americas and the rest split roughly evenly between Europe and Asia. That diversity means that we can harness growth from a wide variety of sources. And it also means that we are resilient to the business or economic dynamics of any individual customer, industry or country.
Furthermore, our sales channels are diversified with about 75% coming from our direct force, with the remainder coming from channel partners. We are very flexible in our licensing and consumption models, and customers can purchase a perpetual license, a lease license, or a pay-as-you-go elastic license and can consume our technology on-premises or in the cloud. We believe this diversity and flexibility allows us to reach and support a broad range of customers around the world.
I'd now like to give some color on the challenges our users are facing and how we're accommodating them and provide additional comments on the demand environment, including a perspective by industry and by geography. It is important to note that our analysis of demand has already been factored into our Q2 and full year guidance. Let me also caution that with the unprecedented market volatility we are all experiencing, demand could change in either direction as the global situation continues to evolve. We expect the most significant business disruption to occur in the second quarter when our teams and those of our customers work remotely. We are currently assuming a modest recovery in the business environment during the third quarter as states and countries slowly reopen, and business and consumer sentiment begins to improve. We also assume business activity and customer sentiments will continue to improve through the fourth quarter.
Comparing this period of disruption with the pre-COVID environment, we expect different kinds of customers will be impacted in different ways. First, it is likely to be more challenging to close deals with brand new customers, primarily because of the difficulty in building new relationships and driving demand with new prospects remotely. Fortunately, for ANSYS, over the course of our 50-year history, we have built a large and loyal customer base. And so while new customers are important, the majority of our business comes from existing customers.
Second, we expect larger accounts to perform more strongly than small- and medium-sized businesses. This is to our advantage as the majority of our business comes from these larger accounts. Larger customers have stronger liquidity and capital position, and we believe that a majority of them will be able to maintain their R&D cycles. In contrast, smaller customers tend to be more sensitive to liquidity constraints and are more likely to delay purchases. So, however, that we believe government programs, especially in Europe, will mitigate some of this risk.
Furthermore, during this period of disruption, we expect renewal rates to remain strong, although new business will come under incremental pressure. We also expect customers to prefer leases over perpetual because of the smaller initial financial commitment of the lease. And we will see additional scrutiny given to large multiyear contracts, which could result in delays in signing or perhaps smaller commitments than we had previously expected. This could introduce incremental timing uncertainty into our top line. Our prepared remarks contain a more comprehensive discussion of the attributes affecting our pipeline conversion and their related impact.
With that backdrop, I'll shift to an industry view. We are seeing little to no reduction in demand in the high-tech and semiconductor vertical, which accounted for about 1/3 of our business in 2019. Many of these customers have deep pockets and are developing products against a multiyear road map, and they are not willing to let a few quarters of uncertainties slow them down. Other companies in large markets such as 5G are in a global race for leadership positions within their industry and are unwilling to delay their R&D efforts and thus cede their future to a competitor.
Let me now move to aerospace and defense. We anticipate investments will continue for defense and military aerospace, driven by long-term government programs, and we expect to see little to no reduction in demand for ANSYS technology in this vertical. Commercial aerospace and contracts will be impacted in the short term, driven by both pre-COVID challenges faced by some companies and by the dramatic reduction in passenger air travel as a result of this pandemic. However, in the medium to long term, I believe this will be somewhat mitigated by the continued need of long-term R&D initiatives that address environmental issues and government regulations.
In the automotive industry, although there has been widespread idling of manufacturing plans, R&D are still receiving funding. And that is particularly true for emerging solutions like autonomy and electrification where ANSYS plays a key role. However, we are expecting to see headwinds on more traditional R&D activities in the sector. Given the need for competitive differentiation, we expect to see ongoing investments in new product introductions for industrial equipment. Although we anticipate a reduction in R&D spending on existing products in this vertical. The low price of oil is causing headwinds in the energy sector. Fortunately, this vertical accounts for a relatively small portion of our business.
Let me turn now to a geographical view. Relative to our expected performance of the geographies at the time of our last earnings call, we believe North America will fare the best. North America has the largest installed base of big enterprise customers, and a number of these customers are due to renew their leases of ANSYS products in 2020. We expect a high renewal rate for those leases, and we also expect to attach new product sales to the renewals. Our North America customer base includes a good percentage of high-tech and semiconductor companies, and we expect their R&D and simulation initiatives to continue to receive funding.
Asia Pacific entered the COVID-19 crisis a few weeks before the rest of the world. We did see an initial reduction in demand activity there, but we're now seeing a return of demand. For example, we saw China end Q1 stronger than we had expected, and it continues to have momentum in Q2. The high-tech and semiconductor industry remains strong throughout the region. However, we do see some headwinds in the more traditional automotive investments and the heavy industrials.
We're expecting some disruptions in business in EMEA, in part because of headwinds related to industrial and traditional automotive activities and in part because we saw some customers struggle with the transition to a work-from-home model. Still, we see relief coming in the form of government programs designed to help companies, especially smaller ones deal with the near-term financial stress.
With all these uncertainties, we are reducing our full year revenue and ACV guidance by mid-single digits, with the greatest impact coming in Q2. Maria will go through guidance in more detail.
Before I finish, I would like to mention that we are preparing a Simulation World, our exciting new online conference that brings together simulation thought leaders and users from around the world. Simulation World will feature a who's who of ANSYS customers, including Volkswagen Motorsport, Baker Hughes, Ericsson and Porsche Motorsport. Simulation World already has more than 10,000 registrants, demonstrating the value of simulation in the marketplace. I'm very excited that this forum gives us a new and unique opportunity to generate demand for our multiphysics portfolio.
Despite the uncertainties in the market, we believe that our strategy of pervasive simulation and the value that we deliver to our customers is more important than ever. Our strategy accelerates customers' key research and development initiatives, which are not typically impacted by economic slowdowns, and we support critical emerging areas like electrification, autonomy, 5G and the industrial Internet of Things. And our value proposition is compelling to customers, both in good times and in tough economic times because we can help our customers drive both top line revenue growth and achieve significant cost savings. I am confident in our ability to continue to drive long-term growth. And with our continued investment in the business, I believe we are well positioned to emerge from this crisis stronger than ever.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Maria to discuss our financials for Q1 and provide more detail around our outlook and assumptions for the remainder of 2020. Maria?"

I'll begin with a perspective on our first quarter financial performance. Then I'll also provide qualitative and quantitative color and context around our outlook assumptions for Q2 and the remainder of 2020.  In connection with our updated outlook, I will encourage you to please review all of the earnings documents that we have posted to our Investor Relations website.
Before I get started, I wanted to take a moment to say thank you to my ANSYS colleagues, who have all successfully navigated the work-from-home transition to enable us to continue to operate our business, support our customers and to be able to meet all of our financial reporting deadlines, including all of the efforts that have gone into supporting today's earnings call. Your teamwork, flexibility, dedication and innovation have been personally inspiring. And for that, I just want to say thank you.
Although we faced a more challenging customer demand environment in the latter part of March as compared to our expectations at the time that we provided our February guidance, our financial results reflect solid execution, which yielded revenue, operating margin and EPS, all towards the midpoint of the guidance ranges that we previously provided for the quarter.
Our start to the year is very encouraging when considering the tough Q1 2019 comparable, in which we reported double-digit revenue growth and the negative impact that COVID-19 inflicted on global economies in the first quarter.
Our key financial metrics begin with Q1 ACV of $301 million, with 82% coming from recurring sources and total revenue of $309 million. I will add that the key currency exchange rates were within the ranges that we provided with our first quarter guidance. We closed the quarter with a total balance of deferred revenue and backlog of $835 million, representing a 24% increase over last year's first quarter balance.
During the quarter, we continued to manage our business with fiscal discipline, which yielded a solid first quarter gross margin of 88% and an operating margin of 29%, in line with our Q1 guidance. Margins were positively impacted by a slower pace of hiring than we had planned as well as reduced travel and corporate event spending. These positive variances were partially offset by higher bad debt expense.  The net result was first quarter EPS of $0.83, which was slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range.
With respect to taxes, our effective tax rate in Q1 was 19.5%. And going forward, we have adopted a normalized effective tax rate approach for non-GAAP reporting and expect our effective tax rate to remain at 19.5% for the full year. Our cash flow from operations totaled $147 million, and we ended the quarter with a total of $718 million in cash and short-term investments.
In line with our capital allocation priorities, we repurchased 690,000 shares during the quarter at an average price of $233.48. We have 2.8 million shares available for repurchase under the current authorized program. Against the backdrop of ongoing volatility and uncertainty in the global markets, we will continue to assess both our own financial performance as well as market conditions as they continue to evolve in determining when might be the most opportune time to reinstate any future share repurchases.
Through the combination of our current cash position, the additional $500 million that we have available under our undrawn revolver and our projections for 2020 operating cash flow, we believe that we have ample liquidity to continue to progress against our long-term strategy, while at the same time, remaining cognizant of the current environment.
Now let me turn to the topic of guidance. As this crisis has evolved, our team has created multiple scenarios to build out what we believe is the most appropriate framework for giving investors a forward-looking view of the business based upon everything that we currently know. That being said, because of the very significant market and economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 outbreak, our ranges for outlook are wider than those that we have historically provided.
Let me also add that the entirety of our guidance reduction relates to the expected effects of the global pandemic. Factoring in our Q1 results, we are initiating guidance for Q2 and updating our revenue, EPS, ACV and operating cash flow outlook for the full year. This update reflects our current views for the remainder of the year as well as the minor contribution from the Lumerical acquisition that we closed on April 1.
For the second quarter, we expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of $335 million to $375 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.01 to $1.33. This outlook assumes that we will experience the most significant business disruption in the second quarter. Based upon discussions with our customers and channel partners, we anticipate delays in the timing of closing certain transactions and, in particular, larger enterprise deals may be especially challenging. We have also assumed that some customers will delay certain purchases until later in the year.
For the full year, we are updating both the revenue and EPS outlook to non-GAAP revenue in the range of $1.555 billion to $1.630 billion or constant currency growth of 2% to 7%, and EPS in the range of $5.61 to $6.23. We are also updating our full year ACV outlook to a range of $1.5 billion to $1.575 billion. This represents constant currency ACV growth in the range of 3% to 9%.
With respect to the remainder of the year, we expect a modest recovery in the business environment in Q3 as employees return to work and businesses begin to resume operations. Our current assumptions anticipate a stronger recovery in the fourth quarter, buoyed by a combination of sales transactions that may have been deferred from earlier quarters, and the sales outlook for multiyear leases that are currently forecasted to close in Q4.
With respect to annual operating cash flows, we are updating our outlook for 2020 to a range of $425 million to $470 million. This is reflective of our updated full year ACV, revenue and profitability estimates. We have also factored into our outlook an incremental $10 million to $20 million of customer payments that would have otherwise been made in 2020 that may be delayed into 2021 as a result of extended payment term requests on new contracts and delayed payments on existing contracts.
For modeling purposes, we're expecting second quarter operating margins of 33.5% to 39%. And for the full year, we expect operating margins in the range of 40% to 42%. These charges are reflective of our adjusted spending plans for Q2 and the remainder of the year. They include a slower pace of hiring and reduced discretionary spending, as well as decreased spending on certain noncritical facilities and infrastructure projects.
On the other hand, we will continue to invest in certain digital transformation projects such as our global CRM and HRIS initiatives, as these projects are critical elements in building the foundation to efficiently operate and scale our business over the long term.
Further details around specific currency rates and other quantitative and qualitative assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q2 and 2020 are contained in the prepared remarks document.
In our effort to provide greater insight and transparency to investors, we have added additional commentary to our prepared remarks and Form 10-Q, specifically related to the impacts of COVID-19. As a caveat, I will remind everyone that this information is based upon everything that we know as of today. And given the uncertain and unprecedented environment that we are operating under, our assumptions are subject to change. Our current expectations, as reflected in our updated financial outlook, is that there will be a delay in business with an adverse impact on our Q2 and full year results.
Beyond the points that Ajei mentioned earlier, regarding the various elements that have contributed to the resiliency of our business model over the long term, from a financial perspective, I'd also like to highlight our high level of recurring ACV, historically stable renewal rates for both leases and maintenance and the strength of our balance sheet and operating cash flow. We are trying to be as transparent as we can and appreciate that you are all seeking information, details and perspectives on our future outlook. We have tried to take into account the uncertainty, particularly around the timing of larger enterprise deals.
We also trust that you will appreciate that there is no certainty in our assumptions and that things will continue to evolve and change in either direction depending on how long this situation continues to negatively impact global economies, customer sentiment and purchasing decisions as it has since this global pandemic first began in Q1. We will continue to remain focused on the things that we can control, trying to strike a balance between short and long-term strategic initiatives that we believe are critical to our long-term success.
In closing, we are very fortunate to start the year with solid first quarter financial and operational results. Being able to deliver on our Q1 financial commitments, despite the extreme volatility is a testament to both the resiliency of the ANSYS business model and to the collective efforts and dedication of the broader ANSYS ecosystem that includes our employees, customers and partners.
As we look ahead, we remain committed to invest in our business and to continue to execute against our long-term strategic priorities. Our focus and commitment to the long term, combined with our best-in-class product portfolio, long-standing customer relationships and resilient business model give us confidence that we will emerge from this crisis better positioned to capitalize on our long-term growth aspirations.

Meaning where you and your peers seem to be going or ought to go over the next half decade or more. So the question is, there seems to be an incipient arms race going on among engineering software companies in terms of their underlying architectures and data platforms as their future architectures. You have Minerva, PTC recently alluded to Atlas, AUTOBEST Forge. Dassault, of course, has 3Dex. So the question is, how are you thinking about the long-term impact or importance to you in terms of maintaining or gaining share from this new architecture that you have? And are there any implications in terms of your moving from a highly discrete deliverable schedule, as you just alluded to in your remarks, to more of a continuous flow of deliverables over time?
And then secondly, the question has to do with COVID. And at the risk of extrapolation, are there any attributes of the business that you think might go on indefinitely or that you would have to think about doing more on an ongoing basis?

With respect to our partnership relationships, we continue to drive our relationships with our partners and with our customers and the importance of what we do together remains unchanged.
With respect to the first part of your question, the long-term view of our industry, I think it's important to note that the part of the industry where ANSYS lives which is simulation, we believe, is the most important aspect that customers are dealing with. They need simulation in order to be able to validate the design of the products to be able to design the products. Some of the other companies that you mentioned are in other parts of the end-to-end ecosystem. We're in the simulation space. And we believe that this is an extremely valuable part of the end-to-end ecosystem, it’s something that customers do need.
Now to your point about platforms, look, I think that there is some in the industry who believe that you need to have a single monolithic platform, which is a single source of truth and ideal single vendor monolithic environment. We don't believe that's the case. Our strategy is completely open. We believe instead in an authoritative source of truth, which is an ecosystem of open, federated and purpose-built domain-specific solutions, and we participate in that. And I think that's a much more realistic way of addressing the digital transformation needs of scale. It's not about picking one platform and locking a vendor or locking a customer into a particular platform, it's vendors like ourselves playing in an open environment, recognizing that we need to be in a position to support our customers as they understand how to create these complex products of the future."

So if you look at our Q1 results, they came -- all of the key metrics came in at basically the midpoint or a little bit better than what we had forecasted when we gave guidance at the end of February. Now that being said, when we gave that guidance, we were basically assuming that COVID-19 was somewhat limited to China and perhaps South Korea. But just like everyone in the world, as March progressed, things got progressively worse as this really became a global pandemic. So as a result of that, a lot of stuff has changed in the past 6 weeks. And so that is why we've modified our full year outlook, which now does factor in what we believe is an elongated impact from COVID-19, the most dramatic being Q2."

Where we're really seeing the biggest dynamic right now and what we built into our outlook for 2020 is that at the small-medium business level, that those customers are probably -- and we're seeing some of this going to choose an annual lease versus a paid up just given the current economic environment and their access to capital. But I will also just comment that today, the majority of our leases are still annual leases.

Number one is that some customers are not able to access physical labs or were not able to access physical labs. And as a result of that, physical experimentation is suffering. And obviously, simulation does not require you to access a physical lab. You can do all your work on the computer and in a work-from-home scenario. So that has clearly swings away from physical testing towards more simulation activity, and that's obviously a tailwind for us, and that's helpful.
The other thing is -- and I think this has been very well established, part of the value proposition, what part of the value proposition of simulation is really being able to address cost, and in particular, you can reduce the number of physical prototypes, and you can test in parallel instead of serializing a sequence of events, you can test a number of things in parallel on the computer. And the fact that you can reduce cost is an important driver. And again, in these tough economic times, people are looking to reduce costs. And that, again, is a good guide to tailwind for simulation. So I'm pretty excited about those dynamics.
Another point I'd actually like to make, which is kind of interesting is we've been able to deliver that unique pass situation as the pandemic as we've been able to deliver a number of simulation-based insights to out there. People have been using our technology to come up with ideas or assessments of things like social distancing, the creation of PPE, the creation of medical -- rapid creation of medical devices and a lot of that is being done because of the speed and the rate in case at which of this work is being done, it was unexpected. A lot of that work is being done through simulation as well. And that also demonstrates the effectiveness of simulation if you start to think about the agility that we can bring to bear."

Thanks to strong execution, ANSYS delivered Q2 revenue, operating margin and earnings that exceeded the high end of our guidance. Our Q2 results illustrate the close relationships we have built with ou",1454,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Thanks to strong execution, ANSYS delivered Q2 revenue, operating margin and earnings that exceeded the high end of our guidance. Our Q2 results illustrate the close relationships we have built with our customers, which were important as the overwhelming majority of our business in Q2 was transacted remotely. 
That included 2 notable sales. First, we closed the largest total contract in our 50-year history at almost $100 million, with an existing customer in the automotive and ground transportation space. This customer is standardizing on end solutions for multi-physics, additive manufacturing, electrification and digital wins to develop great products faster and more affordably. 
Our second notable deal was our largest new business professional agreement, which was driven by our flagship HFSS for electro-magnetics and LS [indiscernible] for explicit analysis. This $12 million agreement, with a major high-tech company, had been forecasted for the second half of the year. But based on the customer's evolving needs and strong sales execution, we were able to sign the contract in Q2. That contract was the primary contributor to our Q2 revenue coming in over the high end of our guidance. 
True to our performance by industries, Q2 played -- largely played out as we had expected. We saw little to no reduction in demand in the high-tech and semiconductor vertical, which included the $12 million new business deal that I have already mentioned. Similarly, the defense segment remains relatively stable due to its focus on technology to support national security. 
For example, in Q2, we closed a 7-figure multiyear deal with a European defense contractor. Even while many manufacturing plants were idle due to COVID, the automotive industry is continuing its investment in R&D. In particular, OEMs and their supply chains continue to rely on simulation for emerging solutions and electrification and autonomy. Our optical solutions were adopted by a North American autonomous electric vehicle developer and by an Asian automotive OEM to advance their ADAS programs. Also in Asia, Tier 1 automotive supplier, Denville, signed a 3-year multimillion-dollar deal to adopt ANSYS solutions for automotive parts development for electrification and autonomy. 
Our Q2 performance by geography was, as we expected, with North America leading the way. North America has our largest installed base of enterprise customers, with a number of them to renew their leases in 2020. We are seeing a high renewal rate of those leases, and are expanding on them by attaching new product sales. However, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks document, we saw a slowdown in the SMB space across all our major geographies as we had predicted in our last earnings call. 
Despite the uncertain economic times, companies are continuing their investments in R&D. As we have previously discussed, R&D is typically the initiative least impacted by budget cuts and the first restored, primarily because it drives future growth and market success. Customers view simulation and the key component of R&D, a force complier that helps them drive both top line revenue growth and achieve significant cost savings. 
Furthermore, the pandemic has limited access to labs for some customers, making simulation even more important than ever. Some other customers have struggled with remote access corporate data centers and are taking advantage of ANSYS Cloud to give their engineers access to high-performance compute capacity. 
For example, our customer, Coca-Cola, is reporting that ANSYS Cloud is dramatically reducing the time required for simulation, making its engineers working from home even more productive than when they were in the office. Our inaugural simulation world virtual conference clearly illustrated the importance of simulation to customers and prospects across industries. More than 55,000 registrants from around the world signed up to learn how companies, such as Ferrari, HPC, Honeywell, Siemens, Ford, Seagate and Bosch are using ANSYS stimulation to develop their next-generation products. 
They also heard from our partners, including Microsoft, PTC, Autodesk and Rockwell Automation. Simulation growth demonstrated the power of digital transformation, and the key role that simulation plays in making our customers digital transformation is successful. 
Our customers continued reliance on simulation. Along with our proven ability to close even the largest deals remotely, gives us confidence as we forecast the second half of the year. We have increased our guidance and reflect currency changes, improved cash flow and our EPS overachievement in Q2. Maria will give you the details in a few minutes. 
Moving to our product successes. We recently released ANSYS 2020 R2. This innovative release helps distributed engineering teams accelerate innovation by harnessing new streamlined workflows and dynamic capabilities across our multiphysics product suites. Some of the many highlights of R2 include: a streamlined fluids workflow to simulate capacity pay and cell watch influence; integration of software capabilities from LS Dyna into our mechanical interface; the ability to solve over 100 million unknowns in a single simulation, while delivering a nearly 10x increased solution size in our electromagnetics flagship product, HFSS; a new electrothermal option in our semiconductor solution, RedHawk SC, which uses our big data platform to solve coupling of various structures on over 1 billion instances concurrently; and platform upgrades that empower engineers to rapidly process and finalize their designs through cloud-based high-performance computing. 
As part of our ANSYS 2020 R2 launch, we also unveiled our next-generation upfront simulation solution, ANSYS Discovery. With built-in seamless connection to ANSYS flagship products, Discovery now empowers all engineers to explore large -- larger design spaces and quickly answer critical design questions early, resulting in improved ensuring productivity and product quality. 
Our partner of PTC has embedded Discovery into CAS solution, Creo Simulation Live. On its recent earnings call, PTC announced closing of its first 7-figure Creo Simulation Live deal with a large U.S. government agency as well as the closing of 10 follow-on expansion deals. 
As the product continues to build momentum, PTC is planning new marketing programs to support sales. We have partnered with Microsoft, Dell, GE and [indiscernible] to form the digital twins consortium. Physics-based digital screens technology enables companies to head off problems before they occur, prevent unplanned downtime, improve the customer experience and drive innovation and performance. This consortium will build an ecosystem of digital twin users, drive best practices and define requirements for new digital twin standards across industries. 
Due to our deep commitment to encouraging innovation at all levels, FAST company has once again named ANSYS as one of the best workplaces for innovators. Working with Accenture, FAST company recognized ANSYS for giving employees the freedom to explore the ideas that benefit our customers and the communities we serve. 
Turning to our recent moves and M&A. We started Q2 with our acquisition of Lumerical, which enables ANSYS customers to predict the behavior of life within complex photonic devices, structures and systems. By integrating Lumerical's photonics products with our semiconductor and optical suites, designers can accurately predict the impact of both nanoscale and macroscale optics for automotive displays, autonomous vehicles, augmented reality and even the development of cosmetics. 
Our acquisition of LSTC continues to play a key role in expanding our solution footprint with customers around the world. In Europe, our channel partner, Dynamore, inked an important deal with BMW to adopt ANSYS Elastimas and virtual craft testing, replacing an incumbent competitor. And in Asia, a major global automotive OEM continued its investment in LS Dyna as a product of choice for crash safety analysis. 
This is exciting news coming just months after we closed the acquisition of LSTC. Finally, I'm proud that ANSYS has been named one of the Bay Area's best places to work by the San Francisco business signs and the Silicon Valley business journal. This recognition is a testament to our diverse and inclusive culture, which incorporates valuable perspectives and background to solve complex challenges for our customers. 
To summarize, Q2 was a strong quarter, highlighted by great execution across the board, thanks to our global team of dedicated employees and channel partners. Despite the economic uncertainties, our customers know that ANSYS simulation technologies help them solve their most vesting product challenges, whether they're working in a corporate research lab or using the cloud from their home offices. They know that ANSYS Simulation delivers both top line revenue growth and significant cost savings. And they know that ANSYS Simulation will position them for future growth and market success. 
Our ability to close business and to support our customers, even if they work remotely, gives us confidence to deliver against our objectives for the second half of the year. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Maria to discuss our financials for Q2 as well as the details around our outlook and the assumptions for the remainder of 2020. Maria?"

Hello, everyone. Ajei shared a few highlights from our Q2 results, and now let me take a few minutes to add some additional perspective on our strong second quarter financial performance, and provide both qualitative and quantitative color around our outlook and key assumptions for Q3 and the remainder of 2020. I also encourage you to please review all of the Q2 earnings documents that we have posted to our Investor Relations website. 
Before I begin, I would like to take a moment to again say thank you to the ANSYS team. In our efforts to remain focused on employee safety, most of our colleagues continue to work from home throughout the second quarter, and we believe that this will likely continue to be the case throughout most of what remains of 2020. 
We have leveraged our previous investments in collaboration and infrastructure to remain connected, and we continue to seamlessly support our customers and each other. Our HR team has also promoted initiatives around health and wellness, so that we can support our employees' well-being through these historic times. 
Now let me move on to our financial performance. Our Q2 results reflect the resiliency from the ANSYS business model, combined with our continued focus on executing against our plans. We finished the quarter with total revenue of $389.7 million, or constant currency revenue growth of 6%, and operating margin and EPS results that were both well above the high end of our Q2 guidance. Our revenue in Q2 was driven by strong sales execution. 
As Ajei mentioned earlier, the closing of the largest new business professional license deal in the company's history was the primary contributor to our revenue being above the high end of our guidance range. I would also just like to highlight that these results are quite impressive when considering the very strong comparable of last year's second quarter, in which we reported constant currency revenue growth of 23%. 
The combination of our strong second quarter and first half results, and the strength of our sales pipeline, gives us confidence that we are on the right path as we continue to make meaningful progress towards achieving our longer-term strategic objectives and delivering on our 2020 financial commitment. 
Key financial metrics for the quarter continued, with Q2 ACV of $344 million or constant currency growth of 6%, with 83% of ACV coming from recurring sources. Strong lease sales, which drove a 14% increase in lease license revenue, combined with a continued high renewal rate on maintenance contracts, contributed to building our deferred revenue and backlog to a Q2 total of $846.5 million, an 18% increase over last year's comparable balance and a new record Q2 high. This provides us good visibility into the second half of 2020. 
The strong top line results, combined with our continued focus on fiscal discipline, helped to drive a second quarter gross margin of 90% and an operating margin of 43%, which finished well above the high end of our Q2 guidance. 
In line with the plans that we had communicated last quarter, we continue to manage our business at reduced levels of discretionary spending. The most notable being in the category of business travel and entertainment, as safety concerns continued to limit our ability to travel throughout the second quarter. These positive variances were partially offset by higher bad debt expense. 
While we have been managing the business throughout most of the first half of 2020, at a reduced pace of hiring, we did increase our employee base by approximately 170 employees in Q2, which included the addition of 58 employees through the acquisition of Lumerical that we closed on April 1. The net result was second quarter EPS of $1.55, which also finished above the high end of our guidance, and which benefited from the overperformance in revenue. 
With respect to taxes, our effective tax rate in Q2 was 19.5%, which is also the rate that we expect for the remainder of 2020. We further strengthened our cash and balance sheet position in the second quarter, with cash flow from operations, totaled $132 million for the quarter. Cash flow from operations was $279 million for the first half. We closed Q2 with a total of $745 million in cash and short-term investments. And through the combination of our current cash position, the additional $500 million that we have available under our undrawn revolver and our projections for 2020 operating cash flow, we remained confident that we have ample liquidity to continue to progress against our long-term strategy, while, at the same time, remaining cognizant of the uncertainties that exist in the current operating environment. 
As we had previously communicated, against the backdrop of ongoing volatility and uncertainty in the global marketplace, [indiscernible] to cease our share repurchase activity during the quarter, which lays up with 2.8 million shares available for repurchase under the current authorized program. We will continue to assess both our own financial performance as well as market conditions, in determining when likely the most opportune time to consider restating future share repurchases. 
While no shares were repurchased during the quarter, substantially all of our cash flow from operations in the first half was deployed on the combination of share repurchases, capital expenditures and the acquisition of Lumerical. 
Now let me turn to the topic of guidance. Before I get into the specific numbers, let me just provide a few qualitative comments with respect to the ongoing impact of COVID-19 and how we are facing about our business for the second half. 
During our last call, I have discussed how our team had created multiple scenarios to build out what we believe was the most appropriate framework, based upon everything that we knew at the time. As we go cross through the second and into the current quarter, we have continued to execute against that framework and to evolve our plans, factoring in both new data, as it becomes available, and the continuing uncertainty that exists in the global market. 
Consistent with our practice from last quarter, we will continue to provide outlook for Q3 and the remainder of 2020, but with ranges, that is lighter than [indiscernible] historically provided to account for the increased uncertainty. 
To summarize, coming off our very strong finish in Q2, we are initiating guidance for the third quarter and increasing our revenue, earnings, ACV and operating cash flow outlook for the full year. The increases to revenue and ACV are to reflect a weaker dollar currency environment. 
Now let me move on to the details of our outlook. For Q3, we expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of $347 million to $377 million, and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.10 to $1.34. For the full year, we are increasing our outlook to factor in both our strong second quarter financial results as well as changes in key currency rates that may have taken place since we last provided our outlook in early May, starting with non-GAAP revenue in the range of $1.57 billion to $1.645 billion, or constant currency growth in the range of 2% to 7% and EPS in the range of $5.75 to $6.35. 
We are also increasing our full year 2020 ACV outlook to a range of $1.52 billion to $1.585 billion. This represents constant currency ACV growth of 4% to 8%. 
With respect to the remainder of the year, in Q3, we expect the business environment, that is similar to or marginally better than Q2, as many customers have not reviewed full operations and employees continue to work from how. 
We also continue to expect, if the effects of the pandemic will continue to adversely impact our levels of new business, particularly in the SMB space and disproportionately affecting perpetual licenses. Our current outlook continues to anticipate a stronger recovery in the fourth quarter, [indiscernible] by the pipeline for multiyear leases that are currently forecasted to close in Q4. 
Our outlook for the remainder of 2020 factors in everything that we are currently aware of with respect to ongoing trade discussions and customer sentiment across our geographically and industry diverse customer base. It also reflects spending in the second half related to several business infrastructure and digital transformation projects as well as increased sales and third-party commissions. 
With respect to annual operating cash flow, we are increasing our outlook for 2020 to a range of $435 million to $475 million. This is reflective of our current view on full year ACV, revenue, profitability estimates and tax payments. 
As we have previously communicated, we have also factored into our outlook the adverse impact of customer payments that may be delayed into 2021 as a result of extended payment term negotiations on new contracts and delayed payments on existing contracts. Currently, we are increasing our estimate of the impact of 2020 operating cash flow to be in the range of $15 million to $25 million. 
Looking ahead to Q3. We are expecting operating margins in the range of 34.5% to 38.5% and for the full year, in line with our previous communications, we're expecting to finish the year with strong operating margins in the range of 40% to 42%. These targets were reflective of our adjusted spending plans for the second half of 2020. These plans continue to include a slower place of hiring, reduced discretionary spending and decreased spending on noncritical facilities and infrastructure projects. 
In line with our previous commentary, it is our intention to continue to fund our internal digital transformation projects as these are critical elements in building the foundation to efficiently operate and scale our business over the long term. Further details around specific currency rates and other key quantitative and qualitative assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q3 and 2020 are contained in the prepared remarks document. 
We are striving to be as transparent as we can, and have tried to factor in the added uncertainty around the timing of closing larger enterprise deals. We also trust that you will appreciate that there is no certainty in our assumptions, and that conditions will continue to evolve and change in either direction, depending on how long the pandemic continues to negatively impact global economy, customer segments and purchasing decisions as it has since this global crisis first began to unfold since the first quarter. 
We will continue to remain focused on the things that we can control, aiming to strike a balance between short and long-term strategic initiatives, that we believe are critical to strengthening our leadership position and to capturing the long-term market opportunity that we see ahead of us. 
In closing, we are very fortunate to start the year with strong first half financial and operational results. We were able to deliver well ahead in our Q2 financial commitment, including the closing of the 2 milestone deals that Ajei spoke to earlier. These strong results are a testament to both the resiliency of the ANSYS business model and to the collectives background and dedication of our employees, customers and partners. 
The combination of our long-standing customer relationships, best-in-class products, diverse customer base, high level of recurring ACV, stable renewal rates and the strength of our balance sheet and operating cash flow, all contribute to the stability of our business in these challenging times. We saw that strength and stability reflected in our results for the second quarter and first half, and these foundational pillars are what give us confidence in our outlook for the remainder of the year and our longer-term vision of making simulation pervasive.

That sounds maybe better than I would have thought 3 months ago. So I was wondering if you could maybe just provide a little more color on the scenario analysis?

But given the dynamics and the fact that the pace of acceleration in Q3 is not happening at the rate that we had projected when we spoke to back in early May, we just thought it was more prudent, based on everything that we're seeing and the fact that customers are having extended work from home and the coronavirus situation continues to have a lot of volatility around it, it was just more prudent to go ahead and increase the ACV to take a look at what happened relative to currency, but not change our outlook on the full year. 
We've got a good strong pipe. We got good visibility into it. The fact that we can close those milestone deals in Q2 during the height of the pandemic, continues to give us confidence that even though we've got this extended work-from-home situation that our team is effective in engaging with customers and being able to close these deals.

As you consider our relationship with our customers, we have built over the decades, very deep relationships with our customers, and they rely on us for the areas that are most important to them, specifically in the areas of R&D and the creation of new products. 
And even as we're seeing in some other parts of the economy and certainly, automotive is a great example, where there is some short -- where there is a demand challenge that you're seeing in -- and you're seeing slowdowns, and you're seeing shutdowns in plants, what's really important to recognize and certainly automotive companies recognize as well is that as we come out of the pandemic, investment in R&D is what allows them to maintain their edge as they come out of this. 
And so that's it. It's a commitment to R&D, it's a commitment to the long-term success of their business, and it's a recognition that simulation, what we provide, is absolutely essential. It's a force multiplier -- as I said in my comments, it's a force multiplier to their R&D initiatives. So this is one thing. 
The other thing is I think that when you consider people working from home or rethinking the digital nature of their product processes, and exactly what it means now to be able to take all of your employees and have them be effective from home, it becomes even more important to consider that digital transformation. And in our opinion, there isn't a pure representation of the digital behavior of the product and simulation. That is the essence of the digital behavior of a product. 
And again, our customers recognize this. And as you start to see this transition and the understanding that digital transformation -- and the understanding of how to take advantage of digital technologies is going to be essential for product development in the future, I think that plays into our sweet spot. So it's customer relationships, it's the importance of simulation. It's the nature of the businesses that our customers that are running. All of those are important."

As I said, the areas that they're standardizing on, obviously, the multiphysics -- it's a multiphysics deal. I mentioned the use of that is manufacturing, I mentioned electrification, I mentioned digital twins. I did not mention SPDM, but yes, SPDM was also part of that particular relationship.

They're not necessarily -- in general, it provides engineers with access to the latest hardware. They're not tied to whatever investments may have been made in the data centers. Of -- at the time that the data centers were set up or at the time that they were updated. So there's some real advantages to being able to take advantage -- to use the cloud. And certainly, as people and engineers are trying to get access to cloud technology from -- or access to simulation activity from wherever they may be working from home remote locations, certainly, we see the cloud as being important. 
You have to recognize, of course, that our customers have made, in many cases, significant investments in data centers, and they continue to take advantage of those data centers. And many of our customers have built in place a working model where you have engineers and remote locations accessing their data centers remotely to be able to take advantage of our technologies. 
So it's a mix. I mean, they're taking advantage of cloud technology, sometimes they're using on-premises, sometimes they'll use a hybrid. We certainly do expect to see an acceleration in the use of cloud technology. And certainly, the acceleration of use of ANSYS Cloud as a result of this pandemic. There is no question that, that will be the case. However, it is off a small base, as we've said to you before, and our -- and we have a very long tail in terms of the investment that our customers have made in HPC.

As I said in the script earlier, and if you -- if you listen to our launch last week, you probably would have seen that we -- when we launched Discovery, and the current version of Discovery, it is an improvement over the previous version in that we have seamless connections into our flagship solvers. So not only have we made a number of improvements to the Discovery, my vision as well, we've built these seamless connections and the UI has been -- and the interface has been completely revamped as well. So it's a very interesting -- we think it's a very exciting product, and it brings together the notion of interactive modeling, it brings together real time simulation, and it brings together the accuracy of the ANSYS flagship solvers into one end-user experience that we think is radically easy to use. 
So we're very excited about this technology. The reason, obviously, we've made these enhancements is because we're getting feedback from customers, and we're evolving the technology. So we see this as being -- as certainly helping our ability to continue to sell and be successful in the marketplace.

24893,676809164,2062605,"ANSYS, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 06, 2020",2020-08-06,"Earnings Calls","ANSYS, Inc.","Executives","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Thanks to strong execution, ANSYS delivered Q2 revenue, operating margin and earnings that exceeded the high end of our guidance. Our Q2 results illustrate the close relationships we have built with ou",1453,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Thanks to strong execution, ANSYS delivered Q2 revenue, operating margin and earnings that exceeded the high end of our guidance. Our Q2 results illustrate the close relationships we have built with our customers, which were important as the overwhelming majority of our business in Q2 was transacted remotely. 
That included 2 notable sales. First, we closed the largest total contract in our 50-year history at almost $100 million, with an existing customer in the automotive and ground transportation space. This customer is standardizing on ANSYS solutions for multi-physics, additive manufacturing, electrification and digital twin to develop great products faster and more affordably.  
Our second notable deal was our largest new business professional agreement, which was driven by our flagship HFSS for electro-magnetics and LS-DYNA for explicit analysis. This $12 million agreement with a major high-tech company had been forecasted for the second half of the year. But based on the customer's evolving needs and strong sales execution, we were able to sign the contract in Q2. That contract was the primary contributor to our Q2 revenue coming in over the high end of our guidance.  
Turning to our performance by industries. Q2 played -- largely played out as we had expected. We saw little to no reduction in demand in the high-tech and semiconductor vertical, which included the $12 million new business deal that I have already mentioned. Similarly, the defense segment remains relatively stable due to its focus on technology to support national security.  
For example, in Q2, we closed a 7-figure multiyear deal with a European defense contractor. Even while many manufacturing plants were idle due to COVID, the automotive industry is continuing its investment in R&D. In particular, OEMs and their supply chains continue to rely on simulations for emerging solutions and electrification and autonomy. Our optical solutions were adopted by a North American autonomous electric vehicle developer and by an Asian automotive OEM to advance their ADAS programs. Also in Asia, Tier 1 automotive supplier, DENSO, signed a 3-year multimillion-dollar deal to adopt ANSYS solutions for automotive parts development for electrification and autonomy.  
Our Q2 performance by geography was as we expected, with North America leading the way. North America has our largest installed base of enterprise customers, with a number of them due to renew their leases in 2020. We are seeing a high renewal rate for those leases, and are expanding on them by attaching new product sales. However, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks document, we saw a slowdown in the SMB space across all our major geographies as we had predicted in our last earnings call.  
Despite the uncertain economic times, companies are continuing their investments in R&D. As we have previously discussed, R&D is typically the initiative least impacted by budget cuts and the first restored, primarily because it drives future growth and market success. Customers view simulations and the key component of R&D, a force multiplier that helps them drive both top line revenue growth and achieve significant cost savings.  
Furthermore, the pandemic has limited access to labs for some customers, making simulations even more important than ever. Some other customers have struggled with remote access to corporate data centers and are taking advantage of ANSYS Cloud to give their engineers access to high-performance compute capacity. For example, our customer, Coca-Cola, is reporting that ANSYS Cloud is dramatically reducing the time required for simulations, making its engineers working from home even more productive than when they were in the office. Our inaugural Simulation World virtual conference clearly illustrated the importance of simulations to customers and prospects across industries. More than 55,000 registrants from around the world signed up to learn how companies, such as Ferrari, HPE, Honeywell, Siemens, Ford, Seagate and Bosch are using ANSYS simulation to develop their next-generation products.  
They also heard from our partners, including Microsoft, PTC, Autodesk and Rockwell Automation. Simulation World demonstrated the power of digital transformation and the key role that simulation plays in making our customers' digital transformation is successful.  
Our customers continued reliance on simulation. Along with our proven ability to close even the largest deals remotely, gives us confidence as we forecast the second half of the year. We have increased our guidance to reflect currency changes, improved cash flow and our EPS overachievement in Q2. Maria will give you the details in a few minutes.  
Moving to our product successes. We recently released Ansys 2020 R2. This innovative release helps distributed engineering teams accelerate innovation by harnessing new streamlined workflows and dynamic capabilities across our multiphysics product suites. Some of the many highlights of R2 include: a streamlined fluids workflow to simulate capacity fade and cell life in Fluent; integration of solver capabilities from LS-DYNA into our mechanical interface; the ability to solve over 100 million unknowns in a single simulation while delivering a nearly 10x increased solution size in our electromagnetics flagship product, HFSS; a new electrothermal option in our semiconductor solution, RedHawk-SC, which uses our big data platform to solve coupling of various structures on over 1 billion instances concurrently; and platform upgrades that empower engineers to rapidly process and finalize their designs through cloud-based high-performance computing.  
As part of our Ansys 2020 R2 launch, we also unveiled our next-generation upfront simulation solution, Ansys Discovery. With built-in seamless connection to ANSYS flagship products, Discovery now empowers all engineers to explore large -- larger design spaces and quickly answer critical design questions early, resulting in improved ensuring productivity and product quality.  
Our partner, PTC, has embedded Discovery into CAD solution, Creo Simulation Live. On its recent earnings call, PTC announced the closing of its first 7-figure Creo Simulation Live deal with a large U.S. government agency as well as the closing of 10 follow-on expansion deals.  
As the product continues to build momentum, PTC is planning new marketing programs to support sales. We have partnered with Microsoft, Dell, GE and Lendlease to form the Digital Twin Consortium. Physics-based digital twin technology enables companies to head off problems before they occur, prevent unplanned downtime, improve the customer experience and drive innovation and performance. This consortium will build an ecosystem of digital twin users, drive best practices and define requirements for new digital twin standards across industries.  
Due to our deep commitment to encouraging innovation at all levels, Fast Company has once again named ANSYS as one of the best workplaces for innovators. Working with Accenture, Fast Company recognized ANSYS for giving employees the freedom to explore the ideas that benefit our customers and the communities we serve.  
Turning to our recent moves and M&A. We started Q2 with our acquisition of Lumerical, which enables ANSYS customers to predict the behavior of light within complex photonic devices, structures and systems. By integrating Lumerical's photonics products with our semiconductor and optical suites, designers can accurately predict the impact of both nanoscale and macroscale optics for automotive displays, autonomous vehicles, augmented reality and even the development of cosmetics.  
Our acquisition of LSTC continues to play a key role in expanding our solution footprint with customers around the world. In Europe, our channel partner, DYNAmore, inked an important deal with BMW to adopt ANSYS LS-DYNA for virtual crash testing, replacing an incumbent competitor. And in Asia, a major global automotive OEM continued its investment in LS-DYNA as the product of choice for crash safety analysis.  
This is exciting news coming just months after we closed the acquisition of LSTC. 
Finally, I'm proud that ANSYS has been named one of the Bay Area's Best Places to Work by the San Francisco Business Times and the Silicon Valley Business Journal. This recognition is a testament to our diverse and inclusive culture, which incorporates valuable perspectives and background to solve complex challenges for our customers.  
To summarize, Q2 was a strong quarter, highlighted by great execution across the board, thanks to our global team of dedicated employees and channel partners. Despite the economic uncertainties, our customers know that ANSYS' simulation technologies help them solve their most vexing product challenges, whether they're working in a corporate research lab or using the cloud from their home offices. They know that ANSYS simulation delivers both top line revenue growth and significant cost savings. And they know that ANSYS simulation will position them for future growth and market success.  
Our ability to close business and to support our customers, even if they work remotely, gives us confidence to deliver against our objectives for the second half of the year.  
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Maria to discuss our financials for Q2 as well as the details around our outlook and the assumptions for the remainder of 2020. Maria?"

Hello, everyone. Ajei shared a few highlights from our Q2 results. And now let me take a few minutes to add some additional perspective on our strong second quarter financial performance and provide both qualitative and quantitative color around our outlook and key assumptions for Q3 and the remainder of 2020. I also encourage you to please review all of the Q2 earnings documents that we have posted to our Investor Relations website.  
Before I begin, I would like to take a moment to again say thank you to the ANSYS team. In our efforts to remain focused on employee safety, most of our colleagues continue to work from home throughout the second quarter, and we believe that this will likely continue to be the case throughout most of what remains of 2020.  
We have leveraged our previous investments in collaboration and infrastructure to remain connected, and we continue to seamlessly support our customers and each other. Our HR team has also promoted initiatives around health and wellness so that we can support our employees' well-being through these historic times.  
Now let me move on to our financial performance. Our Q2 results reflect the resiliency from the ANSYS business model, combined with our continued focus on executing against our plans. We finished the quarter with total revenue of $389.7 million, or constant currency revenue growth of 6%, and operating margin and EPS results that were both well above the high end of our Q2 guidance. Our revenue in Q2 was driven by strong sales execution. As Ajei mentioned earlier, the closing of the largest new business professional license deal in the company's history was the primary contributor to our revenue being above the high end of our guidance range. I would also just like to highlight that these results are quite impressive when considering the very strong comparable of last year's second quarter, in which we reported constant currency revenue growth of 23%. The combination of our strong second quarter and first half results and the strength of our sales pipeline give us confidence that we are on the right path as we continue to make meaningful progress towards achieving our longer-term strategic objectives and delivering on our 2020 financial commitment.  
Key financial metrics for the quarter continue with Q2 ACV of $344 million or constant currency growth of 6%, with 83% of ACV coming from recurring sources. Strong lease sales, which drove a 14% increase in lease license revenue combined with a continued high renewal rate on maintenance contracts, contributed to building our deferred revenue and backlog to a Q2 total of $846.5 million, an 18% increase over last year's comparable balance and a new record Q2 high. This provides us good visibility into the second half of 2020.  
The strong top line results, combined with our continued focus on fiscal discipline, helped to drive a second quarter gross margin of 90% and an operating margin of 43%, which finished well above the high end of our Q2 guidance.  
In line with the plans that we had communicated last quarter, we continued to manage our business at reduced levels of discretionary spending. The most notable being in the category of business travel and entertainment, as safety concerns continued to limit our ability to travel throughout the second quarter. These positive variances were partially offset by higher bad debt expense.  
While we have been managing the business throughout most of the first half of 2020 at a reduced pace of hiring, we did increase our employee base by approximately 170 employees in Q2, which included the addition of 58 employees through the acquisition of Lumerical that we closed on April 1.  
The net result was second quarter EPS of $1.55, which also finished above the high end of our guidance, and which benefited from the overperformance in revenue.  
With respect to taxes, our effective tax rate in Q2 was 19.5%, which is also the rate that we expect for the remainder of 2020. We further strengthened our cash and balance sheet position in the second quarter, with cash flow from operations that totaled $132 million for the quarter. Cash flow from operations was $279 million for the first half. We closed Q2 with a total of $745 million in cash and short-term investments. And through the combination of our current cash position, the additional $500 million that we have available under our undrawn revolver and our projections for 2020 operating cash flow, we remain confident that we have ample liquidity to continue to progress against our long-term strategy, while at the same time, remaining cognizant of the uncertainties that exist in the current operating environment.  
As we had previously communicated, against the backdrop of ongoing volatility and uncertainty in the global marketplace, we elected to cease our share repurchase activity during the quarter, which lays up with 2.8 million shares available for repurchase under the current authorized program. We will continue to assess both our own financial performance as well as market conditions in determining when might be the most opportune time to consider reinstating future share repurchases. While no shares were repurchased during the quarter, substantially all of our cash flow from operations in the first half was deployed on the combination of share repurchases, capital expenditures and the acquisition of Lumerical.  
Now let me turn to the topic of guidance. Before I get into the specific numbers, let me just provide a few qualitative comments with respect to the ongoing impact of COVID-19 and how we are thinking about our business for the second half.  
During our last call, Ajei discussed how our team had created multiple scenarios to build out what we believe was the most appropriate framework based upon everything that we knew at the time. As we progressed through the second and into the current quarter, we have continued to execute against that framework and to evolve our plans, factoring in both new data, as it becomes available, and the continuing uncertainty that exists in the global market.  
Consistent with our practice from last quarter, we will continue to provide outlook for Q3 and the remainder of 2020 but with ranges that are wider than those historically provided to account for the increased uncertainty.  
To summarize, coming off our very strong finish in Q2, we are initiating guidance for the third quarter and increasing our revenue, earnings, ACV and operating cash flow outlook for the full year. The increases to revenue and ACV are to reflect a weaker dollar currency environment.  
Now let me move on to the details of our outlook. For Q3, we expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of $347 million to $377 million, and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.10 to $1.34. For the full year, we are increasing our outlook to factor in both our strong second quarter financial results as well as changes in key currency rates that may have taken place since we last provided our outlook in early May.  
Starting with non-GAAP revenue in the range of $1.57 billion to $1.645 billion, or constant currency growth in the range of 2% to 7% and EPS in the range of $5.75 to $6.35. We are also increasing our full year 2020 ACV outlook to a range of $1.52 billion to $1.585 billion. This represents constant currency ACV growth of 4% to 8%. With respect to the remainder of the year, in Q3, we expect the business environment that is similar to or marginally better than Q2, as many customers have not resumed full operations and employees continue to work from how. We also continue to expect that the effects of the pandemic will continue to adversely impact our levels of new business, particularly in the SMB space, and disproportionately affecting perpetual licenses. Our current outlook continues to anticipate a stronger recovery in the fourth quarter, buoyed by the pipeline for multiyear leases that are currently forecasted to close in Q4.  
Our outlook for the remainder of 2020 factors in everything that we are currently aware of with respect to ongoing trade discussions and customer sentiment across our geographically and industry-diverse customer base. It also reflects spending in the second half related to several business infrastructure and digital transformation projects as well as increased sales and third-party commissions.  
With respect to annual operating cash flow, we are increasing our outlook for 2020 to a range of $435 million to $475 million. This is reflective of our current view on full year ACV, revenue, profitability estimates and tax payments. As we have previously communicated, we have also factored into our outlook the adverse impact of customer payments that may be delayed into 2021 as a result of extended payment term negotiations on new contracts and delayed payments on existing contracts. Currently, we are increasing our estimates of the impact of 2020 operating cash flow to be in the range of $15 million to $25 million.  
Looking ahead to Q3. We are expecting operating margins in the range of 34.5% to 38.5% and for the full year, in line with our previous communications, we're expecting to finish the year with strong operating margins in the range of 40% to 42%. These targets are reflective of our adjusted spending plans for the second half of 2020. These plans continue to include a slower pace of hiring, reduced discretionary spending and decreased spending on noncritical facilities and infrastructure projects.  
In line with our previous commentary, it is our intention to continue to fund our internal digital transformation projects as these are critical elements in building the foundation to efficiently operate and scale our business over the long term. Further details around specific currency rates and other key quantitative and qualitative assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q3 and 2020 are contained in the prepared remarks document.  
We are striving to be as transparent as we can and have tried to factor in the added uncertainty around the timing of closing larger enterprise deals. We also trust that you will appreciate that there is no certainty in our assumptions, and that conditions will continue to evolve and change in either direction, depending on how long the pandemic continues to negatively impact global economies, customer sentiments and purchasing decisions as it has since this global crisis first began to unfold late in the first quarter.  
We will continue to remain focused on the things that we can control, aiming to strike a balance between short and long-term strategic initiatives that we believe are critical to strengthening our leadership position and to capturing the long-term market opportunity that we see ahead of us.  
In closing, we are very fortunate to start the year with strong first half financial and operational results. We were able to deliver well ahead in our Q2 financial commitment, including the closing of the 2 milestone deals that Ajei spoke to earlier. These strong results are a testament to both the resiliency of the ANSYS business model and to the collective efforts and dedication of our employees, customers and partners.  
The combination of our long-standing customer relationships, best-in-class products, diverse customer base, high level of recurring ACV, stable renewal rates and the strength of our balance sheet and operating cash flow all contributed to the stability of our business in these challenging times. We saw that strength and stability reflected in our results for the second quarter and first half, and these foundational pillars are what give us confidence in our outlook for the remainder of the year and our longer-term vision of making simulation pervasive.

That sounds maybe better than I would have thought 3 months ago. So I was wondering if you could maybe just provide a little more color on the scenario analysis? And if you do end up at or above the high end of expectations, what are maybe some of the reasons for that as we think about the year playing out?"

So Joe, let me start off by saying, if you look at the guide for the remainder of the year and second half, and in line with some of the comments that Ajei and I made around how Q2 had played out, if you look at the overperformance in Q2, right, influenced by 2 milestone deals, and in particular, the one paid-up deal that contributed about $10 million to paid up that was originally scheduled for Q3 that came into Q2. So our outlook on the full year hasn't really changed. But given the dynamics and the fact that the pace of acceleration in Q3 is not happening at the rate that we had projected when we spoke to you back in early May, we just thought it was more prudent, based on everything that we're seeing and the fact that customers are having extended work from home and the coronavirus situation continues to have a lot of volatility around it, it was just more prudent to go ahead and increase the ACV, to take into account what's happened relative to currency, but not change our outlook on the full year. 
We've got a good strong pipe. We got good visibility into it. The fact that we can close those milestone deals in Q2, during the height of the pandemic, continues to give us confidence that even though we've got this extended work-from-home situation, that our team is effective in engaging with customers and being able to close these deals. 
So at this point, I don't think we're ready to start talking about upside. I think we're just ready to talk about the confidence that we have in the outlook that we've put out there today."

As you consider our relationship with our customers, we have built over the decades very deep relationships with our customers, and they rely on us for the areas that are most important to them, specifically in the areas of R&D and the creation of new products. 
And even as we're seeing in certain parts of the economy and certainly, automotive is a great example where there is some short -- where there is a demand challenge that you're seeing in -- and you're seeing slowdowns, and you're seeing shutdowns in plants. What's really important to recognize and certainly, automotive companies recognize as well, is that as we come out of the pandemic, investment in R&D is what allows them to maintain their edge as they come out of this. 
And so that's it. It's a commitment to R&D. It's a commitment to the long-term success of their business. And it's a recognition that simulation, what we provide, is absolutely essential. It's a force multiplier, as I said in my comments. It's a force multiplier to their R&D initiatives. So this is one thing. 
The other thing is I think that when you consider people working from home or rethinking the digital nature of their product processes and exactly what it means now to be able to take all of your employees and have them be effective from home, it becomes even more important to consider that digital transformation. And in our opinion, there isn't a pure representation of the digital behavior of the product and simulation. That is the essence of the digital behavior of a product. 
And again, our customers recognize this. And as you start to see this transition and the understanding that digital transformation and the understanding of how to take advantage of digital technologies is going to be essential for product development in the future, I think that plays into our sweet spot. So it's customer relationships, it's the importance of simulation. It's the nature of the businesses that our customers that are running. All of those are important."

We certainly do expect to see an acceleration in the use of cloud technology and certainly, the acceleration of use of ANSYS Cloud as a result of this pandemic. There is no question that, that will be the case. However, it is off a small base, as we've said to you before, and our -- and we have a very long tail in terms of the investment that our customers have made in HPC. So you should factor all of that when you consider the dynamic in the marketplace."

As I said in the script earlier, and if you -- if you listened to our launch last week, you probably would have seen that we -- when we launched Discovery, the current version of Discovery, it is an improvement over the previous version in that we have seamless connections into our flagship solvers. So not only have we made a number of improvements to the Discovery Live version as well, we've built these seamless connections and the UI has been -- and the interface has been completely revamped as well. So it's a very interesting -- we think it's a very exciting product, and it brings together the notion of interactive modeling, it brings together real time simulation, and it brings together the accuracy of the ANSYS flagship solvers into one end-user experience that we think is radically easy to use. 
So we're very excited about this technology. The reason, obviously, we've made these enhancements is because we're getting feedback from customers, and we're evolving the technology. So we see this as being -- as certainly helping our ability to continue to sell and be successful in the marketplace. 
I also mentioned, as we're talking about Discovery, I also mentioned our partner, PTC and the success that they're seeing with their OEM of Discovery into Creo Simulation Live. So we're seeing continued trials and adoption of Discovery. We're excited about the product line. It is, as I said, and as I've been very careful to caution all of you, it is off a very small base. It's a new product in a conservative market. But we're very excited about the product and the capabilities and similarly excited about our relationship with PTC."

24893,676809164,2113916,"ANSYS, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 06, 2020",2020-08-06,"Earnings Calls","ANSYS, Inc.","Executives","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Thanks to strong execution, ANSYS delivered Q2 revenue, operating margin and earnings that exceeded the high end of our guidance. Our Q2 results illustrate the close relationships we have built with ou",1453,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Thanks to strong execution, ANSYS delivered Q2 revenue, operating margin and earnings that exceeded the high end of our guidance. Our Q2 results illustrate the close relationships we have built with our customers, which were important as the overwhelming majority of our business in Q2 was transacted remotely. 
That included 2 notable sales. First, we closed the largest total contract in our 50-year history at almost $100 million, with an existing customer in the automotive and ground transportation space. This customer is standardizing on ANSYS solutions for multi-physics, additive manufacturing, electrification and digital twin to develop great products faster and more affordably.  
Our second notable deal was our largest new business professional agreement, which was driven by our flagship HFSS for electro-magnetics and LS-DYNA for explicit analysis. This $12 million agreement with a major high-tech company had been forecasted for the second half of the year. But based on the customer's evolving needs and strong sales execution, we were able to sign the contract in Q2. That contract was the primary contributor to our Q2 revenue coming in over the high end of our guidance.  
Turning to our performance by industries. Q2 played -- largely played out as we had expected. We saw little to no reduction in demand in the high-tech and semiconductor vertical, which included the $12 million new business deal that I have already mentioned. Similarly, the defense segment remains relatively stable due to its focus on technology to support national security.  
For example, in Q2, we closed a 7-figure multiyear deal with a European defense contractor. Even while many manufacturing plants were idle due to COVID, the automotive industry is continuing its investment in R&D. In particular, OEMs and their supply chains continue to rely on simulations for emerging solutions and electrification and autonomy. Our optical solutions were adopted by a North American autonomous electric vehicle developer and by an Asian automotive OEM to advance their ADAS programs. Also in Asia, Tier 1 automotive supplier, DENSO, signed a 3-year multimillion-dollar deal to adopt ANSYS solutions for automotive parts development for electrification and autonomy.  
Our Q2 performance by geography was as we expected, with North America leading the way. North America has our largest installed base of enterprise customers, with a number of them due to renew their leases in 2020. We are seeing a high renewal rate for those leases, and are expanding on them by attaching new product sales. However, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks document, we saw a slowdown in the SMB space across all our major geographies as we had predicted in our last earnings call.  
Despite the uncertain economic times, companies are continuing their investments in R&D. As we have previously discussed, R&D is typically the initiative least impacted by budget cuts and the first restored, primarily because it drives future growth and market success. Customers view simulations and the key component of R&D, a force multiplier that helps them drive both top line revenue growth and achieve significant cost savings.  
Furthermore, the pandemic has limited access to labs for some customers, making simulations even more important than ever. Some other customers have struggled with remote access to corporate data centers and are taking advantage of ANSYS Cloud to give their engineers access to high-performance compute capacity. For example, our customer, Coca-Cola, is reporting that ANSYS Cloud is dramatically reducing the time required for simulations, making its engineers working from home even more productive than when they were in the office. Our inaugural Simulation World virtual conference clearly illustrated the importance of simulations to customers and prospects across industries. More than 55,000 registrants from around the world signed up to learn how companies, such as Ferrari, HPE, Honeywell, Siemens, Ford, Seagate and Bosch are using ANSYS simulation to develop their next-generation products.  
They also heard from our partners, including Microsoft, PTC, Autodesk and Rockwell Automation. Simulation World demonstrated the power of digital transformation and the key role that simulation plays in making our customers' digital transformation is successful.  
Our customers continued reliance on simulation. Along with our proven ability to close even the largest deals remotely, gives us confidence as we forecast the second half of the year. We have increased our guidance to reflect currency changes, improved cash flow and our EPS overachievement in Q2. Maria will give you the details in a few minutes.  
Moving to our product successes. We recently released Ansys 2020 R2. This innovative release helps distributed engineering teams accelerate innovation by harnessing new streamlined workflows and dynamic capabilities across our multiphysics product suites. Some of the many highlights of R2 include: a streamlined fluids workflow to simulate capacity fade and cell life in Fluent; integration of solver capabilities from LS-DYNA into our mechanical interface; the ability to solve over 100 million unknowns in a single simulation while delivering a nearly 10x increased solution size in our electromagnetics flagship product, HFSS; a new electrothermal option in our semiconductor solution, RedHawk-SC, which uses our big data platform to solve coupling of various structures on over 1 billion instances concurrently; and platform upgrades that empower engineers to rapidly process and finalize their designs through cloud-based high-performance computing.  
As part of our Ansys 2020 R2 launch, we also unveiled our next-generation upfront simulation solution, Ansys Discovery. With built-in seamless connection to ANSYS flagship products, Discovery now empowers all engineers to explore large -- larger design spaces and quickly answer critical design questions early, resulting in improved ensuring productivity and product quality.  
Our partner, PTC, has embedded Discovery into CAD solution, Creo Simulation Live. On its recent earnings call, PTC announced the closing of its first 7-figure Creo Simulation Live deal with a large U.S. government agency as well as the closing of 10 follow-on expansion deals.  
As the product continues to build momentum, PTC is planning new marketing programs to support sales. We have partnered with Microsoft, Dell, GE and Lendlease to form the Digital Twin Consortium. Physics-based digital twin technology enables companies to head off problems before they occur, prevent unplanned downtime, improve the customer experience and drive innovation and performance. This consortium will build an ecosystem of digital twin users, drive best practices and define requirements for new digital twin standards across industries.  
Due to our deep commitment to encouraging innovation at all levels, Fast Company has once again named ANSYS as one of the best workplaces for innovators. Working with Accenture, Fast Company recognized ANSYS for giving employees the freedom to explore the ideas that benefit our customers and the communities we serve.  
Turning to our recent moves and M&A. We started Q2 with our acquisition of Lumerical, which enables ANSYS customers to predict the behavior of light within complex photonic devices, structures and systems. By integrating Lumerical's photonics products with our semiconductor and optical suites, designers can accurately predict the impact of both nanoscale and macroscale optics for automotive displays, autonomous vehicles, augmented reality and even the development of cosmetics.  
Our acquisition of LSTC continues to play a key role in expanding our solution footprint with customers around the world. In Europe, our channel partner, DYNAmore, inked an important deal with BMW to adopt ANSYS LS-DYNA for virtual crash testing, replacing an incumbent competitor. And in Asia, a major global automotive OEM continued its investment in LS-DYNA as the product of choice for crash safety analysis.  
This is exciting news coming just months after we closed the acquisition of LSTC. 
Finally, I'm proud that ANSYS has been named one of the Bay Area's Best Places to Work by the San Francisco Business Times and the Silicon Valley Business Journal. This recognition is a testament to our diverse and inclusive culture, which incorporates valuable perspectives and background to solve complex challenges for our customers.  
To summarize, Q2 was a strong quarter, highlighted by great execution across the board, thanks to our global team of dedicated employees and channel partners. Despite the economic uncertainties, our customers know that ANSYS' simulation technologies help them solve their most vexing product challenges, whether they're working in a corporate research lab or using the cloud from their home offices. They know that ANSYS simulation delivers both top line revenue growth and significant cost savings. And they know that ANSYS simulation will position them for future growth and market success.  
Our ability to close business and to support our customers, even if they work remotely, gives us confidence to deliver against our objectives for the second half of the year.  
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Maria to discuss our financials for Q2 as well as the details around our outlook and the assumptions for the remainder of 2020. Maria?"

Hello, everyone. Ajei shared a few highlights from our Q2 results. And now let me take a few minutes to add some additional perspective on our strong second quarter financial performance and provide both qualitative and quantitative color around our outlook and key assumptions for Q3 and the remainder of 2020. I also encourage you to please review all of the Q2 earnings documents that we have posted to our Investor Relations website.  
Before I begin, I would like to take a moment to again say thank you to the ANSYS team. In our efforts to remain focused on employee safety, most of our colleagues continue to work from home throughout the second quarter, and we believe that this will likely continue to be the case throughout most of what remains of 2020.  
We have leveraged our previous investments in collaboration and infrastructure to remain connected, and we continue to seamlessly support our customers and each other. Our HR team has also promoted initiatives around health and wellness so that we can support our employees' well-being through these historic times.  
Now let me move on to our financial performance. Our Q2 results reflect the resiliency from the ANSYS business model, combined with our continued focus on executing against our plans. We finished the quarter with total revenue of $389.7 million, or constant currency revenue growth of 6%, and operating margin and EPS results that were both well above the high end of our Q2 guidance. Our revenue in Q2 was driven by strong sales execution. As Ajei mentioned earlier, the closing of the largest new business professional license deal in the company's history was the primary contributor to our revenue being above the high end of our guidance range. I would also just like to highlight that these results are quite impressive when considering the very strong comparable of last year's second quarter, in which we reported constant currency revenue growth of 23%. The combination of our strong second quarter and first half results and the strength of our sales pipeline give us confidence that we are on the right path as we continue to make meaningful progress towards achieving our longer-term strategic objectives and delivering on our 2020 financial commitment.  
Key financial metrics for the quarter continue with Q2 ACV of $344 million or constant currency growth of 6%, with 83% of ACV coming from recurring sources. Strong lease sales, which drove a 14% increase in lease license revenue combined with a continued high renewal rate on maintenance contracts, contributed to building our deferred revenue and backlog to a Q2 total of $846.5 million, an 18% increase over last year's comparable balance and a new record Q2 high. This provides us good visibility into the second half of 2020.  
The strong top line results, combined with our continued focus on fiscal discipline, helped to drive a second quarter gross margin of 90% and an operating margin of 43%, which finished well above the high end of our Q2 guidance.  
In line with the plans that we had communicated last quarter, we continued to manage our business at reduced levels of discretionary spending. The most notable being in the category of business travel and entertainment, as safety concerns continued to limit our ability to travel throughout the second quarter. These positive variances were partially offset by higher bad debt expense.  
While we have been managing the business throughout most of the first half of 2020 at a reduced pace of hiring, we did increase our employee base by approximately 170 employees in Q2, which included the addition of 58 employees through the acquisition of Lumerical that we closed on April 1.  
The net result was second quarter EPS of $1.55, which also finished above the high end of our guidance, and which benefited from the overperformance in revenue.  
With respect to taxes, our effective tax rate in Q2 was 19.5%, which is also the rate that we expect for the remainder of 2020. We further strengthened our cash and balance sheet position in the second quarter, with cash flow from operations that totaled $132 million for the quarter. Cash flow from operations was $279 million for the first half. We closed Q2 with a total of $745 million in cash and short-term investments. And through the combination of our current cash position, the additional $500 million that we have available under our undrawn revolver and our projections for 2020 operating cash flow, we remain confident that we have ample liquidity to continue to progress against our long-term strategy, while at the same time, remaining cognizant of the uncertainties that exist in the current operating environment.  
As we had previously communicated, against the backdrop of ongoing volatility and uncertainty in the global marketplace, we elected to cease our share repurchase activity during the quarter, which lays up with 2.8 million shares available for repurchase under the current authorized program. We will continue to assess both our own financial performance as well as market conditions in determining when might be the most opportune time to consider reinstating future share repurchases. While no shares were repurchased during the quarter, substantially all of our cash flow from operations in the first half was deployed on the combination of share repurchases, capital expenditures and the acquisition of Lumerical.  
Now let me turn to the topic of guidance. Before I get into the specific numbers, let me just provide a few qualitative comments with respect to the ongoing impact of COVID-19 and how we are thinking about our business for the second half.  
During our last call, Ajei discussed how our team had created multiple scenarios to build out what we believe was the most appropriate framework based upon everything that we knew at the time. As we progressed through the second and into the current quarter, we have continued to execute against that framework and to evolve our plans, factoring in both new data, as it becomes available, and the continuing uncertainty that exists in the global market.  
Consistent with our practice from last quarter, we will continue to provide outlook for Q3 and the remainder of 2020 but with ranges that are wider than those historically provided to account for the increased uncertainty.  
To summarize, coming off our very strong finish in Q2, we are initiating guidance for the third quarter and increasing our revenue, earnings, ACV and operating cash flow outlook for the full year. The increases to revenue and ACV are to reflect a weaker dollar currency environment.  
Now let me move on to the details of our outlook. For Q3, we expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of $347 million to $377 million, and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.10 to $1.34. For the full year, we are increasing our outlook to factor in both our strong second quarter financial results as well as changes in key currency rates that may have taken place since we last provided our outlook in early May.  
Starting with non-GAAP revenue in the range of $1.57 billion to $1.645 billion, or constant currency growth in the range of 2% to 7% and EPS in the range of $5.75 to $6.35. We are also increasing our full year 2020 ACV outlook to a range of $1.52 billion to $1.585 billion. This represents constant currency ACV growth of 4% to 8%. With respect to the remainder of the year, in Q3, we expect the business environment that is similar to or marginally better than Q2, as many customers have not resumed full operations and employees continue to work from how. We also continue to expect that the effects of the pandemic will continue to adversely impact our levels of new business, particularly in the SMB space, and disproportionately affecting perpetual licenses. Our current outlook continues to anticipate a stronger recovery in the fourth quarter, buoyed by the pipeline for multiyear leases that are currently forecasted to close in Q4.  
Our outlook for the remainder of 2020 factors in everything that we are currently aware of with respect to ongoing trade discussions and customer sentiment across our geographically and industry-diverse customer base. It also reflects spending in the second half related to several business infrastructure and digital transformation projects as well as increased sales and third-party commissions.  
With respect to annual operating cash flow, we are increasing our outlook for 2020 to a range of $435 million to $475 million. This is reflective of our current view on full year ACV, revenue, profitability estimates and tax payments. As we have previously communicated, we have also factored into our outlook the adverse impact of customer payments that may be delayed into 2021 as a result of extended payment term negotiations on new contracts and delayed payments on existing contracts. Currently, we are increasing our estimates of the impact of 2020 operating cash flow to be in the range of $15 million to $25 million.  
Looking ahead to Q3. We are expecting operating margins in the range of 34.5% to 38.5% and for the full year, in line with our previous communications, we're expecting to finish the year with strong operating margins in the range of 40% to 42%. These targets are reflective of our adjusted spending plans for the second half of 2020. These plans continue to include a slower pace of hiring, reduced discretionary spending and decreased spending on noncritical facilities and infrastructure projects.  
In line with our previous commentary, it is our intention to continue to fund our internal digital transformation projects as these are critical elements in building the foundation to efficiently operate and scale our business over the long term. Further details around specific currency rates and other key quantitative and qualitative assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q3 and 2020 are contained in the prepared remarks document.  
We are striving to be as transparent as we can and have tried to factor in the added uncertainty around the timing of closing larger enterprise deals. We also trust that you will appreciate that there is no certainty in our assumptions, and that conditions will continue to evolve and change in either direction, depending on how long the pandemic continues to negatively impact global economies, customer sentiments and purchasing decisions as it has since this global crisis first began to unfold late in the first quarter.  
We will continue to remain focused on the things that we can control, aiming to strike a balance between short and long-term strategic initiatives that we believe are critical to strengthening our leadership position and to capturing the long-term market opportunity that we see ahead of us.  
In closing, we are very fortunate to start the year with strong first half financial and operational results. We were able to deliver well ahead in our Q2 financial commitment, including the closing of the 2 milestone deals that Ajei spoke to earlier. These strong results are a testament to both the resiliency of the ANSYS business model and to the collective efforts and dedication of our employees, customers and partners.  
The combination of our long-standing customer relationships, best-in-class products, diverse customer base, high level of recurring ACV, stable renewal rates and the strength of our balance sheet and operating cash flow all contributed to the stability of our business in these challenging times. We saw that strength and stability reflected in our results for the second quarter and first half, and these foundational pillars are what give us confidence in our outlook for the remainder of the year and our longer-term vision of making simulation pervasive.

That sounds maybe better than I would have thought 3 months ago. So I was wondering if you could maybe just provide a little more color on the scenario analysis? And if you do end up at or above the high end of expectations, what are maybe some of the reasons for that as we think about the year playing out?"

So Joe, let me start off by saying, if you look at the guide for the remainder of the year and second half, and in line with some of the comments that Ajei and I made around how Q2 had played out, if you look at the overperformance in Q2, right, influenced by 2 milestone deals, and in particular, the one paid-up deal that contributed about $10 million to paid up that was originally scheduled for Q3 that came into Q2. So our outlook on the full year hasn't really changed. But given the dynamics and the fact that the pace of acceleration in Q3 is not happening at the rate that we had projected when we spoke to you back in early May, we just thought it was more prudent, based on everything that we're seeing and the fact that customers are having extended work from home and the coronavirus situation continues to have a lot of volatility around it, it was just more prudent to go ahead and increase the ACV, to take into account what's happened relative to currency, but not change our outlook on the full year. 
We've got a good strong pipe. We got good visibility into it. The fact that we can close those milestone deals in Q2, during the height of the pandemic, continues to give us confidence that even though we've got this extended work-from-home situation, that our team is effective in engaging with customers and being able to close these deals. 
So at this point, I don't think we're ready to start talking about upside. I think we're just ready to talk about the confidence that we have in the outlook that we've put out there today."

As you consider our relationship with our customers, we have built over the decades very deep relationships with our customers, and they rely on us for the areas that are most important to them, specifically in the areas of R&D and the creation of new products. 
And even as we're seeing in certain parts of the economy and certainly, automotive is a great example where there is some short -- where there is a demand challenge that you're seeing in -- and you're seeing slowdowns, and you're seeing shutdowns in plants. What's really important to recognize and certainly, automotive companies recognize as well, is that as we come out of the pandemic, investment in R&D is what allows them to maintain their edge as they come out of this. 
And so that's it. It's a commitment to R&D. It's a commitment to the long-term success of their business. And it's a recognition that simulation, what we provide, is absolutely essential. It's a force multiplier, as I said in my comments. It's a force multiplier to their R&D initiatives. So this is one thing. 
The other thing is I think that when you consider people working from home or rethinking the digital nature of their product processes and exactly what it means now to be able to take all of your employees and have them be effective from home, it becomes even more important to consider that digital transformation. And in our opinion, there isn't a pure representation of the digital behavior of the product and simulation. That is the essence of the digital behavior of a product. 
And again, our customers recognize this. And as you start to see this transition and the understanding that digital transformation and the understanding of how to take advantage of digital technologies is going to be essential for product development in the future, I think that plays into our sweet spot. So it's customer relationships, it's the importance of simulation. It's the nature of the businesses that our customers that are running. All of those are important."

Thanks to strong execution, ANSYS delivered Q2 revenue, operating margin and earnings that exceeded the high end of our guidance.

Thanks to strong execution, ANSYS delivered Q2 revenue, operating margin and earnings that exceeded the high end of our guidance. Our Q2 results illustrate the close relationships we have built with our customers, which were important as the overwhelming majority of our business in Q2 was transacted remotely. 
That included 2 notable sales. First, we closed the largest total contract in our 50-year history at almost $100 million, with an existing customer in the automotive and ground transportation space. This customer is standardizing on ANSYS solutions for multi-physics, additive manufacturing, electrification and digital twin to develop great products faster and more affordably.  
Our second notable deal was our largest new business professional agreement, which was driven by our flagship HFSS for electro-magnetics and LS-DYNA for explicit analysis. This $12 million agreement with a major high-tech company had been forecasted for the second half of the year. But based on the customer's evolving needs and strong sales execution, we were able to sign the contract in Q2. That contract was the primary contributor to our Q2 revenue coming in over the high end of our guidance.  
Turning to our performance by industries. Q2 played -- largely played out as we had expected. We saw little to no reduction in demand in the high-tech and semiconductor vertical, which included the $12 million new business deal that I have already mentioned. Similarly, the defense segment remains relatively stable due to its focus on technology to support national security.  
For example, in Q2, we closed a 7-figure multiyear deal with a European defense contractor. Even while many manufacturing plants were idle due to COVID, the automotive industry is continuing its investment in R&D. In particular, OEMs and their supply chains continue to rely on simulations for emerging solutions and electrification and autonomy. Our optical solutions were adopted by a North American autonomous electric vehicle developer and by an Asian automotive OEM to advance their ADAS programs. Also in Asia, Tier 1 automotive supplier, DENSO, signed a 3-year multimillion-dollar deal to adopt ANSYS solutions for automotive parts development for electrification and autonomy.  
Our Q2 performance by geography was as we expected, with North America leading the way. North America has our largest installed base of enterprise customers, with a number of them due to renew their leases in 2020. We are seeing a high renewal rate for those leases, and are expanding on them by attaching new product sales. However, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks document, we saw a slowdown in the SMB space across all our major geographies as we had predicted in our last earnings call.  
Despite the uncertain economic times, companies are continuing their investments in R&D. As we have previously discussed, R&D is typically the initiative least impacted by budget cuts and the first restored, primarily because it drives future growth and market success. Customers view simulations and the key component of R&D, a force multiplier that helps them drive both top line revenue growth and achieve significant cost savings.  
Furthermore, the pandemic has limited access to labs for some customers, making simulations even more important than ever. Some other customers have struggled with remote access to corporate data centers and are taking advantage of ANSYS Cloud to give their engineers access to high-performance compute capacity. For example, our customer, Coca-Cola, is reporting that ANSYS Cloud is dramatically reducing the time required for simulations, making its engineers working from home even more productive than when they were in the office. Our inaugural Simulation World virtual conference clearly illustrated the importance of simulations to customers and prospects across industries. More than 55,000 registrants from around the world signed up to learn how companies, such as Ferrari, HPE, Honeywell, Siemens, Ford, Seagate and Bosch are using ANSYS simulation to develop their next-generation products.  
They also heard from our partners, including Microsoft, PTC, Autodesk and Rockwell Automation. Simulation World demonstrated the power of digital transformation and the key role that simulation plays in making our customers' digital transformation is successful.  
Our customers continued reliance on simulation. Along with our proven ability to close even the largest deals remotely, gives us confidence as we forecast the second half of the year. We have increased our guidance to reflect currency changes, improved cash flow and our EPS overachievement in Q2. Maria will give you the details in a few minutes.  
Moving to our product successes. We recently released Ansys 2020 R2. This innovative release helps distributed engineering teams accelerate innovation by harnessing new streamlined workflows and dynamic capabilities across our multiphysics product suites. Some of the many highlights of R2 include: a streamlined fluids workflow to simulate capacity fade and cell life in Fluent; integration of solver capabilities from LS-DYNA into our mechanical interface; the ability to solve over 100 million unknowns in a single simulation while delivering a nearly 10x increased solution size in our electromagnetics flagship product, HFSS; a new electrothermal option in our semiconductor solution, RedHawk-SC, which uses our big data platform to solve coupling of various structures on over 1 billion instances concurrently; and platform upgrades that empower engineers to rapidly process and finalize their designs through cloud-based high-performance computing.  
As part of our Ansys 2020 R2 launch, we also unveiled our next-generation upfront simulation solution, Ansys Discovery. With built-in seamless connection to ANSYS flagship products, Discovery now empowers all engineers to explore large -- larger design spaces and quickly answer critical design questions early, resulting in improved ensuring productivity and product quality.  
Our partner, PTC, has embedded Discovery into CAD solution, Creo Simulation Live. On its recent earnings call, PTC announced the closing of its first 7-figure Creo Simulation Live deal with a large U.S. government agency as well as the closing of 10 follow-on expansion deals.  
As the product continues to build momentum, PTC is planning new marketing programs to support sales. We have partnered with Microsoft, Dell, GE and Lendlease to form the Digital Twin Consortium. Physics-based digital twin technology enables companies to head off problems before they occur, prevent unplanned downtime, improve the customer experience and drive innovation and performance. This consortium will build an ecosystem of digital twin users, drive best practices and define requirements for new digital twin standards across industries.  
Due to our deep commitment to encouraging innovation at all levels, Fast Company has once again named ANSYS as one of the best workplaces for innovators. Working with Accenture, Fast Company recognized ANSYS for giving employees the freedom to explore the ideas that benefit our customers and the communities we serve.  
Turning to our recent moves and M&A. We started Q2 with our acquisition of Lumerical, which enables ANSYS customers to predict the behavior of light within complex photonic devices, structures and systems. By integrating Lumerical's photonics products with our semiconductor and optical suites, designers can accurately predict the impact of both nanoscale and macroscale optics for automotive displays, autonomous vehicles, augmented reality and even the development of cosmetics.  
Our acquisition of LSTC continues to play a key role in expanding our solution footprint with customers around the world. In Europe, our channel partner, DYNAmore, inked an important deal with BMW to adopt ANSYS LS-DYNA for virtual crash testing, replacing an incumbent competitor. And in Asia, a major global automotive OEM continued its investment in LS-DYNA as the product of choice for crash safety analysis.  
This is exciting news coming just months after we closed the acquisition of LSTC. 
Finally, I'm proud that ANSYS has been named one of the Bay Area's Best Places to Work by the San Francisco Business Times and the Silicon Valley Business Journal. This recognition is a testament to our diverse and inclusive culture, which incorporates valuable perspectives and background to solve complex challenges for our customers.  
To summarize, Q2 was a strong quarter, highlighted by great execution across the board, thanks to our global team of dedicated employees and channel partners. Despite the economic uncertainties, our customers know that ANSYS' simulation technologies help them solve their most vexing product challenges, whether they're working in a corporate research lab or using the cloud from their home offices. They know that ANSYS simulation delivers both top line revenue growth and significant cost savings. And they know that ANSYS simulation will position them for future growth and market success.  
Our ability to close business and to support our customers, even if they work remotely, gives us confidence to deliver against our objectives for the second half of the year.  
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Maria to discuss our financials for Q2 as well as the details around our outlook and the assumptions for the remainder of 2020. Maria?"

Ajei shared a few highlights from our Q2 results. And now let me take a few minutes to add some additional perspective on our strong second quarter financial performance and provide both qualitative and quantitative color",1942,"Thank you, Ajei. Hello, everyone. Ajei shared a few highlights from our Q2 results. And now let me take a few minutes to add some additional perspective on our strong second quarter financial performance and provide both qualitative and quantitative color around our outlook and key assumptions for Q3 and the remainder of 2020. I also encourage you to please review all of the Q2 earnings documents that we have posted to our Investor Relations website.  
Before I begin, I would like to take a moment to again say thank you to the ANSYS team. In our efforts to remain focused on employee safety, most of our colleagues continue to work from home throughout the second quarter, and we believe that this will likely continue to be the case throughout most of what remains of 2020.  
We have leveraged our previous investments in collaboration and infrastructure to remain connected, and we continue to seamlessly support our customers and each other. Our HR team has also promoted initiatives around health and wellness so that we can support our employees' well-being through these historic times.  
Now let me move on to our financial performance. Our Q2 results reflect the resiliency from the ANSYS business model, combined with our continued focus on executing against our plans. We finished the quarter with total revenue of $389.7 million, or constant currency revenue growth of 6%, and operating margin and EPS results that were both well above the high end of our Q2 guidance. Our revenue in Q2 was driven by strong sales execution. As Ajei mentioned earlier, the closing of the largest new business professional license deal in the company's history was the primary contributor to our revenue being above the high end of our guidance range. I would also just like to highlight that these results are quite impressive when considering the very strong comparable of last year's second quarter, in which we reported constant currency revenue growth of 23%. The combination of our strong second quarter and first half results and the strength of our sales pipeline give us confidence that we are on the right path as we continue to make meaningful progress towards achieving our longer-term strategic objectives and delivering on our 2020 financial commitment.  
Key financial metrics for the quarter continue with Q2 ACV of $344 million or constant currency growth of 6%, with 83% of ACV coming from recurring sources. Strong lease sales, which drove a 14% increase in lease license revenue combined with a continued high renewal rate on maintenance contracts, contributed to building our deferred revenue and backlog to a Q2 total of $846.5 million, an 18% increase over last year's comparable balance and a new record Q2 high. This provides us good visibility into the second half of 2020.  
The strong top line results, combined with our continued focus on fiscal discipline, helped to drive a second quarter gross margin of 90% and an operating margin of 43%, which finished well above the high end of our Q2 guidance.  
In line with the plans that we had communicated last quarter, we continued to manage our business at reduced levels of discretionary spending. The most notable being in the category of business travel and entertainment, as safety concerns continued to limit our ability to travel throughout the second quarter. These positive variances were partially offset by higher bad debt expense.  
While we have been managing the business throughout most of the first half of 2020 at a reduced pace of hiring, we did increase our employee base by approximately 170 employees in Q2, which included the addition of 58 employees through the acquisition of Lumerical that we closed on April 1.  
The net result was second quarter EPS of $1.55, which also finished above the high end of our guidance, and which benefited from the overperformance in revenue.  
With respect to taxes, our effective tax rate in Q2 was 19.5%, which is also the rate that we expect for the remainder of 2020. We further strengthened our cash and balance sheet position in the second quarter, with cash flow from operations that totaled $132 million for the quarter. Cash flow from operations was $279 million for the first half. We closed Q2 with a total of $745 million in cash and short-term investments. And through the combination of our current cash position, the additional $500 million that we have available under our undrawn revolver and our projections for 2020 operating cash flow, we remain confident that we have ample liquidity to continue to progress against our long-term strategy, while at the same time, remaining cognizant of the uncertainties that exist in the current operating environment.  
As we had previously communicated, against the backdrop of ongoing volatility and uncertainty in the global marketplace, we elected to cease our share repurchase activity during the quarter, which lays up with 2.8 million shares available for repurchase under the current authorized program. We will continue to assess both our own financial performance as well as market conditions in determining when might be the most opportune time to consider reinstating future share repurchases. While no shares were repurchased during the quarter, substantially all of our cash flow from operations in the first half was deployed on the combination of share repurchases, capital expenditures and the acquisition of Lumerical.  
Now let me turn to the topic of guidance. Before I get into the specific numbers, let me just provide a few qualitative comments with respect to the ongoing impact of COVID-19 and how we are thinking about our business for the second half.  
During our last call, Ajei discussed how our team had created multiple scenarios to build out what we believe was the most appropriate framework based upon everything that we knew at the time. As we progressed through the second and into the current quarter, we have continued to execute against that framework and to evolve our plans, factoring in both new data, as it becomes available, and the continuing uncertainty that exists in the global market.  
Consistent with our practice from last quarter, we will continue to provide outlook for Q3 and the remainder of 2020 but with ranges that are wider than those historically provided to account for the increased uncertainty.  
To summarize, coming off our very strong finish in Q2, we are initiating guidance for the third quarter and increasing our revenue, earnings, ACV and operating cash flow outlook for the full year. The increases to revenue and ACV are to reflect a weaker dollar currency environment.  
Now let me move on to the details of our outlook. For Q3, we expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of $347 million to $377 million, and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.10 to $1.34. For the full year, we are increasing our outlook to factor in both our strong second quarter financial results as well as changes in key currency rates that may have taken place since we last provided our outlook in early May.  
Starting with non-GAAP revenue in the range of $1.57 billion to $1.645 billion, or constant currency growth in the range of 2% to 7% and EPS in the range of $5.75 to $6.35. We are also increasing our full year 2020 ACV outlook to a range of $1.52 billion to $1.585 billion. This represents constant currency ACV growth of 4% to 8%. With respect to the remainder of the year, in Q3, we expect the business environment that is similar to or marginally better than Q2, as many customers have not resumed full operations and employees continue to work from how. We also continue to expect that the effects of the pandemic will continue to adversely impact our levels of new business, particularly in the SMB space, and disproportionately affecting perpetual licenses. Our current outlook continues to anticipate a stronger recovery in the fourth quarter, buoyed by the pipeline for multiyear leases that are currently forecasted to close in Q4.  
Our outlook for the remainder of 2020 factors in everything that we are currently aware of with respect to ongoing trade discussions and customer sentiment across our geographically and industry-diverse customer base. It also reflects spending in the second half related to several business infrastructure and digital transformation projects as well as increased sales and third-party commissions.  
With respect to annual operating cash flow, we are increasing our outlook for 2020 to a range of $435 million to $475 million. This is reflective of our current view on full year ACV, revenue, profitability estimates and tax payments. As we have previously communicated, we have also factored into our outlook the adverse impact of customer payments that may be delayed into 2021 as a result of extended payment term negotiations on new contracts and delayed payments on existing contracts. Currently, we are increasing our estimates of the impact of 2020 operating cash flow to be in the range of $15 million to $25 million.  
Looking ahead to Q3. We are expecting operating margins in the range of 34.5% to 38.5% and for the full year, in line with our previous communications, we're expecting to finish the year with strong operating margins in the range of 40% to 42%. These targets are reflective of our adjusted spending plans for the second half of 2020. These plans continue to include a slower pace of hiring, reduced discretionary spending and decreased spending on noncritical facilities and infrastructure projects.  
In line with our previous commentary, it is our intention to continue to fund our internal digital transformation projects as these are critical elements in building the foundation to efficiently operate and scale our business over the long term. Further details around specific currency rates and other key quantitative and qualitative assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q3 and 2020 are contained in the prepared remarks document.  
We are striving to be as transparent as we can and have tried to factor in the added uncertainty around the timing of closing larger enterprise deals. We also trust that you will appreciate that there is no certainty in our assumptions, and that conditions will continue to evolve and change in either direction, depending on how long the pandemic continues to negatively impact global economies, customer sentiments and purchasing decisions as it has since this global crisis first began to unfold late in the first quarter.  
We will continue to remain focused on the things that we can control, aiming to strike a balance between short and long-term strategic initiatives that we believe are critical to strengthening our leadership position and to capturing the long-term market opportunity that we see ahead of us.  
In closing, we are very fortunate to start the year with strong first half financial and operational results. We were able to deliver well ahead in our Q2 financial commitment, including the closing of the 2 milestone deals that Ajei spoke to earlier. These strong results are a testament to both the resiliency of the ANSYS business model and to the collective efforts and dedication of our employees, customers and partners.  
The combination of our long-standing customer relationships, best-in-class products, diverse customer base, high level of recurring ACV, stable renewal rates and the strength of our balance sheet and operating cash flow all contributed to the stability of our business in these challenging times. We saw that strength and stability reflected in our results for the second quarter and first half, and these foundational pillars are what give us confidence in our outlook for the remainder of the year and our longer-term vision of making simulation pervasive.

So Joe, let me start off by saying, if you look at the guide for the remainder of the year and second half, and in line with some of the comments that Ajei and I made around how Q2 had played out, if you look at the overperformance in Q2, right, influenced by 2 milestone deals, and in particular, the one paid-up deal that contributed about $10 million to paid up that was originally scheduled for Q3 that came into Q2. So our outlook on the full year hasn't really changed. But given the dynamics and the fact that the pace of acceleration in Q3 is not happening at the rate that we had projected when we spoke to you back in early May, we just thought it was more prudent, based on everything that we're seeing and the fact that customers are having extended work from home and the coronavirus situation continues to have a lot of volatility around it, it was just more prudent to go ahead and increase the ACV, to take into account what's happened relative to currency, but not change our outlook on the full year. 
We've got a good strong pipe. We got good visibility into it. The fact that we can close those milestone deals in Q2, during the height of the pandemic, continues to give us confidence that even though we've got this extended work-from-home situation, that our team is effective in engaging with customers and being able to close these deals.

So we don't want to stop investing, albeit we are investing at a slower pace and very much in line with the scenarios that we had created back in May when we have realigned all of our business plans for the remainder of the year."

As you consider our relationship with our customers, we have built over the decades very deep relationships with our customers, and they rely on us for the areas that are most important to them, specifically in the areas of R&D and the creation of new products. 
And even as we're seeing in certain parts of the economy and certainly, automotive is a great example where there is some short -- where there is a demand challenge that you're seeing in -- and you're seeing slowdowns, and you're seeing shutdowns in plants. What's really important to recognize and certainly, automotive companies recognize as well, is that as we come out of the pandemic, investment in R&D is what allows them to maintain their edge as they come out of this. 
And so that's it. It's a commitment to R&D. It's a commitment to the long-term success of their business. And it's a recognition that simulation, what we provide, is absolutely essential. It's a force multiplier, as I said in my comments. It's a force multiplier to their R&D initiatives. So this is one thing. 
The other thing is I think that when you consider people working from home or rethinking the digital nature of their product processes and exactly what it means now to be able to take all of your employees and have them be effective from home, it becomes even more important to consider that digital transformation. And in our opinion, there isn't a pure representation of the digital behavior of the product and simulation. That is the essence of the digital behavior of a product. 
And again, our customers recognize this. And as you start to see this transition and the understanding that digital transformation and the understanding of how to take advantage of digital technologies is going to be essential for product development in the future, I think that plays into our sweet spot. So it's customer relationships, it's the importance of simulation. It's the nature of the businesses that our customers that are running. All of those are important."

We think it's going to take longer, just given that they are not as well capitalized and don't have the same liquidity that our enterprise customers do. And so what we're doing, we are trying to help our customers and our channel partners through these very challenging times because as we discovered in 2008 and 2009, when you go through difficult times, you're able to create very strong relationships that then you can build off for the next decade.

They're not tied to whatever investments may have been made in the data centers of -- at the time that the data centers were set up or at the time that they were updated. So there's some real advantages to being able to take advantage -- to use the Cloud. And certainly, as people and engineers are trying to get access to cloud technology from -- or access to simulation activity from wherever they may be working from home from remote locations, certainly, we see the cloud as being important. 
You have to recognize, of course, that our customers have made, in many cases, significant investments in data centers, and they continue to take advantage of those data centers. And many of our customers have built in place a working model where you have engineers in remote locations accessing their data centers remotely to be able to take advantage of our technologies. 
So it's a mix. I mean, they're taking advantage of cloud technology. Sometimes they're using on-premises, sometimes they'll use a hybrid. We certainly do expect to see an acceleration in the use of cloud technology and certainly, the acceleration of use of ANSYS Cloud as a result of this pandemic. There is no question that, that will be the case.

So we're very excited about this technology. The reason, obviously, we've made these enhancements is because we're getting feedback from customers, and we're evolving the technology.

Q3 was another strong quarter for ANSYS, meeting or beating our financial guidance on all key metrics. Our performance demonstrates that our core value proposition of helping organizations increase their top line while driving bottom line savings continues to resonate with the market. I'm excited that the demand for ANSYS' Multiphysics Solutions is strong and growing and is furthering our strategy of making simulation pervasive across the product life cycle. Based on our year-to-date performance, and the strength of our pipeline for the fourth quarter, we are increasing both the high end and the midpoint of our 2020 guidance for ACV, revenue and EPS. Maria will have the details in a few minutes. 
Our prepared remarks document has details about the quarter, but let me provide some regional perspective. We anticipate that the Americas will be our strongest region for the full year. From a quarterly perspective, Asia Pacific was strong in Q3, with Japan leading the way, reflecting our ongoing progress towards multiphysics multiyear lease deals. We expect EMEA to show good growth in driven by the timing of larger deals. 
During Q3, our enterprise and strategic account program continue to show strength, with approximately 50% of our Q3 ACV coming from our top 100 customers. I'm excited that we closed a 5-year $72 million lease with a North American enterprise customer, our largest agreement quarter and the second largest in the history of the company. This deal results in ACV in revenue in Q3 and primarily in Q4 and comes after the almost $100 million sale that we announced last quarter. 
We saw continued headwinds this quarter with small and medium businesses across geographies, consent with what we have previously communicated. From an industry point of view, the high-tech automotive and ground transportation and aerospace and defense sectors continue to be our strongest performance for the full year. 
On our past calls, I have given some additional color around particular aspects of our business. Today, I will discuss our successes in the aerospace and defense vertical. AMD is ANSYS' second largest sector at about 18% of our trailing 12 months ACV. Although the pandemic has impacted commercial air travel, we continue to see spending in the sector, thanks to important strategic initiatives. These include eco-friendly fuel-efficient engines, Space 2.0 initiatives such as rocket design and satellite deployments and national defense. 
I would like to highlight 2 important Q3 deals in which companies will use ANSYS simulation to develop eco-friendlier aircraft engines. These companies are relying on ANSYS to improve engine efficiency, reduce engine weight and avoid fuel inefficient overdesign. The first agreement was with Honeywell, which is using ANSYS simulation to automate its engineering workflows to maximize operational efficiency and drive process improvements. As a result, Honeywell will benefit from product-wide traceability and reusability while significantly cutting development cycle times. 
The second was with a major aircraft engine manufacturer that is investing $34 million over the next 5 years to standardize on ANSYS to achieve its vision of developing next-generation engines at lower cost. 
Space 2.0 companies are democratizing space by launching satellites and astronauts into orbit, and they are embracing the use of simulation to develop better products and to make smarter decisions faster. Firefly Aerospace, one of the more than 1,000 companies that have benefited from the ANSYS startup program, recently announced that it has realized about $15 million in savings from using our simulation for critical tasks leading to a design that can withstand the extreme conditions of lift off, flight and space travel. 
We are seeing ongoing investments in multiphysics simulation by government agencies and defense contractors, which are trying to solve next-generation problems in the interest of national security. These organizations are turning to ANSYS because of our simulation leadership and advanced multiphysics capabilities. 
In Q3, we saw investment from a large North American defense contractor for the design of an advanced aircraft optical sensor. To help calibrate sensor algorithms to reduce noise and blurriness due to high-speed air flow, our team developed and deployed a fully coupled aero-optical solution. This competitive win was possible not only because of ANSYS' multiphysics leadership, but also because of the unparalleled accuracy of our products. ANSYS simulations eliminated 8 weeks of testing for the company, lowering test costs by 60% and increasing engineering productivity by up to 15% using the new workflow. 
We signed another multimillion-dollar Q3 deal, this time with a government agency to use ANSYS to design chips that are more secure. This organization is relying on an important multiphysics breakthrough by ANSYS R&D, in which simulation can be used to help chip designers prevent hard to detect site channel attacks. Specifically, the new ANSYS offering, which is deployed and runs on the customers procure private cloud, enables chip and system designers to simulate and measure their vulnerability to security attacks while the chip is being designed. As an aside, this organization was amongst the first customers to serve the needs of its users and prime contractors using an ANSYS private cloud, that is ANSYS products deployed and running on a shared secured infrastructure. 
Let me move from customers to acquisitions. Last week, we announced our intent to acquire AGI, a pioneer and leader in the analysis and simulation of missions, such as satellite launches, national defense and certain rescue operations. ANSYS has not traditionally participated in this area, which is growing due to the increasing number of missions. Historically, customer needs were partially addressed by commercial software with multiple applications or by in-house codes. 
AGI has a purpose-built solution for mission analysis and simulation and has become a leading firm in this area. By combining forces with AGI, we will be able to address a broader opportunity called digital mission engineering, which combines mission simulation and analysis from AGI and component and system-level simulation from ANSYS. Our combined portfolio will enable customers to simulate up and down the stack, starting at the chip level and going all the way up to the customer's entire mission, thereby increasing the likelihood of success and saving customers' time, money and other crucial resources. 
You may remember that we formed a partnership with AGI last year, and one of the results of that was a connection between its products ANSYS HFSS, our flagship electromagnetic solver. Several large customers are using both companies' products together. One large prime contractor, for example, uses AGI software to track the radar visibility and signal availability between various mission assets and then employs ANSYS HFSS to analyze the quality of that visibility and connectivity. 
Here is another example to make it more concrete. The use of simulation to plan the successful deployment of a new telecommunication satellite. First, AGI's mission and orbital simulation capabilities can help ensure that the launch and the orbit of the new satellite avoids the collision with other objects in space. Furthermore, the combination of AGI's capabilities and ANSYS HFSS can simulate the relative position and communications capabilities of the satellite to other orbiting telecommunication satellites and to terrestial base stations to help ensure that the satellite will perform as expected when deployed. 
We will be in a position to share more with you about our plans with AGI after the transaction closes. Before I turn the call over to Maria, I'd like to discuss 2 important topics: the ANSYS Cloud offering and our commitment to ESG. 
As is cloud, which enables our customers to access high-performance computing in the public cloud, it's critically important with so many customers continuing to work remotely during the pandemic. ANSYS Cloud is built on our close collaboration with Microsoft and its Azure platform. Today, ANSYS cloud customers can use the majority of our mechanical, fluids, and electromagnetics products on the latest and highest performance compute and networking infrastructure available in the market. 
Furthermore, ANSYS cloud supports flexible consumption models, lowering the barrier to entry for customers. These include an elastic pay-as-you-go model that gives users fast access to ANSYS products and high-performance computing infrastructure in Azure for greatest convenience. A bring your own license model that allows customers to use their existing ANSYS lease licenses, thus preserving their existing investments and a hybrid model that enables customers to mix and match elastic and lease licenses for greatest flexibility. 
The demand for ANSYS Cloud continues to increase with usage doubling in the last 6 months. For example, joint ANSYS Microsoft customer, Rockwell Automation, is using ANSYS Cloud to accelerate its product development processes. The company has reduced simulation run times by 50%, enabling users to solve larger problems more accurately. Whilst we are excited about our public cloud offering and encouraged by our rapid progress, it is important to note that the majority of our customers view ANSYS products on-premises in their own data centers or in private cloud such as the government agency I mentioned earlier. As such, we expect our ANSYS cloud offering will remain a relatively small piece of our business for the foreseeable future. 
Finally, we are continuing to advance our environmental, social and governance programs. In Q3, we submitted our 2020 climate change report to CDP, which helps us identify our internal environmental risks and opportunities. This information is available on our Investor Relations website. We are also analyzing the benefits in environmental sustainability that our solutions enable for our customers and plan to make that information publicly available when ready. 
To summarize, Q3 was another strong quarter, thanks to great execution from our global team of dedicated employees and channel partners. Our compelling value proposition of helping customers to decrease costs while spurring top line growth continues to gain traction in the market. Those factors, combined with our close customer relationships, the power of ANSYS products and the strength of our pipeline gives us continued confidence as we work to deliver against our objectives for the remainder of 2020. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Maria to discuss our financials for Q3 as well as the details around our outlook and the assumptions for the remainder of the year. Maria?"
24893,691582212,2130146,"ANSYS, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2020",2020-11-05,"Earnings Calls","ANSYS, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ajei. Hello, everyone.

We're very pleased to report another quarter of strong financial performance. Driven by the team's ongoing focus on execution. I'll walk through an overview of the Q3 financial highlights and then add some additional qualitative and quantitative color around our outlook, and key assumptions for the final quarter of 2020. Before I begin, I'd like to take a moment to again say thank you to the ANSYS team. As part of our efforts to keep employees safe and healthy, most of our colleagues continue to work from home throughout the third quarter. As we previously communicated, this will continue to be the case throughout the remainder of 2020. 
Our Q3 results reflect the stability of the ANSYS business model, even in the backdrop of a prolonged global pandemic, we finished the quarter with total revenue of $369 million or constant currency revenue growth of 5%, and operating margin and EPS results that were both above the high end of our Q3 guidance. Consistent with the first half of the year, our revenue in Q3 was driven by solid sales execution. Other key financial metrics for the third quarter continue to be strong with ACV of $305 million, of which 78% is coming from recurring sources. This is a new record for Q3 with respect to both total ACV and the percent that is attributable to recurring sources. 
Q3's results reflect the continued trend in strong lease sales that we've been experiencing throughout 2020, with a 10% increase in lease license revenue. This, combined with high renewal rates on maintenance contracts, contributed to building our deferred revenue and backlog to a Q3 record total of $880 million, a 35% increase over last year's comparable balance. The solid top line results, combined with our focus on fiscal discipline, helped to drive a third quarter gross margin of 89% and an operating margin of 39.8%, which finished above the high end of our Q3 guidance. 
In line with the plans that we communicated last quarter, we continue to manage our business at reduced levels of discretionary spending, particularly in the category of business, travel and entertainment. While we also continue to manage the business at a reduced pace of hiring, we did increase our employee base by 143 employees in the third quarter. The net result was third quarter EPS of $1.36, which finished above the high end of our guidance and which benefited from the combination of the solid revenue results and ongoing fiscal discipline. 
With respect to taxes, our effective tax rate in Q3 was 19.5%, which is the rate that we expect for the remainder of 2020. We further strengthened our cash and balance sheet position in the third quarter, with cash flow from operations that totaled $94.5 million and we closed the quarter with a total of $845 million in cash and short-term investments. We remain confident that we have ample liquidity to continue to progress against our long-term strategy, while at the same time, remaining cognizant of the uncertainties that exist in the current business climate. 
Now let me move on to the topic of guidance. Coming off another strong finish in Q3, combined with our current outlook regarding the strength of the pipeline of opportunities for the balance of 2020, we are increasing both the high end and the midpoint of our ACV, revenue and earnings outlook for the full year. Let me just add that we have excluded the impact of the AGI acquisition from our updated guidance because the closing date is not certain. To the extent that the deal closes in the fourth quarter as we expect, the impact on our non-GAAP financial results will be immaterial. 
Now let me move on to the specifics of our outlook. For Q4, we expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of $542 million to $582 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.36 to $2.67. For the full year, we are increasing our outlook to non-GAAP revenue in the range of $1.610 billion to $1.650 billion. For our constant currency growth in the range of 5% to 7% and EPS in the range of $6.09 to $6.40. We are also increasing our full year 2020 HCV outlook to a range of $1.555 billion to $1.590 billion, or constant currency ACV growth of 6% to 8%. 
With respect to the remainder of the year, we expect a similar business environment in Q4 to what we experienced in Q3. That being said, we have a pipeline of enterprise customers with scheduled renewals for multiyear leases and with whom we are in active negotiations as part of their process of planning their R&D spend commitments for the remainder of the year and beyond. 
In line with what we've experienced since the health crisis first began in late Q1, we expect that the effects of the pandemic will continue to adversely impact our levels of new business, particularly in the SMB space and disproportionately affecting perpetual licenses. Our outlook for the remainder of the year factors in everything that we are currently aware of with respect to ongoing trade discussions and customer sentiment across our geographically and industry diverse customer base. It also reflects an increase in sales and third-party commissions as we head into the largest ACV quarter of the year. 
With respect to annual operating cash flow, we are maintaining our outlook for 2020 in the range of $435 million to $475 million. This is reflective of our current view on full year ACV, revenue, profitability estimates and tax payments. We have also factored into our outlook, the adverse impact of customer payments that will be delayed into 2021 because of extended payment terms negotiated on new contracts and delayed payments on existing contracts. 
We are maintaining our estimate of these payment related negative impacts by 2020 operating cash flow to be in the range of $15 million to   $25   million. Our outlook on operating cash flow also takes into account a recent unfavorable tax assessment, which we are estimating will have a negative impact of $10 million in 2020, the majority of which is expected to be recaptured in 2021's cash flow. 
Looking ahead to Q4, we are expecting operating margin in the range of 47.5% to 49.5%, and for the full year, in line with our previous outlook, we're expecting to finish the year with industry-leading operating margins in the range of 41% to 42%. 
Further details around specific currency rates and other key quantitative and qualitative assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q4 and 2020 are contained in the prepared remarks document. Consistent with our standard practice, we will provide detailed 2021 guidance once we finalize our 2021 annual planning process and close out 2020. 
We are very fortunate to finish Q3 with strong financial and operational results. These results are a testament to both the resiliency of the ANSYS business model, and to the tenacity and dedication of our employees, customers and partners. In closing, we are also very excited about the pending acquisition of Analytical graphics. As you saw in the recent press release announcing the deal, we will pay $700 million for AGI, with shareholders receiving 67% in the purchase price in cash, and 33% in ANSYS common stock. We expect to finalize closing later in Q4. 
With respect to 2021, we expect the deals to contribute an additional $75 million to $85 million of non-GAAP revenue, and then it will be modestly accretive to non-GAAP EPS. This acquisition is yet another milestone in our continued deployment of capital to grow and expand our business and our leadership in this exciting and growing market.

In some cases, they have activities or programs where they're using simulation, and you can really see the growth of the use of simulation, and that's kind of factored into the way the deal is structured. And in some cases, in a multiyear deal. And in some cases, you'll see the desire not just to increase the number of users, but maybe to bring on a new technology and start to work and add a new technology capability to that. So it really -- there's no one-size-fits-all. But what we try to do when we sit down with our customers and work through the details of a multiyear deal is to really understand the demand dynamics within the customer. We usually have a pretty good sense of where the usage is. What they'd like to try to accomplish, map that against our capabilities, and then that's how we find the basis of a conversation in the agreement."

And then tying that into AGI, you use the interesting phrase that it's purpose built.

So let me start, Jay, with the -- the first part of your -- the first part of your first -- the first part of your question, let me start with that one. Look, you're absolutely right to observe that. We have been able to bring integrated multiphysics capabilities to market to address the needs of our customers. We've talked about 5G, we've talked about electrification. These are all capabilities that require multiple physics working together, a true multiphysics capability with a workforce and integrated data flow and automation that goes with that. Rotating machinery, for example, there are many examples that we can point to. 
The infrastructure that we've built within our portfolio not only the world-class solvers and physics capabilities that we have with the infrastructure that we've built with Minerva, with our platform capabilities around                 and so forth, have all given us the ability to much more effectively and rapidly integrate these solutions or these technologies together to address the needs of customers. And so you're starting to see some of these domain-specific solutions being made available because it's so much easier to be able to integrate our technologies together to create this multiphysics capability. So absolutely, you should see more of that the side effect of that is it becomes easier to integrate active acquired technologies into our portfolio as well. 
The second part of your question was, you made the observation that mission simulation and connecting that with component level and system-level simulation, you made the observation that there may be other use cases other than space and satellite. And the answer, of course, is there's certainly other use cases that one could imagine, telecommunications, for example, 5G infrastructure, you mentioned autonomous vehicles, these are all potential future opportunities that we would have to export to evaluate whether those would be opportunities for us to engage with."

And with the recent extended lockdowns in EMEA, in certain parts of the United States, we just think there's still enough volatility and uncertainty that it makes more sense for us to continue to be prudent in our hiring and in other things that are not critical to the long-term success of the business. And additionally, as we think about Q4, our plans are to go ahead and close AGI, which will add a couple of hundred new employees into the ANSYS family. 
So I would think much more certainty around the pace of recovery in the overall global economy would make us much more comfortable to perhaps return to a more rapid pace of investments, as you saw perhaps in 2018 or 2019.

Q3 was another strong quarter for ANSYS, meeting or beating our financial guidance on all key metrics. Our performance demonstrates that our core value proposition of helping organizations increase their top line while driving bottom line savings continues to resonate with the market. I'm excited that the demand for ANSYS' multiphysics solutions is strong and growing and is furthering our strategy of making simulation pervasive across the product life cycle. Based on our year-to-date performance, and the strength of our pipeline for the fourth quarter, we are increasing both the high end and the midpoint of our 2020 guidance for ACV, revenue and EPS. Maria will have the details in a few minutes. 
Our prepared remarks document has details about the quarter, but let me provide some regional perspective. We anticipate that the Americas will be our strongest region for the full year. From a quarterly perspective, Asia Pacific was strong in Q3, with Japan leading the way, reflecting our ongoing progress towards multiphysics multiyear lease deals. We expect EMEA to show good growth in Q4 driven by the timing of larger deals. 
During Q3, our enterprise and strategic account program continue to show strength, with approximately 50% of our Q3 ACV coming from our top 100 customers. I'm excited that we closed a 5-year $72 million lease with a North American enterprise customer, our largest agreement in the quarter and the second largest in the history of the company. This deal results in ACV in revenue in Q3 and primarily in Q4 and comes after the almost $100 million sale that we announced last quarter. 
We saw continued headwinds this quarter with small and medium businesses across geographies, consistent with what we have previously communicated. From an industry point of view, the high-tech automotive and ground transportation and aerospace and defense sectors continue to be our strongest performance for the full year. 
On our past calls, I have given some additional color around particular aspects of our business. Today, I will discuss our successes in the aerospace and defense vertical. AMD is ANSYS' second largest sector at about 18% of our trailing 12 months ACV. Although the pandemic has impacted commercial air travel, we continue to see spending in the sector, thanks to important strategic initiatives. These include eco-friendly fuel-efficient engines, Space 2.0 initiatives such as rocket design and satellite deployments and national defense. 
I would like to highlight 2 important Q3 deals in which companies will use ANSYS simulation to develop eco-friendlier aircraft engines. These companies are relying on ANSYS to improve engine efficiency, reduce engine weight and avoid fuel inefficient overdesign. The first agreement was with Honeywell, which is using ANSYS simulation to automate its engineering workflows to maximize operational efficiency and drive process improvements. As a result, Honeywell will benefit from product-wide traceability and reusability while significantly cutting development cycle times. 
The second was with a major aircraft engine manufacturer that is investing $34 million over the next 5 years to standardize on ANSYS to achieve its vision of developing next-generation engines at lower cost. 
Space 2.0 companies are democratizing space by launching satellites and astronauts into orbit, and they are embracing the use of simulation to develop better products and to make smarter decisions faster. Firefly Aerospace, one of the more than 1,000 companies that have benefited from the ANSYS startup program, recently announced that it has realized about $15 million in savings from using our simulation for critical tasks leading to a design that can withstand the extreme conditions of lift off, flight and space travel. 
We are seeing ongoing investments in multiphysics simulation by government agencies and defense contractors, which are trying to solve next-generation problems in the interest of national security. These organizations are turning to ANSYS because of our simulation leadership and advanced multiphysics capabilities. 
In Q3, we saw investment from a large North American defense contractor for the design of an advanced aircraft optical sensor. To help calibrate sensor algorithms to reduce noise and blurriness due to high-speed air flow, our team developed and deployed a fully coupled aero-optical solution. This competitive win was possible not only because of ANSYS' multiphysics leadership, but also because of the unparalleled accuracy of our products. ANSYS simulations eliminated 8 weeks of testing for the company, lowering test costs by 60% and increasing engineering productivity by up to 15% using the new workflow. 
We signed another multimillion dollar Q3 deal, this time with a government agency to use ANSYS to design chips that are more secure. This organization is relying on an important multiphysics breakthrough by ANSYS R&D, in which simulation can be used to help chip designers prevent hard-to-detect side channel attacks. Specifically, the new ANSYS offering, which is deployed and runs on the customers procure private cloud, enables chip and system designers to simulate and measure their vulnerability to security attacks while the chip is being designed. As an aside, this organization was amongst the first customers to serve the needs of its users and prime contractors using an ANSYS private cloud, that is ANSYS products deployed and running on a shared secured infrastructure. 
Let me move from customers to acquisitions. Last week, we announced our intent to acquire AGI, a pioneer and leader in the analysis and simulation of missions, such as satellite launches, national defense and certain rescue operations. ANSYS has not traditionally participated in this area, which is growing due to the increasing number of missions. Historically, customer needs were partially addressed by commercial software with multiple applications or by in-house codes. 
AGI has a purpose-built solution for mission analysis and simulation and has become a leading firm in this area. By combining forces with AGI, we will be able to address a broader opportunity called digital mission engineering, which combines mission simulation and analysis from AGI and component and system-level simulation from ANSYS. Our combined portfolio will enable customers to simulate up and down the stack, starting at the chip level and going all the way up to the customer's entire mission, thereby increasing the likelihood of success and saving customers' time, money and other crucial resources. 
You may remember that we formed a partnership with AGI last year, and one of the results of that alliance was a connection between its products and ANSYS HFSS, our flagship electromagnetic solver. Several large customers are using both companies' products together. One large prime contractor, for example, uses AGI software to track the radar visibility and signal availability between various mission assets and then employs ANSYS HFSS to analyze the quality of that visibility and connectivity. 
Here is another example to make it more concrete. The use of simulation to plan the successful deployment of a new telecommunication satellite. First, AGI's mission and orbital simulation capabilities can help ensure that the launch and the orbit of the new satellite avoids the collision with other objects in space. Furthermore, the combination of AGI's capabilities and ANSYS HFSS can simulate the relative position and communications capabilities of the satellite to other orbiting telecommunication satellites and to terrestial base stations to help ensure that the satellite will perform as expected when deployed. 
We will be in a position to share more with you about our plans with AGI after the transaction closes. Before I turn the call over to Maria, I'd like to discuss 2 important topics: the ANSYS Cloud offering and our commitment to ESG. 
ANSYS Cloud, which enables our customers to access high-performance computing in the public cloud, it's critically important with so many customers continuing to work remotely during the pandemic. ANSYS Cloud is built on our close collaboration with Microsoft and its Azure platform. Today, ANSYS cloud customers can use the majority of our mechanical, fluids, and electromagnetics products on the latest and highest performance compute and networking infrastructure available in the market. 
Furthermore, ANSYS cloud supports flexible consumption models, lowering the barrier to entry for customers. These include an elastic pay-as-you-go model that gives users fast access to ANSYS products and high-performance computing infrastructure in Azure for greatest convenience, a bring-your-own license model that allows customers to use their existing ANSYS lease licenses, thus preserving their existing investments and a hybrid model that enables customers to mix and match elastic and lease licenses for greatest flexibility. 
The demand for ANSYS Cloud continues to increase with usage doubling in the last 6 months. For example, joint ANSYS Microsoft customer, Rockwell Automation, is using ANSYS Cloud to accelerate its product development processes. The company has reduced simulation run times by 50%, enabling users to solve larger problems more accurately. Whilst we are excited about our public cloud offering and encouraged by our rapid progress, it is important to note that the majority of our customers view ANSYS products on-premises in their own data centers or in private cloud such as the government agency I mentioned earlier. As such, we expect our ANSYS cloud offering will remain a relatively small piece of our business for the foreseeable future. 
Finally, we are continuing to advance our environmental, social and governance programs. In Q3, we submitted our 2020 climate change report to CDP, which helps us identify our internal environmental risks and opportunities. This information is available on our Investor Relations website. We are also analyzing the benefits in environmental sustainability that our solutions enable for our customers and plan to make that information publicly available when ready. 
To summarize, Q3 was another strong quarter, thanks to great execution from our global team of dedicated employees and channel partners. Our compelling value proposition of helping customers to decrease costs while spurring top line growth continues to gain traction in the market. Those factors, combined with our close customer relationships, the power of ANSYS products and the strength of our pipeline gives us continued confidence as we work to deliver against our objectives for the remainder of 2020. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Maria to discuss our financials for Q3 as well as the details around our outlook and the assumptions for the remainder of the year. Maria?"

We're very pleased to report another quarter of strong financial performance, driven by the team's ongoing focus on execution. I'll walk through an overview of the Q3 financial highlights and then add some additional qualitative and quantitative color around our outlook, and key assumptions for the final quarter of 2020. Before I begin, I'd like to take a moment to again say thank you to the ANSYS team. As part of our efforts to keep employees safe and healthy, most of our colleagues continue to work from home throughout the third quarter. And as we previously communicated, this will continue to be the case throughout the remainder of 2020. 
Our Q3 results reflect the stability of the ANSYS business model, even in the backdrop of a prolonged global pandemic, we finished the quarter with total revenue of $369 million or constant currency revenue growth of 5%, and operating margin and EPS results that were both above the high end of our Q3 guidance. Consistent with the first half of the year, our revenue in Q3 was driven by solid sales execution. Other key financial metrics for the third quarter continue to be strong with ACV of $305 million, of which 78% is coming from recurring sources. This is a new record for Q3 with respect to both total ACV and the percent that is attributable to recurring sources. 
Q3's results reflect the continued trend in strong lease sales that we've been experiencing throughout 2020, with a 10% increase in lease license revenue. This, combined with high renewal rates on maintenance contracts, contributed to building our deferred revenue and backlog to a Q3 record total of $880 million, a 35% increase over last year's comparable balance. The solid top line results, combined with our focus on fiscal discipline, helped to drive a third quarter gross margin of 89% and an operating margin of 39.8%, which finished above the high end of our Q3 guidance. 
In line with the plans that we communicated last quarter, we continue to manage our business at reduced levels of discretionary spending, particularly in the category of business travel and entertainment. While we also continue to manage the business at a reduced pace of hiring, we did increase our employee base by 143 employees in the third quarter. The net result was third quarter EPS of $1.36, which finished above the high end of our guidance and which benefited from the combination of the solid revenue results and ongoing fiscal discipline. 
With respect to taxes, our effective tax rate in Q3 was 19.5%, which is the rate that we expect for the remainder of 2020. We further strengthened our cash and balance sheet position in the third quarter, with cash flow from operations that totaled $94.5 million, and we closed the quarter with a total of $845 million in cash and short-term investments. We remain confident that we have ample liquidity to continue to progress against our long-term strategy, while at the same time, remaining cognizant of the uncertainties that exist in the current business climate. 
Now let me move on to the topic of guidance. Coming off another strong finish in Q3, combined with our current outlook regarding the strength of the pipeline of opportunities for the balance of 2020, we are increasing both the high end and the midpoint of our ACV, revenue and earnings outlook for the full year. Let me just add that we have excluded the impact of the AGI acquisition from our updated guidance because the closing date is not certain. To the extent that the deal closes in the fourth quarter as we expect, the impact on our non-GAAP financial results will be immaterial. 
Now let me move on to the specifics of our outlook. For Q4, we expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of $542 million to $582 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.36 to $2.67. For the full year, we are increasing our outlook to non-GAAP revenue in the range of $1.610 billion to $1.650 billion, or constant currency growth in the range of 5% to 7% and EPS in the range of $6.09 to $6.40. We are also increasing our full year 2020 ACV outlook to a range of $1.555 billion to $1.590 billion, or constant currency ACV growth of 6% to 8%. 
With respect to the remainder of the year, we expect a similar business environment in Q4 to what we experienced in Q3. That being said, we have a pipeline of enterprise customers with scheduled renewals for multiyear leases and with whom we are in active negotiations as part of their process of planning their R&D spend commitments for the remainder of the year and beyond. 
In line with what we've experienced since the health crisis first began in late Q1, we expect that the effects of the pandemic will continue to adversely impact our levels of new business, particularly in the SMB space and disproportionately affecting perpetual licenses. Our outlook for the remainder of the year factors in everything that we are currently aware of with respect to ongoing trade discussions and customer sentiment across our geographically and industry diverse customer base. It also reflects an increase in sales and third-party commissions as we head into the largest ACV quarter of the year. 
With respect to annual operating cash flow, we are maintaining our outlook for 2020 in the range of $435 million to $475 million. This is reflective of our current view on full year ACV, revenue, profitability estimates and tax payments. We have also factored into our outlook, the adverse impact of customer payments that will be delayed into 2021 because of extended payment terms negotiated on new contracts and delayed payments on existing contracts. 
We are maintaining our estimate of these payment related negative impacts by 2020 operating cash flow to be in the range of $15 million to $25 million. Our outlook on operating cash flow also takes into account a recent unfavorable tax assessment, which we are estimating, will have a negative impact of $10 million in 2020, the majority of which is expected to be recaptured in 2021's cash flow. 
Looking ahead to Q4, we are expecting operating margin in the range of 47.5% to 49.5%, and for the full year, in line with our previous outlook, we're expecting to finish the year with industry-leading operating margins in the range of 41% to 42%. 
Further details around specific currency rates and other key quantitative and qualitative assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q4 and 2020 are contained in the prepared remarks document. Consistent with our standard practice, we will provide detailed 2021 guidance once we finalize our 2021 annual planning process and close out 2020. 
We are very fortunate to finish Q3 with strong financial and operational results. These results are a testament to both the resiliency of the ANSYS business model and to the tenacity and dedication of our employees, customers and partners. In closing, we are also very excited about the pending acquisition of Analytical Graphic. As you saw in the recent press release announcing the deal, we will pay $700 million for AGI, with its shareholders receiving 67% in the purchase price in cash and 33% in ANSYS common stock. We expect to finalize closing later in Q4. 
With respect to 2021, we expect the deals to contribute an additional $75 million to $85 million of non-GAAP revenue, and then it will be modestly accretive to non-GAAP EPS. This acquisition is yet another milestone in our continued deployment of capital to grow and expand our business and our leadership in this exciting and growing market.

So let me start, Jay, with the -- the first part of your -- the first part of your first -- the first part of your question, let me start with that one. Look, you're absolutely right to observe that. We have been able to bring integrated multiphysics capabilities to market to address the needs of our customers. We've talked about 5G, we've talked about electrification. These are all capabilities that require multiple physics working together, a true multiphysics capability with a workflow and integrated data flow and automation that goes with that. Rotating machinery, for example, there are many examples that we can point to. 
The infrastructure that we've built within our portfolio not only the world-class solvers and physics capabilities that we have with the infrastructure that we've built with Minerva, with our platform capabilities around EMEA and so forth, have all given us the ability to much more effectively and rapidly integrate these solutions or these technologies together to address the needs of customers. And so you're starting to see some of these domain-specific solutions being made available because it's so much easier to be able to integrate our technologies together to create this multiphysics capability. So absolutely, you should see more of that. The side effect of that is it becomes easier to integrate active acquired technologies into our portfolio as well. 
The second part of your question was, you made the observation that mission simulation and connecting that with component level and system-level simulation, you made the observation that there may be other use cases other than space and satellite. And the answer, of course, is if there's certainly other use cases that one could imagine, telecommunications, for example, 5G infrastructure, you mentioned autonomous vehicles, these are all potential future opportunities that we would have to export to evaluate whether those would be opportunities for us to engage with."

It seems like your recent partnership announcement with Microsoft was a nice expansion. I guess I'm thinking in terms of the new physics as well as the go-to-market offerings or the joint go-to-market efforts. I'm just curious, if there -- are there any technical limitations to bringing the rest of your simulation portfolio over to ANSYS Cloud? I know, Ajei, you mentioned, you've continued to expand. Are there any limitation, bringing the rest of it over? And I guess as a follow-up, are our customers asking about ANSYS cloud-like offering that may run on top of AWS or GCP, just given their unique needs?"

The ANSYS cloud offering per se, the one that we take to market is running on top of Azure. And there really isn't any fundamental restriction on the capabilities that we could make available on ANSYS Cloud. We have our flagships on ANSYS Cloud, and we will continue to add capabilities to that -- to the cloud offering as it makes sense. So it's -- you should look to us to continue to make investments in ANSYS Cloud. You should look to more capabilities in there. But we have to be cognizant of the fact that, as I've explained in my comments, we have to be cognizant of the fact that our customers, for the most part, are still running on-premises in their own data centers or in private clouds. And our objective is to make sure that our technology is there. It's available and ready to go. And as and when the customers are ready, we're able to support them with ANSYS Cloud."
