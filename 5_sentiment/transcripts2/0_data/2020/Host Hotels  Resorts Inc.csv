We had significant accomplishments under his tenure that Brian will address and we wish him well as he begins his role as Global Head of for Morgan Stanley based in Los Angeles. 
2019 was another highly productive year for Host. We successfully executed large value-enhancing capital allocation transactions and delivered a solid operational performance, which exceeded our adjusted EBITDAre and adjusted FFO per diluted share expectations for the fourth quarter. We capitalized on favorable market conditions and sold 14 of our lower total REVPAR, higher capital expenditure hotels for $1.3 billion. We further upgraded the quality of our portfolio by acquiring the iconic One Hotel South Beach, completing 4 renovations as part of the Marriott transformational capital program, investing in multiple value-enhancing development projects across the portfolio. We returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while further strengthening our best-in-class investment-grade balance sheet. 
Finally, we delivered our strongest comparable total RevPAR and RevPAR performance for 2019 in the fourth quarter while achieving solid margins in the year challenged by accelerating wage and benefit expense growth. We exceeded the top end of our full year 2019 adjusted EBITDAre guidance range, primarily due to stronger-than-expected total revenue growth at our noncomparable hotels. Comparable hotel total RevPAR was 190 basis points due to better-than-expected food and beverage as well as other revenues. We will discuss our fourth quarter results in more detail later. 
I would like to now focus on the 4 key business trends that impacted our 2019 operational performance and that are expected to impact 2020 as well. First is the strong food and beverage and other revenue growth that we experienced in the quarter and year. We delivered comparable total RevPAR growth that is 200 basis points higher than comparable room's RevPAR growth for the quarter, 160 basis points higher for the year. Food and beverage revenues grew largely because of corporate in-house group business, which typically had robust contribution ratios. Other revenues were bolstered by miscellaneous increases, including higher golf and spa revenues. Our solid total RevPAR growth speaks to our ability to grow revenues through multiple channels at our hotels. Approximately, 35% of our revenues are earned from food and beverage, conference and meeting space, spa and other amenities. In an environment where the industry is near peak occupancy with modest ADR growth, our ability to grow revenues through nonroom sources is a key strength of our portfolio. While we expect continued total RevPAR growth in 2020, its growth rate should be roughly the same as RevPAR due to a tougher year-over-year comparison. 
The second trend is the strong growth we've experienced in loyalty redemption revenues, which has supported our leisure demand. Some of its increase is due to structural changes that Marriott International has introduced long redemptions, such as the opportunity to earn greater redemption revenue through increased occupancy tiers. Marriott introduced Bonvoy in early 2019 with the rollout across all consumer touch points, including our property sales and marketing channels, digital, mobile and co-branded credit cards. Additionally, the launch was boosted by a multimillion dollar media campaign. In late 2019, Marriott announced peak and offpeak redemption schedule, which should further support our 2020 growth expectations. Our redemption revenues have grown well in excess of the revenues outlined in the business case Marriott made for Bonvoy in 2019. In the fourth quarter, we grew Marriott Bonvoy redemption revenues by nearly 22% for our comparable hotels and 24% for all our own Marriott hotels, with the Venetian Ritz-Carlton
And Ritz-Carlton Marina del Rey achieving the highest redemption revenues in the portfolio. Although redemption revenues will also face tough comparisons this year, Host's ability to leverage Marriott's powerful loyalty program is another key strength for our business. 
The third trend is the continued acceleration in wage and benefit expense growth. Wage and benefit expenses increased 370 basis points in the quarter and 290 basis points for the year on a year-over-year basis. We were able to largely offset this expense growth through a variety of external and internal initiatives, which allows us to achieve breakeven margins at 1% RevPAR growth in 2019. Our external initiatives were driven by near-term Marriott Starwood merger synergies, which were largely realized in 2019. Our internal initiatives, we expect smaller incremental efficiencies in 2020 relative to last year. Meanwhile, we expect wage and benefit expense growth to increase by approximately 5% in 2020 over 2019 as unemployment remains at all-time lows and job openings in the lodging sector reached record highs. Our 2020 guidance for comparable hotel expense, however, is for 2.5% to 3.5% growth per available room, primarily due to productivity gains, partially offsetting wage and benefit expense growth. As a result, we expect breakeven margins at 3.5% to 4% RevPAR growth in 2020. We will further detail the impact of wage and benefit expense growth on our 2020 EBITDA margins. But here are 3 key takeaways on this issue. First, we expect the rate of wage and benefit growth to peak in 2020. Second, we are continuing to work with our operators to adopt productivity-enhancing technology that will decrease our operating costs over the long term. And third, our exposure to world-class operators like Marriott and Hyatt leaves us relatively well positioned in a tight labor market, given their best-in-class retention and low turnover. Finally, we see prolonged macro uncertainty continuing to negatively impact expectations for U.S. nonresidential fixed investment, which has slowed materially from 6.4% in 2018 to 2.1% in 2019 and is now expected to grow by just 70 basis points in 2020. RevPAR is highly correlated with this metric, which is being impacted by trade and political uncertainty in an election year as well as by coronavirus. A sustained increase in nonresidential fixed investment would be a positive catalyst for the industry. But until it accelerates, our expectations for business transient travel remain muted, and our managers continue to focus on driving group and leisure business. 
Moving on to our outlook for group business in 2020. We are pleased to begin the year with total group revenues being 4.2% ahead of the same time last year as we benefit from a favorable citywide convention calendar 2020, with San Diego, Miami, Orlando and Washington D.C. all pacing ahead. We had approximately 77.5% of our group rooms on the books and 150 basis points ahead of the same time last year. Thus far, we haven't experienced a material direct impact on our business from coronavirus as Chinese travelers contribute approximately 1.5% of our room revenues. That said, the situation continues to evolve and with prevailing uncertainty could put further diluted credit pressure on business transient revenues. Additionally, supply is continuing to grow this year with a 2.3% increase expected across all scales on a net basis. As a result, we expect full year comparable constant dollar RevPAR growth to range between flat to up 1%. We would note that the addition of the 1 Hotel South Beach added approximately 10 basis points to our newly defined 2020 full year comparable RevPAR growth guidance as we owned the hotel for nearly all of 2019. We  expect comparable EBITDA margins to be down 165 basis points at the low end and down 125 basis points at the high end of our guidance. These assumptions result in full year forecasted adjusted EBITDAre of $1.360 billion to $1.405 billion. While the midpoint of our of our 2020 total EBITDA guidance reflects a 10% year-over-year decline, approximately 60% of this decline is attributable to 2019 asset sales and declines in our noncomparable hotels due to renovations. Notably, our comparable hotel EBITDA is expected to decline by only 2.5% to 5% year-over-year. 
Finally, with much of the decline in EBITDA mitigated by our stock repurchase program, we expected adjusted FFO per diluted share of $1.65 to $1.71. Although margins are being impacted by accelerating wage and benefit cost growth this year, it is important to note that comparable EBITDA margins have improved by 80 basis points from 28.2% in 2016 to approximately 29% last year. We have helped total expense growth steady at less than 1.5% for the last 3 years through a variety of external and internal initiatives. As mentioned earlier, wage and benefit cost growth is expected to peak this year, and we are working with our operators to adopt productivity-enhancing technology that we anticipate will decrease our operating costs over the long term. 
Shifting to the Marriott transformational capital program. 2 of the 4 renovations we completed last year, Coronado Island Marriott and New York Marriott Downtown have already achieved meaningful RevPAR index gains and are well positioned to accelerate EBITDA growth and stabilization. The San Francisco Marriott Marquis and Santa Clara Marriott were completed in the second half of 2019. While it's too early to measure improvement, we have high expectations for these 2 properties. We expect to invest between $180 million to $200 million in the program this year and to complete renovations at the San Antonio Rivercenter and Minneapolis, Marriott City Center in the first and second quarter, respectively, and JW Marriott Atlanta Buckhead in the fourth quarter. We will also complete the second phases of 3 phased renovations at both the New York Marriott Marquis and the Orlando World Center. By the end of 2020, this program will be 60% to 70% complete. We are pleased to be completing these renovations in a low RevPAR growth environment, which minimizes the impact of the disruption and leaves us well positioned to achieve meaningful RevPAR index gains and accelerated EBITDA growth at stabilization. 
In addition to the Marriott transformational capital program, we are also implementing multiple value-enhancing ROI projects across the portfolio. We categorize these as developments, operational projects and energy efficiency or sustainability projects. developments include developing a 165 key AC by Marriott on excess surface parking at The Westin Kierland in Scottsdale and adding 19 new 2-bedroom luxury sellers at the Andaz Maui. Operational projects include adding meeting space at the Orlando World Center, converting underutilized lobby space into grab-and-go marketplaces, repositioning F&B and adding keys at several properties. Additionally, we have multiple energy efficiency projects which are an important part of our industry-leading corporate responsibility program and include major systems overhauls, value key retrofits and solar panels, among others. We have historically achieved a high-teens average cash-on-cash return on these ROI projects, and we expect to grow this program going forward as an important piece of our capital allocation strategy. We differentiate ourselves through extraordinary execution, which achieved both a strong business case and prioritizes our sustainability goals for these projects. We have been recognized for our leadership and performance on sustainability, earning our seventh consecutive green star and overall global sector leader designation as well as a 5-star rating from this year. We have also been named to the Dow Jones World Sustainability Index for the first time, and the North America Sustainability Index for the third time. Have won NAREIT, lodging and resort leader in the light award 4 times in the past 5 years and most recently have been named a CDP's A list for leading our action against client change. 
To conclude with capital allocation, let me briefly review our execution over the last 2 years within the context of our long-term strategic vision for Host. Since 2018, we sold $3.3 billion of relatively lower quality and lower total RevPAR assets in our portfolio. We have invested $1.6 billion into iconic assets with 2019 total RevPAR was more than double that of the assets we sold. All 4 of our acquisitions are in excellent condition, with limited near-term capital needs. We achieved higher blended cap rates and EBITDA multiples on our acquisitions that on our dispositions and have thereby minimized dilution to earnings while significantly upgrading the quality of our portfolio. In addition, we have nearly $610 million of stock since mid-2019, amounting to nearly 5% of our weighted average shares outstanding. 
Finally, we have meaningfully strengthened our balance sheet by increasing our liquidity, extending our debt maturities and lowering our borrowing costs. Our asset recycling has reduced our CapEx intensity and improved the blended cap rate and long-term NAV profile of our portfolio. Our share repurchases have been accretive to FFO per diluted share, and the enhanced flexibility of our balance sheet has provided us with greater optionality to create significant long-term value for our shareholders. Today, our flexibility and willingness to use the appropriate value creation tool, whether it's stock buybacks, asset recycling, development or redevelopment at the opportune time to create meaningful value for our shareholders, is what best differentiates Host from most of its lodging peers. We have clearly demonstrated our willingness to use these value creation tools in 2019 and will continue to do so in 2020. 
Our long-term strategic vision is to own iconic and irreplaceable assets with high total RevPAR and limited near-term CapEx needs in key markets with strong and diverse demand generators. Market conditions over the last couple of years have enabled us to substantially reposition our portfolio at an accelerated pace. We believe that apart from a small number of assets that we would like to eventually monetize, our portfolio is where we want to be at this point in the economic cycle. 
With regard to acquisitions, while the bar remains high, we will continue to evaluate assets that meet our strategic objectives, focusing on opportunities where we can leverage our competitive advantages such as the owner, broker and operator relationships, our ability to do large transactions and our reputation for providing speed and closing and the flexibility of operating taxes and structures to sellers. 
Overall, we are very well positioned with a favorable citywide convention calendar supporting operational performance this year and balance sheet flexibility, providing us with greater optionality to create significant long-term value for our shareholders. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Brian."

We delivered adjusted EBITDAre of $355 million for the quarter and $1.534 billion for the year. As mentioned, we exceeded the top end of our 2019 adjusted EBITDAre guidance mainly due to strong revenue growth at our noncomparable hotels. Noncomparable total RevPAR grew 940 basis points for the quarter, primarily due to a post renovation lift at the San Francisco Marriott Marquis and strong redemption revenues at the Ritz-Carlton Naples. 
For the fourth quarter, comparable total RevPAR grew 190 basis points primarily due to higher food and beverage and other revenues. While fourth quarter comparable RevPAR declined 10 basis points, it would have been flat, adjusted for the estimated 10 basis points of renovation disruption related to the Marriott transformational capital program. During the quarter, occupancy was unchanged, but ADR decreased by 10 basis points, primarily due to the anticipated decline in group business, driven by an unfavorable citywide convention calendar. Transient revenue grew 270 basis points due to the growth in leisure demand which more than offset the continued business transient weakness. Although business transient revenues for the fourth quarter were down 350 basis points, driven by a room night decline of 340 basis points, we would note that the fourth quarter was the least affected by declines in business travel due to the favorable holiday shift in December. 
Looking at individual market performance for the fourth quarter. Our top 5 total RevPAR growth markets were: Orlando, Florida Gulf Coast, Atlanta, Denver and Phoenix, while New Orleans, Seattle, San Antonio, Northern Virginia and Hawaii trailed the portfolio. We think an important measure of our success in 2019 was our ability to deliver strong margin performance. Comparable EBITDA margins only declined 10 basis points for the quarter and 5 basis points for the full year, in line with the midpoint of our full year 2019 guidance. We believe this is an impressive performance as wage and benefit expense grew 370 basis points, driven by hourly wage rate increases, most notably in Southern California. While California was especially affected, the unemployment rate in most of our markets was below the national average of 3.7%, driving significant increases in wage and benefit expense across the portfolio. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended 2019 with a $3.8 billion of total debt, $1.6 billion of unrestricted cash and $1.5 billion of available capacity under our credit facility revolver. During 2019, we achieved several major financial milestones. First, we refinanced $1 billion in term loans and expanded our revolving credit facility by $500 million to $1.5 billion. Second, we achieved an upgrade of our corporate credit rating to BBB- from BB+ by S&P Global Ratings. Third, we refinanced $650 million of senior notes by issuing the first green bond in the lodging industry, with a coupon of 3 3/8% and yield to maturity of 3.467%. And these represent the lowest effective 10-year bond pricing and overall yield achieved in our history. Lastly, we have minimal debt maturing until 2023, with a balanced debt maturity schedule with no more than 7% of our debt as a percentage of enterprise value maturing in any given year. 
In summary, we have executed over $3 billion of refinancing, which resulted in extending our total weighted average debt maturity to 5.4 years, reducing our weighted average interest rate to 3.8%, all while maintaining in an appropriately balanced floating rate mix of 26%. 
Finally, in 2019, we returned significant value to our shareholders with $482 million of stock repurchases as well as a total cash dividend of $0.85 per share, which represents a yield of approximately 5% on our current stock price. We also just announced the first quarter dividend of $0.20 per share. 
Turning to the forecast. Let me take a few minutes to detail the assumptions underlying our 2020 guidance. As Jim mentioned, we expect our revenue performance to be driven by group and leisure transient business as a result of the citywide calendar, growing economy and strong employment numbers. While the U.S. economy continues an unprecedented growth cycle, we have been thoughtful about the impact of the global economy and our own election cycle, which we believe continues to constrain the level of business investment. Overall, we expect our performance to be stronger in the first half of 2020 due to the strength of our group booking pace and more difficult comps in the second half of the year. We will also continue to benefit from owner's priority and operating profit guarantees related to the Marriott transformational capital program. Our forecast includes a total of $16 million of operating profit guarantees from Marriott, of which $9 million is included in comparable hotel EBITDA. Equally important, we expect as more properties are completed, we should begin to see an increase in each hotel's RevPAR index, which should bolster overall EBITDA for the properties. 
For modeling purposes, we expect adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter will range from 26% to 28% of our annual forecast. 
Lastly, total shares currently outstanding are approximately $705 million, reflecting the additional shares repurchased in the first quarter. 
In conclusion, we believe that Host Hotels & Resorts is the premier lodging REIT in the industry. We have a high-quality, well-diversified portfolio whose consistent performance is driven by strong in-house analytics and by working with the best operators in the business. With the only investment-grade balance sheet among lodging REITs, we are well positioned to continue to execute on our strategic vision to create long-term value for our shareholders.

Given what happened to our industry and the post 9/11 world and then live it again in 2008, 2009. So I think if we were to find ourselves in this type of RevPAR  growth environment or a flat to negative RevPAR growth environment with resulting EBITDA declines, we would be having meaningful conversations with our operators about brand standards. And that can mean everything from taking a look at restaurant offerings and hours of operation to guest to guest demand in current lounges and lounges Not that we're not doing this today. We would really push the lines labor scheduling and technology. So I think that's 1 of the first things that we would do if we found ourselves near the environment for an extended period of time. On the capital allocation front, our balance sheet has never been in better shape. We -- as we sit here today, we have $1.6 billion of unrestricted cash. And if we were to go to 3x leverage today, we could buy $2.5 billion plus of assets -- $2.5 billion to $3 billion plus of assets. As we think about the macro environment that we operate in today, we are being measured in our capital allocation decisions. We like the optionality that our balance sheet gives us today. If we're in a slow growth environment, couple of things we would consider doing might include accelerating investment in our portfolio going forward. We have the ability to do that so that our assets are very well positioned when we see a reacceleration of RevPAR. We might consider if our stock price comes under pressure enhancing the buyback program. And lastly, I think that if we are in this environment for an extended period of time, you're likely to see some distress in the hotel world. We're seeing it already in New York. There's been a number of articles written regarding the level of default in New York City going up. And we like the position we're in with the balance sheet that we have, the optionality and flexibility to pivot one way or the other in good times or in tough times."

2019 was another highly productive year for Host. We successfully executed large value-enhancing capital allocation transactions and delivered a solid operational performance, which exceeded our adjusted EBITDAre and adjusted FFO per diluted share expectations for the fourth quarter. We capitalized on favorable market conditions and sold 14 of our lower total RevPAR, higher capital expenditure hotels for $1.3 billion. We further upgraded the quality of our portfolio by acquiring the iconic 1 Hotel South Beach, completing 4 renovations as part of the Marriott transformational capital program, and investing in multiple value-enhancing development projects across the portfolio. We returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while further strengthening our best-in-class investment-grade balance sheet.
Finally, we delivered our strongest comparable total RevPAR and RevPAR performance for 2019 in the fourth quarter, while achieving solid margins in the year challenged by accelerating wage and benefit expense growth. We exceeded the top end of our full year 2019 adjusted EBITDAre guidance range, primarily due to stronger-than-expected total revenue growth at our noncomparable hotels. Comparable hotel total RevPAR was 190 basis points due to better-than-expected food and beverage as well as other revenues. We will discuss our fourth quarter results in more detail later.
I would like to now focus on the 4 key business trends that impacted our 2019 operational performance and that are expected to impact 2020 as well. First is the strong food and beverage and other revenue growth that we experienced in the quarter and year. We delivered comparable total RevPAR growth that is 200 basis points higher than comparable room's RevPAR growth for the quarter and160 basis points higher for the year. Food and beverage revenues grew largely because of corporate in-house group business, which typically had robust contribution ratios. Other revenues were bolstered by miscellaneous increases, including higher golf and spa revenues. Our solid total RevPAR growth speaks to our ability to grow revenues through multiple channels at our hotels. Approximately, 35% of our revenues are earned from food and beverage, conference and meeting space, spa and other amenities. In an environment where the industry is near peak occupancy with modest ADR growth, our ability to grow revenues through nonroom sources is a key strength of our portfolio. While we expect continued total RevPAR growth in 2020, its growth rate should be roughly the same as RevPAR due to a tougher year-over-year comparison.
The second trend is the strong growth we've experienced in loyalty redemption revenues, which has supported our leisure demand. Some of the increase is due to structural changes that Marriott International has introduced Bonvoy redemption, such as the opportunity to earn greater redemption revenue through increased occupancy tiers. Marriott introduced Bonvoy in early 2019 with the rollout across all consumer touch points, including our property sales and marketing channels, digital, mobile and co-branded credit cards. Additionally, the launch was boosted by a multimillion dollar media campaign. In late 2019, Marriott announced peak and offpeak redemption schedule, which should further support our 2020 growth expectations. Our redemption revenues have grown well in excess of the revenues outlined in the business case Marriott made for Bonvoy in 2019. In the fourth quarter, we grew Marriott Bonvoy redemption revenues by nearly 22% for our comparable hotels and 24% for all our own Marriott hotels, with the Venetian Ritz-Carlton, Naples and Ritz-Carlton, Marina del Rey achieving the highest redemption revenues in the portfolio. Although redemption revenues will also face tough comparisons this year, Host's ability to leverage Marriott's powerful loyalty program is another key strength for our business.
The third trend is the continued acceleration in wage and benefit expense growth. Wage and benefit expenses increased 370 basis points in the quarter and 290 basis points for the year on a year-over-year basis. We were able to largely offset this expense growth through a variety of external and internal initiatives, which allows us to achieve breakeven margins at 1% RevPAR growth in 2019. Our external initiatives were driven by near-term Marriott-Starwood merger synergy, which were largely realized in 2019. Our internal initiatives, we expect smaller incremental efficiencies in 2020 relative to last year. Meanwhile, we expect wage and benefit expense growth to increase by approximately 5% in 2020 over 2019 as unemployment remains at all-time lows and job openings in the lodging sector reach record highs. Our 2020 guidance for comparable hotel expenses, however, is for 2.5% to 3.5% growth per available room, primarily due to productivity gain, partially offsetting wage and benefit expense growth. As a result, we expect breakeven margins at 3.5% to 4% RevPAR growth in 2020. We will further detail the impact of wage and benefit expense growth on our 2020 EBITDA margins. But here are 3 key takeaways on this issue. First, we expect the rate of wage and benefit growth to peak in 2020. Second, we are continuing to work with our operators to adopt productivity-enhancing technology that will decrease our operating costs over the long term. And third, our exposure to world-class operators like Marriott and Hyatt leaves us relatively well positioned in a tight labor market, given their best-in-class retention and low turnover. Finally, we see prolonged macro uncertainty continuing to negatively impact expectations for U.S. nonresidential fixed investment, which has slowed materially from 6.4% in 2018 to 2.1% in 2019 and is now expected to grow by just 70 basis points in 2020. RevPAR is highly correlated with this metric, which is being impacted by trade and political uncertainty in an election year as well as by coronavirus. A sustained increase in nonresidential fixed investment would be a positive catalyst for the industry. But until it accelerates, our expectations for business transient travel remain muted, and our managers continue to focus on driving group and leisure business.
Moving on to our outlook for group business in 2020. We are pleased to begin the year with total group revenue being 4.2% ahead of the same time last year as we benefit from a favorable citywide convention calendar 2020, with San Diego, Miami, Orlando and Washington, D.C. all pacing ahead. We had approximately 77.5% of our group rooms on the books and are 150 basis points ahead of the same time last year. Thus far, we haven't experienced a material direct impact on our business from coronavirus as Chinese travelers contribute approximately 1.5% of our room revenues. That said, the situation continues to evolve and the prevailing uncertainty could put further downward pressure on business transient revenues. Additionally, supply is continuing to grow this year with a 2.3% increase expected across all scales on a net basis. As a result, we expect full year comparable constant dollar RevPAR growth to range between flat to up 1%. We would note that the addition of the 1 Hotel South Beach added approximately 10 basis points to our newly defined 2020 full year comparable RevPAR growth guidance as we owned the hotel for nearly all of 2019. We expect comparable EBITDA margins to be down 165 basis points at the low end and down 125 basis points at the high end of our guidance. These assumptions result in full year forecasted adjusted EBITDAre of $1.360 billion to $1.405 billion. While the midpoint of our -- of our 2020 total EBITDA guidance reflects a 10% year-over-year decline, approximately 60% of this decline is attributable to 2019 asset sales and declines in our noncomparable hotels due to renovation. Notably, our comparable hotel EBITDA is expected to decline by only 2.5% to 5% year-over-year.
Finally, with much of the decline in EBITDA mitigated by our stock repurchase program, we expect adjusted FFO per diluted share of $1.65 to $1.71. Although margins are being impacted by accelerating wage and benefit cost growth this year, it is important to note that comparable EBITDA margins have improved by 80 basis points from 28.2% in 2016 to approximately 29% last year. We have held total expense growth steady at less than 1.5% for the last 3 years through a variety of external and internal initiatives. As mentioned earlier, wage and benefit cost growth is expected to peak this year, and we are working with our operators to adopt productivity-enhancing technology that we anticipate will decrease our operating costs over the long term.
Shifting to the Marriott transformational capital program. 2 of the 4 renovations we completed last year, Coronado Island Marriott and New York Marriott Downtown have already achieved meaningful RevPAR index gains and are well positioned to accelerate EBITDA growth and stabilization. The San Francisco Marriott Marquis and Santa Clara Marriott were completed in the second half of 2019. And while it's too early to measure improvement, we have high expectations for these 2 properties. We expect to invest between $180 million to $200 million in the program this year and to complete renovations at the San Antonio Rivercenter and Minneapolis Marriott City Center in the first and second quarter, respectively, and JW Marriott Atlanta Buckhead in the fourth quarter. We will also complete the second phases of 3-phased renovations at both the New York Marriott Marquis and the Orlando World Center. By the end of 2020, this program will be 60% to 70% complete. We are pleased to be completing these renovations in a low RevPAR growth environment, which minimizes the impact of the disruption and leaves us well positioned to achieve meaningful RevPAR index gains and accelerated EBITDA growth at stabilization.
In addition to the Marriott transformational capital program, we are also implementing multiple value-enhancing ROI projects across the portfolio. We categorize these as product development, operational projects and energy efficiency or sustainability projects. Product developments include developing a 165-key AC by Marriott on excess surface parking at The Westin Kierland in Scottsdale and adding 19 new 2-bedroom luxury villas at the Andaz Maui. Operational projects include adding meeting space at the Orlando World Center, converting underutilized lobby space into grab-and-go marketplaces, repositioning F&B office and adding keys at several properties. Additionally, we have multiple energy efficiency projects which are an important part of our industry-leading corporate responsibility program and include major systems overhauls, LED retrofit and solar panels, among others. We have historically achieved a high-teens average cash-on-cash return on these ROI projects, and we expect to grow this program going forward as an important piece of our capital allocation strategy. We differentiate ourselves through extraordinary execution, which achieves both a strong business case and prioritizes our sustainability goals for these projects. We have been recognized for our leadership and performance on sustainability, earning our seventh consecutive Green Star and Overall Global Sector Leader designation as well as a 5-star rating from GRESB this year. We have also been named to the Dow Jones World Sustainability Index for the first time and the North America Sustainability Index for the third time. Have won the NAREIT Lodging and Resorts Leader in Light Award 4 times in the past 5 years and most recently have been named to CDP's A list for leading our action against climate change.
To conclude with capital allocation, let me briefly review our execution over the last 2 years within the context of our long-term strategic vision for Host. Since 2018, we sold $3.3 billion of relatively lower quality and lower total RevPAR assets in our portfolio. We have invested $1.6 billion into iconic assets with 2019 total RevPAR with more than double that of the assets we sold. All 4 of our acquisitions are in excellent condition, with limited near-term capital needs. We achieved higher blended cap rates and EBITDA multiples on our acquisitions than on our dispositions and have thereby minimized dilution to earnings while significantly upgrading the quality of our portfolio. In addition, we have bought nearly $610 million of stock since mid-2019, amounting to nearly 5% of our weighted average share outstanding.
Finally, we have meaningfully strengthened our balance sheet by increasing our liquidity, extending our debt maturities and lowering our borrowing costs. Our asset recycling has reduced our CapEx intensity and improved the blended cap rate and long-term NAV profile of our portfolio. Our share repurchases have been accretive to FFO per diluted share, and the enhanced flexibility of our balance sheet has provided us with greater optionality to create significant long-term value for our shareholders. Today, our flexibility and willingness to use the appropriate value creation tool, whether it's stock buybacks, asset recycling, development or redevelopment at the opportune time to create meaningful value for our shareholders is what best differentiates Host from most of its lodging REIT peers. We have clearly demonstrated our willingness to use these value creation tools in 2019 and will continue to do so in 2020.
Our long-term strategic vision is to own iconic and irreplaceable assets with high total RevPAR and limited near-term CapEx needs in key markets with strong and diverse demand generators. Market conditions over the last couple of years have enabled us to substantially reposition our portfolio at an accelerated pace. We believe that apart from a small number of assets that we would like to eventually monetize, our portfolio is where we want to be at this point in the economic cycle.
With regard to acquisitions, while the bar remains high, we will continue to evaluate assets that meet our strategic objectives, focusing on opportunities where we can leverage our competitive advantages such as the owner, broker and operator relationships, our ability to do large transactions and our reputation for providing speed and certainty of closing and the flexibility of operating, taxes and e-structures to sellers.
Overall, we are very well positioned with a favorable citywide convention calendar supporting operational performance this year and balance sheet flexibility providing us with greater optionality to create significant long-term value for our shareholders.
With that, I will turn the call over to Brian."

We delivered adjusted EBITDAre of $355 million for the quarter and $1.534 billion for the year. As mentioned, we exceeded the top end of our 2019 adjusted EBITDAre guidance mainly due to strong revenue growth at our noncomparable hotels. Noncomparable total RevPAR grew 940 basis points for the quarter, primarily due to a post renovation lift at the San Francisco Marriott Marquis and strong redemption revenues at the Ritz-Carlton Naples.
For the fourth quarter, comparable total RevPAR grew 190 basis points primarily due to higher food and beverage and other revenues. While fourth quarter comparable RevPAR declined 10 basis points, it would have been flat if adjusted for the estimated 10 basis points of renovation disruption related to the Marriott transformational capital program. During the quarter, occupancy was unchanged, but ADR decreased by 10 basis points, primarily due to the anticipated decline in group business, driven by an unfavorable citywide convention calendar. Transient revenue grew 270 basis points due to the growth in leisure demand which more than offset the continued business transient weakness. Although business transient revenues for the fourth quarter were down 350 basis points, driven by a room night decline of 340 basis points, we would note that the fourth quarter was the least affected by declines in business travel due to the favorable holiday shift in December.
Looking at individual market performance for the fourth quarter. Our top 5 total RevPAR growth markets were: Orlando, Florida Gulf Coast, Atlanta, Denver and Phoenix, while New Orleans, Seattle, San Antonio, Northern Virginia and Hawaii trailed the portfolio. We think an important measure of our success in 2019 was our ability to deliver strong margin performance. Comparable EBITDA margins only declined 10 basis points for the quarter and 5 basis points for the full year, in line with the midpoint of our full year 2019 guidance. We believe this is an impressive performance as wage and benefit expense grew 370 basis points, driven by hourly wage rate increases, most notably in Southern California. While California was especially affected, the unemployment rate in most of our markets was below the national average of 3.7%, driving significant increases in wage and benefit expense across the portfolio.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended 2019 with $3.8 billion of total debt, $1.6 billion of unrestricted cash and $1.5 billion of available capacity under our credit facility revolver. During 2019, we achieved several major financial milestones. First, we refinanced $1 billion in term loans and expanded our revolving credit facility by $500 million to $1.5 billion. Second, we achieved an upgrade of our corporate credit rating to BBB- from BB+ by S&P Global Ratings. Third, we refinanced $650 million of senior notes by issuing the first green bond in the lodging industry, with a coupon of 3 3/8% and yield to maturity of 3.467%. These represent the lowest effective 10-year bond pricing and overall yield achieved in our history. Lastly, we have minimal debt maturing until 2023, with a balanced debt maturity schedule with no more than 7% of our debt as a percentage of enterprise value maturing in any given year.
In summary, we have executed over $3 billion of refinancing, which resulted in extending our total weighted average debt maturity to 5.4 years, reducing our weighted average interest rate to 3.8%, all while maintaining an appropriately balanced floating rate mix of 26%.
Finally, in 2019, we returned significant value to our shareholders with $482 million of stock repurchases as well as a total cash dividend of $0.85 per share, which represents a yield of approximately 5% on our current stock price. We also just announced the first quarter dividend of $0.20 per share.
Turning to the forecast. Let me take a few minutes to detail the assumptions underlying our 2020 guidance. As Jim mentioned, we expect our revenue performance to be driven by group and leisure transient business as a result of the citywide calendar, growing economy and strong employment numbers. While the U.S. economy continues an unprecedented growth cycle, we have been thoughtful about the impact of the global economy and our own election cycle, which we believe continues to constrain the level of business investment. Overall, we expect our performance to be stronger in the first half of 2020 due to the strength of our group booking pace and more difficult comps in the second half of the year. We will also continue to benefit from owner's priority and operating profit guarantees related to the Marriott transformational capital program. Our forecast includes a total of $16 million of operating profit guarantees from Marriott, of which $9 million is included in comparable hotel EBITDA. Equally important, we expect as more properties are completed, we should begin to see an increase in each hotel's RevPAR index, which should bolster overall EBITDA for the properties.
For modeling purposes, we expect adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter will range from 26% to 28% of our annual forecast.
Lastly, total shares currently outstanding are approximately $705 million, reflecting the additional shares repurchased in the first quarter.
In conclusion, we believe that Host Hotels & Resorts is the premier lodging REIT in the industry. We have a high-quality, well-diversified portfolio whose consistent performance is driven by strong in-house analytics and by working with the best operators in the business. With the only investment-grade balance sheet among lodging REITs, we are well positioned to continue to execute on our strategic vision to create long-term value for our shareholders.

Again, it's something that we think about from a -- not only from a capital allocation perspective, but also from an operation perspective. We have lived through some pretty meaningful down cycles. I won't go back beyond 9/11. But of course, we learnt a lot, given what happened to our industry in the post 9/11 world and then lived it again in 2008, 2009. So I think if we were to find ourselves in this type of tepid RevPAR growth environment or flat to negative RevPAR growth environment with resulting EBITDA declines, we would be having meaningful conversations with our operators about lasting brand standards. And that can mean everything from taking a look at restaurant offerings and hours of operation to in-room guest amenities, to guest amenities in concierge lounges and club lounges. Not that we're not doing this today. We would really push beyond those lines labor scheduling and technology. So I think that's one of the first things that we would do if we found ourselves near to this environment for an extended period of time. On the capital allocation front, our balance sheet has never been in better shape. We -- as we sit here today, we have $1.6 billion of unrestricted cash. And if we were to go 3x leverage today, we could buy $2.5 billion plus of assets -- $2.5 billion to $3 billion plus of assets. As we think about the macro environment that we operate in today, we are being measured in our capital allocation decisions. We like the optionality that our balance sheet gives us today. If we're in a slow growth environment, couple of things we would consider doing might include accelerating investment in our portfolio going forward. We have the ability to do that, so that our assets are very well positioned when we see a reacceleration of RevPAR. We might consider if our stock price comes under pressure, enhancing the buyback program. And lastly, I think that if we are in this environment for an extended period of time, you're likely to see some distress in the hotel world. We're seeing it already in New York. There's been a number of articles written regarding the level of default in New York City going up. And we like the position we're in with the balance sheet that we have, the optionality and flexibility to pivot one way or the other in good times or in tough times."

It's going to range from property to property. Our returns on the Andaz Maui villas given the cost associated with developing and building Hawaii is likely to be on the lower end of that range, whereas we're in the process of moving forward with a large part at the Orlando World Center Marriott, where we expect very meaningful cash-on-cash returns as a result of putting that amenity in place and what that will allow us to do is shoulder a weakened transient business. So the attractive returns we think that in addition to buying back our stock, which we view as incredibly inexpensive today, that investing in our portfolio is a very good place to be allocating capital. It's easier to underwrite these returns given our knowledge of the assets and the in-house expertise that we have. We have a best-in-class team, both on the asset management side and on our design construction side with years and years of experience of doing these types of projects. We are not going to say we never had a surprise, but we had very few surprises when it comes to construction budgets and timing. And we're very comfortable with our underwriting.

2019 was another highly productive year for Host. We successfully executed large value-enhancing capital allocation transactions and delivered a solid operational performance, which exceeded our adjusted EBITDAre and adjusted FFO per diluted share expectations for the fourth quarter. We capitalized on favorable market conditions and sold 14 of our lower total RevPAR, higher capital expenditure hotels for $1.3 billion. We further upgraded the quality of our portfolio by acquiring the iconic 1 Hotel South Beach, completing 4 renovations as part of the Marriott transformational capital program, and investing in multiple value-enhancing development projects across the portfolio. We returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while further strengthening our best-in-class investment-grade balance sheet.
Finally, we delivered our strongest comparable total RevPAR and RevPAR performance for 2019 in the fourth quarter, while achieving solid margins in the year challenged by accelerating wage and benefit expense growth. We exceeded the top end of our full year 2019 adjusted EBITDAre guidance range, primarily due to stronger-than-expected total revenue growth at our noncomparable hotels. Comparable hotel total RevPAR was 190 basis points due to better-than-expected food and beverage as well as other revenues. We will discuss our fourth quarter results in more detail later.
I would like to now focus on the 4 key business trends that impacted our 2019 operational performance and that are expected to impact 2020 as well. First is the strong food and beverage and other revenue growth that we experienced in the quarter and year. We delivered comparable total RevPAR growth that is 200 basis points higher than comparable room's RevPAR growth for the quarter and160 basis points higher for the year. Food and beverage revenues grew largely because of corporate in-house group business, which typically had robust contribution ratios. Other revenues were bolstered by miscellaneous increases, including higher golf and spa revenues. Our solid total RevPAR growth speaks to our ability to grow revenues through multiple channels at our hotels. Approximately, 35% of our revenues are earned from food and beverage, conference and meeting space, spa and other amenities. In an environment where the industry is near peak occupancy with modest ADR growth, our ability to grow revenues through nonroom sources is a key strength of our portfolio. While we expect continued total RevPAR growth in 2020, its growth rate should be roughly the same as RevPAR due to a tougher year-over-year comparison.
The second trend is the strong growth we've experienced in loyalty redemption revenues, which has supported our leisure demand. Some of the increase is due to structural changes that Marriott International has introduced Bonvoy redemption, such as the opportunity to earn greater redemption revenue through increased occupancy tiers. Marriott introduced Bonvoy in early 2019 with the rollout across all consumer touch points, including our property sales and marketing channels, digital, mobile and co-branded credit cards. Additionally, the launch was boosted by a multimillion dollar media campaign. In late 2019, Marriott announced peak and offpeak redemption schedule, which should further support our 2020 growth expectations. Our redemption revenues have grown well in excess of the revenues outlined in the business case Marriott made for Bonvoy in 2019. In the fourth quarter, we grew Marriott Bonvoy redemption revenues by nearly 22% for our comparable hotels and 24% for all our own Marriott hotels, with the Venetian Ritz-Carlton, Naples and Ritz-Carlton, Marina del Rey achieving the highest redemption revenues in the portfolio. Although redemption revenues will also face tough comparisons this year, Host's ability to leverage Marriott's powerful loyalty program is another key strength for our business.
The third trend is the continued acceleration in wage and benefit expense growth. Wage and benefit expenses increased 370 basis points in the quarter and 290 basis points for the year on a year-over-year basis. We were able to largely offset this expense growth through a variety of external and internal initiatives, which allows us to achieve breakeven margins at 1% RevPAR growth in 2019. Our external initiatives were driven by near-term Marriott-Starwood merger synergy, which were largely realized in 2019. Our internal initiatives, we expect smaller incremental efficiencies in 2020 relative to last year. Meanwhile, we expect wage and benefit expense growth to increase by approximately 5% in 2020 over 2019 as unemployment remains at all-time lows and job openings in the lodging sector reach record highs. Our 2020 guidance for comparable hotel expenses, however, is for 2.5% to 3.5% growth per available room, primarily due to productivity gain, partially offsetting wage and benefit expense growth. As a result, we expect breakeven margins at 3.5% to 4% RevPAR growth in 2020. We will further detail the impact of wage and benefit expense growth on our 2020 EBITDA margins. But here are 3 key takeaways on this issue. First, we expect the rate of wage and benefit growth to peak in 2020. Second, we are continuing to work with our operators to adopt productivity-enhancing technology that will decrease our operating costs over the long term. And third, our exposure to world-class operators like Marriott and Hyatt leaves us relatively well positioned in a tight labor market, given their best-in-class retention and low turnover. Finally, we see prolonged macro uncertainty continuing to negatively impact expectations for U.S. nonresidential fixed investment, which has slowed materially from 6.4% in 2018 to 2.1% in 2019 and is now expected to grow by just 70 basis points in 2020. RevPAR is highly correlated with this metric, which is being impacted by trade and political uncertainty in an election year as well as by coronavirus. A sustained increase in nonresidential fixed investment would be a positive catalyst for the industry. But until it accelerates, our expectations for business transient travel remain muted, and our managers continue to focus on driving group and leisure business.
Moving on to our outlook for group business in 2020. We are pleased to begin the year with total group revenue being 4.2% ahead of the same time last year as we benefit from a favorable citywide convention calendar 2020, with San Diego, Miami, Orlando and Washington, D.C. all pacing ahead. We had approximately 77.5% of our group rooms on the books and are 150 basis points ahead of the same time last year. Thus far, we haven't experienced a material direct impact on our business from coronavirus as Chinese travelers contribute approximately 1.5% of our room revenues. That said, the situation continues to evolve and the prevailing uncertainty could put further downward pressure on business transient revenues. Additionally, supply is continuing to grow this year with a 2.3% increase expected across all scales on a net basis. As a result, we expect full year comparable constant dollar RevPAR growth to range between flat to up 1%. We would note that the addition of the 1 Hotel South Beach added approximately 10 basis points to our newly defined 2020 full year comparable RevPAR growth guidance as we owned the hotel for nearly all of 2019. We expect comparable EBITDA margins to be down 165 basis points at the low end and down 125 basis points at the high end of our guidance. These assumptions result in full year forecasted adjusted EBITDAre of $1.360 billion to $1.405 billion. While the midpoint of our -- of our 2020 total EBITDA guidance reflects a 10% year-over-year decline, approximately 60% of this decline is attributable to 2019 asset sales and declines in our noncomparable hotels due to renovation. Notably, our comparable hotel EBITDA is expected to decline by only 2.5% to 5% year-over-year.
Finally, with much of the decline in EBITDA mitigated by our stock repurchase program, we expect adjusted FFO per diluted share of $1.65 to $1.71. Although margins are being impacted by accelerating wage and benefit cost growth this year, it is important to note that comparable EBITDA margins have improved by 80 basis points from 28.2% in 2016 to approximately 29% last year. We have held total expense growth steady at less than 1.5% for the last 3 years through a variety of external and internal initiatives. As mentioned earlier, wage and benefit cost growth is expected to peak this year, and we are working with our operators to adopt productivity-enhancing technology that we anticipate will decrease our operating costs over the long term.
Shifting to the Marriott transformational capital program. 2 of the 4 renovations we completed last year, Coronado Island Marriott and New York Marriott Downtown have already achieved meaningful RevPAR index gains and are well positioned to accelerate EBITDA growth and stabilization. The San Francisco Marriott Marquis and Santa Clara Marriott were completed in the second half of 2019. And while it's too early to measure improvement, we have high expectations for these 2 properties. We expect to invest between $180 million to $200 million in the program this year and to complete renovations at the San Antonio Rivercenter and Minneapolis Marriott City Center in the first and second quarter, respectively, and JW Marriott Atlanta Buckhead in the fourth quarter. We will also complete the second phases of 3-phased renovations at both the New York Marriott Marquis and the Orlando World Center. By the end of 2020, this program will be 60% to 70% complete. We are pleased to be completing these renovations in a low RevPAR growth environment, which minimizes the impact of the disruption and leaves us well positioned to achieve meaningful RevPAR index gains and accelerated EBITDA growth at stabilization.
In addition to the Marriott transformational capital program, we are also implementing multiple value-enhancing ROI projects across the portfolio. We categorize these as product development, operational projects and energy efficiency or sustainability projects. Product developments include developing a 165-key AC by Marriott on excess surface parking at The Westin Kierland in Scottsdale and adding 19 new 2-bedroom luxury villas at the Andaz Maui. Operational projects include adding meeting space at the Orlando World Center, converting underutilized lobby space into grab-and-go marketplaces, repositioning F&B office and adding keys at several properties. Additionally, we have multiple energy efficiency projects which are an important part of our industry-leading corporate responsibility program and include major systems overhauls, LED retrofit and solar panels, among others. We have historically achieved a high-teens average cash-on-cash return on these ROI projects, and we expect to grow this program going forward as an important piece of our capital allocation strategy. We differentiate ourselves through extraordinary execution, which achieves both a strong business case and prioritizes our sustainability goals for these projects. We have been recognized for our leadership and performance on sustainability, earning our seventh consecutive Green Star and Overall Global Sector Leader designation as well as a 5-star rating from GRESB this year. We have also been named to the Dow Jones World Sustainability Index for the first time and the North America Sustainability Index for the third time. Have won the NAREIT Lodging and Resorts Leader in Light Award 4 times in the past 5 years and most recently have been named to CDP's A list for leading our action against climate change.
To conclude with capital allocation, let me briefly review our execution over the last 2 years within the context of our long-term strategic vision for Host. Since 2018, we sold $3.3 billion of relatively lower quality and lower total RevPAR assets in our portfolio. We have invested $1.6 billion into iconic assets with 2019 total RevPAR with more than double that of the assets we sold. All 4 of our acquisitions are in excellent condition, with limited near-term capital needs. We achieved higher blended cap rates and EBITDA multiples on our acquisitions than on our dispositions and have thereby minimized dilution to earnings while significantly upgrading the quality of our portfolio. In addition, we have bought nearly $610 million of stock since mid-2019, amounting to nearly 5% of our weighted average share outstanding.
Finally, we have meaningfully strengthened our balance sheet by increasing our liquidity, extending our debt maturities and lowering our borrowing costs. Our asset recycling has reduced our CapEx intensity and improved the blended cap rate and long-term NAV profile of our portfolio. Our share repurchases have been accretive to FFO per diluted share, and the enhanced flexibility of our balance sheet has provided us with greater optionality to create significant long-term value for our shareholders. Today, our flexibility and willingness to use the appropriate value creation tool, whether it's stock buybacks, asset recycling, development or redevelopment at the opportune time to create meaningful value for our shareholders is what best differentiates Host from most of its lodging REIT peers. We have clearly demonstrated our willingness to use these value creation tools in 2019 and will continue to do so in 2020.
Our long-term strategic vision is to own iconic and irreplaceable assets with high total RevPAR and limited near-term CapEx needs in key markets with strong and diverse demand generators. Market conditions over the last couple of years have enabled us to substantially reposition our portfolio at an accelerated pace. We believe that apart from a small number of assets that we would like to eventually monetize, our portfolio is where we want to be at this point in the economic cycle.
With regard to acquisitions, while the bar remains high, we will continue to evaluate assets that meet our strategic objectives, focusing on opportunities where we can leverage our competitive advantages such as the owner, broker and operator relationships, our ability to do large transactions and our reputation for providing speed and certainty of closing and the flexibility of operating, taxes and e-structures to sellers.
Overall, we are very well positioned with a favorable citywide convention calendar supporting operational performance this year and balance sheet flexibility providing us with greater optionality to create significant long-term value for our shareholders.
With that, I will turn the call over to Brian."

We delivered adjusted EBITDAre of $355 million for the quarter and $1.534 billion for the year. As mentioned, we exceeded the top end of our 2019 adjusted EBITDAre guidance mainly due to strong revenue growth at our noncomparable hotels. Noncomparable total RevPAR grew 940 basis points for the quarter, primarily due to a post renovation lift at the San Francisco Marriott Marquis and strong redemption revenues at the Ritz-Carlton Naples.
For the fourth quarter, comparable total RevPAR grew 190 basis points primarily due to higher food and beverage and other revenues. While fourth quarter comparable RevPAR declined 10 basis points, it would have been flat if adjusted for the estimated 10 basis points of renovation disruption related to the Marriott transformational capital program. During the quarter, occupancy was unchanged, but ADR decreased by 10 basis points, primarily due to the anticipated decline in group business, driven by an unfavorable citywide convention calendar. Transient revenue grew 270 basis points due to the growth in leisure demand which more than offset the continued business transient weakness. Although business transient revenues for the fourth quarter were down 350 basis points, driven by a room night decline of 340 basis points, we would note that the fourth quarter was the least affected by declines in business travel due to the favorable holiday shift in December.
Looking at individual market performance for the fourth quarter. Our top 5 total RevPAR growth markets were: Orlando, Florida Gulf Coast, Atlanta, Denver and Phoenix, while New Orleans, Seattle, San Antonio, Northern Virginia and Hawaii trailed the portfolio. We think an important measure of our success in 2019 was our ability to deliver strong margin performance. Comparable EBITDA margins only declined 10 basis points for the quarter and 5 basis points for the full year, in line with the midpoint of our full year 2019 guidance. We believe this is an impressive performance as wage and benefit expense grew 370 basis points, driven by hourly wage rate increases, most notably in Southern California. While California was especially affected, the unemployment rate in most of our markets was below the national average of 3.7%, driving significant increases in wage and benefit expense across the portfolio.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended 2019 with $3.8 billion of total debt, $1.6 billion of unrestricted cash and $1.5 billion of available capacity under our credit facility revolver. During 2019, we achieved several major financial milestones. First, we refinanced $1 billion in term loans and expanded our revolving credit facility by $500 million to $1.5 billion. Second, we achieved an upgrade of our corporate credit rating to BBB- from BB+ by S&P Global Ratings. Third, we refinanced $650 million of senior notes by issuing the first green bond in the lodging industry, with a coupon of 3 3/8% and yield to maturity of 3.467%. These represent the lowest effective 10-year bond pricing and overall yield achieved in our history. Lastly, we have minimal debt maturing until 2023, with a balanced debt maturity schedule with no more than 7% of our debt as a percentage of enterprise value maturing in any given year.
In summary, we have executed over $3 billion of refinancing, which resulted in extending our total weighted average debt maturity to 5.4 years, reducing our weighted average interest rate to 3.8%, all while maintaining an appropriately balanced floating rate mix of 26%.
Finally, in 2019, we returned significant value to our shareholders with $482 million of stock repurchases as well as a total cash dividend of $0.85 per share, which represents a yield of approximately 5% on our current stock price. We also just announced the first quarter dividend of $0.20 per share.
Turning to the forecast. Let me take a few minutes to detail the assumptions underlying our 2020 guidance. As Jim mentioned, we expect our revenue performance to be driven by group and leisure transient business as a result of the citywide calendar, growing economy and strong employment numbers. While the U.S. economy continues an unprecedented growth cycle, we have been thoughtful about the impact of the global economy and our own election cycle, which we believe continues to constrain the level of business investment. Overall, we expect our performance to be stronger in the first half of 2020 due to the strength of our group booking pace and more difficult comps in the second half of the year. We will also continue to benefit from owner's priority and operating profit guarantees related to the Marriott transformational capital program. Our forecast includes a total of $16 million of operating profit guarantees from Marriott, of which $9 million is included in comparable hotel EBITDA. Equally important, we expect as more properties are completed, we should begin to see an increase in each hotel's RevPAR index, which should bolster overall EBITDA for the properties.
For modeling purposes, we expect adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter will range from 26% to 28% of our annual forecast.
Lastly, total shares currently outstanding are approximately $705 million, reflecting the additional shares repurchased in the first quarter.
In conclusion, we believe that Host Hotels & Resorts is the premier lodging REIT in the industry. We have a high-quality, well-diversified portfolio whose consistent performance is driven by strong in-house analytics and by working with the best operators in the business. With the only investment-grade balance sheet among lodging REITs, we are well positioned to continue to execute on our strategic vision to create long-term value for our shareholders.

I won't go back beyond 9/11. But of course, we learnt a lot, given what happened to our industry in the post 9/11 world and then lived it again in 2008, 2009. So I think if we were to find ourselves in this type of tepid RevPAR growth environment or flat to negative RevPAR growth environment with resulting EBITDA declines, we would be having meaningful conversations with our operators about lasting brand standards. And that can mean everything from taking a look at restaurant offerings and hours of operation to in-room guest amenities, to guest amenities in concierge lounges and club lounges. Not that we're not doing this today. We would really push beyond those lines labor scheduling and technology. So I think that's one of the first things that we would do if we found ourselves near to this environment for an extended period of time. On the capital allocation front, our balance sheet has never been in better shape. We -- as we sit here today, we have $1.6 billion of unrestricted cash. And if we were to go 3x leverage today, we could buy $2.5 billion plus of assets -- $2.5 billion to $3 billion plus of assets. As we think about the macro environment that we operate in today, we are being measured in our capital allocation decisions. We like the optionality that our balance sheet gives us today. If we're in a slow growth environment, couple of things we would consider doing might include accelerating investment in our portfolio going forward. We have the ability to do that, so that our assets are very well positioned when we see a reacceleration of RevPAR. We might consider if our stock price comes under pressure, enhancing the buyback program. And lastly, I think that if we are in this environment for an extended period of time, you're likely to see some distress in the hotel world. We're seeing it already in New York. There's been a number of articles written regarding the level of default in New York City going up. And we like the position we're in with the balance sheet that we have, the optionality and flexibility to pivot one way or the other in good times or in tough times."

It's going to range from property to property. Our returns on the Andaz Maui villas given the cost associated with developing and building Hawaii is likely to be on the lower end of that range, whereas we're in the process of moving forward with a large part at the Orlando World Center Marriott, where we expect very meaningful cash-on-cash returns as a result of putting that amenity in place and what that will allow us to do is shoulder a weakened transient business. So the attractive returns we think that in addition to buying back our stock, which we view as incredibly inexpensive today, that investing in our portfolio is a very good place to be allocating capital. It's easier to underwrite these returns given our knowledge of the assets and the in-house expertise that we have. We have a best-in-class team, both on the asset management side and on our design construction side with years and years of experience of doing these types of projects. We are not going to say we never had a surprise, but we had very few surprises when it comes to construction budgets and timing. And we're very comfortable with our underwriting.

We had significant accomplishments under his tenure that Brian will address and we wish him well as he begins his role as Global Head of Lodging for Morgan Stanley based in Los Angeles.
2019 was another highly productive year for Host. We successfully executed large value-enhancing capital allocation transactions and delivered a solid operational performance, which exceeded our adjusted EBITDAre and adjusted FFO per diluted share expectations for the fourth quarter. We capitalized on favorable market conditions and sold 14 of our lower total RevPAR, higher capital expenditure hotels for $1.3 billion. We further upgraded the quality of our portfolio by acquiring the iconic 1 Hotel South Beach, completing 4 renovations as part of the Marriott transformational capital program, and investing in multiple value-enhancing development projects across the portfolio. We returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while further strengthening our best-in-class investment-grade balance sheet.
Finally, we delivered our strongest comparable total RevPAR and RevPAR performance for 2019 in the fourth quarter, while achieving solid margins in the year challenged by accelerating wage and benefit expense growth. We exceeded the top end of our full year 2019 adjusted EBITDAre guidance range, primarily due to stronger-than-expected total revenue growth at our noncomparable hotels. Comparable hotel total RevPAR was 190 basis points due to better-than-expected food and beverage as well as other revenues. We will discuss our fourth quarter results in more detail later.
I would like to now focus on the 4 key business trends that impacted our 2019 operational performance and that are expected to impact 2020 as well. First is the strong food and beverage and other revenue growth that we experienced in the quarter and year. We delivered comparable total RevPAR growth that is 200 basis points higher than comparable room's RevPAR growth for the quarter and160 basis points higher for the year. Food and beverage revenues grew largely because of corporate in-house group business, which typically had robust contribution ratios. Other revenues were bolstered by miscellaneous increases, including higher golf and spa revenues. Our solid total RevPAR growth speaks to our ability to grow revenues through multiple channels at our hotels. Approximately, 35% of our revenues are earned from food and beverage, conference and meeting space, spa and other amenities. In an environment where the industry is near peak occupancy with modest ADR growth, our ability to grow revenues through nonroom sources is a key strength of our portfolio. While we expect continued total RevPAR growth in 2020, its growth rate should be roughly the same as RevPAR due to a tougher year-over-year comparison.
The second trend is the strong growth we've experienced in loyalty redemption revenues, which has supported our leisure demand. Some of the increase is due to structural changes that Marriott International has introduced Bonvoy redemption, such as the opportunity to earn greater redemption revenue through increased occupancy tiers. Marriott introduced Bonvoy in early 2019 with the rollout across all consumer touch points, including our property sales and marketing channels, digital, mobile and co-branded credit cards. Additionally, the launch was boosted by a multimillion dollar media campaign. In late 2019, Marriott announced peak and offpeak redemption schedule, which should further support our 2020 growth expectations. Our redemption revenues have grown well in excess of the revenues outlined in the business case Marriott made for Bonvoy in 2019. In the fourth quarter, we grew Marriott Bonvoy redemption revenues by nearly 22% for our comparable hotels and 24% for all our own Marriott hotels, with the Venetian Ritz-Carlton, Naples and Ritz-Carlton, Marina del Rey achieving the highest redemption revenues in the portfolio. Although redemption revenues will also face tough comparisons this year, Host's ability to leverage Marriott's powerful loyalty program is another key strength for our business.
The third trend is the continued acceleration in wage and benefit expense growth. Wage and benefit expenses increased 370 basis points in the quarter and 290 basis points for the year on a year-over-year basis. We were able to largely offset this expense growth through a variety of external and internal initiatives, which allows us to achieve breakeven margins at 1% RevPAR growth in 2019. Our external initiatives were driven by near-term Marriott-Starwood merger synergy, which were largely realized in 2019. Our internal initiatives, we expect smaller incremental efficiencies in 2020 relative to last year. Meanwhile, we expect wage and benefit expense growth to increase by approximately 5% in 2020 over 2019 as unemployment remains at all-time lows and job openings in the lodging sector reach record highs. Our 2020 guidance for comparable hotel expenses, however, is for 2.5% to 3.5% growth per available room, primarily due to productivity gain, partially offsetting wage and benefit expense growth. As a result, we expect breakeven margins at 3.5% to 4% RevPAR growth in 2020. We will further detail the impact of wage and benefit expense growth on our 2020 EBITDA margins. But here are 3 key takeaways on this issue. First, we expect the rate of wage and benefit growth to peak in 2020. Second, we are continuing to work with our operators to adopt productivity-enhancing technology that will decrease our operating costs over the long term. And third, our exposure to world-class operators like Marriott and Hyatt leaves us relatively well positioned in a tight labor market, given their best-in-class retention and low turnover. Finally, we see prolonged macro uncertainty continuing to negatively impact expectations for U.S. nonresidential fixed investment, which has slowed materially from 6.4% in 2018 to 2.1% in 2019 and is now expected to grow by just 70 basis points in 2020. RevPAR is highly correlated with this metric, which is being impacted by trade and political uncertainty in an election year as well as by coronavirus. A sustained increase in nonresidential fixed investment would be a positive catalyst for the industry. But until it accelerates, our expectations for business transient travel remain muted, and our managers continue to focus on driving group and leisure business.
Moving on to our outlook for group business in 2020. We are pleased to begin the year with total group revenue being 4.2% ahead of the same time last year as we benefit from a favorable citywide convention calendar 2020, with San Diego, Miami, Orlando and Washington, D.C. all pacing ahead. We had approximately 77.5% of our group rooms on the books and are 150 basis points ahead of the same time last year. Thus far, we haven't experienced a material direct impact on our business from coronavirus as Chinese travelers contribute approximately 1.5% of our room revenues. That said, the situation continues to evolve and the prevailing uncertainty could put further downward pressure on business transient revenues. Additionally, supply is continuing to grow this year with a 2.3% increase expected across all scales on a net basis. As a result, we expect full year comparable constant dollar RevPAR growth to range between flat to up 1%. We would note that the addition of the 1 Hotel South Beach added approximately 10 basis points to our newly defined 2020 full year comparable RevPAR growth guidance as we owned the hotel for nearly all of 2019. We expect comparable EBITDA margins to be down 165 basis points at the low end and down 125 basis points at the high end of our guidance. These assumptions result in full year forecasted adjusted EBITDAre of $1.360 billion to $1.405 billion. While the midpoint of our -- of our 2020 total EBITDA guidance reflects a 10% year-over-year decline, approximately 60% of this decline is attributable to 2019 asset sales and declines in our noncomparable hotels due to renovation. Notably, our comparable hotel EBITDA is expected to decline by only 2.5% to 5% year-over-year.
Finally, with much of the decline in EBITDA mitigated by our stock repurchase program, we expect adjusted FFO per diluted share of $1.65 to $1.71. Although margins are being impacted by accelerating wage and benefit cost growth this year, it is important to note that comparable EBITDA margins have improved by 80 basis points from 28.2% in 2016 to approximately 29% last year. We have held total expense growth steady at less than 1.5% for the last 3 years through a variety of external and internal initiatives. As mentioned earlier, wage and benefit cost growth is expected to peak this year, and we are working with our operators to adopt productivity-enhancing technology that we anticipate will decrease our operating costs over the long term.
Shifting to the Marriott transformational capital program. 2 of the 4 renovations we completed last year, Coronado Island Marriott and New York Marriott Downtown have already achieved meaningful RevPAR index gains and are well positioned to accelerate EBITDA growth and stabilization. The San Francisco Marriott Marquis and Santa Clara Marriott were completed in the second half of 2019. And while it's too early to measure improvement, we have high expectations for these 2 properties. We expect to invest between $180 million to $200 million in the program this year and to complete renovations at the San Antonio Rivercenter and Minneapolis Marriott City Center in the first and second quarter, respectively, and JW Marriott Atlanta Buckhead in the fourth quarter. We will also complete the second phases of 3-phased renovations at both the New York Marriott Marquis and the Orlando World Center. By the end of 2020, this program will be 60% to 70% complete. We are pleased to be completing these renovations in a low RevPAR growth environment, which minimizes the impact of the disruption and leaves us well positioned to achieve meaningful RevPAR index gains and accelerated EBITDA growth at stabilization.
In addition to the Marriott transformational capital program, we are also implementing multiple value-enhancing ROI projects across the portfolio. We categorize these as product development, operational projects and energy efficiency or sustainability projects. Product developments include developing a 165-key AC by Marriott on excess surface parking at The Westin Kierland in Scottsdale and adding 19 new 2-bedroom luxury villas at the Andaz Maui. Operational projects include adding meeting space at the Orlando World Center, converting underutilized lobby space into grab-and-go marketplaces, repositioning F&B office and adding keys at several properties. Additionally, we have multiple energy efficiency projects which are an important part of our industry-leading corporate responsibility program and include major systems overhauls, LED retrofit and solar panels, among others. We have historically achieved a high-teens average cash-on-cash return on these ROI projects, and we expect to grow this program going forward as an important piece of our capital allocation strategy. We differentiate ourselves through extraordinary execution, which achieves both a strong business case and prioritizes our sustainability goals for these projects. We have been recognized for our leadership and performance on sustainability, earning our seventh consecutive Green Star and Overall Global Sector Leader designation as well as a 5-star rating from GRESB this year. We have also been named to the Dow Jones World Sustainability Index for the first time and the North America Sustainability Index for the third time. Have won the NAREIT Lodging and Resorts Leader in Light Award 4 times in the past 5 years and most recently have been named to CDP's A list for leading our action against climate change.
To conclude with capital allocation, let me briefly review our execution over the last 2 years within the context of our long-term strategic vision for Host. Since 2018, we sold $3.3 billion of relatively lower quality and lower total RevPAR assets in our portfolio. We have invested $1.6 billion into iconic assets with 2019 total RevPAR with more than double that of the assets we sold. All 4 of our acquisitions are in excellent condition, with limited near-term capital needs. We achieved higher blended cap rates and EBITDA multiples on our acquisitions than on our dispositions and have thereby minimized dilution to earnings while significantly upgrading the quality of our portfolio. In addition, we have bought nearly $610 million of stock since mid-2019, amounting to nearly 5% of our weighted average share outstanding.
Finally, we have meaningfully strengthened our balance sheet by increasing our liquidity, extending our debt maturities and lowering our borrowing costs. Our asset recycling has reduced our CapEx intensity and improved the blended cap rate and long-term NAV profile of our portfolio. Our share repurchases have been accretive to FFO per diluted share, and the enhanced flexibility of our balance sheet has provided us with greater optionality to create significant long-term value for our shareholders. Today, our flexibility and willingness to use the appropriate value creation tool, whether it's stock buybacks, asset recycling, development or redevelopment at the opportune time to create meaningful value for our shareholders is what best differentiates Host from most of its lodging REIT peers. We have clearly demonstrated our willingness to use these value creation tools in 2019 and will continue to do so in 2020.
Our long-term strategic vision is to own iconic and irreplaceable assets with high total RevPAR and limited near-term CapEx needs in key markets with strong and diverse demand generators. Market conditions over the last couple of years have enabled us to substantially reposition our portfolio at an accelerated pace. We believe that apart from a small number of assets that we would like to eventually monetize, our portfolio is where we want to be at this point in the economic cycle.
With regard to acquisitions, while the bar remains high, we will continue to evaluate assets that meet our strategic objectives, focusing on opportunities where we can leverage our competitive advantages such as the owner, broker and operator relationships, our ability to do large transactions and our reputation for providing speed and certainty of closing and the flexibility of operating, taxes and e-structures to sellers.
Overall, we are very well positioned with a favorable citywide convention calendar supporting operational performance this year and balance sheet flexibility providing us with greater optionality to create significant long-term value for our shareholders.
With that, I will turn the call over to Brian."

We delivered adjusted EBITDAre of $355 million for the quarter and $1.534 billion for the year. As mentioned, we exceeded the top end of our 2019 adjusted EBITDAre guidance mainly due to strong revenue growth at our noncomparable hotels. Noncomparable total RevPAR grew 940 basis points for the quarter, primarily due to a post renovation lift at the San Francisco Marriott Marquis and strong redemption revenues at the Ritz-Carlton Naples.
For the fourth quarter, comparable total RevPAR grew 190 basis points primarily due to higher food and beverage and other revenues. While fourth quarter comparable RevPAR declined 10 basis points, it would have been flat if adjusted for the estimated 10 basis points of renovation disruption related to the Marriott transformational capital program. During the quarter, occupancy was unchanged, but ADR decreased by 10 basis points, primarily due to the anticipated decline in group business, driven by an unfavorable citywide convention calendar. Transient revenue grew 270 basis points due to the growth in leisure demand which more than offset the continued business transient weakness. Although business transient revenues for the fourth quarter were down 350 basis points, driven by a room night decline of 340 basis points, we would note that the fourth quarter was the least affected by declines in business travel due to the favorable holiday shift in December.
Looking at individual market performance for the fourth quarter. Our top 5 total RevPAR growth markets were: Orlando, Florida Gulf Coast, Atlanta, Denver and Phoenix, while New Orleans, Seattle, San Antonio, Northern Virginia and Hawaii trailed the portfolio. We think an important measure of our success in 2019 was our ability to deliver strong margin performance. Comparable EBITDA margins only declined 10 basis points for the quarter and 5 basis points for the full year, in line with the midpoint of our full year 2019 guidance. We believe this is an impressive performance as wage and benefit expense grew 370 basis points, driven by hourly wage rate increases, most notably in Southern California. While California was especially affected, the unemployment rate in most of our markets was below the national average of 3.7%, driving significant increases in wage and benefit expense across the portfolio.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended 2019 with $3.8 billion of total debt, $1.6 billion of unrestricted cash and $1.5 billion of available capacity under our credit facility revolver. During 2019, we achieved several major financial milestones. First, we refinanced $1 billion in term loans and expanded our revolving credit facility by $500 million to $1.5 billion. Second, we achieved an upgrade of our corporate credit rating to BBB- from BB+ by S&P Global Ratings. Third, we refinanced $650 million of senior notes by issuing the first green bond in the lodging industry, with a coupon of 3 3/8% and yield to maturity of 3.467%. These represent the lowest effective 10-year bond pricing and overall yield achieved in our history. Lastly, we have minimal debt maturing until 2023, with a balanced debt maturity schedule with no more than 7% of our debt as a percentage of enterprise value maturing in any given year.
In summary, we have executed over $3 billion of refinancing, which resulted in extending our total weighted average debt maturity to 5.4 years, reducing our weighted average interest rate to 3.8%, all while maintaining an appropriately balanced floating rate mix of 26%.
Finally, in 2019, we returned significant value to our shareholders with $482 million of stock repurchases as well as a total cash dividend of $0.85 per share, which represents a yield of approximately 5% on our current stock price. We also just announced the first quarter dividend of $0.20 per share.
Turning to the forecast. Let me take a few minutes to detail the assumptions underlying our 2020 guidance. As Jim mentioned, we expect our revenue performance to be driven by group and leisure transient business as a result of the citywide calendar, growing economy and strong employment numbers. While the U.S. economy continues an unprecedented growth cycle, we have been thoughtful about the impact of the global economy and our own election cycle, which we believe continues to constrain the level of business investment. Overall, we expect our performance to be stronger in the first half of 2020 due to the strength of our group booking pace and more difficult comps in the second half of the year. We will also continue to benefit from owner's priority and operating profit guarantees related to the Marriott transformational capital program. Our forecast includes a total of $16 million of operating profit guarantees from Marriott, of which $9 million is included in comparable hotel EBITDA. Equally important, we expect as more properties are completed, we should begin to see an increase in each hotel's RevPAR index, which should bolster overall EBITDA for the properties.
For modeling purposes, we expect adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter will range from 26% to 28% of our annual forecast.
Lastly, total shares currently outstanding are approximately $705 million, reflecting the additional shares repurchased in the first quarter.
In conclusion, we believe that Host Hotels & Resorts is the premier lodging REIT in the industry. We have a high-quality, well-diversified portfolio whose consistent performance is driven by strong in-house analytics and by working with the best operators in the business. With the only investment-grade balance sheet among lodging REITs, we are well positioned to continue to execute on our strategic vision to create long-term value for our shareholders.

Again, it's something that we think about from a -- not only from a capital allocation perspective, but also from an operation perspective. We have lived through some pretty meaningful down cycles. I won't go back beyond 9/11. But of course, we learnt a lot, given what happened to our industry in the post 9/11 world and then lived it again in 2008, 2009. So I think if we were to find ourselves in this type of tepid RevPAR growth environment or flat to negative RevPAR growth environment with resulting EBITDA declines, we would be having meaningful conversations with our operators about lasting brand standards. And that can mean everything from taking a look at restaurant offerings and hours of operation to in-room guest amenities, to guest amenities in concierge lounges and club lounges. Not that we're not doing this today. We would really push beyond those lines labor scheduling and technology. So I think that's one of the first things that we would do if we found ourselves near to this environment for an extended period of time. On the capital allocation front, our balance sheet has never been in better shape. We -- as we sit here today, we have $1.6 billion of unrestricted cash. And if we were to go 3x leverage today, we could buy $2.5 billion plus of assets -- $2.5 billion to $3 billion plus of assets. As we think about the macro environment that we operate in today, we are being measured in our capital allocation decisions. We like the optionality that our balance sheet gives us today. If we're in a slow growth environment, couple of things we would consider doing might include accelerating investment in our portfolio going forward. We have the ability to do that, so that our assets are very well positioned when we see a reacceleration of RevPAR. We might consider if our stock price comes under pressure, enhancing the buyback program. And lastly, I think that if we are in this environment for an extended period of time, you're likely to see some distress in the hotel world. We're seeing it already in New York. There's been a number of articles written regarding the level of default in New York City going up. And we like the position we're in with the balance sheet that we have, the optionality and flexibility to pivot one way or the other in good times or in tough times."

It's going to range from property to property. Our returns on the Andaz Maui villas given the cost associated with developing and building Hawaii is likely to be on the lower end of that range, whereas we're in the process of moving forward with a large part at the Orlando World Center Marriott, where we expect very meaningful cash-on-cash returns as a result of putting that amenity in place and what that will allow us to do is shoulder a weakened transient business. So the attractive returns we think that in addition to buying back our stock, which we view as incredibly inexpensive today, that investing in our portfolio is a very good place to be allocating capital. It's easier to underwrite these returns given our knowledge of the assets and the in-house expertise that we have. We have a best-in-class team, both on the asset management side and on our design construction side with years and years of experience of doing these types of projects. We are not going to say we never had a surprise, but we had very few surprises when it comes to construction budgets and timing. And we're very comfortable with our underwriting.

We hope that you and your families are safe and healthy, and we extend our deepest [indiscernible] for those affected by COVID-19.
As you are aware, the lodging sector is navigating its unprecedented done that is expected to be at least twice as severe as the Great Recession. After a strong January and February, U.S. RevPAR posted its steepest decline on record and is expected to further deteriorate in April according to STR data.
Although we couldn't have anticipated the op rate of a global pandemic, Host is well positioned to withstand the magnitude of its impact due to years of prudent capital allocation that emphasize maximizing balance sheet capacity and liquidity towards the end of the cycle.
Today, we not only expect to persevere through this crisis, we fully expect to emerge with a stronger operating model, the highest quality portfolio in the company's history and the ability to capitalize on future opportunities to create value for all our stakeholders.
This morning, I will address our liquidity and cash flow position, key business segment trends and our revised capital plan. Brian will discuss our first quarter performance in-depth and provide our forecast for April.
We began this year with the lowest leverage in the company's history at 1.6x net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA, no near-term debt maturities, $1.6 billion of cash on hand, a fully unencumbered consolidated portfolio and an investment grade balance sheet. We drew down our $1.5 billion credit facility revolver in mid-March and ended April with approximately $2.7 billion of cash, including FF&E reserves, after paying approximately $140 million in first quarter dividends, which were declared in February.
At quarter end, our leverage ratio, as defined in our credit facility was at 2x. Our interest coverage ratio was at 6.8x, and our fixed charge coverage ratio was at 4.6x, all of which are well within the limits specified in our credit facility covenants. We expect to remain in compliance with all our credit facility covenants through the second quarter and are currently in discussions with our supportive bank lending group to secure greater flexibility on our covenant requirements.
Moving on to expenses. We our operators responded to the precipitous decline in revenues in March and April by implementing portfolio-wide cost reductions that are unprecedented in their magnitude. These include reducing the fixed portion of above property allocated costs by as much as 2/3, suspending contributions to hotels FFD escrow accounts, suspending most brand standards and unfortunately, furloughing up to 80% of the hotel workforce.
As of yesterday, operations at 35 of our 80 consolidated hotels representing 43% of our total room count are suspended. We work with our operators to determine whether to suspend operations at a hotel based on the property's ability to generate revenues that are greater than the incremental cost associated with remaining open. If the hotel is expected to achieve this incremental threshold, it remains open. Our preference is to leave hotels open as long as it is financially justifiable to do so because we believe an operational property is better positioned to capture demand when it begins to recover.
Our scale within several markets such as New York, Washington, D.C., San Diego, Los Angeles, Orange County and Chicago, has helped us generate operational efficiencies and to further benefit from consolidating low levels of demand at multiple properties into the hotels that remain operational in that market. For example, we have gained operational efficiencies in Washington, D.C., with the leadership of the JW Marriott overseeing the Washington Marriott at Metro Center and the Westin Georgetown. The same has been achieved in New York and other markets.
Demand consolidation is benefiting our hotels in Los Angeles, San Antonio and San Diego, where we are able to consolidate demand into one property in each of those markets. For the hotels that remain open, our managers have significantly scaled down operations by closing guestroom floors and meeting spaces and suspending food and beverage outlet operations. Due to timing, we expect to see the full benefit of these operating expense reductions in April when total hotel operating expenses are expected to be 70% to 75% lower than our initial forecast from February.
At the corporate level, we expect to further conserve cash by reducing our capital expenditures by $100 million to $125 million and our corporate expenses by 10% to 15%. Finally, we expect to either suspend our second quarter dividend or cut it to $0.01 a share, which is a reduction of approximately $140 million compared to our prior $0.20 per share quarterly dividend.
As a result of these anticipated cash savings initiatives, and a worst-case scenario where all of our hotels are effectively closed through the end of 2020 and the dividend remains suspended or reduced, our monthly cash outflow would average $120 million to $140 million per month, reflecting average hotel level expenses of $78 million to $80 million a month as well as estimated capital expenditures, interest payments and general corporate overhead. Importantly, in this worst-case scenario, we would end 2020 with approximately $1.65 billion of cash, including the FF&E reserve, leaving us with ample liquidity to support operations as the economy recovers. 
Moving on to group and transient business trends. Through May 4, we have lost an estimated $1.3 billion of expected 2020 revenues. This represents approximately $630 million of total group revenues known to date and $660 million of total transient revenues forecasted for the first half of the year. Approximately 90% of our total group revenue cancellations have been for the first half of the year with over 60% in the second quarter alone. Of the approximately 10% of total group revenue cancellations in the second half, less than 3% are for the fourth quarter. While the low levels of cancellations for the fourth quarter are encouraging, we believe that the near-term pace of group and transient business remains uncertain until the consumer feels comfortable traveling again. 
Our operators have booked approximately 12% of our total 2020 loss group revenues with the majority rebooked for the second half of 2020. Although we expect a significant portion of our total group revenues to be lost due to timing as they were driven by a favorable 2020 citywide convention calendar, a majority of our group customers have expressed a desire to be booked at our properties. Finally, we have collected $32 million of cancellation fees to date with $10 million recognized in the first quarter.
Shifting to 2021 total group revenue pace. We began this year with 2.3 million definite rooms on the books for 2021, and pace was nearly 3% ahead of the same time last year. Although 2021 group booking activity is half of what was last year, and our total group revenue pace is now flat, we believe group demand will return over time. With decision-makers on the sidelines and wait-and-see mode, we believe the pace of recovery in both group and business transient will depend upon customers feeling safe to travel.
Markets with stronger group for 2021 are San Antonio, San Diego, Seattle, Los Angeles and Chicago, whereas New York, Orlando, San Francisco, San Jose, Denver and Boston currently have pace opportunities. Given the current uncertainty, pace by market could change considerably in the weeks and months to come. We continue to believe in the long-term viability of the group business. While the association business model relies upon generating income from large group meetings, a more intangible reality is that most group meetings allow members within an industry to connect with and learn from each other, while building relationships and trust in a manner that we don't think is possible to replicate digitally. In the long run, we believe using group volumes to compress supply and generate productive yield management will remain a cornerstone of the lodging business.
That said, we are positioning ourselves for the recovery to be led by drive to leisure destinations. As observed in China and other parts of Asia that are several weeks ahead of the United States, the recovery thus far has been like been led by domestic leisure stays and drive to destinations. With renovations recently completed and construction or planned within the next 12 months, over 70% of our portfolio and our strongest drive to leisure markets will be fully refreshed. Specifically, our hotels in Phoenix, San Diego, Orange County, San Antonio and Florida, which represent over 13,000 keys or nearly 30% of our total portfolio are very well positioned to capture a recovery and drive to leisure demand.
We continue to prioritize the health and safety of our employees and guests. Most of our hotels are managed by large brands who are known for reliably delivering consistent service and standards. These brands are now reusing their [indiscernible] standards to even higher levels with new protocols to address the current circumstances. We believe branded hotels communication around and execution of rigorous cleaning standards will resonate well with customers. Moreover, we expect the strength of their loyalty programs to be a strong driver of demand to our properties.
Turning to our supply outlook. While it will take several quarters before we have a complete understanding of the change in hotel supply growth, we've cut our internal net supply expectations for 2020 in half, based on broad assumptions surrounding project delays or announcements and existing hotel closures. We now expect supply growth of roughly 1% in 2020 with average growth over the next 3 years, remaining below the long-term historical trend. Moreover, we believe there is a high probability that several projects that have not yet become construction will be canceled or significantly delayed. 
Although, no one knows the timing or shape of the recovery, we are hopeful that occupancy declines may have stabilized and found a bottom in April. We are frequently asked what level of occupancy will allow us to break even at the hotel line. As you may imagine, it's difficult to provide a number as it varies greatly by property requires ADR assumptions and is likely to change on a monthly basis. We have done the analysis based on a single month of operations in the current environment with significant expense reductions remaining in parts. In that scenario, assuming ADRs declined 15% to 30% on a year-over-year basis, we would expect to achieve hotel EBITDA breakeven at 35% to 45% portfolio occupancy.
Our enterprise analytics and asset management teams are working closely with our operators to strengthen a long-term hotel operating model. With near-term goals of achieving breakeven and generating higher profitability at lower levels of occupancy. In the 2009 recession, several operating expense line items were significantly reduced and continue to improve through the cycle. While we expect our hotels to incur new expenses, especially ones related to new clean standards, downturns compel owners and operators to reevaluate brand standards, programs and above property expenses, an exercise that can result in long-term savings and a healthier hotel operating model that better serves customers' changing needs.
Turning to CapEx. We have reduced our 2020 capital expenditures by $100 million to $125 million, which represents an approximately 50% reduction to the portion of the CapEx budget that wasn't already spent underweighed or committed. Approximately 85% of our CapEx savings are derived from eliminating nonessential renewal and replacement CapEx spend with the remainder coming from suspended ROI projects. We continue to plan on spending $180 million to $200 million on the Marriott transformational capital program and now expect to receive $20 million in operating profit guarantees this year. It makes sense for us to complete these renovations for these reasons. First, we benefited from $20 million of operating profit guarantees without experiencing commensurate revenue disruption given the current unprecedented low RevPAR environment. Second, we expect the renovations to position us to achieve meaningful RevPAR gains through the cycle, particularly as most hotel owners are compelled to cut back renovations due to liquidity constraints. And third, construction bids are coming in below budget, and market pricing is expected to decline by at least 6% to 10%, which provides us the opportunity to buyout construction at lower prices.
In addition to all of this, as the performance of these properties return, we will receive enhanced owners' priority on this investment, which will reduce the incentive management fees we pay Marriott.
As part of this year's Marriott Transformational capital program, we have completed renovations at the San Antonio River Center Marriott, and where we will finish the Minneapolis City Center Marriott in just a few weeks. Later this year, we plan to complete the JW Marriott bucket. In addition, we expect to start the Rich [indiscernible] which is scheduled to complete in the first quarter of 2021. Finally, we will complete the second phases at both New York Marriott Marquis and the Orlando World Center Marriott, which are scheduled to complete in the third and fourth quarter of 2021, respectively.
Combined with the properties completed as part of last year's capital program, including [indiscernible] New York Marriott Downtown, San Francisco Maria Marquis and Santa Clara Marriott. The Marriott transformational capital program will be nearly 70% complete by the end of 2020.
While the program consists of a mix of group and leisure dominant and hotels and markets, these transformational renovations are expected to have a useful life of 7 to 10 years and will help our properties gain market share and outperform through the next cycle.
While our revised CapEx plan assumes projects will be completed substantially as scheduled, COVID-19 has impacted our ability to implement renovations, as supply chains have been disrupted, and certain state and local orders have deemed construction nonessential. We will continue to provide quarterly updates on our capital plan for the year.
As I reflect on leading host over the last few years and now through this crisis, it is gratifying to know that our prudent and disciplined capital allocation strategy towards the end of the cycle has served our stakeholders well. In 2018 and 2019, we sold $3.3 billion of our relatively lower quality and lower total RevPAR assets at the top of the market. Additionally, we capitalized on the favorable debt capital markets last year to execute over $3 billion of refinancing which extended our debt maturities and reduced our borrowing cost at an opportune time.
While we also acquired $1.6 billion of high-quality assets, bought back $629 million of stock and invested in developing and redeveloping parts of our portfolio, we deployed each of these value creation tools in a measured and disciplined manner, not knowing when the cycle would end, but discerning that balance sheet strength and capacity would be of paramount importance when it did.
Today, as we enter a new lodging cycle, we feel hopeful about a future where the threat of this pandemic has passed. In the meantime, we are taking the opportunity this crisis provides to further strengthen our operating model and to learn how it will generate higher levels of profitability at lower levels of occupancy. We are excited to be entering a new cycle with the highest quality portfolio of iconic and irreplaceable assets in the company's history and likely in the lodging industry.
When demand recovers, we believe that the quality of our assets, many of which will be newly renovated will be a true differentiator that will help us gain RevPAR index share and outperform the industry. We continue to believe in the strength of both geographic and demand diversity through the cycle. Geographic diversity will serve us through an uneven recovery as various states and markets and are down at different times. Demand diversity will help us drive optimal revenue management and pricing through the cycle.
Finally, we expect our relative balance sheet strength to continue to be a differentiator that will provide us with greater flexibility to capitalize on future long-term value creation opportunities that meet our strategic objectives.
With that, I will turn the call over to Brian."

Good morning, everyone. Prior to the spread of the pandemic in the United States, business was off to a strong start in 2020. For the total portfolio in January and February, RevPAR was up 220 basis points driven by 120 basis point increas",1177,"Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Prior to the spread of the pandemic in the United States, business was off to a strong start in 2020. For the total portfolio in January and February, RevPAR was up 220 basis points driven by 120 basis point increase in occupancy. Total RevPAR was up 490 basis points for the same period. As a result, at that point in the quarter, we were ahead of last year by approximately $20 million. March, however, experienced a 65% decline in RevPAR, driven by a 52% drop in occupancy. We lost 730,000 room nights due to shelter in-place orders and widespread changes in business travel policies.
March room revenues declined by $200 million year-over-year and drove a first quarter RevPAR decline of 23.3% as occupancy fell 17% year-over-year. Our first quarter results include a $43 million wage and benefit expense associated with moves to suspend operations and the necessary changes to hotel level staffing. These costs include an $8 million cash payment to hotel employees in March and a $35 million accrual for furlough benefits in April and May. If our operators extend those benefits for the approximately 80% of the workforce that is currently furloughed, we would expect the carrying cost for those employees beyond May to average $15 million to $17 million per month for the entire portfolio.
As Jim mentioned, we have worked closely with our operators to reduce operating expenses and expect to realize a 70% to 75% reduction in hotel-level operating expenses in April compared to our initial forecast. As a reminder, our initial forecast in February implied that hotel-level expenses at the midpoint would be approximately $3.8 billion for the full year. On the revenue front, we expect the total RevPAR for April will decline by 90% to 95%, reflecting the extremely low occupancies in most markets.
Demand in April has largely been restricted to medical professionals and airline crews. For example, the Sheraton New York Times Square and the New York Marriott Marquis achieved occupancies close to 50% in April, primarily driven by medical and first responder business. Being 2 of the largest hotels in the city to remain open has provided the Sheraton and the Marquis with a great opportunity to capture this business. With New York City, thankfully, continuing to make progress from earlier peak infection levels, this business is expected to taper off in early to mid-may. 
By the end of March, we had suspended operations at 13 properties. As occupancies continue to decline through April, we suspended operations and an additional 22 properties, bringing the total number of suspensions to 35.
A typical staffing model for properties that have been suspended include a management team of 5 to 7 associates working as scheduled has been reduced anywhere from 20% to 40%. Further, there is management oversight of the security department and in certain circumstances, properties have layered in additional sales and event department management to assist with the rescheduling and planning of future group business. Hourly positions are generally limited to single associate per shift in the engineering and security departments.
Properties that are operational will generally have the same base management coverage as suspended properties as well as minimal rooms management though again, working at significantly reduced hours. Typically, these managers are covering both the housekeeping department and Front Desk as well as actively working a shift in one of those departments. Hourly positions in addition to the security and engineering positions previously mentioned, may include a housekeeper shift based on occupancy and Front Desk coverage. In the very limited cases where food services provided, one chef or kitchen shift would be added to prepare a limited to go menu.
Although visibility remains limited, we do not anticipate additional suspensions at this time. Timing with regard to reopening the 35 hotels where operations are currently suspended, however, remains unclear. Our reopening criteria are based on the timing of state and local authorities and the pace of our bookings and revenue growth projections. We are working with our operators to determine how costs can be managed through the impending recovery such that we can achieve breakeven levels as quickly as possible, with the goal of generating higher levels of profitability at lower levels of occupancy over time.
Shifting to market performance. Our top-performing markets in the first quarter were all in negative territory, although they outperformed the STR upper tier segment in their respective markets. Top-performing markets include: Phoenix, San Francisco, New Orleans, Atlanta, Miami, San Diego, New York and the Florida Gulf Coast. The underperformers were San Antonio, Maui Oahu, Jacksonville, Orange County, Denver, Northern Virginia, Washington, D.C., Seattle and Houston.
The majority of the $630 million of total group revenue loss that Jim mentioned, has been driven by 6 markets, San Diego, New York, Orlando, Phoenix, San Francisco and Boston. However, we have experienced cancellations across the portfolio with 24 markets showing greater than $5 million in total group revenue cancellations.
We are not providing any 2020 guidance at this time. Our lack of visibility regarding the depth and duration of the pandemic, the timing of the reopening of individual states and localities and the expected operating restrictions for businesses as well as individual company travel restrictions is simply too uncertain at this time. I would note that in prior recessions, peak to trough declines in hotel level EBITDA have been roughly twice as large as the peak to trough declines in RevPAR. Although this 2:1 ratio should have deteriorated considerably in a near 0 revenue environment, we believe it will continue to hold true for our portfolio due to our significant success in reducing fixed cost at the property level.
Our confidence in our ability to not only persevere through this crisis, but to be able to drive value for stakeholders is based on the strength of our investment-grade balance sheet. We have significant liquidity to withstand the worst-case scenario of a complete shutdown of our entire portfolio until year-end 2021, subject to our success in obtaining covenant waivers for our credit facilities.
Moreover, we have no significant debt maturities until 2023, and have approximately $2.7 billion of available cash as of April 30.
Finally, the company has access to other sources of liquidity, including secured debt, asset sales and capital market transactions. To be clear, the company has no need to tap into additional sources of liquidity, but I mentioned them to provide reassurance that we do not expect liquidity to be an issue for host.
Today, more than ever, we believe that Host Hotels & Resorts is the premier lodging REIT in the industry. We have a high-quality, well-diversified portfolio whose consistent performance is driven by strong in-house analytics and by working with the best operators in the business. With the only investment-grade balance sheet among lodging REITs, we are well positioned to deal with this crisis and to continue to execute our strategic vision to create long-term value for our shareholders.

Mike, we're in a unique position, given the strength of the company and the fact that we came into the year at 1.6x debt-to-EBITDA with $1.6 billion of cash on the balance sheet. We are truly in a position to persevere through this downturn through this pandemic and come out the other side in a position to play offense. Now when does that happen? I think right now, it's very premature at this point in time. I don't think you're going to see us or anybody else in a position to acquire hotels until we have greater visibility on the cadence of how the U.S. economy is going to perform and how it's going to recover. I think everyone is in agreement today that we are in a recession. We just don't know the depth of the recession nor do we know the duration of the recession. There are numerous conversations occurring between hotel owners and lenders today with respect to waivers, interest forbearance. It's a question of how that's all going to play out and where the opportunities are going to be. I think it's a little too soon to know. But when we have visibility and when we start seeing opportunities come to market, we will be in a position to take advantage of those opportunities. We're talking to our bank group by giving us some optionality to acquire hotels as we move forward. Obviously, the hotels are going to have to be a strategic fit for us. They're going to have to be priced appropriately. They're going to have to allow us to believe that we're going to be able to create shareholder value or we're going to continue to be disciplined in our approach to capital allocation. We think it served us very well toward the end of this cycle and giving us an opportunity to play offense."

And I'm just -- I'd like to maybe hear your opinion on the art of pricing a hotel room. Coming out of COVID, given that everything is at a stand still and starting from scratch, how do you anchor the customers' expectation to that sort of a rate starting from a 0 base?

We don't think revenue management is by anything like by any means a thing of the past today. We think it's more important than ever. And our primary concern is going to be focused on rate integrity and not rate degradation. It's tricky and a low RevPAR environment, low occupancy environment, we'll grant you that. But as an example, in the month of April, we ran at a very low occupancy for the portfolio of about 13% -- just north of 12%. We ran $135 ADR. That doesn't sound great, but when you're selling rooms in hotels that, in many instances, if you put New York aside or running at low single-digit occupancies to maintain a rate in that level, it is pretty good from our perspective. So as we look at breakeven occupancy and ADRs, it's really a quite a variable exercise that's going to change hotel by hotel. It's going to change is occupancy and demand increase and expenses creep back into the property. So the numbers we gave you with respect to occupancy declines and ADR declines are really based on the low level of expenses that we're experiencing today. So as those expenses increase, it's going to be a balance between incremental expenses going into the properties against occupancy and ADR gains. Is that helpful to you, Rich?"

We view this opportunity, this crisis truly has an opportunity to redefine the hotel operating model. And there are going to be incremental costs associated with cleaning and sanitizing because we think that, that is going to be critically important. It's always been important to the traveling consumer to know what they're getting when they check into a hotel room. And the fact that the majority of our properties are managed by Marriott and Hyatt gives us great comfort because they are at the top when it comes to cleaning and sanitizing standards and their outreach to consumers has been meaningful and it will continue to be meaningful. So we think this is truly a distinguishing factor relative to the independent hotel operator because the customers are going to be comfortable that if they're going to say, the Marriott managed hotel or a Hyatt managed hotel, that it's going to be sanitized. It's going to be clean and safety is paramount today. I mean, we talked a minute ago about ADR. And I can tell you, based on some focus groups that have taken place. The customers don't really care as much about ADR as they care about their personal safety. So we think that between the brand standards with respect to cleanness and cleaning and the fact that we are affiliated with the best loyalty program in the space is going to give us a true competitive advantage as we come out of this pandemic. So I'll let Sourav give you a little more color on how we're thinking about the hotel operating model."

And where the opportunity really exists is going to be, I would put in sort of 3 broad buckets: One is going to be a reduction of above property costs. Second is the brands are really focusing on brand standards and figuring out which brand standards are our cake and can we have either eliminated completely or modified. And the third is really adapting to the changing customer preferences, particularly leveraging technology. So think about would we really need the front desk as we know it today with the touchless technology that does exist. And would the customer want to interact during the check-in experience. So that's a 3 broad buckets, I would put it into.
The incremental costs associated with screening, we believe should be offset by improvement in productivity."

Associations have to have group meetings to survive. It's part of how they make money. But the intangible is the fact that group meetings are very important for interaction and building relationships and building trust among the people that participate in group meetings.

We hope that you and your families are safe and healthy, and we extend our deepest sympathies for those affected by COVID-19.
As you are aware, the lodging sector is navigating its unprecedented downturn that is expected to be at least twice as severe as the Great Recession. After a strong January and February, U.S. RevPAR posted its steepest decline on record and is expected to further deteriorate in April according to STR data.
Although we couldn't have anticipated the outbreak of a global pandemic, Host is well positioned to withstand the magnitude of its impact due to years of prudent capital allocation that emphasize maximizing balance sheet capacity and liquidity towards the end of the cycle.
Today, we not only expect to persevere through this crisis, we fully expect to emerge with a stronger operating model, the highest quality portfolio in the company's history and the ability to capitalize on future opportunities to create value for all our stakeholders.
This morning, I will address our liquidity and cash flow position, key business segment trends and our revised capital plan. Brian will discuss our first quarter performance in-depth and provide our forecast for April.
We began this year with the lowest leverage in the company's history at 1.6x net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA, no near-term debt maturities, $1.6 billion of cash on hand, a fully unencumbered consolidated portfolio and an investment-grade balance sheet. We drew down our $1.5 billion credit facility revolver in mid-March and ended April with approximately $2.7 billion of cash, including FF&E reserves, after paying approximately $140 million in first quarter dividends, which were declared in February.
At quarter end, our leverage ratio, as defined in our credit facility, was at 2x, our interest coverage ratio was at 6.8x, and our fixed charge coverage ratio was at 4.6x, all of which are well within the limits specified in our credit facility covenants. We expect to remain in compliance with all our credit facility covenants through the second quarter and are currently in discussions with our supportive bank lending group to secure greater flexibility on our covenant requirements.
Moving on to expenses. We and our operators responded to the precipitous decline in revenues in March and April by implementing portfolio-wide cost reductions that are unprecedented in their magnitude. These include reducing the fixed portion of above property allocated costs by as much as 2/3, suspending contributions to hotels FF&E escrow accounts, suspending most brand standards, and unfortunately, furloughing up to 80% of the hotel workforce.
As of yesterday, operations at 35 of our 80 consolidated hotels representing 43% of our total room count are suspended. We worked with our operators to determine whether to suspend operations at a hotel based on the property's ability to generate revenues that are greater than the incremental costs associated with remaining open. If the hotel is expected to achieve this incremental threshold, it remains open. Our preference is to leave hotels open as long as it is financially justifiable to do so because we believe an operational property is better positioned to capture demand when it begins to recover.
Our scale within several markets such as New York; Washington, D.C.; San Diego; Los Angeles; Orange County; and Chicago, has helped us generate operational efficiencies and to further benefit from consolidating low levels of demand at multiple properties into the hotels that remain operational in that market. For example, we have gained operational efficiencies in Washington, D.C., with the leadership of the JW Marriott overseeing the Washington Marriott at Metro Center and the Westin Georgetown. The same has been achieved in New York and other markets.
Demand consolidation is benefiting our hotels in Los Angeles, San Antonio and San Diego, where we are able to consolidate demand into one property in each of those markets. For the hotels that remain open, our managers had significantly scaled down our operations by closing guestroom floors and meeting spaces and suspending food and beverage outlet operations. Due to timing, we expect to see the full benefit of these operating expense reductions in April when total hotel operating expenses are expected to be 70% to 75% lower than our initial forecast from February.
At the corporate level, we expect to further conserve cash by reducing our capital expenditures by $100 million to $125 million and our corporate expenses by 10% to 15%. Finally, we expect to either suspend our second quarter dividend or cut it to $0.01 a share, which is a reduction of approximately $140 million compared to our prior $0.20 per share quarterly dividend.
As a result of these anticipated cash savings initiatives and a worst-case scenario where all of our hotels are effectively closed through the end of 2020 and the dividend remains suspended or reduced, our monthly cash outflow would average $120 million to $140 million per month, reflecting average hotel level expenses of $78 million to $80 million a month as well as estimated capital expenditures, interest payments and general corporate overhead.
Importantly, in this worst-case scenario, we would end 2020 with approximately $1.65 billion of cash, including the FF&E reserve, leaving us with ample liquidity to support operations as the economy recovers.
Moving on to group and transient business trends. Through May 4, we have lost an estimated $1.3 billion of expected 2020 revenues. This represents approximately $630 million of total group revenues known to date and $660 million of total transient revenues forecasted for the first half of the year. Approximately 90% of our total group revenue cancellations have been for the first half of the year with over 60% in the second quarter alone.
Of the approximately 10% of total group revenue cancellations in the second half, less than 3% are for the fourth quarter. While the low levels of cancellations for the fourth quarter are encouraging, we believe that the near-term pace of group and transient business remains uncertain until the consumer feels comfortable traveling again.
Our operators have booked approximately 12% of our total 2020 lost group revenues, with the majority rebooked for the second half of 2020. Although we expect a significant portion of our total group revenues to be lost due to timing as they were driven by a favorable 2020 citywide convention calendar, a majority of our group customers have expressed a desire to be booked at our properties. Finally, we have collected $32 million of cancellation fees to date with $10 million recognized in the first quarter.
Shifting to 2021 total group revenue pace. We began this year with 2.3 million definite rooms on the books for 2021, and pace was nearly 3% ahead of the same time last year. Although 2021 group booking activity is half of what it was last year and our total group revenue pace is now flat, we believe group demand will return over time. With decision-makers on the sidelines and wait-and-see mode, we believe that pace of recovery in both group and business transient will depend upon customers feeling safe to travel.
Markets with stronger group for 2021 are San Antonio, San Diego, Seattle, Los Angeles and Chicago, whereas New York, Orlando, San Francisco, San Jose, Denver and Boston currently have pace opportunities.
Given the current uncertainty, pace by market could change considerably in the weeks and months to come. We continue to believe in the long-term viability of the group business. While the association business model relies upon generating income from large group meetings, a more intangible reality is that most group meetings allow members within an industry to connect with and learn from each other, while building relationships and trust in a manner that we don't think is possible to replicate digitally. In the long run, we believe using group volumes to compress supply and generate productive yield management will remain a cornerstone of the lodging business.
That said, we are positioning ourselves for the recovery to be led by drive-to leisure destinations. As observed in China and other parts of Asia that are several weeks ahead of the United States, the recovery thus far has been like -- been led by domestic leisure stays and drive-to destinations. With renovations recently completed, in construction or planned within the next 12 months, over 70% of our portfolio and our strongest drive-to leisure markets will be fully refreshed. Specifically, our hotels in Phoenix, San Diego, Orange County, San Antonio and Florida, which represent over 13,000 keys or nearly 30% of our total portfolio are very well positioned to capture a recovery and drive-to leisure demand.
We continue to prioritize the health and safety of our employees and guests. Most of our hotels are managed by large brands who are known for reliably delivering consistent service and standards. These brands are now recognizing their cleaner standards to even higher levels with new protocols to address the current circumstances. We believe branded hotels, communication around and execution of rigorous cleaning standards will resonate well with customers. Moreover, we expect the strength of their loyalty programs to be a strong driver of demand to our properties.
Turning to our supply outlook. While it will take several quarters before we have a complete understanding of the change in hotel supply growth, we've cut our internal net supply expectations for 2020 in half based on broad assumptions surrounding project delays or announcements and existing hotel closures. We now expect supply growth of roughly 1% in 2020 with average growth over the next 3 years remaining below the long-term historical trend. Moreover, we believe there is a high probability that several projects that have not yet begun construction will be canceled or significantly delayed.
Although no one knows the timing or shape of the recovery, we are hopeful that occupancy declines may have stabilized and found a bottom in April. We are frequently asked what level of occupancy will allow us to breakeven at the hotel EBITDA line. As you may imagine, it's difficult to provide a number as it varies greatly by property, requires ADR assumptions and is likely to change on a monthly basis. We have done the analysis based on a single month of operations in the current environment with significant expense reductions remaining in perks. In that scenario, assuming ADRs declined 15% to 30% on a year-over-year basis, we would expect to achieve hotel EBITDA breakeven at 35% to 45% portfolio occupancy.
Our enterprise analytics and asset management teams are working closely with our operators to strengthen a long-term hotel operating model with near-term goals of achieving breakeven and generating higher profitability at lower levels of occupancy.
In the 2009 recession, several operating expense line items were significantly reduced and continued to improve through the cycle. While we expect our hotels to incur new expenses, especially ones related to the new cleaning standards, downturns compel owners and operators to reevaluate brand standards, programs and above property expenses, an exercise that can result in long-term savings and a healthier hotel operating model that better serves customers' changing needs.
Turning to CapEx. We have reduced our 2020 capital expenditures by $100 million to $125 million, which represents an approximately 50% reduction to the portion of the CapEx budget that wasn't already spent, underweighed or committed.
Approximately 85% of our CapEx savings are derived from eliminating nonessential renewal and replacement CapEx spend with the remainder coming from suspended ROI projects. We continue to plan on spending $180 million to $200 million on the Marriott transformational capital program, and now expect to receive $20 million in operating profit guarantees this year. It makes sense for us to complete these renovations for these reasons. First, we benefited from $20 million of operating profit guarantees without experiencing commensurate revenue disruptions given the current unprecedented low RevPAR environment. Second, we expect the renovations to position us to achieve meaningful RevPAR gains through the cycle, particularly as most hotel owners are compelled to cut back on renovations due to liquidity constraints. And third, construction bids are coming in below budget, and market pricing is expected to decline by at least 6% to 10%, which provides us the opportunity to buyout constructions at lower prices.
In addition to all of this, as the performance of these properties return, we will receive enhanced owners' priority on this investment, which will reduce the incentive management fees we pay Marriott.
As part of this year's Marriott transformational capital program, we have completed renovations at the San Antonio Rivercenter Marriott, and we will finish the Minneapolis City Center Marriott in just a few weeks. Later this year, we plan to complete the JW Marriott bucket. In addition, we expect to start the Ritz-Carlton, Amelia Island, which is scheduled to complete in the first quarter of 2021. Finally, we will complete the second phases at both New York Marriott Marquis and the Orlando World Center Marriott, which are scheduled to complete in the third and fourth quarter of 2021, respectively.
Combined with the properties completed as part of last year's capital program, including Coronado Island Marriott Resort & Spa, New York Marriott Downtown, San Francisco Marriott Marquis and Santa Clara Marriott, the Marriott transformational capital program will be nearly 70% complete by the end of 2020.
While the program consists of a mix of group and leisure-dominated hotels and markets, these transformational renovations are expected to have a useful life of 7 to 10 years and will help our properties gain market share and outperform through the next cycle.
While our revised CapEx plan assumes projects will be completed substantially as scheduled, COVID-19 has impacted our ability to implement renovations as supply chains have been disrupted and certain state and local orders have deemed construction nonessential. We will continue to provide quarterly updates on our capital plan for the year.
As I reflect on leading Host over the last few years and now through this crisis, it is gratifying to know that our prudent and disciplined capital allocation strategy towards the end of the cycle has served all our stakeholders well. In 2018 and 2019, we sold $3.3 billion of our relatively lower quality and lower total RevPAR assets at the top of the market. Additionally, we capitalized on the favorable debt capital markets last year to execute over $3 billion of refinancing, which extended our debt maturities and reduced our borrowing costs at an opportune time.
While we also acquired $1.6 billion of high-quality assets, bought back $629 million of stock and invested in developing and redeveloping parts of our portfolio, we deployed each of these value creation tools in a measured and disciplined manner, not knowing when the cycle would end, but discerning that balance sheet strength and capacity would be of paramount importance when it did.
Today, as we enter a new lodging cycle, we feel hopeful about a future where the threat of this pandemic has passed. In the meantime, we are taking the opportunity this crisis provides to further strengthen our operating model and to learn how to generate higher levels of profitability at lower levels of occupancy. We are excited to be entering a new cycle with the highest quality portfolio of iconic and irreplaceable assets in the company's history and likely in the lodging industry.
When demand recovers, we believe that the quality of our assets, many of which will be newly renovated, will be a true differentiator that will help us gain RevPAR index share and outperform the industry. We continue to believe in the strength of both geographic and demand diversity through the cycle. Geographic diversity will serve us through an uneven recovery as various states and markets entered lockdowns at different times. Demand diversity will help us drive optimal revenue management and pricing through the cycle.
Finally, we expect our relative balance sheet strength to continue to be a differentiator that will provide us with greater flexibility to capitalize on future long-term value creation opportunities that meet our strategic objectives.
With that, I will turn the call over to Brian."

Good morning, everyone. Prior to the spread of the pandemic in the United States, business was off to a strong start in 2020.

Prior to the spread of the pandemic in the United States, business was off to a strong start in 2020. For the total portfolio in January and February, RevPAR was up 220 basis points, driven by 120 basis point increase in occupancy. Total RevPAR was up 490 basis points for the same period. As a result, at that point in the quarter, we were ahead of last year by approximately $20 million. March, however, experienced a 65% decline in RevPAR, driven by a 52% drop in occupancy. We lost 730,000 room nights due to shelter-in-place orders and widespread changes in business travel policies.
March room revenues declined by $200 million year-over-year and drove our first quarter RevPAR decline of 23.3% as occupancy fell 17% year-over-year. Our first quarter results include a $43 million wage and benefit expense associated with moves to suspend operations and the necessary changes to hotel-level staffing. These costs include an $8 million cash payment to hotel employees in March and a $35 million accrual for furlough benefits in April and May. If our operators extend those benefits for the approximately 80% of the workforce that is currently furloughed, we would expect the carrying costs for those employees beyond May to average $15 million to $17 million per month for the entire portfolio.
As Jim mentioned, we have worked closely with our operators to reduce operating expenses and expect to realize a 70% to 75% reduction in hotel-level operating expenses in April compared to our initial forecast. As a reminder, our initial forecast in February implied that hotel-level expenses at the midpoint would be approximately $3.8 billion for the full year. On the revenue front, we expect the total RevPAR for April will decline by 90% to 95%, reflecting the extremely low occupancies in most markets.
Demand in April has largely been restricted to medical professionals and airline crews. For example, the Sheraton New York Times Square and the New York Marriott Marquis achieved occupancies close to 50% in April, primarily driven by medical and first-responder business. Being 2 of the largest hotels in the city to remain open has provided the Sheraton and the Marquis with a great opportunity to capture this business. With New York City, thankfully, continuing to make progress from earlier peak infection levels, this business is expected to taper off in early to mid-May.
By the end of March, we had suspended operations at 13 properties. As occupancies continued to decline through April, we suspended operations in an additional 22 properties, bringing the total number of suspensions to 35.
A typical staffing model for properties that have been suspended include a management team of 5 to 7 associates working at schedules that have been reduced anywhere from 20% to 40%. Further, there is management oversight of the security department, and in certain circumstances, properties have layered in additional sales and event department management to assist with the rescheduling and planning of future group business. Hourly positions are generally limited to single associate per shift in the engineering and security departments.
Properties that are operational will generally have the same base management coverage as suspended properties as well as minimal rooms management, though, again, working at significantly reduced hours. Typically, these managers are covering both the housekeeping department and front desk as well as actively working a shift in one of those departments. Hourly positions in addition to the security and engineering positions previously mentioned may include a housekeeper shift based on occupancy and front desk coverage. In the very limited cases where food service is provided, one chef or kitchen shift would be added to prepare a limited to go menu.
Although visibility remains limited, we do not anticipate additional suspensions at this time. Timing with regard to reopening the 35 hotels where operations are currently suspended, however, remains unclear. Our reopening criteria are based on the timing of state and local authorities and the pace of our bookings and revenue growth projections. We are working with our operators to determine how costs can be managed through the impending recovery such that we can achieve breakeven levels as quickly as possible, with the goal of generating higher levels of profitability at lower levels of occupancy over time.
Shifting to market performance. Our top-performing markets in the first quarter were all in negative territory, although they outperformed the STR upper tier segment in their respective markets. Top-performing markets include: Phoenix, San Francisco, New Orleans, Atlanta, Miami, San Diego, New York and the Florida Gulf Coast. The underperformers were San Antonio; Maui/Oahu; Jacksonville; Orange County; Denver; Northern Virginia; Washington, D.C.; Seattle; and Houston.
The majority of the $630 million of total group revenue loss that Jim mentioned has been driven by 6 markets: San Diego, New York, Orlando, Phoenix, San Francisco and Boston. However, we have experienced cancellations across the portfolio with 24 markets showing greater than $5 million in total group revenue cancellations.
We are not providing any 2020 guidance at this time. Our lack of visibility regarding the depth and duration of the pandemic, the timing of the reopening of individual states and localities and the expected operating restrictions for businesses as well as individual company travel restrictions is simply too uncertain at this time. I would note that in prior recessions, peak to trough declines in hotel-level EBITDA have been roughly twice as large as the peak to trough declines in RevPAR. Although this 2:1 ratio should have deteriorated considerably in a near 0 revenue environment, we believe it will continue to hold true for our portfolio due to our significant success in reducing fixed costs at the property level.
Our confidence in our ability to not only persevere through this crisis but to be able to drive value for stakeholders is based on the strength of our investment-grade balance sheet. We have significant liquidity to withstand the worst-case scenario of a complete shutdown of our entire portfolio until year-end 2021, subject to our success in obtaining covenant waivers for our credit facilities. Moreover, we have no significant debt maturities until 2023 and have approximately $2.7 billion of available cash as of April 30.
Finally, the company has access to other sources of liquidity, including secured debt, asset sales and capital market transactions. To be clear, the company has no need to tap into additional sources of liquidity, but I mentioned them to provide reassurance that we do not expect liquidity to be an issue for Host.
Today, more than ever, we believe that Host Hotels & Resorts is the premier lodging REIT in the industry. We have a high-quality, well-diversified portfolio whose consistent performance is driven by strong in-house analytics and by working with the best operators in the business. With the only investment-grade balance sheet among lodging REITs, we are well positioned to deal with this crisis and to continue to execute our strategic vision to create long-term value for our shareholders.

Now when does that happen? I think right now, it's very premature at this point in time. I don't think you're going to see us or anybody else in a position to acquire hotels until we have greater visibility on the cadence of how the U.S. economy is going to perform and how it's going to recover. I think everyone is in agreement today that we are in a recession. We just don't know the depth of the recession nor do we know the duration of the recession.

We are having daily conversations with our operators regarding reinventing the revenue management model. We don't think revenue management is by anything like -- by any means a thing of the past today. We think it's more important than ever. And our primary concern is going to be focused on rate integrity and not rate degradation. It's tricky, and a low RevPAR environment, low occupancy environment will grant you that. But as an example, in the month of April, we ran at a very low occupancy for the portfolio of about 13% -- just north of 12%. We ran $135 ADR. That doesn't sound great, but when you're selling rooms in hotels that, in many instances, if you put New York aside, are running at low single-digit occupancies to maintain a rate in that level, it is pretty good from our perspective. So as we look at breakeven occupancy and ADRs, it's really a quite a variable exercise that's going to change hotel by hotel. It's going to change as occupancy and demand increase and expenses creep back into the property. So the numbers we gave you with respect to occupancy declines and ADR declines are really based on the low level of expenses that we're experiencing today. So as those expenses increase, it's going to be a balance between incremental expenses going into the properties against occupancy and ADR gains. Is that helpful to you, Rich?"

We view this opportunity -- this crisis truly has an opportunity to redefine the hotel operating model. And there are going to be incremental costs associated with cleaning and sanitizing because we think that, that is going to be critically important. It's always been important to the traveling consumer to know what they're getting when they check into a hotel room. And the fact that the majority of our properties are managed by Marriott and Hyatt gives us great comfort because they are at the top when it comes to cleaning and sanitizing standards and their outreach to consumers has been meaningful and it will continue to be meaningful. So we think this is truly a distinguishing factor relative to the independent hotel operator because the customers are going to be comfortable that if they're going to stay at a Marriott-managed hotel or a Hyatt-managed hotel, that it's going to be sanitized. It's going to be clean, and safety is paramount today. I mean we talked a minute ago about ADR. And I can tell you, based on some focus groups that have taken place, the customers don't really care as much about ADR as they care about their personal safety. So we think that between the brand standards with respect to cleanliness and cleaning and the fact that we are affiliated with the best loyalty program in the space is going to give us a true competitive advantage as we come out of this pandemic. So I'll let Sourav give you a little more color on how we're thinking about the hotel operating model."

And where the opportunity really exists is going to be, I would put in sort of 3 broad buckets: one is going to be a reduction of above property costs. Second is the brands are really focusing on brand standards and figuring out which brand standards are cake and can be either eliminated completely or modified. And the third is really adapting to the changing customer preferences, particularly leveraging technology. So think about would we really need the front desk as we know it today with the touchless technology that does exist and would the customer want to interact during the check-in experience. So that's our 3 broad buckets I would put it into.
The incremental costs associated with screening, we believe, should be offset by improvement in productivity."

Associations have to have group meetings to survive. It's part of how they make money. But the intangible is the fact that group meetings are very important for interaction and building relationships and building trust among the people that participate in group meetings.

We hope that you and your families are safe and healthy, and we extend our deepest sympathies for those affected by COVID-19.
As you are aware, the lodging sector is navigating its unprecedented downturn that is expected to be at least twice as severe as the Great Recession. After a strong January and February, U.S. RevPAR posted its steepest decline on record and is expected to further deteriorate in April according to STR data.
Although we couldn't have anticipated the outbreak of a global pandemic, Host is well positioned to withstand the magnitude of this impact due to years of prudent capital allocation that emphasize maximizing balance sheet capacity and liquidity towards the end of the cycle.
Today, we not only expect to persevere through this crisis, we fully expect to emerge with a stronger operating model, the highest quality portfolio in the company's history and the ability to capitalize on future opportunities to create value for all our stakeholders.
This morning, I will address our liquidity and cash flow position, key business segment trends and our revised capital plan. Brian will discuss our first quarter performance in-depth and provide our forecast for April.
We began this year with the lowest leverage in the company's history at 1.6x net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA, no near-term debt maturities, $1.6 billion of cash on hand, a fully unencumbered consolidated portfolio and an investment-grade balance sheet. We drew down our $1.5 billion credit facility revolver in mid-March and ended April with approximately $2.7 billion of cash, including FF&E reserves, after paying approximately $140 million in first quarter dividends, which were declared in February.
At quarter end, our leverage ratio, as defined in our credit facility, was at 2x, our interest coverage ratio was at 6.8x, and our fixed charge coverage ratio was at 4.6x, all of which are well within the limits specified in our credit facility covenants. We expect to remain in compliance with all our credit facility covenants through the second quarter and are currently in discussions with our supportive bank lending group to secure greater flexibility on our covenant requirements.
Moving on to expenses. We and our operators responded to the precipitous decline in revenues in March and April by implementing portfolio-wide cost reductions that are unprecedented in their magnitude. These include reducing the fixed portion of above property allocated costs by as much as 2/3, suspending contributions to hotels FF&E escrow accounts, suspending most brand standards, and unfortunately, furloughing up to 80% of the hotel workforce.
As of yesterday, operations at 35 of our 80 consolidated hotels representing 43% of our total room count are suspended. We worked with our operators to determine whether to suspend operations at a hotel based on the property's ability to generate revenues that are greater than the incremental costs associated with remaining open. If the hotel is expected to achieve this incremental threshold, it remains open. Our preference is to leave hotels open as long as it is financially justifiable to do so because we believe an operational property is better positioned to capture demand when it begins to recover.
Our scale within several markets such as New York, Washington, D.C., San Diego, Los Angeles, Orange County and Chicago has helped us generate operational efficiencies and to further benefit from consolidating low levels of demand at multiple properties into the hotels that remain operational in that market. For example, we have gained operational efficiencies in Washington, D.C., with the leadership of the JW Marriott overseeing the Washington Marriott at Metro Center and the Westin Georgetown. The same has been achieved in New York and other markets.
Demand consolidation is benefiting our hotels in Los Angeles, San Antonio and San Diego, where we are able to consolidate demand into one property in each of those markets. For the hotels that remain open, our managers had significantly scaled down operations by closing guestroom floors and meeting spaces and suspending food and beverage outlet operations. Due to timing, we expect to see the full benefit of these operating expense reductions in April when total hotel operating expenses are expected to be 70% to 75% lower than our initial forecast from February.
At the corporate level, we expect to further conserve cash by reducing our capital expenditures by $100 million to $125 million and our corporate expenses by 10% to 15%. Finally, we expect to either suspend our second quarter dividend or cut it to $0.01 a share, which is a reduction of approximately $140 million compared to our prior $0.20 per share quarterly dividend.
As a result of these anticipated cash savings initiatives and a worst-case scenario where all of our hotels are effectively closed through the end of 2020 and the dividend remains suspended or reduced, our monthly cash outflow would average $120 million to $140 million per month, reflecting average hotel level expenses of $78 million to $80 million a month as well as estimated capital expenditures, interest payments and general corporate overhead.
Importantly, in this worst-case scenario, we would end 2020 with approximately $1.65 billion of cash, including the FF&E reserve, leaving us with ample liquidity to support operations as the economy recovers.
Moving on to group and transient business trends. Through May 4, we have lost an estimated $1.3 billion of expected 2020 revenues. This represents approximately $630 million of total group revenues known to date and $660 million of total transient revenues forecasted for the first half of the year. Approximately 90% of our total group revenue cancellations have been for the first half of the year with over 60% in the second quarter alone.
Of the approximately 10% of total group revenue cancellations in the second half, less than 3% are for the fourth quarter. While the low levels of cancellations for the fourth quarter are encouraging, we believe that the near-term pace of group and transient business remains uncertain until the consumer feels comfortable traveling again.
Our operators have booked approximately 12% of our total 2020 lost group revenues, with the majority rebooked for the second half of 2020. Although we expect a significant portion of our total group revenues to be lost due to timing as they were driven by a favorable 2020 citywide convention calendar, a majority of our group customers have expressed a desire to be booked at our properties. Finally, we have collected $32 million of cancellation fees to date with $10 million recognized in the first quarter.
Shifting to 2021 total group revenue pace. We began this year with 2.3 million definite rooms on the books for 2021, and pace was nearly 3% ahead of the same time last year. Although 2021 group booking activity is half of what it was last year and our total group revenue pace is now flat, we believe group demand will return over time. With decision-makers on the sidelines in wait-and-see mode, we believe that pace of recovery in both group and business transient will depend upon customers feeling safe to travel.
Markets with stronger group for 2021 are San Antonio, San Diego, Seattle, Los Angeles and Chicago, whereas New York, Orlando, San Francisco, San Jose, Denver and Boston currently have pace opportunities.
Given the current uncertainty, pace by market could change considerably in the weeks and months to come. We continue to believe in the long-term viability of the group business. While the association business model relies upon generating income from large group meetings, a more intangible reality is that most group meetings allow members within an industry to connect with and learn from each other, while building relationships and trust in a manner that we don't think is possible to replicate digitally. In the long run, we believe using group volumes to compress supply and generate productive yield management will remain a cornerstone of the lodging business.
That said, we are positioning ourselves for the recovery to be led by drive-to leisure destinations. As observed in China and other parts of Asia that are several weeks ahead of the United States, the recovery thus far has been like -- been led by domestic leisure stays and drive-to destinations. With renovations recently completed, in construction or planned within the next 12 months, over 70% of our portfolio and our strongest drive-to leisure markets will be fully refreshed. Specifically, our hotels in Phoenix, San Diego, Orange County, San Antonio and Florida, which represent over 13,000 keys or nearly 30% of our total portfolio are very well positioned to capture a recovery in drive-to leisure demand.
We continue to prioritize the health and safety of our employees and guests. Most of our hotels are managed by large brands who are known for reliably delivering consistent service and standards. These brands are now raising their cleanliness standards to even higher levels with new protocols to address the current circumstances. We believe branded hotels, communication around and execution of rigorous cleaning standards will resonate well with customers. Moreover, we expect the strength of their loyalty programs to be a strong driver of demand to our properties.
Turning to our supply outlook. While it will take several quarters before we have a complete understanding of the change in hotel supply growth, we've cut our internal net supply expectations for 2020 in half, based on broad assumptions surrounding project delays or announcements and existing hotel closures. We now expect supply growth of roughly 1% in 2020 with average growth over the next 3 years remaining below the long-term historical trend. Moreover, we believe there is a high probability that several projects that have not yet begun construction will be canceled or significantly delayed.
Although no one knows the timing or shape of the recovery, we are hopeful that occupancy declines may have stabilized and found a bottom in April. We are frequently asked what level of occupancy will allow us to breakeven at the hotel EBITDA line. As you may imagine, it's difficult to provide a number as it varies greatly by property, requires ADR assumptions and is likely to change on a monthly basis. We have done the analysis based on a single month of operations in the current environment with significant expense reductions remaining in place. In that scenario, assuming ADRs decline 15% to 30% on a year-over-year basis, we would expect to achieve hotel EBITDA breakeven at 35% to 45% portfolio occupancy.
Our enterprise analytics and asset management teams are working closely with our operators to strengthen the long-term hotel operating model with near-term goals of achieving breakeven and generating higher profitability at lower levels of occupancy.
In the 2009 recession, several operating expense line items were significantly reduced and continued to improve through the cycle. While we expect our hotels to incur new expenses, especially ones related to the new cleaning standards, downturns compel owners and operators to reevaluate brand standards, programs and above property expenses, an exercise that can result in long-term savings and a healthier hotel operating model that better serves customers' changing needs.
Turning to CapEx. We have reduced our 2020 capital expenditures by $100 million to $125 million, which represents an approximately 50% reduction to the portion of the CapEx budget that wasn't already spent, underweighed or committed.
Approximately 85% of our CapEx savings are derived from eliminating nonessential renewal and replacement CapEx spend with the remainder coming from suspended ROI projects. We continue to plan on spending $180 million to $200 million on the Marriott transformational capital program, and now expect to receive $20 million in operating profit guarantees this year. It makes sense for us to complete these renovations for these reasons. 
First, we benefited from $20 million of operating profit guarantees without experiencing commensurate revenue disruptions given the current unprecedented low RevPAR environment. Second, we expect the renovations to position us to achieve meaningful RevPAR gains through the cycle, particularly as most hotel owners are compelled to cut back on renovations due to liquidity constraints. And third, construction bids are coming in below budget, and market pricing is expected to decline by at least 6% to 10%, which provides us the opportunity to buyout construction at lower prices.
In addition to all of this, as the performance of these properties return, we will receive enhanced owners' priority on this investment, which will reduce the incentive management fees we pay Marriott.
As part of this year's Marriott transformational capital program, we have completed renovations at the San Antonio Rivercenter Marriott, and we will finish the Minneapolis City Center Marriott in just a few weeks. Later this year, we plan to complete the JW Marriott Buckhead. In addition, we expect to start the Ritz-Carlton, Amelia Island, which is scheduled to complete in the first quarter of 2021. Finally, we will complete the second phases at both New York Marriott Marquis and the Orlando World Center Marriott, which are scheduled to complete in the third and fourth quarter of 2021, respectively.
Combined with the properties completed as part of last year's capital program, including Coronado Island Marriott Resort & Spa, New York Marriott Downtown, San Francisco Marriott Marquis and Santa Clara Marriott, the Marriott transformational capital program will be nearly 70% complete by the end of 2020.
While the program consists of a mix of group and leisure-dominated hotels and markets, these transformational renovations are expected to have a useful life of 7 to 10 years and will help our properties gain market share and outperform through the next cycle.
While our revised CapEx plan assumes projects will be completed substantially as scheduled, COVID-19 has impacted our ability to implement renovations as supply chains have been disrupted and certain state and local orders have deemed construction nonessential. We will continue to provide quarterly updates on our capital plan for the year.
As I reflect on leading Host over the last few years and now through this crisis, it is gratifying to know that our prudent and disciplined capital allocation strategy toward the end of the cycle has served all our stakeholders well. In 2018 and 2019, we sold $3.3 billion of our relatively lower quality and lower total RevPAR assets at the top of the market. Additionally, we capitalized on the favorable debt capital markets last year to execute over $3 billion of refinancing, which extended our debt maturities and reduced our borrowing costs at an opportune time.
While we also acquired $1.6 billion of high-quality assets, bought back $629 million of stock and invested in developing and redeveloping parts of our portfolio, we deployed each of these value creation tools in a measured and disciplined manner, not knowing when the cycle would end. But discerning that balance sheet strength and capacity would be of paramount importance when it did.
Today, as we enter a new lodging cycle, we feel hopeful about a future where the threat of this pandemic has passed. In the meantime, we are taking the opportunity this crisis provides to further strengthen our operating model and to learn how to generate higher levels of profitability at lower levels of occupancy. We are excited to be entering a new cycle with the highest quality portfolio of iconic and irreplaceable assets in the company's history and likely in the lodging industry.
When demand recovers, we believe that the quality of our assets, many of which will be newly renovated, will be a true differentiator that will help us gain RevPAR index share and outperform the industry. We continue to believe in the strength of both geographic and demand diversity through the cycle. Geographic diversity will serve us through an uneven recovery as various states and markets entered lockdowns at different times. Demand diversity will help us drive optimal revenue management and pricing through the cycle.
Finally, we expect our relative balance sheet strength to continue to be a differentiator that will provide us with greater flexibility to capitalize on future long-term value creation opportunities that meet our strategic objectives.
With that, I will turn the call over to Brian."

Good morning, everyone. Prior to the spread of the pandemic in the United States, business was off to a strong start in 2020. For the total portfolio in January and February, RevPAR was up 220 basis points, driven by 120 basis point increa",1193,"Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Prior to the spread of the pandemic in the United States, business was off to a strong start in 2020. For the total portfolio in January and February, RevPAR was up 220 basis points, driven by 120 basis point increase in occupancy. Total RevPAR was up 490 basis points for the same period. As a result, at that point in the quarter, we were ahead of last year by approximately $20 million. March, however, experienced a 65% decline in RevPAR, driven by a 52% drop in occupancy. We lost 730,000 room nights due to shelter-in-place orders and widespread changes in business travel policies.
March room revenues declined by $200 million year-over-year and drove our first quarter RevPAR decline of 23.3% as occupancy fell 17% year-over-year. Our first quarter results include a $43 million wage and benefit expense associated with moves to suspend operations and the necessary changes to hotel-level staffing. These costs include an $8 million cash payment to hotel employees in March and a $35 million accrual for furlough benefits in April and May. If our operators extend those benefits for the approximately 80% of the workforce that is currently furloughed, we would expect the carrying costs for those employees beyond May to average $15 million to $17 million per month for the entire portfolio.
As Jim mentioned, we have worked closely with our operators to reduce operating expenses and expect to realize a 70% to 75% reduction in hotel-level operating expenses in April compared to our initial forecast. As a reminder, our initial forecast in February implied that hotel-level expenses at the midpoint would be approximately $3.8 billion for the full year. On the revenue front, we expect the total RevPAR for April will decline by 90% to 95%, reflecting the extremely low occupancies in most markets.
Demand in April has largely been restricted to medical professionals and airline crews. For example, the Sheraton New York Times Square and the New York Marriott Marquis achieved occupancies close to 50% in April, primarily driven by medical and first-responder business. Being 2 of the largest hotels in the city to remain open has provided the Sheraton and the Marquis with a great opportunity to capture this business. With New York City, thankfully, continuing to make progress from earlier peak infection levels, this business is expected to taper off in early to mid-May.
By the end of March, we had suspended operations at 13 properties. As occupancies continued to decline through April, we suspended operations in an additional 22 properties, bringing the total number of suspensions to 35.
A typical staffing model for properties that have been suspended include a management team of 5 to 7 associates working at schedules that have been reduced anywhere from 20% to 40%. Further, there is management oversight of the security department, and in certain circumstances, properties have layered in additional sales and event department management to assist with the rescheduling and planning of future group business. Hourly positions are generally limited to single associate per shift in the engineering and security departments.
Properties that are operational will generally have the same base management coverage as suspended properties as well as minimal rooms management, though, again, working at significantly reduced hours. Typically, these managers are covering both the housekeeping department and front desk as well as actively working a shift in one of those departments. Hourly positions in addition to the security and engineering positions previously mentioned may include a housekeeper shift based on occupancy and front desk coverage. In the very limited cases where food service is provided, one chef or kitchen shift would be added to prepare a limited to-go menu.
Although visibility remains limited, we do not anticipate additional suspensions at this time. Timing with regard to reopening the 35 hotels where operations are currently suspended, however, remains unclear. Our reopening criteria are based on the timing of state and local authorities and the pace of our bookings and revenue growth projections. We are working with our operators to determine how costs can be managed through the impending recovery such that we can achieve breakeven levels as quickly as possible, with the goal of generating higher levels of profitability at lower levels of occupancy over time.
Shifting to market performance. Our top-performing markets in the first quarter were all in negative territory, although they outperformed the STR upper tier segment in their respective markets. Top-performing markets include: Phoenix, San Francisco, New Orleans, Atlanta, Miami, San Diego, New York and the Florida Gulf Coast. The underperformers were San Antonio, Maui/Oahu, Jacksonville, Orange County, Denver, Northern Virginia, Washington, D.C., Seattle and Houston.
The majority of the $630 million of total group revenue loss that Jim mentioned has been driven by 6 markets: San Diego, New York, Orlando, Phoenix, San Francisco and Boston. However, we have experienced cancellations across the portfolio with 24 markets showing greater than $5 million in total group revenue cancellations.
We are not providing any 2020 guidance at this time. Our lack of visibility regarding the depth and duration of the pandemic, the timing of the reopening of individual states and localities and the expected operating restrictions for businesses as well as individual company travel restrictions is simply too uncertain at this time. I would note that in prior recessions, peak to trough declines in hotel-level EBITDA have been roughly twice as large as the peak to trough declines in RevPAR. Although this 2:1 ratio should have deteriorated considerably in a near 0 revenue environment, we believe it will continue to hold true for our portfolio due to our significant success in reducing fixed costs at the property level.
Our confidence in our ability to not only persevere through this crisis but to be able to drive value for stakeholders is based on the strength of our investment-grade balance sheet. We have significant liquidity to withstand the worst-case scenario of a complete shutdown of our entire portfolio until year-end 2021, subject to our success in obtaining covenant waivers for our credit facilities. Moreover, we have no significant debt maturities until 2023 and have approximately $2.7 billion of available cash as of April 30.
Finally, the company has access to other sources of liquidity, including secured debt, asset sales and capital market transactions. To be clear, the company has no need to tap into additional sources of liquidity, but I mentioned them to provide reassurance that we do not expect liquidity to be an issue for Host.
Today, more than ever, we believe that Host Hotels & Resorts is the premier lodging REIT in the industry. We have a high-quality, well-diversified portfolio whose consistent performance is driven by strong in-house analytics and by working with the best operators in the business. With the only investment-grade balance sheet among lodging REITs, we are well positioned to deal with this crisis and to continue to execute our strategic vision to create long-term value for our shareholders.
Thank you. And with that, we will now be happy to take questions. To be sure we have time to address questions from as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to 1 question."

So we're in a really unique position because, as you heard today, we have the runway in a very worse-case scenario to take us through 2021 from a liquidity perspective. We do have access to multiple sources of capital should we need it, which we don't believe we're going to need it. We'll only need it to play offense at the time when opportunities present themselves and we can see greater visibility going forward. 
So as we're having conversations with the bank group, we're keeping into consideration -- taking into consideration maximum optionality and flexibility to put us in a position to play offense going forward.

Now when does that happen? I think right now, it's very premature at this point in time. I don't think you're going to see us or anybody else in a position to acquire hotels until we have greater visibility on the cadence of how the U.S. economy is going to perform and how it's going to recover. I think everyone is in agreement today that we are in a recession. We just don't know the depth of the recession nor do we know the duration of the recession. 
There are numerous conversations occurring between hotel owners and lenders today with respect to waivers, interest forbearance. It's a question of how that's all going to play out and where the opportunities are going to be. I think it's a little too soon to know. But when we have visibility and when we start seeing opportunities come to market, we will be in a position to take advantage of those opportunities. 
We're talking to our bank group by giving us some optionality to acquire hotels as we move forward. Obviously, the hotels are going to have to be a strategic fit for us. They're going to have to be priced appropriately. They're going to have to allow us to believe that we're going to be able to create shareholder value or we're going to continue to be disciplined in our approach to capital allocation.

We are having daily conversations with our operators regarding reinventing the revenue management model. We don't think revenue management is by anything like -- by any means a thing of the past today. We think it's more important than ever. And our primary concern is going to be focused on rate integrity and not rate degradation. It's tricky in a low RevPAR environment, low occupancy environment. We'll grant you that. 
But as an example, in the month of April, we ran at a very low occupancy for the portfolio of about 13% -- just north of 12%. We ran $135 ADR. That doesn't sound great, but when you're selling rooms in hotels that, in many instances, if you put New York aside, are running at low single-digit occupancies to maintain a rate in that level, it is pretty good from our perspective. 
So as we look at breakeven occupancy and ADRs, it's really a quite a variable exercise that's going to change hotel by hotel. It's going to change as occupancy and demand increase and expenses creep back into the property. So the numbers we gave you with respect to occupancy declines and ADR declines are really based on the low level of expenses that we're experiencing today. So as those expenses increase, it's going to be a balance between incremental expenses going into the properties against occupancy and ADR gains. 
Is that helpful to you, Rich?"

Assuming we return to some kind of more normal business environment, where do you think that number can go to? 
It seems like there's going to be a lot of -- so have thoughts around maybe not cleaning hotel rooms when guests are using them, that there might be more cleaning outside of the rooms? Or where do you think that could just move to? Or do you think it just kind of stays the same after everything has been reallocated?"

I'll give you a couple of thoughts here, but I'm going to ask Sourav to jump in on this one. 
We're -- I can tell you this. We view this opportunity -- this crisis truly has an opportunity to redefine the hotel operating model. And there are going to be incremental costs associated with cleaning and sanitizing because we think that, that is going to be critically important. It's always been important to the traveling consumer to know what they're getting when they check into a hotel room. 
And the fact that the majority of our properties are managed by Marriott and Hyatt gives us great comfort because they are at the top when it comes to cleaning and sanitizing standards and their outreach to consumers has been meaningful and it will continue to be meaningful. So we think this is truly a distinguishing factor relative to the independent hotel operator because the customers are going to be comfortable that if they're going to stay at a Marriott-managed hotel or a Hyatt-managed hotel, that it's going to be sanitized. It's going to be clean, and safety is paramount today. 
I mean we talked a minute ago about ADR. And I can tell you, based on some focus groups that have taken place, the customers don't really care as much about ADR as they care about their personal safety. So we think that between the brand standards with respect to cleanliness and cleaning and the fact that we are affiliated with the best loyalty program in the space is going to give us a true competitive advantage as we come out of this pandemic. 
So I'll let Sourav give you a little more color on how we're thinking about the hotel operating model."

And where the opportunity really exists is going to be, I would put in sort of 3 broad buckets. 
One is going to be a reduction of above property costs. Second is the brands are really focusing on brand standards and figuring out which brand standards archaic and can be either eliminated completely or modified. And the third is really adapting to the changing customer preferences, particularly leveraging technology. So think about would we really need the front desk as we know it today with the touchless technology that does exist or would the customer want to interact during the check-in experience. 
So that's our 3 broad buckets I would put it into.
The incremental costs associated with screening, we believe, should be offset by improvement in productivity."

We hope that you and your families are safe and healthy, and we extend our deepest sympathies for those affected by COVID-19.
As you are aware, the lodging sector is navigating its unprecedented downturn that is expected to be at least twice as severe as the Great Recession. After a strong January and February, U.S. RevPAR posted its steepest decline on record and is expected to further deteriorate in April according to STR data.
Although we couldn't have anticipated the outbreak of a global pandemic, Host is well positioned to withstand the magnitude of this impact due to years of prudent capital allocation that emphasize maximizing balance sheet capacity and liquidity towards the end of the cycle.
Today, we not only expect to persevere through this crisis, we fully expect to emerge with a stronger operating model, the highest quality portfolio in the company's history and the ability to capitalize on future opportunities to create value for all our stakeholders.
This morning, I will address our liquidity and cash flow position, key business segment trends and our revised capital plan. Brian will discuss our first quarter performance in-depth and provide our forecast for April.
We began this year with the lowest leverage in the company's history at 1.6x net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA, no near-term debt maturities, $1.6 billion of cash on hand, a fully unencumbered consolidated portfolio and an investment-grade balance sheet. We drew down our $1.5 billion credit facility revolver in mid-March and ended April with approximately $2.7 billion of cash, including FF&E reserves, after paying approximately $140 million in first quarter dividends, which were declared in February.
At quarter end, our leverage ratio, as defined in our credit facility, was at 2x, our interest coverage ratio was at 6.8x, and our fixed charge coverage ratio was at 4.6x, all of which are well within the limits specified in our credit facility covenants. We expect to remain in compliance with all our credit facility covenants through the second quarter and are currently in discussions with our supportive bank lending group to secure greater flexibility on our covenant requirements.
Moving on to expenses. We and our operators responded to the precipitous decline in revenues in March and April by implementing portfolio-wide cost reductions that are unprecedented in their magnitude. These include reducing the fixed portion of above property allocated costs by as much as 2/3, suspending contributions to hotels FF&E escrow accounts, suspending most brand standards, and unfortunately, furloughing up to 80% of the hotel workforce.
As of yesterday, operations at 35 of our 80 consolidated hotels representing 43% of our total room count are suspended. We worked with our operators to determine whether to suspend operations at a hotel based on the property's ability to generate revenues that are greater than the incremental costs associated with remaining open. If the hotel is expected to achieve this incremental threshold, it remains open. Our preference is to leave hotels open as long as it is financially justifiable to do so because we believe an operational property is better positioned to capture demand when it begins to recover.
Our scale within several markets such as New York, Washington, D.C., San Diego, Los Angeles, Orange County and Chicago has helped us generate operational efficiencies and to further benefit from consolidating low levels of demand at multiple properties into the hotels that remain operational in that market. For example, we have gained operational efficiencies in Washington, D.C., with the leadership of the JW Marriott overseeing the Washington Marriott at Metro Center and the Westin Georgetown. The same has been achieved in New York and other markets.
Demand consolidation is benefiting our hotels in Los Angeles, San Antonio and San Diego, where we are able to consolidate demand into one property in each of those markets. For the hotels that remain open, our managers had significantly scaled down operations by closing guestroom floors and meeting spaces and suspending food and beverage outlet operations. Due to timing, we expect to see the full benefit of these operating expense reductions in April when total hotel operating expenses are expected to be 70% to 75% lower than our initial forecast from February.
At the corporate level, we expect to further conserve cash by reducing our capital expenditures by $100 million to $125 million and our corporate expenses by 10% to 15%. Finally, we expect to either suspend our second quarter dividend or cut it to $0.01 a share, which is a reduction of approximately $140 million compared to our prior $0.20 per share quarterly dividend.
As a result of these anticipated cash savings initiatives and a worst-case scenario where all of our hotels are effectively closed through the end of 2020 and the dividend remains suspended or reduced, our monthly cash outflow would average $120 million to $140 million per month, reflecting average hotel level expenses of $78 million to $80 million a month as well as estimated capital expenditures, interest payments and general corporate overhead.
Importantly, in this worst-case scenario, we would end 2020 with approximately $1.65 billion of cash, including the FF&E reserve, leaving us with ample liquidity to support operations as the economy recovers.
Moving on to group and transient business trends. Through May 4, we have lost an estimated $1.3 billion of expected 2020 revenues. This represents approximately $630 million of total group revenues known to date and $660 million of total transient revenues forecasted for the first half of the year. Approximately 90% of our total group revenue cancellations have been for the first half of the year with over 60% in the second quarter alone.
Of the approximately 10% of total group revenue cancellations in the second half, less than 3% are for the fourth quarter. While the low levels of cancellations for the fourth quarter are encouraging, we believe that the near-term pace of group and transient business remains uncertain until the consumer feels comfortable traveling again.
Our operators have booked approximately 12% of our total 2020 lost group revenues, with the majority rebooked for the second half of 2020. Although we expect a significant portion of our total group revenues to be lost due to timing as they were driven by a favorable 2020 citywide convention calendar, a majority of our group customers have expressed a desire to be booked at our properties. Finally, we have collected $32 million of cancellation fees to date with $10 million recognized in the first quarter.
Shifting to 2021 total group revenue pace. We began this year with 2.3 million definite rooms on the books for 2021, and pace was nearly 3% ahead of the same time last year. Although 2021 group booking activity is half of what it was last year and our total group revenue pace is now flat, we believe group demand will return over time. With decision-makers on the sidelines in wait-and-see mode, we believe that pace of recovery in both group and business transient will depend upon customers feeling safe to travel.
Markets with stronger group for 2021 are San Antonio, San Diego, Seattle, Los Angeles and Chicago, whereas New York, Orlando, San Francisco, San Jose, Denver and Boston currently have pace opportunities.
Given the current uncertainty, pace by market could change considerably in the weeks and months to come. We continue to believe in the long-term viability of the group business. While the association business model relies upon generating income from large group meetings, a more intangible reality is that most group meetings allow members within an industry to connect with and learn from each other, while building relationships and trust in a manner that we don't think is possible to replicate digitally. In the long run, we believe using group volumes to compress supply and generate productive yield management will remain a cornerstone of the lodging business.
That said, we are positioning ourselves for the recovery to be led by drive-to leisure destinations. As observed in China and other parts of Asia that are several weeks ahead of the United States, the recovery thus far has been like -- been led by domestic leisure stays and drive-to destinations. With renovations recently completed, in construction or planned within the next 12 months, over 70% of our portfolio and our strongest drive-to leisure markets will be fully refreshed. Specifically, our hotels in Phoenix, San Diego, Orange County, San Antonio and Florida, which represent over 13,000 keys or nearly 30% of our total portfolio are very well positioned to capture a recovery in drive-to leisure demand.
We continue to prioritize the health and safety of our employees and guests. Most of our hotels are managed by large brands who are known for reliably delivering consistent service and standards. These brands are now raising their cleanliness standards to even higher levels with new protocols to address the current circumstances. We believe branded hotels, communication around and execution of rigorous cleaning standards will resonate well with customers. Moreover, we expect the strength of their loyalty programs to be a strong driver of demand to our properties.
Turning to our supply outlook. While it will take several quarters before we have a complete understanding of the change in hotel supply growth, we've cut our internal net supply expectations for 2020 in half, based on broad assumptions surrounding project delays or announcements and existing hotel closures. We now expect supply growth of roughly 1% in 2020 with average growth over the next 3 years remaining below the long-term historical trend. Moreover, we believe there is a high probability that several projects that have not yet begun construction will be canceled or significantly delayed.
Although no one knows the timing or shape of the recovery, we are hopeful that occupancy declines may have stabilized and found a bottom in April. We are frequently asked what level of occupancy will allow us to breakeven at the hotel EBITDA line. As you may imagine, it's difficult to provide a number as it varies greatly by property, requires ADR assumptions and is likely to change on a monthly basis. We have done the analysis based on a single month of operations in the current environment with significant expense reductions remaining in place. In that scenario, assuming ADRs decline 15% to 30% on a year-over-year basis, we would expect to achieve hotel EBITDA breakeven at 35% to 45% portfolio occupancy.
Our enterprise analytics and asset management teams are working closely with our operators to strengthen the long-term hotel operating model with near-term goals of achieving breakeven and generating higher profitability at lower levels of occupancy.
In the 2009 recession, several operating expense line items were significantly reduced and continued to improve through the cycle. While we expect our hotels to incur new expenses, especially ones related to the new cleaning standards, downturns compel owners and operators to reevaluate brand standards, programs and above property expenses, an exercise that can result in long-term savings and a healthier hotel operating model that better serves customers' changing needs.
Turning to CapEx. We have reduced our 2020 capital expenditures by $100 million to $125 million, which represents an approximately 50% reduction to the portion of the CapEx budget that wasn't already spent, underweighed or committed.
Approximately 85% of our CapEx savings are derived from eliminating nonessential renewal and replacement CapEx spend with the remainder coming from suspended ROI projects. We continue to plan on spending $180 million to $200 million on the Marriott transformational capital program, and now expect to receive $20 million in operating profit guarantees this year. It makes sense for us to complete these renovations for these reasons. 
First, we benefited from $20 million of operating profit guarantees without experiencing commensurate revenue disruptions given the current unprecedented low RevPAR environment. Second, we expect the renovations to position us to achieve meaningful RevPAR gains through the cycle, particularly as most hotel owners are compelled to cut back on renovations due to liquidity constraints. And third, construction bids are coming in below budget, and market pricing is expected to decline by at least 6% to 10%, which provides us the opportunity to buyout construction at lower prices.
In addition to all of this, as the performance of these properties return, we will receive enhanced owners' priority on this investment, which will reduce the incentive management fees we pay Marriott.
As part of this year's Marriott transformational capital program, we have completed renovations at the San Antonio Rivercenter Marriott, and we will finish the Minneapolis City Center Marriott in just a few weeks. Later this year, we plan to complete the JW Marriott Buckhead. In addition, we expect to start the Ritz-Carlton, Amelia Island, which is scheduled to complete in the first quarter of 2021. Finally, we will complete the second phases at both New York Marriott Marquis and the Orlando World Center Marriott, which are scheduled to complete in the third and fourth quarter of 2021, respectively.
Combined with the properties completed as part of last year's capital program, including Coronado Island Marriott Resort & Spa, New York Marriott Downtown, San Francisco Marriott Marquis and Santa Clara Marriott, the Marriott transformational capital program will be nearly 70% complete by the end of 2020.
While the program consists of a mix of group and leisure-dominated hotels and markets, these transformational renovations are expected to have a useful life of 7 to 10 years and will help our properties gain market share and outperform through the next cycle.
While our revised CapEx plan assumes projects will be completed substantially as scheduled, COVID-19 has impacted our ability to implement renovations as supply chains have been disrupted and certain state and local orders have deemed construction nonessential. We will continue to provide quarterly updates on our capital plan for the year.
As I reflect on leading Host over the last few years and now through this crisis, it is gratifying to know that our prudent and disciplined capital allocation strategy toward the end of the cycle has served all our stakeholders well. In 2018 and 2019, we sold $3.3 billion of our relatively lower quality and lower total RevPAR assets at the top of the market. Additionally, we capitalized on the favorable debt capital markets last year to execute over $3 billion of refinancing, which extended our debt maturities and reduced our borrowing costs at an opportune time.
While we also acquired $1.6 billion of high-quality assets, bought back $629 million of stock and invested in developing and redeveloping parts of our portfolio, we deployed each of these value creation tools in a measured and disciplined manner, not knowing when the cycle would end. But discerning that balance sheet strength and capacity would be of paramount importance when it did.
Today, as we enter a new lodging cycle, we feel hopeful about a future where the threat of this pandemic has passed. In the meantime, we are taking the opportunity this crisis provides to further strengthen our operating model and to learn how to generate higher levels of profitability at lower levels of occupancy. We are excited to be entering a new cycle with the highest quality portfolio of iconic and irreplaceable assets in the company's history and likely in the lodging industry.
When demand recovers, we believe that the quality of our assets, many of which will be newly renovated, will be a true differentiator that will help us gain RevPAR index share and outperform the industry. We continue to believe in the strength of both geographic and demand diversity through the cycle. Geographic diversity will serve us through an uneven recovery as various states and markets entered lockdowns at different times. Demand diversity will help us drive optimal revenue management and pricing through the cycle.
Finally, we expect our relative balance sheet strength to continue to be a differentiator that will provide us with greater flexibility to capitalize on future long-term value creation opportunities that meet our strategic objectives.
With that, I will turn the call over to Brian."

Good morning, everyone. Prior to the spread of the pandemic in the United States, business was off to a strong start in 2020. For the total portfolio in January and February, RevPAR was up 220 basis points, driven by 120 basis point increa",1193,"Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Prior to the spread of the pandemic in the United States, business was off to a strong start in 2020. For the total portfolio in January and February, RevPAR was up 220 basis points, driven by 120 basis point increase in occupancy. Total RevPAR was up 490 basis points for the same period. As a result, at that point in the quarter, we were ahead of last year by approximately $20 million. March, however, experienced a 65% decline in RevPAR, driven by a 52% drop in occupancy. We lost 730,000 room nights due to shelter-in-place orders and widespread changes in business travel policies.
March room revenues declined by $200 million year-over-year and drove our first quarter RevPAR decline of 23.3% as occupancy fell 17% year-over-year. Our first quarter results include a $43 million wage and benefit expense associated with moves to suspend operations and the necessary changes to hotel-level staffing. These costs include an $8 million cash payment to hotel employees in March and a $35 million accrual for furlough benefits in April and May. If our operators extend those benefits for the approximately 80% of the workforce that is currently furloughed, we would expect the carrying costs for those employees beyond May to average $15 million to $17 million per month for the entire portfolio.
As Jim mentioned, we have worked closely with our operators to reduce operating expenses and expect to realize a 70% to 75% reduction in hotel-level operating expenses in April compared to our initial forecast. As a reminder, our initial forecast in February implied that hotel-level expenses at the midpoint would be approximately $3.8 billion for the full year. On the revenue front, we expect the total RevPAR for April will decline by 90% to 95%, reflecting the extremely low occupancies in most markets.
Demand in April has largely been restricted to medical professionals and airline crews. For example, the Sheraton New York Times Square and the New York Marriott Marquis achieved occupancies close to 50% in April, primarily driven by medical and first-responder business. Being 2 of the largest hotels in the city to remain open has provided the Sheraton and the Marquis with a great opportunity to capture this business. With New York City, thankfully, continuing to make progress from earlier peak infection levels, this business is expected to taper off in early to mid-May.
By the end of March, we had suspended operations at 13 properties. As occupancies continued to decline through April, we suspended operations in an additional 22 properties, bringing the total number of suspensions to 35.
A typical staffing model for properties that have been suspended include a management team of 5 to 7 associates working at schedules that have been reduced anywhere from 20% to 40%. Further, there is management oversight of the security department, and in certain circumstances, properties have layered in additional sales and event department management to assist with the rescheduling and planning of future group business. Hourly positions are generally limited to single associate per shift in the engineering and security departments.
Properties that are operational will generally have the same base management coverage as suspended properties as well as minimal rooms management, though, again, working at significantly reduced hours. Typically, these managers are covering both the housekeeping department and front desk as well as actively working a shift in one of those departments. Hourly positions in addition to the security and engineering positions previously mentioned may include a housekeeper shift based on occupancy and front desk coverage. In the very limited cases where food service is provided, one chef or kitchen shift would be added to prepare a limited to-go menu.
Although visibility remains limited, we do not anticipate additional suspensions at this time. Timing with regard to reopening the 35 hotels where operations are currently suspended, however, remains unclear. Our reopening criteria are based on the timing of state and local authorities and the pace of our bookings and revenue growth projections. We are working with our operators to determine how costs can be managed through the impending recovery such that we can achieve breakeven levels as quickly as possible, with the goal of generating higher levels of profitability at lower levels of occupancy over time.
Shifting to market performance. Our top-performing markets in the first quarter were all in negative territory, although they outperformed the STR upper tier segment in their respective markets. Top-performing markets include: Phoenix, San Francisco, New Orleans, Atlanta, Miami, San Diego, New York and the Florida Gulf Coast. The underperformers were San Antonio, Maui/Oahu, Jacksonville, Orange County, Denver, Northern Virginia, Washington, D.C., Seattle and Houston.
The majority of the $630 million of total group revenue loss that Jim mentioned has been driven by 6 markets: San Diego, New York, Orlando, Phoenix, San Francisco and Boston. However, we have experienced cancellations across the portfolio with 24 markets showing greater than $5 million in total group revenue cancellations.
We are not providing any 2020 guidance at this time. Our lack of visibility regarding the depth and duration of the pandemic, the timing of the reopening of individual states and localities and the expected operating restrictions for businesses as well as individual company travel restrictions is simply too uncertain at this time. I would note that in prior recessions, peak to trough declines in hotel-level EBITDA have been roughly twice as large as the peak to trough declines in RevPAR. Although this 2:1 ratio should have deteriorated considerably in a near 0 revenue environment, we believe it will continue to hold true for our portfolio due to our significant success in reducing fixed costs at the property level.
Our confidence in our ability to not only persevere through this crisis but to be able to drive value for stakeholders is based on the strength of our investment-grade balance sheet. We have significant liquidity to withstand the worst-case scenario of a complete shutdown of our entire portfolio until year-end 2021, subject to our success in obtaining covenant waivers for our credit facilities. Moreover, we have no significant debt maturities until 2023 and have approximately $2.7 billion of available cash as of April 30.
Finally, the company has access to other sources of liquidity, including secured debt, asset sales and capital market transactions. To be clear, the company has no need to tap into additional sources of liquidity, but I mentioned them to provide reassurance that we do not expect liquidity to be an issue for Host.
Today, more than ever, we believe that Host Hotels & Resorts is the premier lodging REIT in the industry. We have a high-quality, well-diversified portfolio whose consistent performance is driven by strong in-house analytics and by working with the best operators in the business. With the only investment-grade balance sheet among lodging REITs, we are well positioned to deal with this crisis and to continue to execute our strategic vision to create long-term value for our shareholders.
Thank you. And with that, we will now be happy to take questions. To be sure we have time to address questions from as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to 1 question."

Now when does that happen? I think right now, it's very premature at this point in time. I don't think you're going to see us or anybody else in a position to acquire hotels until we have greater visibility on the cadence of how the U.S. economy is going to perform and how it's going to recover. I think everyone is in agreement today that we are in a recession. We just don't know the depth of the recession nor do we know the duration of the recession. 
There are numerous conversations occurring between hotel owners and lenders today with respect to waivers, interest forbearance. It's a question of how that's all going to play out and where the opportunities are going to be. I think it's a little too soon to know. But when we have visibility and when we start seeing opportunities come to market, we will be in a position to take advantage of those opportunities. 
We're talking to our bank group by giving us some optionality to acquire hotels as we move forward. Obviously, the hotels are going to have to be a strategic fit for us. They're going to have to be priced appropriately. They're going to have to allow us to believe that we're going to be able to create shareholder value or we're going to continue to be disciplined in our approach to capital allocation.

We are having daily conversations with our operators regarding reinventing the revenue management model. We don't think revenue management is by anything like -- by any means a thing of the past today. We think it's more important than ever. And our primary concern is going to be focused on rate integrity and not rate degradation. It's tricky in a low RevPAR environment, low occupancy environment. We'll grant you that. 
But as an example, in the month of April, we ran at a very low occupancy for the portfolio of about 13% -- just north of 12%. We ran $135 ADR. That doesn't sound great, but when you're selling rooms in hotels that, in many instances, if you put New York aside, are running at low single-digit occupancies to maintain a rate in that level, it is pretty good from our perspective. 
So as we look at breakeven occupancy and ADRs, it's really a quite a variable exercise that's going to change hotel by hotel. It's going to change as occupancy and demand increase and expenses creep back into the property. So the numbers we gave you with respect to occupancy declines and ADR declines are really based on the low level of expenses that we're experiencing today. So as those expenses increase, it's going to be a balance between incremental expenses going into the properties against occupancy and ADR gains. 
Is that helpful to you, Rich?"

We're -- I can tell you this. We view this opportunity -- this crisis truly has an opportunity to redefine the hotel operating model. And there are going to be incremental costs associated with cleaning and sanitizing because we think that, that is going to be critically important. It's always been important to the traveling consumer to know what they're getting when they check into a hotel room. 
And the fact that the majority of our properties are managed by Marriott and Hyatt gives us great comfort because they are at the top when it comes to cleaning and sanitizing standards and their outreach to consumers has been meaningful and it will continue to be meaningful. So we think this is truly a distinguishing factor relative to the independent hotel operator because the customers are going to be comfortable that if they're going to stay at a Marriott-managed hotel or a Hyatt-managed hotel, that it's going to be sanitized. It's going to be clean, and safety is paramount today. 
I mean we talked a minute ago about ADR. And I can tell you, based on some focus groups that have taken place, the customers don't really care as much about ADR as they care about their personal safety. So we think that between the brand standards with respect to cleanliness and cleaning and the fact that we are affiliated with the best loyalty program in the space is going to give us a true competitive advantage as we come out of this pandemic.

And where the opportunity really exists is going to be, I would put in sort of 3 broad buckets. 
One is going to be a reduction of above property costs. Second is the brands are really focusing on brand standards and figuring out which brand standards archaic and can be either eliminated completely or modified. And the third is really adapting to the changing customer preferences, particularly leveraging technology. So think about would we really need the front desk as we know it today with the touchless technology that does exist or would the customer want to interact during the check-in experience. 
So that's our 3 broad buckets I would put it into.
The incremental costs associated with screening, we believe, should be offset by improvement in productivity."

So people are still booking. I think it really goes to the uncertainty surrounding the scope and depth of the crisis. We think group is a very viable part of the hotel business going forward. Associations have to have group meetings to survive. It's part of how they make money. But the intangible is the fact that group meetings are very important for interaction and building relationships and building trust among the people that participate in group meetings. We don't believe that this is able to be replaced digitally. It's just not going to happen over a Zoom call. So we feel that the group is going to continue to be a viable part of the business.

We hope that all of you are staying safe and healthy during these extraordinary times. The lodging industry experienced a challenging second quarter with record RevPAR declines in April,",2571,"Thank you, Tejal, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. We hope that all of you are staying safe and healthy during these extraordinary times. The lodging industry experienced a challenging second quarter with record RevPAR declines in April, followed by a slight improvement in lodging demand through May and June. Working with our operators, we responded swiftly to the changing demand landscape by reducing our second quarter hotel operating expenses by 72% year-over-year. As states and markets began to ease their lockdowns, our portfolio achieved over 100% hotel revenue growth from the lows of $24 million in April to $49 million in June. 
Toward the end of the second quarter, we successfully amended our credit agreement and achieved outstanding terms that preserve our liquidity and retain our flexibility to capitalize on value-enhancing investment opportunities. All in all, we emerged from the most challenging quarter on record for host and the travel industry with significantly lower operating costs greater balance sheet flexibility and access to $2.5 billion of liquidity. 
Starting with operations. Our second quarter expense reductions and revenue growth were driven by exceptionally agile asset management and the swift reaction of our world-class operators. As lodging demand plumbed to record lows in April, we worked with our operators to suspend operations at 35 hotels, reduced hotel fixed costs by approximately 50% and reduce overall hotel operating costs by 72% year-over-year. 
Cost savings were primarily driven by steep reductions in wage and benefit expenses and the fixed portion of above property allocated costs as well as by suspending most brand standards and contributions to hotels FF&E reserve accounts. 
At operational hotels, our managers significantly scaled down operations by closing guestroom floors and meeting spaces. When leisure demand began improving through May and June, we swiftly pivoted to reopen hotels and work with our operators to drive 380 basis points of average occupancy gains and a 50% increase in average room rates across the portfolio from April to June. As of yesterday, 64 of our 80 consolidated hotels, representing 78% of our total room count were operational. 
We prioritized reopening 8 suspended hotels located in drive-to leisure markets including Florida, San Diego, Phoenix, San Antonio and Orange County, as these markets captured leisure demand and delivered higher second quarter RevPAR than the rest of our portfolio. We currently expect another 6 hotels to reopen in August with operational rooms representing nearly 90% of our total room count by month end. As a reminder, we work with our operators to reopen a property when it's expected to sustain approximately 10% to 15% occupancy levels. 
At those levels, we expect incremental revenues to exceed the incremental cost of being operational, resulting in marginally lower EBITDA losses. Our preference is for hotels to remain operational rather than suspended because an operational property is capable of capturing spontaneous short-term demand and better positioned to attract future demand when the market begins to recover. 
All that said, we continually review our hotel's occupancy trends and won't hesitate to suspend our hotel's operations when the marginal benefit of remaining operational turns negative. For instance, we are currently reviewing the New York and San Francisco markets New York has been slow to reopen with the recent pause on indoor dining and a cancellation of the 2020 United Nations General Assembly and New York Marathon events, while San Francisco has enacted an onerous, costly and unnecessary operating ordinates. 
As we deliver both significant expense reductions and gradual revenue improvement, we've reduced our hotel level operating loss by nearly 50% from $73 million in April, $37 million in June. Our hotel level monthly operating loss averaged $54 million, while above property corporate level monthly cash flows averaged $79 million in the second quarter, with the latter reflecting a concentration of Capex, which is expected to decrease by approximately $100 million in the second half of the year. 
We ended the second quarter with $2.5 billion of available liquidity, which includes $750 million of available capacity under the revolver portion of the credit facility as well as over $150 million of FF&E escrow reserves. Assuming operational performance remains at second quarter levels, we would expect approximately $100 million to $110 million of total monthly cash outflows, reflecting an average hotel level loss of approximately $50 million a month as well as estimated capital expenditures, interest payments and general corporate overhead. 
In this scenario, we would expect to end 2020 and with approximately $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion of total available liquidity. If operational performance remains at second quarter 2020 levels beyond year-end, we would have ample liquidity until mid-2022, even with CapEx near 2020 levels, subject to continued covenant waivers for our credit agreement. 
Moving on to our balance sheet. Our quarter end leverage ratio, as defined in our credit facility was at 4.6x. Our interest coverage ratio was at 4.4x, and our fixed charge coverage ratio was at 2.7x, all of which were within the limits specified in our prior credit facility covenants. With the amended credit agreement in place, our quarterly tested financial covenants were waived beginning July 1, 2020, through the second quarter of 2021. We're testing to resume for the third quarter of 2021. 
Although the duration of this pandemic induced crisis remains unknown, we continue to expect our liquidity position and balance sheet capacity to remain key comparative strengths that differentiate host as one of the few lodging REITs that is less likely to need to issue equity expressly to delever its balance sheet. Shifting to business performance. We saw clear signs of a recovery in consumer demand through May and June as state and market lockdowns began to ease. Our booking pace indicated a solid pickup in June and the trend leading into the third quarter, but has since decelerated since daily infection rates in certain markets have spiked. 13 of our top 20 markets have regressed their reopening phases in the last 3 to 4 weeks, while the other 7 remain in their existing phase. 
Needless to say, this trend has impacted our reopening plants. When Hawaii announced that on August 1, they would lift the 14-day quarantine requirement for travelers who test negative for COVID-19 up to 72 hours prior to arrival. The on-the-books occupancy for our Mowry Resorts quickly reached mid teens. We, therefore, expected to reopen the Andaz Maui and the Fairmont Kilani in August. But have now delayed our reopening plans as Hawaii has extended the quarantine through at least the end of August. 
Surprisingly, we saw some group business in the second quarter despite the absence of a vaccine or an effective therapeutic. Excluding New York, which benefit from COVID-19 related emergency services group business. Traditional group business showed signs of improvement as it grew from 1,700 room nights sold in April to 12,855 sold in June. For the whole portfolio, business transient room nights grew 150% to 12,450 room nights in June after bottoming at 4,850 room nights in April. 
While business transient demand has primarily been driven by defense contractors, we have begun to see consulting-related business travel in July. Government transient room nights also improved from 650 room nights in April to 6,450 room nights in June. Finally, contract business held up relatively well in the second quarter with 43,000 contract room nights sold in the quarter. 
Our San Antonio Hotels increased airline crew volume year-over-year, while Newark Airport Hyatt Place Waikiki and Grand Hyatt Buckhead, all saw production improved throughout the quarter. As of June, our properties have 1.8 million rooms on the books for the full year 2020, down nearly 62% from 4.6 million group rooms same time last year. Our total group revenue pace is down 81% in the third quarter and 49% in the fourth quarter. 
And we continue to expect group cancellations in the second half of the year. We have rebooked approximately $120 million of canceled total group revenues with an additional $96 million in the pipeline that collectively represent nearly 21% of the total group revenue that canceled this year. We are also working with our operators to find creative ways to fill the demand gap with long-term group blocks from schools, sports associations and corporates. 
For example, Houston Airport Marriott received a large corporate group booking of 175 rooms per night from July to December in addition to another corporate group booking of 100 rooms per night on a month-to-month basis. The rooms are being used to quarantine COVID-19 negative employees for 14 days prior to international deployment. 
Looking at next year, we are experiencing a high single-digit deceleration in our total group revenue booking pace for 2021 as measured by definite revenues on the books, with most of the deficit concentrated in the first half of next year and minimal impact to the second half. Our tentative revenues, however, are tracking nearly 30% ahead of the same time last year, reflecting robust pent-up demand that's waiting for the current health and safety risk to subside. 
Our business outlook depends upon how quickly we, as a nation, can flatten the rate of new COVID-19 infections while we await a more effective solution, which we expect will take the form of a vaccine. In the interim, increasing consumers' confidence in our industry has never been more important. The major hotel brands have been proactive in creating, implementing and communicating new cleanliness and health and safety standards. Including corporate requirements for face coverings to be worn within indoor public spaces. 
These safety protocols help address the risk of contagion and establish trust with consumers. Specifically at Marriott, long known for consistency and reliability, we expect their commitment to clean program to resonate with both business and leisure customers alike. Encouragingly, as a percentage of second quarter revenues, our direct sales through marriott.com increased 400 basis points over last year compared with sales through OTAs increasing by 200 basis points. 
As we have consistently said, Host benefits from our strong affiliation with world-class hotel brands. We continue to believe that beyond strong loyalty programs brand trust and reliability will be differentiators that will help host outperform during the recovery. We remain deeply committed to redefining our operating model with the immediate goal of achieving breakeven as soon as possible and the longer-term goal of generating higher profitability at lower levels of occupancy. 
In the 2009 recession, several operating expense line items were significantly reduced and continued to improve through the cycle. Downturns compel owners and operators to reevaluate brand standards, programs and above property expenses and exercise that can result in long-term savings and a healthier hotel operating model that better serves customers' changing needs. To that end, we are working with our operators to deliver permanent cost savings at the hotel level through the following 3 key initiatives. 
First, to achieve a long-term reduction in the fixed component of above property charges. Second, to adopt productivity-enhancing technology, such as the use of mobile key. And third, to drive efficiencies through the cross utilization of management functions. While achieving these long-term permanent cost savings is conditional upon reaching an agreement with our operators, we have analyzed the potential benefit they could have on our operating model. 
Based on 2019 revenues, we believe these measures have the potential to reduce annual hotel level expenses for our current portfolio by an aggregate $100 million to $150 million, which represents approximately 3% to 4% of pro forma 2019 hotel level expenses. Turning to our supply outlook, although there has been little evidence of a material decline in supply so far, there is a historical pattern of supply rationalization after large demand shocks. 
When we look at the historical supply trajectory for the top 60 to 70 markets, rooms under construction in major markets fell by 68%, 2 years after the peak of 2008 and were down 77% by mid 2011. We, therefore, expect supply will be mitigated over the long-term with rooms under construction declining over time and likely bottoming at even lower levels than in the last recession, given the significantly greater degree of distress. 
In addition, we expect record levels of permanent hotel closures due to the unprecedented level of distress in the market. According to Trup, the lodging delinquency rate has risen from 2.7% in April to 19% in May and has reached approximately 24% in June. Our analysis indicates that nearly 30% of upper tier hotels in our top 20 markets are temporarily closed. 7 hotels in our top 20 markets are reported to have permanently closed already, and we expect more of the temporary closures to become permanent. 
To conclude, we have experienced 4 months of significant economic uncertainty as our nation locked down, began to reopen, flattened infection rates in certain markets and experienced sharp increases in others. Although we expect economic uncertainty to prevail until the health and safety risk posed by the pandemic are fully addressed. We are encouraged by the following: first, our operator's ability to adapt the operating model to record low levels of demand by reducing our hotel level operating cost by 72%. Our goal is to make a portion of these cost reductions permanent and to achieve higher levels of profitability at lower levels of occupancy. Second is the resilience of lodging demand, which began to return as states and markets reopen and as our booking trends indicated, would have been greater had infection rates continue to flatten rather than rise. 
Although there is some debate about the future of business travel as professionals grow accustomed to virtual meetings, we would note that U.S. occupancy has achieved higher peaks following the last 3 downturns, including [ 9 11 ], when many believed air travel would be permanently impacted. While speculating on long-term behavioral trends in the midst of the biggest global health and safety crisis in a century is likely to be unproductive, business transient and group business customers have a proven track record of choosing the effectiveness of in-person interactions despite the efficiency of videoconferencing technology. 
Finally, we are confident in the strategic advantages provided by our financial capacity to withstand prolonged business disruption. Host is differentiated in its potential to not only survive this crisis, but also to capitalize on future long-term value creation opportunities that meet our strategic objectives. We are excited to have entered a new cycle with the highest quality portfolio of iconic and irreplaceable hotels in the company's history and likely in the lodging industry. 
When demand recovers, we believe that the quality of our assets, many of which will be newly renovated, will be a true differentiator that will help us gain RevPAR index share and outperform the industry. We continue to believe in the strength of both geographic and demand diversity through the cycle. Geographic diversity will serve us through an uneven recovery as various states and markets recover differently, while demand diversity will help us drive optimal revenue management and pricing through the cycle. 
My remarks would not be complete if I didn't mention how conversations about confronting systemic racism have reverberated throughout our society. Diversity, equality, and inclusion remain at the forefront of our priorities and integral to our corporate values. I was proud to recently join the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion Initiative. And as an organization, Host remains committed to fostering these values in our company and our communities. With that, I will turn the call over to Brian."
29574,677004616,2053477,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 31, 2020",2020-07-31,"Earnings Calls","Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Building on Jim's comments, the volatility in the second quarter was unprecedented as the demand landscape changed over the course of the quarter.

Building on Jim's comments, the volatility in the second quarter was unprecedented as the demand landscape changed over the course of the quarter. Although second quarter RevPAR declined by 93% year-over-year, it grew 133% from the depths of the crisis in April through the end of June when 10 of our hotels exceeded or were close to achieving breakeven EBITDA. 
For the quarter, we delivered a RevPAR of over $14 driven by average occupancy of 8.8% and an average room rate of approximately $162. Total RevPAR of approximately $23 and benefited from $14 million of mostly COVID related group cancellation and attrition revenues recognized in the second quarter compared to $10 million of similar revenues recognized in the first quarter. 
In the second half of this year, we do not expect to recognize any further cancellation and attrition revenues related to the pandemic as we continue to prioritize the rebooking of group business. Our second quarter results include a $45 million payment for health care benefits and special pay for the nearly 80% of hotel level employees that have been furloughed. 
We have accrued $35 million for that expense in the first quarter. In the second quarter, we accrued an additional $32 million for similar payments that will be made in the third quarter. The decrease in the third quarter primarily reflects the reopening of several suspended properties since April. As Jim mentioned, we work closely with our operators to reduce expenses and have realized a 72% decrease in second quarter hotel level operating cost. Our wage and benefit expense during the quarter was approximately 81% lower excluding onetime wage and benefit-related special costs. 
Our variable costs decreased 93% due to lower occupancy while our fixed costs, including fixed wage and benefits expenses, were approximately 50% lower. The decrease in fixed cost was driven by wage and benefits above property cost relief, utility expense and property specific sales and marketing reductions that partially offset other fixed costs such as property tax and insurance. 
Although long-term costs associated with revised cleanliness protocols are yet to be fully determined, we believe the cost increase will be more than offset by productivity improvements. Our operators provided significant cost relief for above property shared service and allocated costs, which are normally considered fixed. These costs include sales offices, rent -- revenue management, advertising, the program services fund at Marriott, centralized human resources, accounting, payroll, as well as IT systems and support. These fixed costs saw unprecedented reductions with some allocated costs reduced by as much as 2/3. 
Overall, we reduced operating expenses by approximately 72% year-over-year at our low occupancy hotels and by approximately 75% at hotels with suspended operations. For the third quarter, we believe we will see continued cost containment for wages, benefits and variable expenses where cost reductions mirror reductions in overall volume. 
With regards to fixed costs, while the brands have not communicated above property service cost target as yet, we expect utility and property-specific sales and marketing cost reductions to continue. Moreover, we would also expect the tax benefit we experienced in the second quarter to continue along the same trajectory. 
Moving to revenues. Portfolio-wide average occupancy declined by approximately 73 percentage points year-over-year to 8.8%, and our average daily room rate was down 35%, but still nearly $162. We have generally found that our operators are able to preserve, and in some cases, to even exceed rates versus the same time last year at properties that are in high demand on strong compression dates such as national holidays. 
For example, our Florida hotels delivered remarkable ADR growth of approximately 12% year-over-year, with ADR for the month of June, approximately $97 higher. Thus far, this downturn has distinguished itself by the fact that average rates decline are not driving occupancy to the extent that they normally would. Customers are more sensitive to cleanliness and sanitation standards than to room rates. We are hopeful that rate degradation will be less severe than in prior downturns and that branded hotels will benefit from having stringent cleanliness standards that should help gain customer trust and strong loyalty programs that should help drive demand. 
Shifting to market performance. Hotels in our drive-to leisure markets, which include Phoenix, San Antonio, San Diego, Florida Gulf, Miami and Jacksonville, were running a 1.8% occupancy at the beginning of the quarter, and had progressed to 17.4% by the last week of June. Although the portfolio was in negative territory in the second quarter, markets with relatively better performance include Jacksonville, the Florida Gulf Coast, New York, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami and Atlanta. 
The Florida markets, excluding Orlando, benefited from leisure demand. The Ritz-Carlton, Amelia Island, outperformed STR's upper tier RevPAR in Jacksonville by 600 basis points, while our Miami Hotels outperformed their STR peers by 250 basis points of RevPAR. Our hotels in New York and L.A. benefited from medical related business as well as the closure of hotels within those markets. 
It is estimated that 50% of New York hotel inventory is in suspended operations and that 20% of closed hotels in Manhattan may not reopen. In Atlanta, our hotels in the market benefited from short-term transient demand as well as crew contract business. Our worst-performing markets in the second quarter were Orlando, Boston, Maui/Oahu, New Orleans, Seattle, San Diego and San Francisco, largely due to suspended operations at several of our hotels in those markets through much of the second quarter. 
Turning to CapEx. At the outset of the pandemic, we reduced our expected 2020 capital expenditures by approximately $100 million. And through the second quarter, we have completed almost 60% of the total CapEx spend we have planned for the year. We received $8 million of operating profit guarantees for the Marriott Transformational Capital Program year-to-date and expect to receive another $12 million over the second half of the year. 
As Jim mentioned, we successfully amended our revolving credit facility and term loans at the end of June. In the amendment, we accomplished 3 key objectives. First, we bought our portfolio time to make inroads into the recovery. We suspended the testing of financial covenants through the second quarter of 2021 and gained additional flexibility to accommodate our portfolio's recovery for 3 quarters following the covenant relief period. 
Second, we preserved our ability to capitalize on opportunistic value-enhancing investments during this period of extreme dislocation. Under the waiver, we have the ability to acquire $1.5 billion of assets using our existing liquidity while maintaining certain minimum liquidity requirements. We have the ability to issue equity without any requirement to repay debt. 
We have preserved the flexibility to use $750 million of net proceeds from asset sales for reinvestment purposes. And lastly, we preserve the flexibility to spend up to $500 million in ROI CapEx during the covenant waiver period. This provides us the ability to continue value enhancing, repositioning and development projects within the portfolio without experiencing revenue disruption, as well as to continue the Marriott Transformational Capital Program, which benefits from operating profit guarantees. 
On behalf of the Host management team, I would like to thank the members of our bank group for their continued support. Looking forward for the rest of the year, we are not providing 2020 guidance at this time due to the continued lack of visibility on the depth and duration of this crisis. The timing of the reopening of individual states and localities and the expected operating restrictions for businesses, as well as individual company travel restrictions. 
Once again, we would note that in prior recessions, peak to trough declines in hotel level EBITDA and have been roughly twice as large as the peak to trough declines in RevPAR. Although this 2:1 ratio should have deteriorated considerably in a near 0 revenue environment, we believe it will continue to hold true for our portfolio due to the significant success in reducing fixed costs at the property level. 
Today, more than ever, we believe that Host Hotels & Resorts is the premier lodging REIT in the industry. We have a high-quality, well-diversified portfolio whose consistent performance is driven by strong in-house analytics and by working with the best operators in the business, with the only investment-grade balance sheet among lodging REITs, no significant debt maturities until 2023 and approximately $2.5 billion of available liquidity as of June 30. We are well positioned to deal with this crisis and to continue to execute our strategic vision to create long-term value for our shareholders. Thank you. And with that, we will now be happy to take questions.

With respect to potential acquisitions, although from a capital allocation perspective, we have the flexibility to invest in up to $1.5 billion of acquisitions with existing liquidity, subject to maintaining $500 million of liquidity. I'll make a couple of comments with respect to that. Number one, there aren't many opportunities in the marketplace today. We expect to see investment opportunities the latter part of this year and into next year as a special servicers and other lenders resolve issues with their borrowers. And in some instances, properties are going to come to market.

As we think about it, maybe we were looking at the potential performance in an optimistic way because of the forward bookings we saw for the fourth of July weekend, in particular. And I'll talk about one market that, from our perspective, was very meaningful, and that is Miami Beach. We have the one hotel South Beach. We opened that property in early June. We saw good forward bookings. And going into the fourth of July weekend, we expected occupancy in the 70% plus range, didn't materialize because the mayor shut the beaches, shut the bars. As we all know, there was a surge in cases in Florida. And we ended up running around 20% of occupancy. 
So I think there's good news and bad news and what happened there. The good news is that there is a lot of pent-up demand. And whenever the virus is under control, we fully anticipate that people are going to get back on the road and continue to want to travel and to have a good experience at a luxury property. Obviously, the bad news is, there was a surge in cases, and there's nothing we can do about that. I mean, we're all waiting as a nation to get the pandemic under control. And I think everyone is waiting for an effective vaccine or vaccines or a therapeutic to allow people to get back to business. 
So other markets continue to do well over the fourth of July. As an example, the -- 2 Ritz Carltons in Florida, the Ritz Naples and the Ritz in Amelia Island, both ran occupancies in the 60s and achieved ADRs of $600. Those rates were higher than same time last year. So again, we think if we hadn't seen the surge in cases in Florida, that we would have done better than we did at those properties. So if I talk about seeing a deceleration it's really based on our expectations."

So I'll take the second question first, Bill. I think it's too soon, really too soon to say what's going to happen to values over the long term.

I think it's too soon, really too soon to say what's going to happen to values over the long term. I mean, everybody in the public space is trading at a significant discount to replacement cost today. I think that we are probably less than 50% of replacement costs. I mean, we put some data on replacement costs in our investor presentation for everyone to see, and it's a very granular analysis that we provided. 
So some of the assets that are in the market today, at the height of the pandemic are trading at a 20% discount to where they were valued pre COVID, where they were valued February 1. So I am confident that over time, as cash flows recover and as EBITDA recovers, that the values for the most part across the country will get back to pre COVID levels and improve. I mean, there are going to be some markets where I think it's going to be more challenging, quite frankly. And those are markets where you're still dealing with supply issues. Are you dealing with high cost structures? And those assets might have a bit of a challenge, maintaining their value going forward. But for the most part, I think we're going to get back to where we were pre COVID and grow from there. 
And I'll just point out the fact that we have a very strong geographically diversified portfolio. So with no more than 11% of our EBITDA coming out of any one market. So we are very well positioned, regardless of what happens going forward. And your question with respect to business transient and whether or not business transient recovers to pre COVID levels, I think that the technology has been helpful today. 
We're doing this earnings call in a couple of different locations. And it's certainly not ideal, and I know that we -- we would all prefer to be in the same place, but we're being careful and thoughtful about safety and health as everyone else is. But I, for one, and others are -- I think I'm ready to get on the road. I'm done with Zoom calls. I mean, we have had, on average, 450 Zoom video meetings a week at Host for the last 6 or 7 weeks. So I think it's good to have Zoom today, but we do think that the personal interaction is key. Notwithstanding that, we have looked at what happens if business transient doesn't come back to pre COVID-19 levels. And I think a good proxy is we certainly listen to the commentary that the airlines gave. 
United has a point of view that it's coming back fully. Delta had a point of view that it might be 20% impaired. So we looked at Delta's case, a 20% down, and so what does that mean to us? What would we do with our portfolio -- our existing portfolio today? And how could we remix the business and what would the financial impact be? So we looked at really remixing that business transient [indiscernible] 20% to leisure. And at the end of the day, it has a de minimis impact on EBITDA. And the impact really is on the EBITDA margin because of the business transient slice of the business is our highest-rated piece of business. So we're ready for whatever whatever comes our way with respect to the recovery. And it's good to have the different levers to flex in our portfolio where we can take leisure or we can take more group and really revenue manage the company on an asset-by-asset basis on almost a daily basis."

An investment-grade balance sheet, we think, is critical to -- two really distinguishing factors, and the best portfolio of iconic and irreplaceable hotels in the industry, which we think we have today. So as we think about building the portfolio out over time, we like -- we've talked about this. We like the model that we have with a strong geographic diversification with a business mix differentiation in the hotel between a combination of leisure transient, business transient and group.

We think that the short-term rental business some of the other platforms that are out there -- that were out there, I don't quite know what's going on with them, but Lyric and Sander and some of those, as well as Airbnb, are going to face serious financial difficulties. 
And it's difficult enough for hotel owners that have well hilled equity partners with them to work their way through this pandemic with literally no cash flow or minimal cash flow coming in. I think that, that issue is compounded by the individual Airbnb owners who have taken on a lot of debt, unfortunately. And nowhere to turn when it comes to servicing that debt.

We hope that all of you are staying safe and healthy during these extraordinary times. 
The lodging industry experienced a challenging second quarter with record RevPAR declines in April, followed by a slight improvement in lodging demand through May and June. Working with our operators, we responded swiftly to the changing demand landscape by reducing our second quarter hotel operating expenses by 72% year-over-year. As states and markets began to ease their lockdowns, our portfolio achieved over 100% hotel revenue growth from the lows of $24 million in April to $49 million in June. Toward the end of the second quarter, we successfully amended our credit agreement and achieved outstanding terms that preserve our liquidity and retain our flexibility to capitalize on value-enhancing investment opportunities. All in all, we emerged from the most challenging quarter on record for Host and the travel industry with significantly lower operating costs, greater balance sheet flexibility and access to $2.5 billion of liquidity. 
Starting with operations. Our second quarter expense reductions and revenue growth were driven by exceptionally agile asset management and the swift reaction of our world-class operators. As lodging demand plumbed to record lows in April, we worked with our operators to suspend operations at 35 hotels, reduced hotel fixed costs by approximately 50% and reduced overall hotel operating costs by 72% year-over-year.  Cost savings were primarily driven by steep reductions in wage and benefit expenses and the fixed portion of above-property allocated costs as well as by suspending most brand standards and contributions to hotels FF&E reserve accounts. 
At operational hotels, our managers significantly scaled down operations by closing guestroom floors and meeting spaces. When leisure demand began improving through May and June, we swiftly pivoted to reopen hotels and worked with our operators to drive 380 basis points of average occupancy gains and a 50% increase in average room rates across the portfolio from April to June. As of yesterday, 64 of our 80 consolidated hotels, representing 78% of our total room count, were operational. 
We prioritized reopening 8 suspended hotels located in drive-to leisure markets, including Florida, San Diego, Phoenix, San Antonio and Orange County, as these markets captured leisure demand and delivered higher second quarter RevPAR than the rest of our portfolio. We currently expect another 6 hotels to reopen in August with operational rooms representing nearly 90% of our total room count by month end. As a reminder, we work with our operators to reopen a property when it's expected to sustain approximately 10% to 15% occupancy levels. At those levels, we expect incremental revenues to exceed the incremental cost of being operational, resulting in marginally lower EBITDA losses. Our preference is for hotels to remain operational rather than suspended because an operational property is capable of capturing spontaneous short-term demand and better positioned to attract future demand when the market begins to recover. 
All that said, we continually review our hotels' occupancy trends and won't hesitate to suspend our hotels' operations when the marginal benefit of remaining operational turns negative. For instance, we are currently reviewing the New York and San Francisco markets. New York has been slow to reopen with the recent pause on indoor dining and the cancellation of the 2020 United Nations General Assembly and New York Marathon events while San Francisco has enacted an onerous, costly and unnecessary operating ordinates. 
As we deliver both significant expense reductions and gradual revenue improvement, we've reduced our hotel level operating loss by nearly 50% from $73 million in April, $37 million in June. Our hotel level monthly operating loss averaged $54 million while above-property corporate-level monthly cash flows averaged $79 million in the second quarter with the latter reflecting a concentration of CapEx, which is expected to decrease by approximately $100 million in the second half of the year. We ended the second quarter with $2.5 billion of available liquidity, which includes $750 million of available capacity under the revolver portion of the credit facility as well as over $150 million of FF&E escrow reserves. 
Assuming operational performance remains at second quarter levels, we would expect approximately $100 million to $110 million of total monthly cash outflows, reflecting an average hotel level loss of approximately $50 million a month as well as estimated capital expenditures, interest payments and general corporate overhead.  In this scenario, we would expect to end 2020 with approximately $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion of total available liquidity. If operational performance remains at second quarter 2020 levels beyond year-end, we would have ample liquidity until mid-2022, even with CapEx near 2020 levels subject to continued covenant waivers for our credit agreement. 
Moving on to our balance sheet. Our quarter-end leverage ratio, as defined in our credit facility, was at 4.6x; our interest coverage ratio was at 4.4x; and our fixed charge coverage ratio was at 2.7x, all of which were within the limits specified in our prior credit facility covenants. With the amended credit agreement in place, our quarterly tested financial covenants were waived beginning July 1, 2020, through the second quarter of 2021. We're testing to resume for the third quarter of 2021. 
Although the duration of this pandemic-induced crisis remains unknown, we continue to expect our liquidity position and balance sheet capacity to remain key comparative strengths that differentiate Host as one of the few lodging REITs that is less likely to need to issue equity expressly to delever its balance sheet. 
Shifting to business performance. We saw clear signs of a recovery in consumer demand through May and June as state and market lockdowns began to ease. Our booking pace indicated a solid pickup in June and the trend leading into the third quarter, but has since decelerated since daily infection rates in certain markets have spiked. 13 of our top 20 markets have regressed their reopening phases in the last 3 to 4 weeks while the other 7 remain in their existing phase. 
Needless to say, this trend has impacted our reopening plans. When Hawaii announced that on August 1, they would lift the 14-day quarantine requirement for travelers who test negative for COVID-19 up to 72 hours prior to arrival, the on-the-books occupancy for our Maui Resorts quickly reached mid-teens. We, therefore, expected to reopen the Andaz Maui and the Fairmont Kea Lani in August, but have now delayed our reopening plans as Hawaii has extended the quarantine through at least the end of August. 
Surprisingly, we saw some group business in the second quarter despite the absence of a vaccine or an effective therapeutic. Excluding New York, which benefit from COVID-19-related emergency services group business, traditional group business showed signs of improvement as it grew from 1,700 room nights sold in April to 12,855 sold in June. For the whole portfolio, business transient room nights grew 150% to 12,450 room nights in June after bottoming at 4,850 room nights in April.  While business transient demand has primarily been driven by defense contractors, we have begun to see consulting-related business travel in July. Government transient room nights also improved from 650 room nights in April to 6,450 room nights in June. 
Finally, contract business held up relatively well in the second quarter with 43,000 contract room nights sold in the quarter.  Our San Antonio hotels increased airline crew volume year-over-year while Newark Airport, Hyatt Place Waikiki and Grand Hyatt Buckhead all saw production improved throughout the quarter. As of June, our properties have 1.8 million rooms on the books for the full year 2020, down nearly 62% from 4.6 million group rooms same time last year. 
Our total group revenue pace is down 81% in the third quarter and 49% in the fourth quarter. And we continue to expect group cancellations in the second half of the year. We have rebooked approximately $120 million of canceled total group revenues with an additional $96 million in the pipeline that collectively represent nearly 21% of the total group revenue that canceled this year. We are also working with our operators to find creative ways to fill the demand gap with long-term group blocks from schools, sports associations and corporates.  For example, Houston Airport Marriott received a large corporate group booking of 175 rooms per night from July to December in addition to another corporate group booking of 100 rooms per night on a month-to-month basis. The rooms are being used to quarantine COVID-19-negative employees for 14 days prior to international deployment. 
Looking at next year, we are experiencing a high single-digit deceleration in our total group revenue booking pace for 2021, as measured by definite revenues on the books, with most of the deficit concentrated in the first half of next year and minimal impact to the second half. Our tentative revenues, however, are tracking nearly 30% ahead of the same time last year, reflecting robust pent-up demand that's waiting for the current health and safety risk to subside. 
Our business outlook depends upon how quickly we, as a nation, can flatten the rate of new COVID-19 infections while we await a more effective solution, which we expect will take the form of a vaccine. In the interim, increasing consumers' confidence in our industry has never been more important. The major hotel brands have been proactive in creating, implementing and communicating new cleanliness and health and safety standards, including corporate requirements for face coverings to be worn with indoor -- within indoor public spaces.  These safety protocols help address the risk of contagion and establish trust with consumers. Specifically at Marriott, long known for consistency and reliability, we expect their commitment to clean program to resonate with both business and leisure customers alike. Encouragingly, as a percentage of second quarter revenues, our direct sales through marriott.com increased 400 basis points over last year compared with sales through OTAs increasing by 200 basis points. 
As we have consistently said, Host benefits from our strong affiliation with world-class hotel brands. We continue to believe that beyond strong loyalty programs, brand trust and reliability will be differentiators that will help host outperform during the recovery. We remain deeply committed to redefining our operating model with the immediate goal of achieving breakeven as soon as possible and the longer-term goal of generating higher profitability at lower levels of occupancy. 
In the 2009 recession, several operating expense line items were significantly reduced and continued to improve through the cycle. Downturns compel owners and operators to reevaluate brand standards, programs and above-property expenses, an exercise that can result in long-term savings and a healthier hotel operating model that better serves customers' changing needs. 
To that end, we are working with our operators to deliver permanent cost savings at the hotel level through the following 3 key initiatives: first, to achieve a long-term reduction in the fixed component of above-property charges; second, to adopt productivity-enhancing technology, such as the use of mobile key; and third, to drive efficiencies through the cross utilization of management functions. 
While achieving these long-term permanent cost savings is conditional upon reaching an agreement with our operators, we have analyzed the potential benefit they could have on our operating model.  Based on 2019 revenues, we believe these measures have the potential to reduce annual hotel level expenses for our current portfolio by an aggregate $100 million to $150 million, which represents approximately 3% to 4% of pro forma 2019 hotel level expenses. 
Turning to our supply outlook. Although there has been little evidence of a material decline in supply so far, there is a historical pattern of supply rationalization after large demand shocks. 
When we look at the historical supply trajectory for the top 60 to 70 markets, rooms under construction in major markets fell by 68% 2 years after the peak of 2008 and were down 77% by mid 2011. We therefore expect supply will be mitigated over the long term with rooms under construction declining over time and likely bottoming at even lower levels than in the last recession, given the significantly greater degree of distress. 
In addition, we expect record levels of permanent hotel closures due to the unprecedented level of distress in the market. According to Trepp, the lodging delinquency rate has risen from 2.7% in April to 19% in May and has reached approximately 24% in June. Our analysis indicates that nearly 30% of upper-tier hotels in our top 20 markets are temporarily closed. 7 hotels in our top 20 markets are reported to have permanently closed already, and we expect more of the temporary closures to become permanent. 
To conclude, we have experienced 4 months of significant economic uncertainty as our nation locked down, began to reopen, flattened infection rates in certain markets and experienced sharp increases in others. Although we expect economic uncertainty to prevail until the health and safety risk posed by the pandemic are fully addressed, we are encouraged by the following. First, our operator's ability to adapt the operating model to record-low levels of demand by reducing our hotel level operating cost by 72%. Our goal is to make a portion of these cost reductions permanent and to achieve higher levels of profitability at lower levels of occupancy. Second is the resilience of lodging demand, which began to return as states and markets reopen and, as our booking trends indicated, would have been greater had infection rates continue to flatten rather than rise. Although there is some debate about the future of business travel as professionals grow accustomed to virtual meetings, we would note that U.S. occupancy has achieved higher peaks following the last 3 downturns, including 9/11 when many believed air travel would be permanently impacted. While speculating on long-term behavioral trends in the midst of the biggest global health and safety crisis in the century is likely to be unproductive, business transient and group business customers have a proven track record of choosing the effectiveness of in-person interactions despite the efficiency of videoconferencing technology. 
Finally, we are confident in the strategic advantages provided by our financial capacity to withstand prolonged business disruption. Host is differentiated in its potential to not only survive this crisis, but also to capitalize on future long-term value creation opportunities that meet our strategic objectives. We are excited to have entered a new cycle with the highest quality portfolio of iconic and irreplaceable hotels in the company's history and likely in the lodging industry. 
When demand recovers, we believe that the quality of our assets, many of which will be newly renovated, will be a true differentiator that will help us gain RevPAR index share and outperform the industry. We continue to believe in the strength of both geographic and demand diversity through the cycle. Geographic diversity will serve us through an uneven recovery as various states and markets recover differently while demand diversity will help us drive optimal revenue management and pricing through the cycle. 
My remarks would not be complete if I didn't mention how conversations about confronting systemic racism have reverberated throughout our society. Diversity, equality and inclusion remain at the forefront of our priorities and integral to our corporate values. I was proud to recently join the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion initiative. And as an organization, Host remains committed to fostering these values in our company and our communities. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Brian."

Good morning, everyone. Building on Jim's comments, the volatility in the second quarter was unprecedented as the demand landscape changed over the course of the quarter. Although second quarter RevPAR declined by 93% year-over-year, it",1416,"Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. 
Building on Jim's comments, the volatility in the second quarter was unprecedented as the demand landscape changed over the course of the quarter. Although second quarter RevPAR declined by 93% year-over-year, it grew 133% from the depths of the crisis in April through the end of June when 10 of our hotels exceeded or were close to achieving breakeven EBITDA. 
For the quarter, we delivered a RevPAR of over $14 driven by average occupancy of 8.8% and an average room rate of approximately $162. Total RevPAR of approximately $23 benefited from $14 million of mostly COVID-related group cancellation and attrition revenues recognized in the second quarter compared to $10 million of similar revenues recognized in the first quarter. 
In the second half of this year, we do not expect to recognize any further cancellation and attrition revenues related to the pandemic as we continue to prioritize the rebooking of group business. Our second quarter results include a $45 million payment for health care benefits and special pay for the nearly 80% of hotel-level employees that have been furloughed.  We have accrued $35 million for that expense in the first quarter. In the second quarter, we accrued an additional $32 million for similar payments that will be made in the third quarter. The decrease in the third quarter primarily reflects the reopening of several suspended properties since April. 
As Jim mentioned, we worked closely with our operators to reduce expenses and have realized a 72% decrease in second quarter hotel-level operating cost. Our wage and benefit expense during the quarter was approximately 81% lower, excluding onetime wage and benefit-related special costs.  Our variable costs decreased 93% due to lower occupancy while our fixed costs, including fixed wage and benefits expenses, were approximately 50% lower. The decrease in fixed cost was driven by wage and benefits, above-property cost relief, utility expense and property-specific sales and marketing reductions that partially offset other fixed costs such as property tax and insurance. 
Although long-term costs associated with revised cleanliness protocols are yet to be fully determined, we believe the cost increase will be more than offset by productivity improvements. Our operators provided significant cost relief for above-property shared service and allocated costs, which are normally considered fixed. These costs include sales offices, rent -- revenue management, advertising, the program services fund at Marriott, centralized human resources, accounting, payroll as well as IT systems and support. These fixed costs saw unprecedented reductions with some allocated costs reduced by as much as 2/3. 
Overall, we reduced operating expenses by approximately 72% year-over-year at our low occupancy hotels and by approximately 75% at hotels with suspended operations.  For the third quarter, we believe we will see continued cost containment for wages, benefits and variable expenses where cost reductions mirror reductions in overall volume. 
With regards to fixed costs, while the brands have not communicated above-property service cost target as yet, we expect utility and property-specific sales and marketing cost reductions to continue. Moreover, we would also expect the tax benefit we experienced in the second quarter to continue along the same trajectory. 
Moving to revenues. Portfolio-wide average occupancy declined by approximately 73 percentage points year-over-year to 8.8%, and our average daily room rate was down 35%, but still nearly $162. We have generally found that our operators are able to preserve and, in some cases, to even exceed rates versus the same time last year at properties that are in high demand on strong compression dates such as national holidays. 
For example, our Florida hotels delivered remarkable ADR growth of approximately 12% year-over-year with ADR for the month of June approximately $97 higher. Thus far, this downturn has distinguished itself by the fact that average rates decline are not driving occupancy to the extent that they normally would. Customers are more sensitive to cleanliness and sanitation standards than to room rates. We are hopeful that rate degradation will be less severe than in prior downturns and that branded hotels will benefit from having stringent cleanliness standards that should help gain customer trust and strong loyalty programs that should help drive demand. 
Shifting to market performance. Hotels in our drive-to leisure markets, which include Phoenix, San Antonio, San Diego, Florida Gulf, Miami and Jacksonville, were running a 1.8% occupancy at the beginning of the quarter and had progressed to 17.4% by the last week of June. Although the portfolio was in negative territory in the second quarter, markets with relatively better performance include Jacksonville, the Florida Gulf Coast, New York, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami and Atlanta. 
The Florida markets, excluding Orlando, benefited from leisure demand. The Ritz-Carlton, Amelia Island outperformed STR's upper-tier RevPAR in Jacksonville by 600 basis points while our Miami hotels outperformed their STR peers by 250 basis points of RevPAR. Our hotels in New York and L.A. benefited from medical-related business as well as the closure of hotels within those markets.  It is estimated that 50% of New York hotel inventory is in suspended operations and that 20% of closed hotels in Manhattan may not reopen. In Atlanta, our hotels in the market benefited from short-term transient demand as well as crew contract business. Our worst-performing markets in the second quarter were Orlando, Boston, Maui/Oahu, New Orleans, Seattle, San Diego and San Francisco largely due to suspended operations at several of our hotels in those markets through much of the second quarter. 
Turning to CapEx. At the outset of the pandemic, we reduced our expected 2020 capital expenditures by approximately $100 million. And through the second quarter, we have completed almost 60% of the total CapEx spend we have planned for the year. We received $8 million of operating profit guarantees for the Marriott Transformational Capital Program year-to-date and expect to receive another $12 million over the second half of the year. 
As Jim mentioned, we successfully amended our revolving credit facility and term loans at the end of June. In the amendment, we accomplished 3 key objectives. First, we bought our portfolio time to make inroads into the recovery. We suspended the testing of financial covenants through the second quarter of 2021 and gained additional flexibility to accommodate our portfolio's recovery for 3 quarters following the covenant relief period.  
Second, we preserved our ability to capitalize on opportunistic value-enhancing investments during this period of extreme dislocation. Under the waiver, we have the ability to acquire $1.5 billion of assets using our existing liquidity while maintaining certain minimum liquidity requirements. We have the ability to issue equity without any requirement to repay debt. We have preserved the flexibility to use $750 million of net proceeds from asset sales for reinvestment purposes. 
And lastly, we preserved the flexibility to spend up to $500 million in ROI CapEx during the covenant waiver period. This provides us the ability to continue value enhancing, repositioning development projects within the portfolio without experiencing revenue disruption as well as to continue the Marriott Transformational Capital Program, which benefits from operating profit guarantees.  On behalf of the Host management team, I would like to thank the members of our bank group for their continued support. 
Looking forward for the rest of the year, we are not providing 2020 guidance at this time due to the continued lack of visibility on the depth and duration of this crisis, the timing of the reopening of individual states and localities and the expected operating restrictions for businesses as well as individual company travel restrictions.  Once again, we would note that in prior recessions, peak-to-trough declines in hotel-level EBITDA have been roughly twice as large as the peak-to-trough declines in RevPAR. Although this 2:1 ratio should have deteriorated considerably in a near-0 revenue environment, we believe it will continue to hold true for our portfolio due to the significant success in reducing fixed costs at the property level. 
Today, more than ever, we believe that Host Hotels & Resorts is the premier lodging REIT in the industry. We have a high-quality, well-diversified portfolio whose consistent performance is driven by strong in-house analytics. And by working with the best operators in the business with the only investment-grade balance sheet among lodging REITs, no significant debt maturities until 2023 and approximately $2.5 billion of available liquidity as of June 30, we are well positioned to deal with this crisis and to continue to execute our strategic vision to create long-term value for our shareholders. Thank you. 
And with that, we will now be happy to take questions. [Operator Instructions]"

With respect to potential acquisitions, although from a capital allocation perspective, we have the flexibility to invest in up to $1.5 billion of acquisitions with existing liquidity subject to maintaining $500 million of liquidity, I'll make a couple of comments with respect to that. Number one, there aren't many opportunities in the marketplace today. We expect to see investment opportunities the latter part of this year and into next year as  special servicers and other lenders resolve issues with their borrowers. And in some instances, properties are going to come to market. 
In other instances, properties are going to be recapped. But it's the same thought process with respect to buying hotels at this point in time. We have to be comfortable that we're going to have the right amount of liquidity to ride through the crisis."

As we think about it, maybe we were looking at the potential performance in an optimistic way because of the forward bookings we saw for the fourth of July weekend, in particular. And I'll talk about 1 market that, from our perspective, was very meaningful and that is Miami Beach. We have the 1 Hotel South Beach. We opened that property in early June. We saw good forward bookings. And going into the fourth of July weekend, we expected occupancy in the 70%-plus range. It didn't materialize because the mayor shut the beaches, shut the bars. As we all know, there was a surge in cases in Florida. And we ended up running around 20% of occupancy. 
So I think there's good news and bad news in what happened there. The good news is that there is a lot of pent-up demand. And whenever the virus is under control, we fully anticipate that people are going to get back on the road and continue to want to travel and to have a good experience in a luxury property. Obviously, the bad news is there was a surge in cases, and there's nothing we can do about that. I mean we're all waiting as a nation to get the pandemic under control. And I think everyone is waiting for an effective vaccine or vaccines or a therapeutic to allow people to get back to business. 
So other markets continue to do well over the fourth of July. As an example, the Ritz -- 2 Ritz Carltons in Florida, the Ritz Naples and the Ritz Amelia Island both ran occupancies in the 60s and achieved ADRs of $600. Those rates were higher than same time last year. So again, we think if we hadn't seen the surge in cases in Florida that we would have done better than we did at those properties. So if I talk about seeing a deceleration, it's really based on our expectations."

I think it's too soon, really too soon to say what's going to happen to values over the long term. I mean everybody in the public space is trading at a significant discount to replacement cost today. I think that we are probably less than 50% of replacement costs. I mean we put some data on replacement costs in our investor presentation for everyone to see, and it's a very granular analysis that we provided. 
So some of the assets that are in the market today, at the height of the pandemic are trading at a 20% discount to where they were valued pre-COVID, where they were valued February 1. So I am confident that over time, as cash flows recover and as EBITDA recovers that values for the most part across the country will get back to pre-COVID levels and improve. I mean there are going to be some markets where I think it's going to be more challenging, quite frankly. And those are markets where you're still dealing with supply issues or you're dealing with high-cost structures. And those assets might have a bit of a challenge maintaining their value going forward. But for the most part, I think we're going to get back to where we were pre-COVID and grow from there. And I'll just point out the fact that we have a very strong geographically diversified portfolio, so -- with no more than 11% of our EBITDA coming out of any one market. So we are very well positioned regardless of what happens going forward. 
And your question with respect to business transient and whether or not business transient recovers to pre-COVID levels, I think that the technology has been helpful today.  We're doing this earnings call in a couple of different locations. And it's certainly not ideal, and I know that we -- we would all prefer to be in the same place, but we're being careful and thoughtful about safety and health as everyone else is. But I, for one, and others are -- I think I'm ready to get on the road. I'm done with Zoom calls. I mean we have had, on average, 450 Zoom video meetings a week at Host for the last 6 or 7 weeks. So I think it's good to have Zoom today, but we do think that the personal interaction is key. 
Notwithstanding that, we have looked at what happens if business transient doesn't come back to pre-COVID-19 levels. And I think a good proxy is we certainly listen to the commentary that the airlines gave.  United has a point of view that it's coming back fully. Delta had a point of view that it might be 20% impaired. So we looked at Delta's case of 20% down, and so what does that mean to us? What would we do with our portfolio, our existing portfolio today? And how could we remix the business? And what would the financial impact be? 
So we looked at really remixing that business transient drop of 20% to leisure. And at the end of the day, it has a de minimis impact on EBITDA. The impact really is on the EBITDA margin because of the business transient slice of the business is our highest-rated piece of business. So we're ready for whatever comes our way with respect to the recovery. And it's good to have the different levers to flex in our portfolio where we can take leisure or we can take more group and really revenue manage the company on an asset-by-asset basis on almost a daily basis."

As the same thing that we've talked about, people want to get out, and they have been driving to Airbnbs and leisure -- and drive-to leisure markets. Our point of view is as we start recovering and markets start opening up, the urban markets, in particular, that are going to be more challenged, we think that the short-term rental business, some of the other platforms that are out there -- that were out there, I don't quite know what's going on with them, but Lyric and Sonder and some of those as well as Airbnb are going to face serious financial difficulties. 
And it's difficult enough for hotel owners that have well-heeled equity partners with them to work their way through this pandemic with literally no cash flow or minimal cash flow coming in. I think that, that issue is compounded by the individual Airbnb owners who have taken on a lot of debt unfortunately and nowhere to turn when it comes to servicing that debt. So I think you're going to see in the urban markets, in particular, a recalibration of alternative accommodations."

We hope that all of you are staying safe and healthy during these extraordinary times. 
The lodging industry experienced a challenging second quarter with record RevPAR declines in April, followed by a slight improvement in lodging demand through May and June. Working with our operators, we responded swiftly to the changing demand landscape by reducing our second quarter hotel operating expenses by 72% year-over-year. As states and markets began to ease their lockdowns, our portfolio achieved over 100% hotel revenue growth from the lows of $24 million in April to $49 million in June. Toward the end of the second quarter, we successfully amended our credit agreement and achieved outstanding terms that preserve our liquidity and retain our flexibility to capitalize on value-enhancing investment opportunities. All in all, we emerged from the most challenging quarter on record for Host and the travel industry with significantly lower operating costs, greater balance sheet flexibility and access to $2.5 billion of liquidity. 
Starting with operations. Our second quarter expense reductions and revenue growth were driven by exceptionally agile asset management and the swift reaction of our world-class operators. As lodging demand plumbed to record lows in April, we worked with our operators to suspend operations at 35 hotels, reduced hotel fixed costs by approximately 50% and reduced overall hotel operating costs by 72% year-over-year. Cost savings were primarily driven by steep reductions in wage and benefit expenses and the fixed portion of above-property allocated costs as well as by suspending most brand standards and contributions to hotels FF&E reserve accounts. 
At operational hotels, our managers significantly scaled down operations by closing guestroom floors and meeting spaces. When leisure demand began improving through May and June, we swiftly pivoted to reopen hotels and worked with our operators to drive 380 basis points of average occupancy gains and a 50% increase in average room rates across the portfolio from April to June. As of yesterday, 64 of our 80 consolidated hotels, representing 78% of our total room count, were operational. 
We prioritized reopening 8 suspended hotels located in drive-to leisure markets, including Florida, San Diego, Phoenix, San Antonio and Orange County, as these markets captured leisure demand and delivered higher second quarter RevPAR than the rest of our portfolio. We currently expect another 6 hotels to reopen in August with operational rooms representing nearly 90% of our total room count by month end. As a reminder, we work with our operators to reopen a property when it's expected to sustain approximately 10% to 15% occupancy levels. At those levels, we expect incremental revenues to exceed the incremental cost of being operational, resulting in marginally lower EBITDA losses. Our preference is for hotels to remain operational rather than suspended because an operational property is capable of capturing spontaneous short-term demand and better positioned to attract future demand when the market begins to recover. 
All that said, we continually review our hotels' occupancy trends and won't hesitate to suspend our hotels' operations when the marginal benefit of remaining operational turns negative. For instance, we are currently reviewing the New York and San Francisco markets. New York has been slow to reopen with the recent pause on indoor dining and the cancellation of the 2020 United Nations General Assembly and New York Marathon events while San Francisco has enacted an onerous, costly and unnecessary operating ordinates. 
As we deliver both significant expense reductions and gradual revenue improvement, we've reduced our hotel level operating loss by nearly 50% from $73 million in April, $37 million in June. Our hotel level monthly operating loss averaged $54 million while above-property corporate-level monthly cash flows averaged $79 million in the second quarter with the latter reflecting a concentration of CapEx, which is expected to decrease by approximately $100 million in the second half of the year. We ended the second quarter with $2.5 billion of available liquidity, which includes $750 million of available capacity under the revolver portion of the credit facility as well as over $150 million of FF&E escrow reserves. 
Assuming operational performance remains at second quarter levels, we would expect approximately $100 million to $110 million of total monthly cash outflows, reflecting an average hotel level loss of approximately $50 million a month as well as estimated capital expenditures, interest payments and general corporate overhead. In this scenario, we would expect to end 2020 with approximately $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion of total available liquidity. If operational performance remains at second quarter 2020 levels beyond year-end, we would have ample liquidity until mid-2022, even with CapEx near 2020 levels subject to continued covenant waivers for our credit agreement. 
Moving on to our balance sheet. Our quarter-end leverage ratio, as defined in our credit facility, was at 4.6x; our interest coverage ratio was at 4.4x; and our fixed charge coverage ratio was at 2.7x, all of which were within the limits specified in our prior credit facility covenants. With the amended credit agreement in place, our quarterly tested financial covenants were waived beginning July 1, 2020, through the second quarter of 2021. We're testing to resume for the third quarter of 2021. 
Although the duration of this pandemic-induced crisis remains unknown, we continue to expect our liquidity position and balance sheet capacity to remain key comparative strengths that differentiate Host as one of the few lodging REITs that is less likely to need to issue equity expressly to delever its balance sheet. 
Shifting to business performance. We saw clear signs of a recovery in consumer demand through May and June as state and market lockdowns began to ease. Our booking pace indicated a solid pickup in June and the trend leading into the third quarter, but has since decelerated since daily infection rates in certain markets have spiked. 13 of our top 20 markets have regressed their reopening phases in the last 3 to 4 weeks while the other 7 remain in their existing phase. 
Needless to say, this trend has impacted our reopening plans. When Hawaii announced that on August 1, they would lift the 14-day quarantine requirement for travelers who test negative for COVID-19 up to 72 hours prior to arrival, the on-the-books occupancy for our Maui Resorts quickly reached mid-teens. We, therefore, expected to reopen the Andaz Maui and the Fairmont Kea Lani in August, but have now delayed our reopening plans as Hawaii has extended the quarantine through at least the end of August. 
Surprisingly, we saw some group business in the second quarter despite the absence of a vaccine or an effective therapeutic. Excluding New York, which benefit from COVID-19-related emergency services group business, traditional group business showed signs of improvement as it grew from 1,700 room nights sold in April to 12,855 sold in June. For the whole portfolio, business transient room nights grew 150% to 12,450 room nights in June after bottoming at 4,850 room nights in April. While business transient demand has primarily been driven by defense contractors, we have begun to see consulting-related business travel in July. Government transient room nights also improved from 650 room nights in April to 6,450 room nights in June. 
Finally, contract business held up relatively well in the second quarter with 43,000 contract room nights sold in the quarter. Our San Antonio hotels increased airline crew volume year-over-year while Newark Airport, Hyatt Place Waikiki and Grand Hyatt Buckhead all saw production improved throughout the quarter. As of June, our properties have 1.8 million rooms on the books for the full year 2020, down nearly 62% from 4.6 million group rooms same time last year. 
Our total group revenue pace is down 81% in the third quarter and 49% in the fourth quarter. And we continue to expect group cancellations in the second half of the year. We have rebooked approximately $120 million of canceled total group revenues with an additional $96 million in the pipeline that collectively represent nearly 21% of the total group revenue that canceled this year. We are also working with our operators to find creative ways to fill the demand gap with long-term group blocks from schools, sports associations and corporates. For example, Houston Airport Marriott received a large corporate group booking of 175 rooms per night from July to December in addition to another corporate group booking of 100 rooms per night on a month-to-month basis. The rooms are being used to quarantine COVID-19-negative employees for 14 days prior to international deployment. 
Looking at next year, we are experiencing a high single-digit deceleration in our total group revenue booking pace for 2021, as measured by definite revenues on the books, with most of the deficit concentrated in the first half of next year and minimal impact to the second half. Our tentative revenues, however, are tracking nearly 30% ahead of the same time last year, reflecting robust pent-up demand that's waiting for the current health and safety risk to subside. 
Our business outlook depends upon how quickly we, as a nation, can flatten the rate of new COVID-19 infections while we await a more effective solution, which we expect will take the form of a vaccine. In the interim, increasing consumers' confidence in our industry has never been more important. The major hotel brands have been proactive in creating, implementing and communicating new cleanliness and health and safety standards, including corporate requirements for face coverings to be worn with indoor -- within indoor public spaces. These safety protocols help address the risk of contagion and establish trust with consumers. Specifically at Marriott, long known for consistency and reliability, we expect their commitment to clean program to resonate with both business and leisure customers alike. Encouragingly, as a percentage of second quarter revenues, our direct sales through marriott.com increased 400 basis points over last year compared with sales through OTAs increasing by 200 basis points. 
As we have consistently said, Host benefits from our strong affiliation with world-class hotel brands. We continue to believe that beyond strong loyalty programs, brand trust and reliability will be differentiators that will help host outperform during the recovery. We remain deeply committed to redefining our operating model with the immediate goal of achieving breakeven as soon as possible and the longer-term goal of generating higher profitability at lower levels of occupancy. 
In the 2009 recession, several operating expense line items were significantly reduced and continued to improve through the cycle. Downturns compel owners and operators to reevaluate brand standards, programs and above-property expenses, an exercise that can result in long-term savings and a healthier hotel operating model that better serves customers' changing needs. 
To that end, we are working with our operators to deliver permanent cost savings at the hotel level through the following 3 key initiatives: first, to achieve a long-term reduction in the fixed component of above-property charges; second, to adopt productivity-enhancing technology, such as the use of mobile key; and third, to drive efficiencies through the cross utilization of management functions. 
While achieving these long-term permanent cost savings is conditional upon reaching an agreement with our operators, we have analyzed the potential benefit they could have on our operating model. Based on 2019 revenues, we believe these measures have the potential to reduce annual hotel level expenses for our current portfolio by an aggregate $100 million to $150 million, which represents approximately 3% to 4% of pro forma 2019 hotel level expenses. 
Turning to our supply outlook. Although there has been little evidence of a material decline in supply so far, there is a historical pattern of supply rationalization after large demand shocks. 
When we look at the historical supply trajectory for the top 60 to 70 markets, rooms under construction in major markets fell by 68% 2 years after the peak of 2008 and were down 77% by mid-2011. We therefore expect supply will be mitigated over the long term with rooms under construction declining over time and likely bottoming at even lower levels than in the last recession, given the significantly greater degree of distress. 
In addition, we expect record levels of permanent hotel closures due to the unprecedented level of distress in the market. According to Trepp, the lodging delinquency rate has risen from 2.7% in April to 19% in May and has reached approximately 24% in June. Our analysis indicates that nearly 30% of upper-tier hotels in our top 20 markets are temporarily closed. 7 hotels in our top 20 markets are reported to have permanently closed already, and we expect more of the temporary closures to become permanent. 
To conclude, we have experienced 4 months of significant economic uncertainty as our nation locked down, began to reopen, flattened infection rates in certain markets and experienced sharp increases in others. Although we expect economic uncertainty to prevail until the health and safety risk posed by the pandemic are fully addressed, we are encouraged by the following. 
First, our operator's ability to adapt the operating model to record-low levels of demand by reducing our hotel level operating cost by 72%. Our goal is to make a portion of these cost reductions permanent and to achieve higher levels of profitability at lower levels of occupancy. 
Second is the resilience of lodging demand, which began to return as states and markets reopen and, as our booking trends indicated, would have been greater had infection rates continue to flatten rather than rise. Although there is some debate about the future of business travel as professionals grow accustomed to virtual meetings, we would note that U.S. occupancy has achieved higher peaks following the last 3 downturns, including 9/11 when many believed air travel would be permanently impacted. While speculating on long-term behavioral trends in the midst of the biggest global health and safety crisis in the century is likely to be unproductive, business transient and group business customers have a proven track record of choosing the effectiveness of in-person interactions despite the efficiency of videoconferencing technology. 
Finally, we are confident in the strategic advantages provided by our financial capacity to withstand prolonged business disruption. Host is differentiated in its potential to not only survive this crisis, but also to capitalize on future long-term value creation opportunities that meet our strategic objectives. We are excited to have entered a new cycle with the highest quality portfolio of iconic and irreplaceable hotels in the company's history and likely in the lodging industry. 
When demand recovers, we believe that the quality of our assets, many of which will be newly renovated, will be a true differentiator that will help us gain RevPAR index share and outperform the industry. We continue to believe in the strength of both geographic and demand diversity through the cycle. Geographic diversity will serve us through an uneven recovery as various states and markets recover differently while demand diversity will help us drive optimal revenue management and pricing through the cycle. 
My remarks would not be complete if I didn't mention how conversations about confronting systemic racism have reverberated throughout our society. Diversity, equality and inclusion remain at the forefront of our priorities and integral to our corporate values. I was proud to recently join the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion initiative. And as an organization, Host remains committed to fostering these values in our company and our communities. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Brian."

Good morning, everyone. Building on Jim's comments, the volatility in the second quarter was unprecedented as the demand landscape changed over the course of the quarter.

Building on Jim's comments, the volatility in the second quarter was unprecedented as the demand landscape changed over the course of the quarter. Although second quarter RevPAR declined by 93% year-over-year, it grew 133% from the depths of the crisis in April through the end of June when 10 of our hotels exceeded or were close to achieving breakeven EBITDA. 
For the quarter, we delivered a RevPAR of over $14 driven by average occupancy of 8.8% and an average room rate of approximately $162. Total RevPAR of approximately $23 benefited from $14 million of mostly COVID-related group cancellation and attrition revenues recognized in the second quarter compared to $10 million of similar revenues recognized in the first quarter. 
In the second half of this year, we do not expect to recognize any further cancellation and attrition revenues related to the pandemic as we continue to prioritize the rebooking of group business. Our second quarter results include a $45 million payment for health care benefits and special pay for the nearly 80% of hotel-level employees that have been furloughed. We have accrued $35 million for that expense in the first quarter. In the second quarter, we accrued an additional $32 million for similar payments that will be made in the third quarter. The decrease in the third quarter primarily reflects the reopening of several suspended properties since April. 
As Jim mentioned, we worked closely with our operators to reduce expenses and have realized a 72% decrease in second quarter hotel-level operating cost. Our wage and benefit expense during the quarter was approximately 81% lower, excluding onetime wage and benefit-related special costs. Our variable costs decreased 93% due to lower occupancy while our fixed costs, including fixed wage and benefits expenses, were approximately 50% lower. The decrease in fixed cost was driven by wage and benefits, above-property cost relief, utility expense and property-specific sales and marketing reductions that partially offset other fixed costs such as property tax and insurance. 
Although long-term costs associated with revised cleanliness protocols are yet to be fully determined, we believe the cost increase will be more than offset by productivity improvements. Our operators provided significant cost relief for above-property shared service and allocated costs, which are normally considered fixed. These costs include sales offices, rent -- revenue management, advertising, the program services fund at Marriott, centralized human resources, accounting, payroll as well as IT systems and support. These fixed costs saw unprecedented reductions with some allocated costs reduced by as much as 2/3. 
Overall, we reduced operating expenses by approximately 72% year-over-year at our low occupancy hotels and by approximately 75% at hotels with suspended operations. For the third quarter, we believe we will see continued cost containment for wages, benefits and variable expenses where cost reductions mirror reductions in overall volume. 
With regards to fixed costs, while the brands have not communicated above-property service cost target as yet, we expect utility and property-specific sales and marketing cost reductions to continue. Moreover, we would also expect the tax benefit we experienced in the second quarter to continue along the same trajectory. 
Moving to revenues. Portfolio-wide average occupancy declined by approximately 73 percentage points year-over-year to 8.8%, and our average daily room rate was down 35%, but still nearly $162. We have generally found that our operators are able to preserve and, in some cases, to even exceed rates versus the same time last year at properties that are in high demand on strong compression dates such as national holidays. 
For example, our Florida hotels delivered remarkable ADR growth of approximately 12% year-over-year with ADR for the month of June approximately $97 higher. Thus far, this downturn has distinguished itself by the fact that average rates decline are not driving occupancy to the extent that they normally would. Customers are more sensitive to cleanliness and sanitation standards than to room rates. We are hopeful that rate degradation will be less severe than in prior downturns and that branded hotels will benefit from having stringent cleanliness standards that should help gain customer trust and strong loyalty programs that should help drive demand. 
Shifting to market performance. Hotels in our drive-to leisure markets, which include Phoenix, San Antonio, San Diego, Florida Gulf, Miami and Jacksonville, were running a 1.8% occupancy at the beginning of the quarter and had progressed to 17.4% by the last week of June. Although the portfolio was in negative territory in the second quarter, markets with relatively better performance include Jacksonville, the Florida Gulf Coast, New York, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami and Atlanta. 
The Florida markets, excluding Orlando, benefited from leisure demand. The Ritz-Carlton, Amelia Island outperformed STR's upper-tier RevPAR in Jacksonville by 600 basis points while our Miami hotels outperformed their STR peers by 250 basis points of RevPAR. Our hotels in New York and L.A. benefited from medical-related business as well as the closure of hotels within those markets. It is estimated that 50% of New York hotel inventory is in suspended operations and that 20% of closed hotels in Manhattan may not reopen. In Atlanta, our hotels in the market benefited from short-term transient demand as well as crew contract business. Our worst-performing markets in the second quarter were Orlando, Boston, Maui/Oahu, New Orleans, Seattle, San Diego and San Francisco largely due to suspended operations at several of our hotels in those markets through much of the second quarter. 
Turning to CapEx. At the outset of the pandemic, we reduced our expected 2020 capital expenditures by approximately $100 million. And through the second quarter, we have completed almost 60% of the total CapEx spend we have planned for the year. We received $8 million of operating profit guarantees for the Marriott Transformational Capital Program year-to-date and expect to receive another $12 million over the second half of the year. 
As Jim mentioned, we successfully amended our revolving credit facility and term loans at the end of June. In the amendment, we accomplished 3 key objectives. First, we bought our portfolio time to make inroads into the recovery. We suspended the testing of financial covenants through the second quarter of 2021 and gained additional flexibility to accommodate our portfolio's recovery for 3 quarters following the covenant relief period. 
Second, we preserved our ability to capitalize on opportunistic value-enhancing investments during this period of extreme dislocation. Under the waiver, we have the ability to acquire $1.5 billion of assets using our existing liquidity while maintaining certain minimum liquidity requirements. We have the ability to issue equity without any requirement to repay debt. We have preserved the flexibility to use $750 million of net proceeds from asset sales for reinvestment purposes. 
And lastly, we preserved the flexibility to spend up to $500 million in ROI CapEx during the covenant waiver period. This provides us the ability to continue value-enhancing, repositioning development projects within the portfolio without experiencing revenue disruption as well as to continue the Marriott Transformational Capital Program, which benefits from operating profit guarantees. On behalf of the Host management team, I would like to thank the members of our bank group for their continued support. 
Looking forward for the rest of the year, we are not providing 2020 guidance at this time due to the continued lack of visibility on the depth and duration of this crisis, the timing of the reopening of individual states and localities and the expected operating restrictions for businesses as well as individual company travel restrictions. Once again, we would note that in prior recessions, peak-to-trough declines in hotel-level EBITDA have been roughly twice as large as the peak-to-trough declines in RevPAR. Although this 2:1 ratio should have deteriorated considerably in a near-0 revenue environment, we believe it will continue to hold true for our portfolio due to the significant success in reducing fixed costs at the property level. 
Today, more than ever, we believe that Host Hotels & Resorts is the premier lodging REIT in the industry. We have a high-quality, well-diversified portfolio whose consistent performance is driven by strong in-house analytics. And by working with the best operators in the business with the only investment-grade balance sheet among lodging REITs, no significant debt maturities until 2023 and approximately $2.5 billion of available liquidity as of June 30, we are well positioned to deal with this crisis and to continue to execute our strategic vision to create long-term value for our shareholders. Thank you. 
And with that, we will now be happy to take questions. [Operator Instructions]"

And if we don't see the situation improve, you can expect to see us cut back. 
With respect to potential acquisitions, although from a capital allocation perspective, we have the flexibility to invest in up to $1.5 billion of acquisitions with existing liquidity subject to maintaining $500 million of liquidity, I'll make a couple of comments with respect to that. Number one, there aren't many opportunities in the marketplace today. We expect to see investment opportunities the latter part of this year and into next year as special servicers and other lenders resolve issues with their borrowers. And in some instances, properties are going to come to market. 
In other instances, properties are going to be recapped. But it's the same thought process with respect to buying hotels at this point in time. We have to be comfortable that we're going to have the right amount of liquidity to ride through the crisis."

As we think about it, maybe we were looking at the potential performance in an optimistic way because of the forward bookings we saw for the fourth of July weekend, in particular. And I'll talk about 1 market that, from our perspective, was very meaningful and that is Miami Beach. We have the 1 Hotel South Beach. We opened that property in early June. We saw good forward bookings. And going into the fourth of July weekend, we expected occupancy in the 70%-plus range. It didn't materialize because the mayor shut the beaches, shut the bars. As we all know, there was a surge in cases in Florida. And we ended up running around 20% of occupancy. 
So I think there's good news and bad news in what happened there. The good news is that there is a lot of pent-up demand. And whenever the virus is under control, we fully anticipate that people are going to get back on the road and continue to want to travel and to have a good experience in a luxury property. Obviously, the bad news is there was a surge in cases, and there's nothing we can do about that. I mean we're all waiting as a nation to get the pandemic under control. And I think everyone is waiting for an effective vaccine or vaccines or a therapeutic to allow people to get back to business. 
So other markets continue to do well over the fourth of July. As an example, the Ritz -- 2 Ritz Carltons in Florida, the Ritz Naples and the Ritz Amelia Island both ran occupancies in the 60s and achieved ADRs of $600. Those rates were higher than same time last year. So again, we think if we hadn't seen the surge in cases in Florida that we would have done better than we did at those properties. So if I talk about seeing a deceleration, it's really based on our expectations."

Again, the positive is that our tentative business for 2021 is up 30% over the same time last year. So that just goes to prove that there is a lot of pent-up demand.

You sounded confident that you thought business travel would recover to previous levels and cited some historical information. But we've never really been stressed like this, and we've never had the technology that's been proven in such a way. So I'm just curious about your thoughts why we wouldn't see a 10% or 15% or 20% permanent impairment in business travel in the future. And the second thing is, are we seeing a long-term or permanent impairment in values of hotels in certain markets where the government reaction to COVID, the labor reaction to reopening might change investors' views?"
29574,677004616,2083736,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 31, 2020",2020-07-31,"Earnings Calls","Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Executives","Sure. So I'll take the second question first, Bill. I think it's too soon, really too soon to say what's going to happen to values over the long term. I mean everybody in the public space is trading at a significant discount to replacement cost today. I t",607,"Sure. So I'll take the second question first, Bill. I think it's too soon, really too soon to say what's going to happen to values over the long term. I mean everybody in the public space is trading at a significant discount to replacement cost today. I think that we are probably less than 50% of replacement costs. I mean we put some data on replacement costs in our investor presentation for everyone to see, and it's a very granular analysis that we provided. 
So some of the assets that are in the market today, at the height of the pandemic are trading at a 20% discount to where they were valued pre-COVID, where they were valued February 1. So I am confident that over time, as cash flows recover and as EBITDA recovers that values for the most part across the country will get back to pre-COVID levels and improve. I mean there are going to be some markets where I think it's going to be more challenging, quite frankly. And those are markets where you're still dealing with supply issues or you're dealing with high-cost structures. And those assets might have a bit of a challenge maintaining their value going forward. 
But for the most part, I think we're going to get back to where we were pre-COVID and grow from there. And I'll just point out the fact that we have a very strong geographically diversified portfolio, so -- with no more than 11% of our EBITDA coming out of any one market. So we are very well positioned regardless of what happens going forward. 
And your question with respect to business transient and whether or not business transient recovers to pre-COVID levels, I think that the technology has been helpful today. We're doing this earnings call in a couple of different locations. And it's certainly not ideal, and I know that we -- we would all prefer to be in the same place, but we're being careful and thoughtful about safety and health as everyone else is. But I, for one, and others are -- I think I'm ready to get on the road. I'm done with Zoom calls. I mean we have had, on average, 450 Zoom video meetings a week at Host for the last 6 or 7 weeks. So I think it's good to have Zoom today, but we do think that the personal interaction is key. 
Notwithstanding that, we have looked at what happens if business transient doesn't come back to pre-COVID-19 levels. And I think a good proxy is we certainly listen to the commentary that the airlines gave. United has a point of view that it's coming back fully. Delta had a point of view that it might be 20% impaired. So we looked at Delta's case of 20% down, and so what does that mean to us? What would we do with our portfolio, our existing portfolio today? And how could we remix the business? And what would the financial impact be? 
So we looked at really remixing that business transient drop of 20% to leisure. And at the end of the day, it has a de minimis impact on EBITDA. The impact really is on the EBITDA margin because of the business transient slice of the business is our highest-rated piece of business. So we're ready for whatever comes our way with respect to the recovery. And it's good to have the different levers to flex in our portfolio where we can take leisure or we can take more group and really revenue manage the company on an asset-by-asset basis on almost a daily basis."

Two really distinguishing factors and the best portfolio of iconic and irreplaceable hotels in the industry, which we think we have today. So as we think about building the portfolio out over time, we like -- we've talked about this.

And it's difficult enough for hotel owners that have well-heeled equity partners with them to work their way through this pandemic with literally no cash flow or minimal cash flow coming in. I think that, that issue is compounded by the individual Airbnb owners who have taken on a lot of debt unfortunately and nowhere to turn when it comes to servicing that debt.

We hope that all of you are staying safe and healthy during these extraordinary times. 
The lodging industry experienced a challenging second quarter with record RevPAR declines in April, followed by a slight improvement in lodging demand through May and June. Working with our operators, we responded swiftly to the changing demand landscape by reducing our second quarter hotel operating expenses by 72% year-over-year. As states and markets began to ease their lockdowns, our portfolio achieved over 100% hotel revenue growth from the lows of $24 million in April to $49 million in June. Toward the end of the second quarter, we successfully amended our credit agreement and achieved outstanding terms that preserve our liquidity and retain our flexibility to capitalize on value-enhancing investment opportunities. All in all, we emerged from the most challenging quarter on record for Host and the travel industry with significantly lower operating costs, greater balance sheet flexibility and access to $2.5 billion of liquidity. 
Starting with operations. Our second quarter expense reductions and revenue growth were driven by exceptionally agile asset management and the swift reaction of our world-class operators. As lodging demand plumbed to record lows in April, we worked with our operators to suspend operations at 35 hotels, reduced hotel fixed costs by approximately 50% and reduced overall hotel operating costs by 72% year-over-year. Cost savings were primarily driven by steep reductions in wage and benefit expenses and the fixed portion of above-property allocated costs as well as by suspending most brand standards and contributions to hotels FF&E reserve accounts. 
At operational hotels, our managers significantly scaled down operations by closing guestroom floors and meeting spaces. When leisure demand began improving through May and June, we swiftly pivoted to reopen hotels and worked with our operators to drive 380 basis points of average occupancy gains and a 50% increase in average room rates across the portfolio from April to June. As of yesterday, 64 of our 80 consolidated hotels, representing 78% of our total room count, were operational. 
We prioritized reopening 8 suspended hotels located in drive-to leisure markets, including Florida, San Diego, Phoenix, San Antonio and Orange County, as these markets captured leisure demand and delivered higher second quarter RevPAR than the rest of our portfolio. We currently expect another 6 hotels to reopen in August with operational rooms representing nearly 90% of our total room count by month end. As a reminder, we work with our operators to reopen a property when it's expected to sustain approximately 10% to 15% occupancy levels. At those levels, we expect incremental revenues to exceed the incremental cost of being operational, resulting in marginally lower EBITDA losses. Our preference is for hotels to remain operational rather than suspended because an operational property is capable of capturing spontaneous short-term demand and better positioned to attract future demand when the market begins to recover. 
All that said, we continually review our hotels' occupancy trends and won't hesitate to suspend our hotels' operations when the marginal benefit of remaining operational turns negative. For instance, we are currently reviewing the New York and San Francisco markets. New York has been slow to reopen with the recent pause on indoor dining and the cancellation of the 2020 United Nations General Assembly and New York Marathon events while San Francisco has enacted an onerous, costly and unnecessary operating ordinates. 
As we deliver both significant expense reductions and gradual revenue improvement, we've reduced our hotel level operating loss by nearly 50% from $73 million in April, $37 million in June. Our hotel level monthly operating loss averaged $54 million while above-property corporate-level monthly cash flows averaged $79 million in the second quarter with the latter reflecting a concentration of CapEx, which is expected to decrease by approximately $100 million in the second half of the year. We ended the second quarter with $2.5 billion of available liquidity, which includes $750 million of available capacity under the revolver portion of the credit facility as well as over $150 million of FF&E escrow reserves. 
Assuming operational performance remains at second quarter levels, we would expect approximately $100 million to $110 million of total monthly cash outflows, reflecting an average hotel level loss of approximately $50 million a month as well as estimated capital expenditures, interest payments and general corporate overhead. In this scenario, we would expect to end 2020 with approximately $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion of total available liquidity. If operational performance remains at second quarter 2020 levels beyond year-end, we would have ample liquidity until mid-2022, even with CapEx near 2020 levels subject to continued covenant waivers for our credit agreement. 
Moving on to our balance sheet. Our quarter-end leverage ratio, as defined in our credit facility, was at 4.6x; our interest coverage ratio was at 4.4x; and our fixed charge coverage ratio was at 2.7x, all of which were within the limits specified in our prior credit facility covenants. With the amended credit agreement in place, our quarterly tested financial covenants were waived beginning July 1, 2020, through the second quarter of 2021. We're testing to resume for the third quarter of 2021. 
Although the duration of this pandemic-induced crisis remains unknown, we continue to expect our liquidity position and balance sheet capacity to remain key comparative strengths that differentiate Host as one of the few lodging REITs that is less likely to need to issue equity expressly to delever its balance sheet. 
Shifting to business performance. We saw clear signs of a recovery in consumer demand through May and June as state and market lockdowns began to ease. Our booking pace indicated a solid pickup in June and the trend leading into the third quarter, but has since decelerated since daily infection rates in certain markets have spiked. 13 of our top 20 markets have regressed their reopening phases in the last 3 to 4 weeks while the other 7 remain in their existing phase. 
Needless to say, this trend has impacted our reopening plans. When Hawaii announced that on August 1, they would lift the 14-day quarantine requirement for travelers who test negative for COVID-19 up to 72 hours prior to arrival, the on-the-books occupancy for our Maui Resorts quickly reached mid-teens. We, therefore, expected to reopen the Andaz Maui and the Fairmont Kea Lani in August, but have now delayed our reopening plans as Hawaii has extended the quarantine through at least the end of August. 
Surprisingly, we saw some group business in the second quarter despite the absence of a vaccine or an effective therapeutic. Excluding New York, which benefit from COVID-19-related emergency services group business, traditional group business showed signs of improvement as it grew from 1,700 room nights sold in April to 12,855 sold in June. For the whole portfolio, business transient room nights grew 150% to 12,450 room nights in June after bottoming at 4,850 room nights in April. While business transient demand has primarily been driven by defense contractors, we have begun to see consulting-related business travel in July. Government transient room nights also improved from 650 room nights in April to 6,450 room nights in June. 
Finally, contract business held up relatively well in the second quarter with 43,000 contract room nights sold in the quarter. Our San Antonio hotels increased airline crew volume year-over-year while Newark Airport, Hyatt Place Waikiki and Grand Hyatt Buckhead all saw production improved throughout the quarter. As of June, our properties have 1.8 million rooms on the books for the full year 2020, down nearly 62% from 4.6 million group rooms same time last year. 
Our total group revenue pace is down 81% in the third quarter and 49% in the fourth quarter. And we continue to expect group cancellations in the second half of the year. We have rebooked approximately $120 million of canceled total group revenues with an additional $96 million in the pipeline that collectively represent nearly 21% of the total group revenue that canceled this year. We are also working with our operators to find creative ways to fill the demand gap with long-term group blocks from schools, sports associations and corporates. For example, Houston Airport Marriott received a large corporate group booking of 175 rooms per night from July to December in addition to another corporate group booking of 100 rooms per night on a month-to-month basis. The rooms are being used to quarantine COVID-19-negative employees for 14 days prior to international deployment. 
Looking at next year, we are experiencing a high single-digit deceleration in our total group revenue booking pace for 2021, as measured by definite revenues on the books, with most of the deficit concentrated in the first half of next year and minimal impact to the second half. Our tentative revenues, however, are tracking nearly 30% ahead of the same time last year, reflecting robust pent-up demand that's waiting for the current health and safety risk to subside. 
Our business outlook depends upon how quickly we, as a nation, can flatten the rate of new COVID-19 infections while we await a more effective solution, which we expect will take the form of a vaccine. In the interim, increasing consumers' confidence in our industry has never been more important. The major hotel brands have been proactive in creating, implementing and communicating new cleanliness and health and safety standards, including corporate requirements for face coverings to be worn with indoor -- within indoor public spaces. These safety protocols help address the risk of contagion and establish trust with consumers. Specifically at Marriott, long known for consistency and reliability, we expect their commitment to clean program to resonate with both business and leisure customers alike. Encouragingly, as a percentage of second quarter revenues, our direct sales through marriott.com increased 400 basis points over last year compared with sales through OTAs increasing by 200 basis points. 
As we have consistently said, Host benefits from our strong affiliation with world-class hotel brands. We continue to believe that beyond strong loyalty programs, brand trust and reliability will be differentiators that will help host outperform during the recovery. We remain deeply committed to redefining our operating model with the immediate goal of achieving breakeven as soon as possible and the longer-term goal of generating higher profitability at lower levels of occupancy. 
In the 2009 recession, several operating expense line items were significantly reduced and continued to improve through the cycle. Downturns compel owners and operators to reevaluate brand standards, programs and above-property expenses, an exercise that can result in long-term savings and a healthier hotel operating model that better serves customers' changing needs. 
To that end, we are working with our operators to deliver permanent cost savings at the hotel level through the following 3 key initiatives: first, to achieve a long-term reduction in the fixed component of above-property charges; second, to adopt productivity-enhancing technology, such as the use of mobile key; and third, to drive efficiencies through the cross utilization of management functions. 
While achieving these long-term permanent cost savings is conditional upon reaching an agreement with our operators, we have analyzed the potential benefit they could have on our operating model. Based on 2019 revenues, we believe these measures have the potential to reduce annual hotel level expenses for our current portfolio by an aggregate $100 million to $150 million, which represents approximately 3% to 4% of pro forma 2019 hotel level expenses. 
Turning to our supply outlook. Although there has been little evidence of a material decline in supply so far, there is a historical pattern of supply rationalization after large demand shocks. 
When we look at the historical supply trajectory for the top 60 to 70 markets, rooms under construction in major markets fell by 68% 2 years after the peak of 2008 and were down 77% by mid-2011. We therefore expect supply will be mitigated over the long term with rooms under construction declining over time and likely bottoming at even lower levels than in the last recession, given the significantly greater degree of distress. 
In addition, we expect record levels of permanent hotel closures due to the unprecedented level of distress in the market. According to Trepp, the lodging delinquency rate has risen from 2.7% in April to 19% in May and has reached approximately 24% in June. Our analysis indicates that nearly 30% of upper-tier hotels in our top 20 markets are temporarily closed. 7 hotels in our top 20 markets are reported to have permanently closed already, and we expect more of the temporary closures to become permanent. 
To conclude, we have experienced 4 months of significant economic uncertainty as our nation locked down, began to reopen, flattened infection rates in certain markets and experienced sharp increases in others. Although we expect economic uncertainty to prevail until the health and safety risk posed by the pandemic are fully addressed, we are encouraged by the following. 
First, our operator's ability to adapt the operating model to record-low levels of demand by reducing our hotel level operating cost by 72%. Our goal is to make a portion of these cost reductions permanent and to achieve higher levels of profitability at lower levels of occupancy. 
Second is the resilience of lodging demand, which began to return as states and markets reopen and, as our booking trends indicated, would have been greater had infection rates continue to flatten rather than rise. Although there is some debate about the future of business travel as professionals grow accustomed to virtual meetings, we would note that U.S. occupancy has achieved higher peaks following the last 3 downturns, including 9/11 when many believed air travel would be permanently impacted. While speculating on long-term behavioral trends in the midst of the biggest global health and safety crisis in the century is likely to be unproductive, business transient and group business customers have a proven track record of choosing the effectiveness of in-person interactions despite the efficiency of videoconferencing technology. 
Finally, we are confident in the strategic advantages provided by our financial capacity to withstand prolonged business disruption. Host is differentiated in its potential to not only survive this crisis, but also to capitalize on future long-term value creation opportunities that meet our strategic objectives. We are excited to have entered a new cycle with the highest quality portfolio of iconic and irreplaceable hotels in the company's history and likely in the lodging industry. 
When demand recovers, we believe that the quality of our assets, many of which will be newly renovated, will be a true differentiator that will help us gain RevPAR index share and outperform the industry. We continue to believe in the strength of both geographic and demand diversity through the cycle. Geographic diversity will serve us through an uneven recovery as various states and markets recover differently while demand diversity will help us drive optimal revenue management and pricing through the cycle. 
My remarks would not be complete if I didn't mention how conversations about confronting systemic racism have reverberated throughout our society. Diversity, equality and inclusion remain at the forefront of our priorities and integral to our corporate values. I was proud to recently join the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion initiative. And as an organization, Host remains committed to fostering these values in our company and our communities. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Brian."

Good morning, everyone. Building on Jim's comments, the volatility in the second quarter was unprecedented as the demand landscape changed over the course of the quarter.

Building on Jim's comments, the volatility in the second quarter was unprecedented as the demand landscape changed over the course of the quarter. Although second quarter RevPAR declined by 93% year-over-year, it grew 133% from the depths of the crisis in April through the end of June when 10 of our hotels exceeded or were close to achieving breakeven EBITDA. 
For the quarter, we delivered a RevPAR of over $14 driven by average occupancy of 8.8% and an average room rate of approximately $162. Total RevPAR of approximately $23 benefited from $14 million of mostly COVID-related group cancellation and attrition revenues recognized in the second quarter compared to $10 million of similar revenues recognized in the first quarter. 
In the second half of this year, we do not expect to recognize any further cancellation and attrition revenues related to the pandemic as we continue to prioritize the rebooking of group business. Our second quarter results include a $45 million payment for health care benefits and special pay for the nearly 80% of hotel-level employees that have been furloughed. We have accrued $35 million for that expense in the first quarter. In the second quarter, we accrued an additional $32 million for similar payments that will be made in the third quarter. The decrease in the third quarter primarily reflects the reopening of several suspended properties since April. 
As Jim mentioned, we worked closely with our operators to reduce expenses and have realized a 72% decrease in second quarter hotel-level operating cost. Our wage and benefit expense during the quarter was approximately 81% lower, excluding onetime wage and benefit-related special costs. Our variable costs decreased 93% due to lower occupancy while our fixed costs, including fixed wage and benefits expenses, were approximately 50% lower. The decrease in fixed cost was driven by wage and benefits, above-property cost relief, utility expense and property-specific sales and marketing reductions that partially offset other fixed costs such as property tax and insurance. 
Although long-term costs associated with revised cleanliness protocols are yet to be fully determined, we believe the cost increase will be more than offset by productivity improvements. Our operators provided significant cost relief for above-property shared service and allocated costs, which are normally considered fixed. These costs include sales offices, rent -- revenue management, advertising, the program services fund at Marriott, centralized human resources, accounting, payroll as well as IT systems and support. These fixed costs saw unprecedented reductions with some allocated costs reduced by as much as 2/3. 
Overall, we reduced operating expenses by approximately 72% year-over-year at our low occupancy hotels and by approximately 75% at hotels with suspended operations. For the third quarter, we believe we will see continued cost containment for wages, benefits and variable expenses where cost reductions mirror reductions in overall volume. 
With regards to fixed costs, while the brands have not communicated above-property service cost target as yet, we expect utility and property-specific sales and marketing cost reductions to continue. Moreover, we would also expect the tax benefit we experienced in the second quarter to continue along the same trajectory. 
Moving to revenues. Portfolio-wide average occupancy declined by approximately 73 percentage points year-over-year to 8.8%, and our average daily room rate was down 35%, but still nearly $162. We have generally found that our operators are able to preserve and, in some cases, to even exceed rates versus the same time last year at properties that are in high demand on strong compression dates such as national holidays. 
For example, our Florida hotels delivered remarkable ADR growth of approximately 12% year-over-year with ADR for the month of June approximately $97 higher. Thus far, this downturn has distinguished itself by the fact that average rates decline are not driving occupancy to the extent that they normally would. Customers are more sensitive to cleanliness and sanitation standards than to room rates. We are hopeful that rate degradation will be less severe than in prior downturns and that branded hotels will benefit from having stringent cleanliness standards that should help gain customer trust and strong loyalty programs that should help drive demand. 
Shifting to market performance. Hotels in our drive-to leisure markets, which include Phoenix, San Antonio, San Diego, Florida Gulf, Miami and Jacksonville, were running a 1.8% occupancy at the beginning of the quarter and had progressed to 17.4% by the last week of June. Although the portfolio was in negative territory in the second quarter, markets with relatively better performance include Jacksonville, the Florida Gulf Coast, New York, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami and Atlanta. 
The Florida markets, excluding Orlando, benefited from leisure demand. The Ritz-Carlton, Amelia Island outperformed STR's upper-tier RevPAR in Jacksonville by 600 basis points while our Miami hotels outperformed their STR peers by 250 basis points of RevPAR. Our hotels in New York and L.A. benefited from medical-related business as well as the closure of hotels within those markets. It is estimated that 50% of New York hotel inventory is in suspended operations and that 20% of closed hotels in Manhattan may not reopen. In Atlanta, our hotels in the market benefited from short-term transient demand as well as crew contract business. Our worst-performing markets in the second quarter were Orlando, Boston, Maui/Oahu, New Orleans, Seattle, San Diego and San Francisco largely due to suspended operations at several of our hotels in those markets through much of the second quarter. 
Turning to CapEx. At the outset of the pandemic, we reduced our expected 2020 capital expenditures by approximately $100 million. And through the second quarter, we have completed almost 60% of the total CapEx spend we have planned for the year. We received $8 million of operating profit guarantees for the Marriott Transformational Capital Program year-to-date and expect to receive another $12 million over the second half of the year. 
As Jim mentioned, we successfully amended our revolving credit facility and term loans at the end of June. In the amendment, we accomplished 3 key objectives. First, we bought our portfolio time to make inroads into the recovery. We suspended the testing of financial covenants through the second quarter of 2021 and gained additional flexibility to accommodate our portfolio's recovery for 3 quarters following the covenant relief period. 
Second, we preserved our ability to capitalize on opportunistic value-enhancing investments during this period of extreme dislocation. Under the waiver, we have the ability to acquire $1.5 billion of assets using our existing liquidity while maintaining certain minimum liquidity requirements. We have the ability to issue equity without any requirement to repay debt. We have preserved the flexibility to use $750 million of net proceeds from asset sales for reinvestment purposes. 
And lastly, we preserved the flexibility to spend up to $500 million in ROI CapEx during the covenant waiver period. This provides us the ability to continue value-enhancing, repositioning development projects within the portfolio without experiencing revenue disruption as well as to continue the Marriott Transformational Capital Program, which benefits from operating profit guarantees. On behalf of the Host management team, I would like to thank the members of our bank group for their continued support. 
Looking forward for the rest of the year, we are not providing 2020 guidance at this time due to the continued lack of visibility on the depth and duration of this crisis, the timing of the reopening of individual states and localities and the expected operating restrictions for businesses as well as individual company travel restrictions. Once again, we would note that in prior recessions, peak-to-trough declines in hotel-level EBITDA have been roughly twice as large as the peak-to-trough declines in RevPAR. Although this 2:1 ratio should have deteriorated considerably in a near-0 revenue environment, we believe it will continue to hold true for our portfolio due to the significant success in reducing fixed costs at the property level. 
Today, more than ever, we believe that Host Hotels & Resorts is the premier lodging REIT in the industry. We have a high-quality, well-diversified portfolio whose consistent performance is driven by strong in-house analytics. And by working with the best operators in the business with the only investment-grade balance sheet among lodging REITs, no significant debt maturities until 2023 and approximately $2.5 billion of available liquidity as of June 30, we are well positioned to deal with this crisis and to continue to execute our strategic vision to create long-term value for our shareholders. Thank you.

So I would tell you that they are very receptive. I think you're going to see, and you've already seen it at Hilton as an example, a meaningful reduction in their corporate headquarters staff. I think you're likely to see it unfortunately at the other brands as well. And those functions, in many instances, relate to the shared services that are above property.

As we think about it, maybe we were looking at the potential performance in an optimistic way because of the forward bookings we saw for the fourth of July weekend, in particular. And I'll talk about 1 market that, from our perspective, was very meaningful and that is Miami Beach. We have the 1 Hotel South Beach. We opened that property in early June. We saw good forward bookings. And going into the fourth of July weekend, we expected occupancy in the 70%-plus range. It didn't materialize because the mayor shut the beaches, shut the bars. As we all know, there was a surge in cases in Florida. And we ended up running around 20% of occupancy. 
So I think there's good news and bad news in what happened there. The good news is that there is a lot of pent-up demand. And whenever the virus is under control, we fully anticipate that people are going to get back on the road and continue to want to travel and to have a good experience in a luxury property. Obviously, the bad news is there was a surge in cases, and there's nothing we can do about that. I mean we're all waiting as a nation to get the pandemic under control. And I think everyone is waiting for an effective vaccine or vaccines or a therapeutic to allow people to get back to business. 
So other markets continue to do well over the fourth of July. As an example, the Ritz -- 2 Ritz Carltons in Florida, the Ritz Naples and the Ritz Amelia Island both ran occupancies in the 60s and achieved ADRs of $600. Those rates were higher than same time last year. So again, we think if we hadn't seen the surge in cases in Florida that we would have done better than we did at those properties. So if I talk about seeing a deceleration, it's really based on our expectations."

We all hope it's going to show up. We all hope by then that we are going to have a vaccine and/or a therapeutic, and we'll continue to see groups want to get back into the hotels and have their meetings. Again, the positive is that our tentative business for 2021 is up 30% over the same time last year. So that just goes to prove that there is a lot of pent-up demand. And we are fully confident that the group will recover. We've always said that the way this recovery was going to play out was with drive-to leisure transient first, with business transit second and which group last. And I think that's exactly how things are playing out."

You sounded confident that you thought business travel would recover to previous levels and cited some historical information. But we've never really been stressed like this, and we've never had the technology that's been proven in such a way. So I'm just curious about your thoughts why we wouldn't see a 10% or 15% or 20% permanent impairment in business travel in the future. And the second thing is, are we seeing a long-term or permanent impairment in values of hotels in certain markets where the government reaction to COVID, the labor reaction to reopening might change investors' views?"

So I'll take the second question first, Bill. I think it's too soon, really too soon to say what's going to happen to values over the long term. I mean everybody in the public space is trading at a significant discount to replacement cost today. I t",607,"Sure. So I'll take the second question first, Bill. I think it's too soon, really too soon to say what's going to happen to values over the long term. I mean everybody in the public space is trading at a significant discount to replacement cost today. I think that we are probably less than 50% of replacement costs. I mean we put some data on replacement costs in our investor presentation for everyone to see, and it's a very granular analysis that we provided. 
So some of the assets that are in the market today, at the height of the pandemic are trading at a 20% discount to where they were valued pre-COVID, where they were valued February 1. So I am confident that over time, as cash flows recover and as EBITDA recovers that values for the most part across the country will get back to pre-COVID levels and improve. I mean there are going to be some markets where I think it's going to be more challenging, quite frankly. And those are markets where you're still dealing with supply issues or you're dealing with high-cost structures. And those assets might have a bit of a challenge maintaining their value going forward. 
But for the most part, I think we're going to get back to where we were pre-COVID and grow from there. And I'll just point out the fact that we have a very strong geographically diversified portfolio, so -- with no more than 11% of our EBITDA coming out of any one market. So we are very well positioned regardless of what happens going forward. 
And your question with respect to business transient and whether or not business transient recovers to pre-COVID levels, I think that the technology has been helpful today. We're doing this earnings call in a couple of different locations. And it's certainly not ideal, and I know that we -- we would all prefer to be in the same place, but we're being careful and thoughtful about safety and health as everyone else is. But I, for one, and others are -- I think I'm ready to get on the road. I'm done with Zoom calls. I mean we have had, on average, 450 Zoom video meetings a week at Host for the last 6 or 7 weeks. So I think it's good to have Zoom today, but we do think that the personal interaction is key. 
Notwithstanding that, we have looked at what happens if business transient doesn't come back to pre-COVID-19 levels. And I think a good proxy is we certainly listen to the commentary that the airlines gave. United has a point of view that it's coming back fully. Delta had a point of view that it might be 20% impaired. So we looked at Delta's case of 20% down, and so what does that mean to us? What would we do with our portfolio, our existing portfolio today? And how could we remix the business? And what would the financial impact be? 
So we looked at really remixing that business transient drop of 20% to leisure. And at the end of the day, it has a de minimis impact on EBITDA. The impact really is on the EBITDA margin because of the business transient slice of the business is our highest-rated piece of business. So we're ready for whatever comes our way with respect to the recovery. And it's good to have the different levers to flex in our portfolio where we can take leisure or we can take more group and really revenue manage the company on an asset-by-asset basis on almost a daily basis."

Two really distinguishing factors and the best portfolio of iconic and irreplaceable hotels in the industry, which we think we have today. So as we think about building the portfolio out over time, we like -- we've talked about this. We like the model that we have with a strong geographic diversification with a business mix differentiation in the hotel between a combination of leisure transient, business transient and group. So multiple demand generators in strong markets with high barriers to entry. And that's how we would think about building the company over the next 3 to 5 years."

As the same thing that we've talked about, people want to get out, and they have been driving to Airbnbs and leisure -- and drive-to leisure markets. Our point of view is as we start recovering and markets start opening up, the urban markets, in particular, that are going to be more challenged, we think that the short-term rental business, some of the other platforms that are out there -- that were out there, I don't quite know what's going on with them, but Lyric and Sonder and some of those as well as Airbnb are going to face serious financial difficulties. 
And it's difficult enough for hotel owners that have well-heeled equity partners with them to work their way through this pandemic with literally no cash flow or minimal cash flow coming in. I think that, that issue is compounded by the individual Airbnb owners who have taken on a lot of debt unfortunately and nowhere to turn when it comes to servicing that debt. So I think you're going to see in the urban markets, in particular, a recalibration of alternative accommodations."

Although third quarter and October RevPAR remained more than 80% lower year-over-year, third quarter revenues grew over 90% quarter-over-quarter as our operators maximize their efforts to access all potential sources of hotel demand, which continues to gradually increase. Second, we have reduced our third quarter hotel level operating loss by approximately 40% from second quarter levels, including the benefit of a $23 million employee retention credit. 
Based on third quarter results and excluding the employee retention credit benefit, we have reduced our monthly ongoing hotel level operating loss by approximately 25% on average compared to the second quarter. Our sequential revenue growth has flowed through to our bottom line as our operators have continued to do an outstanding job of minimizing expenses. 
Finally, we have further strengthened our robust liquidity by raising over $600 million of capital through opportunistic asset sales and debt refinancing and repayments. As a result, if fourth quarter operations are commensurate with the third quarter, we expect to end the year with approximately $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion of total available liquidity, including cash and FF&E reserves, with no debt maturity until 2023. 
As we enter the ninth month of the pandemic with daily COVID-19 case count in the United States in their all-time highs, we continue to believe that the demand recovery will remain gradual and choppy before the widespread availability of effect COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. Therefore, our key near-term priorities remain: number one, working with our operators to continue to access all potential sources of demand; number two, minimizing expenses and reducing hotel cash burn; and number three, maximizing liquidity. 
We are equally focused on our longer-term objectives of structurally redefining our operating model, positioning our portfolio to gain RevPAR index share and capitalizing on opportunistic investments to create long-term value for our stockholders. Let me walk you through our progress on these near and long-term objectives before handing the call over to Sourav to explain our third quarter operating performance. 
Beginning with demand, although occupancy continues to be driven by leisure travelers, our hotels are also capturing short-term group airline crew and small but steady business transient volumes. We booked 127,000 group nights in third quarter and delivered 8,000 more room nights than the second quarter, if you exclude New York, which accounted for the majority of group room nights in the second quarter due to medical and first responder business. 
Excluding New York, group rooms increased progressively throughout the quarter from 19,000 in July to 40,000 in August and 49,000 in September, primarily driven by corporate and SMURF events. 9 of our hotels booked sports-related group locks, for Major League baseball and NFL teams to ESPN and other sports media, with a notable 800 rooms book at Hyatt Regency San Francisco Berlin Game for the PGA championship in August. 
In addition, the Andaz Maui was partially bought out by a film production unit, which generated over 8,000 total room nights across September and October, 2 months when regular hotel operations were temporarily suspended. With robust safety protocols in place, including testing attendees upon arrival and employees on a daily basis, the ANDAs generated a little over $1.7 million of incremental hotel level EBITDA from this business. 
While our operators are striving to access all potential sources of hotel demand, they remain focused on working with meeting planners to restore confidence in traditional group meetings and events. In October, the Orlando World Center Marriott hosted this year's Connect 2020 Conference, with more than 1,000 in-person attendees at our hotel and 175 virtual attendees at home. Every detail was meticulously designed for safety, as the trade show was spread across our 39,000 square foot crystal ballroom with widely spaced boosts and so the large groups of attendees were able to socially distance safely. 
Attendees complied with the hotel's mass mandate and plenty of mass were available on site. The property was able to complement the in-person event with virtual suppliers and a digital trade show that occurred simultaneously. We believe this hybrid meeting format will augment in-person demand, and Marriott plans to host 4 global hybrid meeting events starting on November 9 at our Ritz-Carlton Tysons Corner. 
While such events help publicize the fact that meetings can take place safely, despite the complexities posed by the pandemic, restrictions on large group gatherings remain in place for most states and local jurisdictions, and nearly all conventions and city wides have been canceled through the first quarter of next year. We remain optimistic about group business on a medium to long-term basis due to encouraging group booking patterns. Rebookings as a percentage of cancellations continue to increase with approximately 16% of group book business that was canceled in 2020 now rebooked into future years, up from 11.6% in the second quarter. 
Moreover, group cancellations for 2021 remain concentrated through April, with groups that are scheduled for the second half of next year holding fairly steady. In the third quarter, we booked a net 81,000 group rooms for the second half of 2021, driven by San Francisco, San Jose, Orlando, New York and the D.C. Metro region. 
We have 2.2 million definite rooms on the books for 2021, which on a full year basis, is 31.5% lower than the same time last year, and on a second half basis is 7.7% lower. For context, we had approximately 3.2 million definite rooms on the books for full year 2020 at the same time last year. 
Finally, our operators achieved a robust sequential increase in 2,022 to 2,024 group bookings. We booked nearly 100,000 more room nights for these out years in the third quarter than we did in the second quarter, with room night activity down only 13% to the same time last year. Importantly, for these out years, ADR is only 80 basis points lower than the same time last year in contrast to the deep discounting that prevailed in the aftermath of 9/11 and the great financial crisis. 
Moving on to business transient. Demand remains minimal but has improved from 11,000 room nights in July to 13,000 in August and 14,000 in September. A variety of industries are driving demand, including health care, consulting, technology and financial and business services with no particular standouts. In general, both group and business transient demand is being driven by smaller organizations rather than by the large corporate accounts. We continue to believe that business travel will recover in line with the broader economic recovery because of the ROI it generates for businesses. 
For every dollar spent on business travel, there is a $10 return in revenue and a $3 return in profit according to a 2013 analysis by U.S. Travel and Oxford Economics, which statistically modeled 14 industries over 18 years. Moreover, travel makes up only 1% of total U.S. corporate sales and roughly 2% of operating expenses according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, making travel cuts less impactful to long-term profitability than is commonly perceived. 
Turning to contract revenues, although TSA passenger volumes have slowed recently, they grew steadily during the third quarter as airlines continue to add more destinations. Our operators drove additional crew business to our hotels, resulting in 31,000 more contract rooms in the third quarter compared to the second quarter, a 71% sequential increase. 
And finally, leisure demand, which relatively outperformed other types of demand through the summer, has held up better than historically does post Labor Day. As lines between work, school and home remain blurred, our operators have created new offerings to appeal to consumers looking to escape at home. Hyatt introduced the work from Hyatt Package and Marriott  launched the work anywhere with Marriott Bonvoy package. The packages facilitate working productively from a hotel for the day, a short stay or an extended resort or cation. Another example of our operators innovating to access all potential sources of demand. 
Moving on to cash burn. Our hotel level operating loss averaged $40 million a month in the third quarter, not including the employee retentioning credit received under the CARES Act. That's $10 million per month lower than the monthly cash burn scenario we outlined on our second quarter call and approximately half the worst-case scenario of $70 million to $80 million that we discussed in May. 
Our third quarter hotel level cash expenses less the employee retention credit increased by 19% on a revenue increase of over 90% compared to the second quarter. Our operators have demonstrated their commitment to achieving hotel level breakeven as soon as possible by continuing to minimize costs and add back expenses only as necessary to service business levels at the current low occupancy rate. 
Assuming operational performance remains at third quarter levels, we would expect approximately $95 million to $105 million of total monthly cash outflows, reflecting an average hotel level loss of approximately $40 million a month as well as estimated CapEx, interest payments and general corporate overhead. 
Above property, corporate level monthly cash flows will be sequentially higher in the fourth quarter due to the timing of CapEx and interest payments. So Rob will provide greater details on our near-term cash burn trajectory in his prepared remarks. Moving to our final near-term objective of maximizing liquidity, we raised over $600 million of capital through opportunistic asset sales and debt refinancing since our last earnings call. 
We sold the 532 room Newport Beach Marriott Hotel & Spa for $260 million, which exceeds our pre-COVID internal hold value for this asset. Moreover, we reduced our future CapEx commitments with the sale of this hotel, including $19 million of contractually required owner funded CapEx for the Marriott transformational capital program and associated systems renovations. 
This was an opportunistic sale at pre-COVID pricing to a buyer who has strategic reasons to own the asset. We are pleased to have achieved a total CapEx adjusted valuation of 13.8x 2019 EBITDA and a 6.8% cap rate based on 2019 NOI and to have further enhanced our liquidity and reduced our near-term capital spending requirements. 
Moreover, there will be no incremental redistribution requirement imposed by the tax gain generated by the sale of the Newport Beach Marriott due to a combination of the first quarter, common cash dividend was paid in April 2020 and the anticipated net operating tax loss to be incurred by hosting in 2020 also. We also completed the second closing on the sale of development land at the Phoenician, bringing our total land sales at that asset to approximately $83 million this year. 
As we have discussed in the past, the sale of this land wasn't in our underwriting when we acquired the hotel in 2015. However, it was a part of our vision to unlock the tremendous value we saw in the Phoenician. We are pleased to have executed an incredibly complex rezoning entitlement process by solving multiple technical issues. And so doing, we have successfully monetized approximately 38 acres of nonincome-producing land and created value for our stockholders, while retaining an additional 21.5 acres of land to create further value through a combination of future sales or resort expansion. 
The buyer plans to build approximately 165 luxury condominium units, 85 single-family homes and 30 villas on these parcels. And residents will have the option to purchase an amenity program with the pension to access resort amenities and other services. We anticipate that this build in demand will help drive food and beverage, spa and golf revenues at the resort. 
To conclude on our near-term objectives, we further enhanced our liquidity position by issuing a total of $750 million of Series I senior notes in 2 substantially oversubscribed tranches, resulting in an attractive coupon of 3.5% and a re-offer yield of 3.6% to 3.7%. In conjunction with our Series I issuance, we completed a tender offer of our 4.75% Series C senior notes due 2023, with an approximately 81% participation rate. 
As a result, we further augmented our cash position by $343 million, while extending our average debt maturity and maintaining our weighted average interest rate. Shifting to our longer-term objectives. We are working with our operators to redefine our operating model. Cash utilization of management functions and a reduction in the fixed component of above property charges are 2 of the biggest contributors to our long-term cost savings target of $100 million to $150 million, which is based on 2019 revenues and represents approximately 3% to 4% of pro forma 2019 hotel level expenses. 
To date, our operators have made solid progress on both of these priorities as they restructure their workforce and their above property shared services for sales, marketing, revenue management and it. We remain deeply committed to working with our operators to create long-term efficiencies that will allow us to generate greater profitability at lower levels of occupancy. A more profitable operating model will not only make for a faster recovery to 2019 EBITDA levels, but it will also improve the long-term value of our assets. 
Now turning to investments. Let me begin with our capital investment plans for the portfolio. We believe our ability to continue to invest in our portfolio as a unique competitive advantage that will positively influence our relative performance and our growth trajectory throughout this lodging cycle. Although we have cut our 2020 maintenance CapEx budget by nearly 40%, we continue to invest in the Marriott transformational capital program as well as in other ROI projects. 
On a combined basis, these represent nearly 70% of our 2020 capital spend. Moreover, nearly 70% of our investment in the Marriott program will be complete by year-end 2020, and the entire program will be substantially completed by year-end 2022. As a result, we expect to gain RevPAR index share during the heart of the recovery. First, as we outperformed the competition that is unable to invest this year and next; and second, as we maintain our RevPAR index share gains when competitors disrupt their operations to renovate assets later in the cycle, with 2022 likely being the first year that many will be able to meaningfully invest in their portfolios. 
The Coronado Island Marriott Resort & Spa, for example, completed its transformational program renovations last year and has improved its RevPAR index share by 9.8 points through August this year compared with the same period in 2018. This is nearly 3x the program's expectations of 3 to 4 points of index share gains. It has also outperformed the San Diego downtown upper upscale submarket by 16 points year-to-date, implying over $2 million in incremental room revenues. 
Moving on to acquisition opportunities and the transaction markets, a record 26% of CMBS hotel loans were in special servicing in September 2020 compared with 1.9% in December 2019, and  70% of hotel loans are either in special servicing or on special servicing watch list according to Trepp Research. Delinquency rates are expected to move higher as forbearance agreements start to roll off. 
Additionally, some hotel owners who were hoping for a speedy recovery may not be able to sustain the cash outflows required to service their and may decide to throw in the tile. So although we don't see high-quality assets trading at this time, we continue to focus on opportunities where we can leverage our competitive advantages, such as deep owner, broker and operator relationships and our ability to do large transactions. 
Our reputation for providing speed and certainty of closing and ability to offer tax-advantaged structures to sellers are additional distinguishing factors. To conclude, our near-term objectives aim to lower our cash burn and maximize our liquidity, while our longer-term objectives are designed to drive faster EBITDA recovery by structurally improving margins, gaining market share and acquiring assets. With $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion of expected total available liquidity at year-end, we believe we have the ability to withstand prolonged business disruption and capitalize on opportunities for growth. 
We entered this crisis as one of the lodging REITs with the lowest leverage and greatest balance sheet capacity and believe these remain key attributes that are necessary to create meaningful long-term value in this new lodging cycle. With that, I will turn the call over to Sourav."
29574,691091431,2130743,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2020",2020-11-05,"Earnings Calls","Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Building on Jim's comments, our third quarter top line performance improved from the historic lows recorded in the second quarter. RevPAR for the third quarter declined by 84.1% year-over-year compared with a 93",1563,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Building on Jim's comments, our third quarter top line performance improved from the historic lows recorded in the second quarter. RevPAR for the third quarter declined by 84.1% year-over-year compared with a 93% year-over-year decline in the second quarter. Year-over-year occupancy and ADR declines, both improved on a sequential basis, as we reopened 20 hotels in the third quarter and summer leisure travel bolstered overall hotel demand. 
Compared to STR data for U.S. upper tier hotels in our top markets, our total portfolio's ADR declines were 150 basis points better than the industries. We outperformed on average occupancy in 11 of our top markets in the third quarter. However, our overall occupancy declines were 370 basis points greater than STR, primarily because our portfolio has more hotels in prime downtown locations than the industry does. 
Notably, our RevPAR was in line or better than the industries in our resort oriented markets such as Jacksonville, Florida Gulf Coast, Miami, Phoenix and Hawaii as well as in Northern Virginia and New York, where we benefited from crew business and corporate room blocks. Our operators continue to be able to preserve and, in some cases, to even exceed rates versus the same time last year at properties that are high in demand, especially on strong compression dates such as national holidays. 
For example, our Florida Coastal Resorts delivered 22% year-over-year ADR growth in September. In general, rate doesn't appear to be driving occupancy to the extent it normally would in a downturn. Customers are more sensitive to cleanliness and sanitization standards room rates. We, therefore, remain hopeful that rate degregation will be less severe than in prior turns and that branded hotels will benefit from having stringent cleanliness standards to help gain custom trust and strong loyalty programs to help drive demand. 
Shifting to non rooms revenues. Third quarter food and beverage revenues on a pro forma basis declined by approximately 90% year-over-year due to a 96.5% reduction in banquet and AV revenue and an 81% reduction in outlet revenue. At our open resort properties, however, outlet revenues per occupied room were nearly 28% higher year-over-year, as leisure transient guests continue to dine on property during their stay. 
While other revenues included approximately $10 million of group and attrition and cancellation fees, we do not expect to recognize material cancellation and attrition revenues related to the pandemic going forward as we continue to prioritize the rebooking of group business. Preliminary top line numbers for October reflect a gradual but steady month-over-month improvement, with October RevPAR at approximately $37 compared to September RevPAR of $34.64, driven by 20.7% occupancy and an approximately $179 ADR.  Year-over-year RevPAR declined by approximately 82% and was almost the same as the year-over-year RevPAR decline reported in September. 
Looking at November, we expect top line performance to be negatively impacted by the election this week, but are hopeful that demand will gradually improve around the holidays. Although visibility remains limited as the length of the booking window remains extremely short, our portfolio is generally well positioned to capture short-lead time demand as we now have 75 of 79 hotels representing 94% of our total room count open. 
Speaking of reopenings, let me provide you with a brief update on Hawaii, which reopened to tourists on October 15. Travelers who get  a COVID-19  test, no more than 72 hours before departure and show proof of a negative test upon arrival are now exempt from the mandatory 14-day quarantine role. Multiple airlines and airports are now offering rapid COVID-19 testing for Hawaii-bound passengers, thereby enabling a gradual return of tourists to the islands. 
For November, occupancy on the books is currently ranging between 20% to 35% across our 4 properties in Maui and Oahu. Moreover, the November through January transient ADR pace for our hotels in Hawaii is up 3.8% year-over-year. 
Moving on to expenses. We worked with our operators to reduce third quarter hotel operating costs by over 65% year-over-year, excluding the $43 million of severance paid in the quarter. Although our operators recorded a $23 million reduction in expenses related to the employee retention credit received in the third quarter, this benefit was more than offset by $31 million of health care benefits paid to furloughed employees. 
As a reminder, we accrued $32 million for that expense in the second quarter. In the third quarter, we accrued an additional $26 million for similar payments that will be made in the fourth quarter. As previously disclosed, we expect to incur another $16 million to $26 million of severance expense in the fourth quarter as our operators continue to reevaluate the workforce structure and implement changes that are expected to lead to a more efficient operating model in the long term. We have worked closely with our operators to minimize expenses in the third quarter, despite a reopening more hotels and achieving greater level of occupancy. 
Fixed costs declined 46% year-over-year, excluding the employee retention credit, which is remarkable when you consider that a significant portion of the remaining fixed expenses consist of property taxes and insurance. The quarter-over-quarter increase in the fixed cost was largely due to improving business levels and increased maintenance, utilities and contract service costs at the 20 hotels that were reopened during the third quarter. 
Variable costs were down 85.5% on a total revenue decline of 84% year-over-year. Since April, variable cost declines have broadly matched revenue declines, while ongoing wage and benefit costs have only slightly increased with improving volumes. Hotel management teams have implemented productivity saving protocols, restructured food and beverage platforms and improved the cross utilization of associates. 
As an example, our operators have more than offset the cost increase associated with revised protocols by driving productivity improvement in housekeeping. For the fourth quarter, we believe we will see continued cost containment for wages and benefits and variable expenses, where cost reductions mirror reductions in overall volume. With regards to fixed costs, the brands have already communicated reductions in above property costs. 
Moreover, we would also expect the tax benefit we experienced at the corporate level in the third quarter to continue along the same trajectory. 15 hotels delivered a hotel level operating profit for the third entire third quarter with 18 hotels recording a hotel level operating profit in September, excluding the impact of the employee retention credit. 
At the hotel EBITDA level, we are breaking even in the 35% to 45% occupancy range when ADR is down 15% to 30%, in line with the estimates we provided in April. Assuming the inclusion of corporate level expenses for interest and corporate G&A of approximately $20 million per month on average, we would break even at occupancy levels of approximately 45% and 60% at the same ADR decline levels of 15% to 30%. 
As you think of our path to EBITDA breakeven and subsequent growth, it is important to note that once we achieve hotel breakeven for the consolidated portfolio, we would expect operating expenses to ramp commensurate with business volumes. Therefore, we would expect to remain at breakeven within a range of occupancy before inflecting upward. 
Moving on to cash burn. As Jim noted, we expect fourth quarter above property corporate level monthly cash outflows to be higher than the third quarter, largely due to the timing of CapEx and interest payments. At the hotel level, if operational performance remains at third quarter levels, we would expect an operating loss of approximately $40 million a month, excluding the benefit of the employee retention credit. 
Based on this scenario, overall fourth quarter cash burn would be higher than the third quarter and in the range of approximately $95 million to  $105 million a month. Of this amount, approximately $35 million a month is related to our CapEx program. I would like to note that we haven't provided a hotel level cash burn breakdown for each month of the third quarter because the lumpiness of cash inflows and outflows may make monthly level disclosures misleading. 
For example, September includes the operating profit guarantee for the Marriott transformational capital program as well as the employee retention credit and would, therefore, not provide an accurate run rate for subsequent months. As Jim mentioned, we successfully refinanced debt in transactions that further strengthened our liquidity by $343 million, while extending our weighted average debt maturity and maintaining our weighted average interest rate. 
This, combined with approximately $265 million of net proceeds from the sale of the Newport Beach Marriott and the land of the Phoenician, further maximizes our liquidity, which can be deployed in multiple ways to create value for our shareholders. 
To conclude, although limited visibility continues to make forecasting extremely challenging we continue to focus on what we can influence, which includes minimizing our cash burn and maximize our liquidity in the near term, while working with our operators to redefine the hotel operating model and investing in our assets so they may outperform over the long term. 
Similarly, the strength of our balance sheet and liquidity position allows us to endure an unprecedented crisis today while enabling us to be opportunistic and grow shareholder value in the future. And with that, we will now open it up to Q&A.  To ensure we have time to address questions from as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to 1 question."

That said, we did talk about, I think, Sourav thinked in his comments or maybe it was mine about what we're seeing happen next year with respect to group cancellations, it's clear to us with Connect 2020 being held at Orlando World center, the meeting planners want to get crews back on the road and in hotels. It's very important for associations to meet and for corporate groups to come together as well. 
So our mix from 2017 into 2019 average mix, group business was roughly, on a revenue basis, call it, 35% association, 47% corporate and 18% other, which is really I would tell you that we're seeing a strong desire on the part of association business to come back.

So Rich, I think more than taste, what we're focused on right now as we had talked about last quarter, was really the tentative bookings, which was waiting in the sidelines because pace, obviously, as you would expect, is down because of the uncertainty. But the tentative bookings have really pushed to the second half of next year. Right now, our tentative revenue on the books is up 32%. So clearly, people do want to meet. It's just a matter of, like Jim said, when they are comfortable traveling again, and that's obviously a broader concern. 
The other stat throughout there is, we did book, which is encouraging. We booked 300,000 rooms in the third quarter for 22 to 24 for future years. When compare that to the same time last year, it's only down about 45,000 rooms. And from an ADR perspective, the other encouraging thing is ADRs for the room that we booked is less than 1 point down to the same time last year. So again, encouraging trends when you look out into the future."

We are in a unique position where under our existing credit facility waiver agreement, we can acquire up to $1.5 billion of hotels out of existing liquidity, subject to maintaining $500 million of liquidity in the company. And as we discussed, we expect, assuming that the fourth quarter trends mirror the third quarter trends and we're very pleased with how October has played out that we'll have $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion of available liquidity at the end of this year, taking us into next year. 
So I think that not only are club deals available. As you know, we were very successful in putting together a club deal in Europe with GIC and APG, the Euro JV, where we acquired over 20 hotels as general partner, and we would be very happy to do something like that again in the U.S. if the opportunity presented itself. One of the other distinguishing factors that we have available to us on the acquisition side is the ability to issue operating partnership units that is truly distinguishing, given the liquidity in our stock. 
And just to share, I think we're trading on average now close to $14 million of stock a day. And it gives an owner the opportunity to provide some liquidity but to the upside as well going forward. So to ride the upside in Host as our EBITDA continues to improve and our stock price continues to improve as well. So to answer your question about what do we expect to see? Every indication is -- and we're talking to a lot of people about this, every indication is that come the first half of next year as for various periods way start to expire and as owners who are in the unfortunate position where they don't have the liquidity or they choose to not fund debt service payments and other expenses, we expect to see a significant number of properties come to market. So the answer is yes to both your questions."

That's not to say that we're not going to take every room night that we can. But as we think about margin performance, the better margin performance is driven by rate going forward. 
And we are very, very pleased with the fact that we're not seeing the rate degradation that we've seen in other recovery periods. When we look at what happened after 9/11 and what happened after the Great Recession. So fingers crossed that, that continues to be the trend going forward.

Despite changes in mix, right now, the situation we are in as most of our revenues coming in is really room's only revenue. So reality is, whether we look at leisure business or group any business coming in because it's primarily rooms only, our focus in -- is really on expenses that really reduce and drive higher margins at the rooms level. 
Food and beverage outlets in a lot of cases are running in limited operations. And as we have said before, before we bring back on any food and beverage offerings, we are ensuring it's actually profitable. And we drive profit to the bottom line. From a margin perspective, it obviously is a lower-margin business. But at the end of the day, we're looking at EBITDA dollars, not necessarily EBITDA margin. So once revenues do recover, and we are sort of in a position where we're getting back to pre-COVID levels of revenue, then the focus will be on margin expansion. 
And as we have messaged before, we are really focused on drawing the $100 million to $150 million of incremental EBITDA compared to 2019 levels. And we have made quite a bit of progress on that. And a lot of it is tied to the food and beverage department where there's been significant level of management reduction the severance that we had in the third quarter is directly tied to reduction of almost 30% of management headcount, which we believe is going to be a permanent reduction going forward."

So we will take all that into consideration in our underwriting criteria as we evaluate opportunities going forward. With respect to competitive positioning, I just make an observation that today, the debt markets are generally closed for the level of debt that private equity firms typically need to drive their returns -- their levered returns and high teens to low 20s or, call it, mid-teens to low 20s. 
So we're not seeing any really competition out there today. In fairness, there's just not a lot of product on the market right now.

As you know, that there are roughly 300 brand standards at the major brands. And that would be Marriott, Hyatt and Hilton, and we have worked closely with them to reevaluate each of those standards going forward. And it relates to the most basic, David, food and beverage offerings. 
When the restaurants have to be open, how long do they have to be open, what you have to offer to your customers. The fact that we are talking about and seeing -- and I'm going to let Sourav give a little more detail on this, and seeing a true reduction in expenses of between $100 million and $150 million based on 2019 pro forma performance, I think, is  a strong testament to the fact that the brands get it today. 
They are one with us when it comes to understanding the challenges that owners face. And we interface with both brands, our 2 major operators, Marriott and Hyatt on a weekly basis. So Sourav, do you want to talk a little bit about how we're -- what sort of progress we're making on the $100 million to $150 million?"

David, so I will start-up by saying that Marriott has actually restructured and reduced above property shared services, for sales and marketing, revenue management and it and are right now working towards reductions of their program shared services fees for the following year. For this year, Hyatt has also reduced the fixed component of their above property IT costs by 15% and chain marketing fees by as much as 50%. And moving forward, they're really committed to making their fees more variable so that the cost is actually tied to exactly what you were talking about, the value proposition to the owner. 
In terms of the $100 million to $150 million, the way we think about it is, we would expect that long term, there will be permanent reduction of the fixed portion of the above property cost by as much as 10% to 20%. So putting that into the context of dollars, that would be somewhere between $20 million to $25 million of that $100 million to $150 million. Obviously, I would remind everybody that's tied to 2019 revenues. So assuming we get back to '19 revenues, we would be on the other property piece, $20 million, $25 million of savings, with a 10% to 20% reduction of the fixed piece of the above property costs."

And depending on different types of properties that customers may not very well -- they may not want people in their rooms to clean the rooms as long as they can get clean linens and towels and bathroom amenities that they need deliver to the front door. 
So with respect to food and beverage, I think that we have seen a meaningful change on the F&B side going forward. I don't think you're going to see, as one example, breakfast buffets or likely hot breakfast buffets are likely to be a thing of the past. Hot offerings, the M clubs and the Hyatt concierge lounges are likely to be a thing of the past. So those are going to be permanent cost savings.

So at the property level, it's really understanding what the customer wants and what the customer needs and how we would shift the operating model based on that. 
So the minimum sort of base labor standards are being completely redefined. So going forward, and it's going to be tied to what Jim talked about earlier, is how brand standards get reevaluated based on its customer preferences. So this is an opportunity where we are able to actually do a zero-based budgeting round up budgets to figure out what is the right labor model. And that's where we are pretty confident. We think we're going to get savings not only from a housekeeping perspective, but from food and beverage, particularly in the kitchen department as well."

I hope all of you and your families remain safe and healthy. Over the last several months, we've transitioned from responding to the challenges posed by this pandemic to rebuilding our business within its compounds. 
To that end, I would like to highlight 3 key achievements since our last earnings call. First, we've achieved gradual but steady revenue growth, with our portfolio delivering sequentially higher RevPAR each month from a historic low of approximately $9 in April to a preliminary estimate of $37 in October. 
Although third quarter and October RevPAR remained more than 80% lower year-over-year, third quarter revenues grew over 90% quarter-over-quarter as our operators maximize their efforts to access all potential sources of hotel demand, which continues to gradually increase. 
Second, we have reduced our third quarter hotel level operating loss by approximately 40% from second quarter levels, including the benefit of a $23 million employee retention credit. 
Based on third quarter results and excluding the employee retention credit benefit, we have reduced our monthly ongoing hotel level operating loss by approximately 25% on average compared to the second quarter. Our sequential revenue growth has flowed through to our bottom line as our operators have continued to do an outstanding job of minimizing expenses. 
Finally, we have further strengthened our robust liquidity by raising over $600 million of capital through opportunistic asset sales and debt refinancing and repayments. As a result, if fourth quarter operations are commensurate with the third quarter, we expect to end the year with approximately $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion of total available liquidity, including cash and FF&E reserves, with no debt maturity until 2023. 
As we enter the ninth month of the pandemic with daily COVID-19 case count in the United States in their all-time highs, we continue to believe that the demand recovery will remain gradual and choppy before the widespread availability of effective COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. Therefore, our key near-term priorities remain: number one, working with our operators to continue to access all potential sources of demand; number two, minimizing expenses and reducing hotel cash burn; and number three, maximizing liquidity. 
We are equally focused on our longer-term objectives of structurally redefining our operating model, positioning our portfolio to gain RevPAR index share and capitalizing on opportunistic investments to create long-term value for our stockholders. 
Let me walk you through our progress on these near and long-term objectives before handing the call over to Sourav to explain our third quarter operating performance. 
Beginning with demand, although occupancy continues to be driven by leisure travelers, our hotels are also capturing short-term group airline crew and small but steady business transient volumes. We booked 127,000 group nights in third quarter and delivered 88,000 more room nights than the second quarter, if you exclude New York, which accounted for the majority of group room nights in the second quarter due to medical and first responder business. 
Excluding New York, group rooms increased progressively throughout the quarter from 19,000 in July to 40,000 in August and 49,000 in September, primarily driven by corporate and SMERF events. 9 of our hotels booked sports-related group locks, for Major League baseball and NFL teams to ESPN and other sports media, with a notable 800 rooms booked at Hyatt Regency San Francisco Berlin Game for the PGA Championship in August. 
In addition, the Andaz Maui was partially bought out by a film production unit, which generated over 8,000 total room nights across September and October, 2 months when regular hotel operations were temporarily suspended. With robust safety protocols in place, including testing attendees upon arrival and employees on a daily basis, the Andaz generated a little over $1.7 million of incremental hotel-level EBITDA from this business. 
While our operators are striving to access all potential sources of hotel demand, they remain focused on working with meeting planners to restore confidence in traditional group meetings and events. In October, the Orlando World Center Marriott hosted this year's Connect 2020 conference, with more than 1,000 in-person attendees at our hotel and 175 virtual attendees at home. Every detail was meticulously designed for safety, as the trade show was spread across our 39,000 square foot crystal ballroom with widely spaced booths and aisles, so the large groups of attendees were able to socially distance safely. 
Attendees complied with the hotel's mass mandate and plenty of mass were available on site. The property was able to complement the in-person event with virtual suppliers and a digital trade show that occurred simultaneously. We believe this hybrid meeting format will augment in-person demand, and Marriott plans to host 4 global hybrid meeting events starting on November 9 at our Ritz-Carlton and Tysons Corner. 
While such events help publicize the fact that meetings can take place safely, despite the complexities posed by the pandemic, restrictions on large group gatherings remain in place for most states and local jurisdictions, and nearly all conventions and city wides have been canceled through the first quarter of next year. We remain optimistic about group business on a medium to long-term basis due to encouraging group booking patterns. Rebookings as a percentage of cancellations continue to increase with approximately 16% of group book business that was canceled in 2020, now rebooked into future years, up from 11.6% in the second quarter. 
Moreover, group cancellations for 2021 remain concentrated through April, with groups that are scheduled for the second half of next year holding fairly steady. 
In the third quarter, we booked a net 81,000 group rooms for the second half of 2021, driven by San Francisco, San Jose, Orlando, New York and the D.C. Metro region. We have 2.2 million definite rooms on the books for 2021, which on a full year basis, is 31.5% lower than the same time last year, and on a second half basis is 7.7% lower. For context, we had approximately 3.2 million definite rooms on the books for full year 2020 at the same time last year. 
Finally, our operators achieved a robust sequential increase in 2,022 to 2,024 group bookings. We booked nearly 100,000 more room nights for these out years in the third quarter than we did in the second quarter, with room night activity down only 13% to the same time last year. Importantly, for these out years, ADR is only 80 basis points lower than the same time last year in contrast to the deep discounting that prevailed in the aftermath of 9/11 and the great financial crisis. 
Moving on to business transient. Demand remains minimal but has improved from 11,000 room nights in July to 13,000 in August and 14,000 in September. A variety of industries are driving demand, including health care, consulting, technology and financial and business services with no particular standouts. In general, both group and business transient demand is being driven by smaller organizations rather than by the large corporate accounts. We continue to believe that business travel will recover in line with the broader economic recovery because of the ROI it generates for businesses. 
For every dollar spent on business travel, there is a $10 return in revenue and a $3 return in profit, according to a 2013 analysis by U.S. Travel and Oxford Economics, which statistically modeled 14 industries over 18 years. Moreover, travel makes up only 1% of total U.S. corporate sales and roughly 2% of operating expenses according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, making travel cuts less impactful to long-term profitability than is commonly perceived. 
Turning to contract revenues, although TSA passenger volumes have slowed recently, they grew steadily during the third quarter as airlines continue to add more destinations. Our operators drove additional crew business to our hotels, resulting in 31,000 more contract rooms in the third quarter compared to the second quarter, a 71% sequential increase. 
And finally, leisure demand, which relatively outperformed other types of demand through the summer, has held up better than historically does post Labor Day. If lines between work, school and home remain blurred, our operators have created new offerings to appeal to consumers looking to escape, by not being at home. Hyatt introduced the work from Hyatt Package and Marriott launched the Work Anywhere with Marriott Bonvoy package. The packages facilitate working productively from a hotel for the day, a short stay or an extended resort or vocation. Another example of our operators innovating to access all potential sources of demand. 
Moving on to cash burn. Our hotel level operating loss averaged $40 million a month in the third quarter, not including the employee retentioning credit received under the CARES Act. That's $10 million per month lower than the monthly cash burn scenario we outlined on our second quarter call and approximately half the worst-case scenario of $70 million to $80 million that we discussed in May. 
Our third quarter hotel level cash expenses less the employee retention credit increased by 19% on a revenue increase of over 90% compared to the second quarter. Our operators have demonstrated their commitment to achieving hotel level breakeven as soon as possible by continuing to minimize costs and add back expenses only as necessary to service business levels at the current low occupancy rate. 
Assuming operational performance remains at third quarter levels, we would expect approximately $95 million to $105 million of total monthly cash outflows, reflecting an average hotel level loss of approximately $40 million a month as well as estimated CapEx, interest payments and general corporate overhead. 
Above property, corporate level monthly cash flows will be sequentially higher in the fourth quarter due to the timing of CapEx and interest payments. So Rob will provide greater details on our near-term cash burn trajectory in his prepared remarks. 
Moving to our final near-term objective of maximizing liquidity. We raised over $600 million of capital through opportunistic asset sales and debt refinancing since our last earnings call. We sold the 532 room Newport Beach Marriott Hotel & Spa for $260 million, which exceeds our pre-COVID internal hold value for this asset. Moreover, we reduced our future CapEx commitments with the sale of this hotel, including $19 million of contractually required owner-funded CapEx for the Marriott transformational capital program and associated systems renovations. 
This was an opportunistic sale at pre-COVID pricing to a buyer who has strategic reasons to own the asset. We are pleased to have achieved a total CapEx adjusted valuation of 13.8x 2019 EBITDA and a 6.8% cap rate based on 2019 NOI and to have further enhanced our liquidity and reduced our near-term capital spending requirements. 
Moreover, there will be no incremental redistribution requirement imposed by the tax gains generated by the sale of the Newport Beach Marriott. Due to a combination of the first quarter, common cash dividend was paid in April 2020 and the anticipated net operating tax loss to be incurred by hosting in 2020 also. We also completed the second closing on the sale of development land at The Phoenician, bringing our total land sales at that asset to approximately $83 million this year. 
As we have discussed in the past, the sale of this land wasn't in our underwriting when we acquired the hotel in 2015. However, it was a part of our vision to unlock the tremendous value we saw in The Phoenician. We are pleased to have executed an incredibly complex rezoning entitlement process by solving multiple technical issues. And so doing, we have successfully monetized approximately 38 acres of nonincome-producing land and created value for our stockholders, while retaining an additional 21.5 acres of land to create further value through a combination of future sales or resort expansion. 
The buyer plans to build approximately 165 luxury condominium units, 85 single-family homes and 30 villas on these parcels. And residents will have the option to purchase an amenity program with The Phoenician to access resort amenities and other services. We anticipate that this build in demand will help drive food and beverage, spa and golf revenues at the resort. 
To conclude on our near-term objectives, we further enhanced our liquidity position by issuing a total of $750 million of Series I senior notes in 2 substantially oversubscribed tranches, resulting in an attractive coupon of 3.5% and a re-offer yield of 3.6% to 3.7%. In conjunction with our Series I issuance, we completed a tender offer of our 4.75% Series C senior notes due 2023, with an approximately 81% participation rate. As a result, we further augmented our cash position by $343 million, while extending our average debt maturity and maintaining our weighted average interest rate. 
Shifting to our longer-term objectives. We are working with our operators to redefine our operating model. Cash utilization of management functions and a reduction in the fixed component of above property charges are 2 of the biggest contributors to our long-term cost savings target of $100 million to $150 million, which is based on 2019 revenues and represents approximately 3% to 4% of pro forma 2019 hotel level expenses. 
To date, our operators have made solid progress on both of these priorities as they restructure their workforce and their above property shared services for sales, marketing, revenue management and it. We remain deeply committed to working with our operators to create long-term efficiencies that will allow us to generate greater profitability at lower levels of occupancy. A more profitable operating model will not only make for a faster recovery to 2019 EBITDA levels, but it will also improve the long-term value of our assets. 
Now turning to investments. Let me begin with our capital investment plans for the portfolio. We believe our ability to continue to invest in our portfolio as a unique competitive advantage that will positively influence our relative performance and our growth trajectory throughout this lodging cycle. Although we have cut our 2020 maintenance CapEx budget by nearly 40%, we continue to invest in the Marriott transformational capital program as well as in other ROI projects. 
On a combined basis, these represent nearly 70% of our 2020 capital spend. Moreover, nearly 70% of our investment in the Marriott program will be complete by year-end 2020, and the entire program will be substantially completed by year-end 2022. As a result, we expect to gain RevPAR index share during the heart of the recovery. First, as we outperformed the competition that is unable to invest this year and next; and second, as we maintain our RevPAR index share gains when competitors disrupt their operations to renovate assets later in the cycle, with 2022 likely being the first year that many will be able to meaningfully invest in their portfolios. 
The Coronado Island Marriott Resort & Spa, for example, completed its transformational program renovations last year and has improved its RevPAR index share by 9.8 points through August this year compared with the same period in 2018. This is nearly 3x the program's expectations of 3 to 4 points of index share gains. It has also outperformed the San Diego downtown upper upscale submarket by 16 points year-to-date, implying over $2 million in incremental room revenues. 
Moving on to acquisition opportunities and the transaction markets, a record 26% of CMBS hotel loans were in special servicing in September 2020 compared with 1.9% in December 2019, and  70% of hotel loans are either in special servicing or on special servicing watch list according to Trepp Research. Delinquency rates are expected to move higher as forbearance agreements start to roll off. 
Additionally, some hotel owners who were hoping for a speedy recovery may not be able to sustain the cash outflows required to service their indebtedness and may decide to throw in the towel. So although we don't see high-quality assets trading at this time, we continue to focus on opportunities where we can leverage our competitive advantages, such as deep owner, broker and operator relationships and our ability to do large transactions. 
Our reputation for providing speed and certainty of closing and ability to offer tax-advantaged structures to sellers are additional distinguishing factors. 
To conclude, our near-term objectives aim to lower our cash burn and maximize our liquidity, while our longer-term objectives are designed to drive faster EBITDA recovery by structurally improving margins, gaining market share and acquiring assets. With $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion of expected total available liquidity at year-end, we believe we have the ability to withstand prolonged business disruption and capitalize on opportunities for growth. 
We entered this crisis as one of the lodging REITs with the lowest leverage and greatest balance sheet capacity and believe these remain key attributes that are necessary to create meaningful long-term value in this new lodging cycle. With that, I will turn the call over to Sourav."
29574,691091431,2131429,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2020",2020-11-05,"Earnings Calls","Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Building on Jim's comments, our third quarter top line performance improved from the historic lows recorded in the second quarter. RevPAR for the third quarter declined by 84.1% year-over-year compared with a 93",1562,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Building on Jim's comments, our third quarter top line performance improved from the historic lows recorded in the second quarter. RevPAR for the third quarter declined by 84.1% year-over-year compared with a 93% year-over-year decline in the second quarter. Year-over-year occupancy and ADR declines, both improved on a sequential basis, as we reopened 20 hotels in the third quarter and summer leisure travel bolstered overall hotel demand. 
Compared to STR data for U.S. upper tier hotels in our top markets, our total portfolio's ADR declines were 150 basis points better than the industries. We outperformed on average occupancy in 11 of our top markets in the third quarter. However, our overall occupancy declines were 370 basis points greater than STR, primarily because our portfolio has more hotels in prime downtown locations than the industry does. 
Notably, our RevPAR was in line or better than the industries in our resort oriented markets such as Jacksonville, Florida Gulf Coast, Miami, Phoenix and Hawaii as well as in Northern Virginia and New York, where we benefited from crew business and corporate room blocks. Our operators continue to be able to preserve and, in some cases, to even exceed rates versus the same time last year at properties that are high in demand, especially on strong compression dates such as national holidays. 
For example, our Florida Coastal Resorts delivered 22% year-over-year ADR growth in September. In general, rate doesn't appear to be driving occupancy to the extent it normally would in a downturn. Customers are more sensitive to cleanliness and sanitization standards than to room rates. We, therefore, remain hopeful that rate degregation will be less severe than in prior turns and that branded hotels will benefit from having stringent cleanliness standards to help gain customer trust and strong loyalty programs to help drive demand. 
Shifting to non-rooms revenues. Third quarter food and beverage revenues on a pro forma basis declined by approximately 90% year-over-year due to a 96.5% reduction in banquet and AV revenue and an 81% reduction in outlet revenue. At our open resort properties, however, outlet revenues per occupied room were nearly 28% higher year-over-year, as leisure transient guests continue to dine on property during their stay. 
While other revenues included approximately $10 million of group and attrition and cancellation fees, we do not expect to recognize material cancellation and attrition revenues related to the pandemic going forward as we continue to prioritize the rebooking of group business. Preliminary top line numbers for October reflect a gradual but steady month-over-month improvement, with October RevPAR at approximately $37 compared to September RevPAR of $34.64, driven by 20.7% occupancy and an approximately $179 ADR.  Year-over-year RevPAR declined by approximately 82% and was almost the same as the year-over-year RevPAR decline reported in September. 
Looking at November, we expect top line performance to be negatively impacted by the election this week, but are hopeful that demand will gradually improve around the holidays. Although visibility remains limited as the length of the booking window remains extremely short, our portfolio is generally well positioned to capture short-lead time demand as we now have 75 of 79 hotels representing 94% of our total room count open. 
Speaking of reopenings, let me provide you with a brief update on Hawaii, which reopened to tourists on October 15. Travelers who get a COVID-19  test, no more than 72 hours before departure and show proof of a negative test upon arrival are now exempt from the mandatory 14-day quarantine rule. Multiple airlines and airports are now offering rapid COVID-19 testing for Hawaii-bound passengers, thereby enabling a gradual return of tourists to the islands. 
For November, occupancy on the books is currently ranging between 20% to 35% across our 4 properties in Maui and Oahu. Moreover, the November through January transient ADR pace for our hotels in Hawaii is up 3.8% year-over-year. 
Moving on to expenses. We worked with our operators to reduce third quarter hotel operating costs by over 65% year-over-year, excluding the $43 million of severance paid in the quarter. Although our operators recorded a $23 million reduction in expenses related to the employee retention credit received in the third quarter, this benefit was more than offset by $31 million of health care benefits paid to furloughed employees. 
As a reminder, we accrued $32 million for that expense in the second quarter. In the third quarter, we accrued an additional $26 million for similar payments that will be made in the fourth quarter. As previously disclosed, we expect to incur another $16 million to $26 million of severance expense in the fourth quarter as our operators continue to reevaluate the workforce structure and implement changes that are expected to lead to a more efficient operating model in the long term. We have worked closely with our operators to minimize expenses in the third quarter, despite a reopening more hotels and achieving greater levels of occupancy. 
Fixed costs declined 46% year-over-year, excluding the employee retention credit, which is remarkable when you consider that a significant portion of the remaining fixed expenses consist of property taxes and insurance. The quarter-over-quarter increase in the fixed cost was largely due to improving business levels and increased maintenance, utilities and contract service costs at the 20 hotels that were reopened during the third quarter. 
Variable costs were down 85.5% on a total revenue decline of 84% year-over-year. Since April, variable cost declines have broadly matched revenue declines, while ongoing wage and benefit costs have only slightly increased with improving volumes. Hotel management teams have implemented productivity saving protocols, restructured food and beverage platforms and improved the cross utilization of associates. 
As an example, our operators have more than offset the cost increase associated with revised protocols by driving productivity improvement in housekeeping. For the fourth quarter, we believe we will see continued cost containment for wages and benefits and variable expenses, where cost reductions mirror reductions in overall volume. With regards to fixed costs, the brands have already communicated reductions in above property costs. 
Moreover, we would also expect the tax benefit we experienced at the corporate level in the third quarter to continue along the same trajectory. 15 hotels delivered a hotel-level operating profit for the third entire third quarter with 18 hotels recording a hotel level operating profit in September, excluding the impact of the employee retention credit. 
At the hotel EBITDA level, we are breaking even in the 35% to 45% occupancy range when ADR is down 15% to 30%, in line with the estimates we provided in April. Assuming the inclusion of corporate level expenses for interest and corporate G&A of approximately $20 million per month on average, we would break even at occupancy levels of approximately 45% and 60% at the same ADR decline levels of 15% to 30%. 
As you think of our path to EBITDA breakeven and subsequent growth, it is important to note that once we achieve hotel breakeven for the consolidated portfolio, we would expect operating expenses to ramp commensurate with business volumes. Therefore, we would expect to remain at breakeven within a range of occupancy before inflecting upward. 
Moving on to cash burn. As Jim noted, we expect fourth quarter above property corporate level monthly cash outflows to be higher than the third quarter, largely due to the timing of CapEx and interest payments. At the hotel level, if operational performance remains at third quarter levels, we would expect an operating loss of approximately $40 million a month, excluding the benefit of the employee retention credit. 
Based on this scenario, overall fourth quarter cash burn would be higher than the third quarter and in the range of approximately $95 million to  $105 million a month. Of this amount, approximately $35 million a month is related to our CapEx program. I would like to note that we haven't provided a hotel-level cash burn breakdown for each month of the third quarter because the lumpiness of cash inflows and outflows may make monthly level disclosures misleading. 
For example, September includes the operating profit guarantee for the Marriott transformational capital program as well as the employee retention credit and would, therefore, not provide an accurate run rate for subsequent months. As Jim mentioned, we successfully refinanced debt in transactions that further strengthened our liquidity by $343 million, while extending our weighted average debt maturity and maintaining our weighted average interest rate. 
This, combined with approximately $265 million of net proceeds from the sale of the Newport Beach Marriott and the land of The Phoenician, further maximizes our liquidity, which can be deployed in multiple ways to create value for our shareholders. 
To conclude, although limited visibility continues to make forecasting extremely challenging we continue to focus on what we can influence, which includes minimizing our cash burn and maximize our liquidity in the near term, while working with our operators to redefine the hotel operating model and investing in our assets so they may outperform over the long term. 
Similarly, the strength of our balance sheet and liquidity position allows us to endure an unprecedented crisis today while enabling us to be opportunistic and grow shareholder value in the future. 
And with that, we will now open it up to Q&A.  To ensure we have time to address questions from as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to one question."

I think it's -- the holdback that we're seeing generally in bookings, both on the business transient side and the group side is related to a couple of things. Number one, government restrictions, and that's being driven by public health concerns. So I think we -- as we've talked many times, we're not going to see business return to any sense of normalcy until we have an effective vaccine or vaccines or therapeutics combined with the vaccine. 
That said, we did talk about, I think, Sourav talked in his comments or maybe it was mine about what we're seeing happen next year with respect to group cancellations. It's clear to us with Connect 2020 being held at Orlando World center, the meeting planners want to get crews back on the road and in hotels. It's very important for associations to meet and for corporate groups to come together as well. 
So our mix from 2017 into 2019 average mix, group business was roughly, on a revenue basis, call it, 35% association, 47% corporate and 18% other, which is really SMERF. I would tell you that we're seeing a strong desire on the part of association business to come back. And we're all praying that we have an effective vaccine. So we can talk about how crew pace is looking into 2022 and beyond. And I'll let Sourav take that."

But the tentative bookings have really pushed to the second half of next year. Right now, our tentative revenue on the books is up 32%. So clearly, people do want to meet. It's just a matter of, like Jim said, when they are comfortable traveling again, and that's obviously a broader concern. 
The other stat throughout there is, we did book, which is encouraging. We booked 300,000 rooms in the third quarter for 22 to 24 for future years. When compare that to the same time last year, it's only down about 45,000 rooms. And from an ADR perspective, the other encouraging thing is ADRs for the room that we booked is less than 1 point down to the same time last year. So again, encouraging trends when you look out into the future."

We are in a unique position where under our existing credit facility waiver agreement, we can acquire up to $1.5 billion of hotels out of existing liquidity, subject to maintaining $500 million of liquidity in the company. And as we discussed, we expect, assuming that the fourth quarter trends mirror the third quarter trends and we're very pleased with how October has played out that we'll have $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion of available liquidity at the end of this year, taking us into next year. 
So I think that not only are club deals available. As you know, we were very successful in putting together a club deal in Europe with GIC and APG, the Euro JV, where we acquired over 20 hotels as general partner, and we would be very happy to do something like that again in the U.S. if the opportunity presented itself. One of the other distinguishing factors that we have available to us on the acquisition side is the ability to issue operating partnership units that is truly distinguishing, given the liquidity in our stock. 
And just to share, I think we're trading on average now close to $14 million of stock a day. And it gives an owner the opportunity to provide some liquidity, but to ride the upside as well going forward. So to ride the upside in host as our EBITDA continues to improve and our stock price continues to improve as well. 
So to answer your question about what do we expect to see? Every indication is -- and we're talking to a lot of people about this, every indication is that come the first half of next year as for various periods way start to expire and as owners who are in the unfortunate position where they don't have the liquidity or they choose to not fund debt service payments and other expenses, we expect to see a significant number of properties come to market. So the answer is yes to both your questions."

We're going to have to see, the restrictions loosened, and I don't think that various government authorities are going to be prepared to do that until we have a vaccine. 
So the short answer is we don't know whenever the debt incurrence test will -- we will come back in compliance with the. We don't have any other issues that you should be aware of today. We're in very good shape. We've done, I think, a very good job, an amendable job of raising another $600 million of cash this quarter in a very opportunistic and low-cost way. So we are today focused on reducing expenses, putting the portfolio in a position where we can outperform when the markets do open up and maximizing our liquidity."

That's not to say that we're not going to take every room night that we can. But as we think about margin performance, the better margin performance is driven by rate going forward. 
And we are very, very pleased with the fact that we're not seeing the rate degradation that we've seen in other recovery periods. When we look at what happened after 9/11 and what happened after the Great Recession. So fingers crossed that, that continues to be the trend going forward.

Despite changes in mix, right now, the situation we are in as most of our revenues coming in is really room's only revenue. So reality is, whether we look at leisure business or group any business coming in because it's primarily rooms only, our focus in -- is really on expenses that can really reduce and drive higher margins at the rooms level. 
Food and beverage outlets in a lot of cases are running in limited operations. And as we have said before, before we bring back on any food and beverage offerings, we are ensuring it's actually profitable. And we drive profit to the bottom line. From a margin perspective, it obviously is a lower-margin business. But at the end of the day, we're looking at EBITDA dollars, not necessarily EBITDA margin. So once revenues do recover, and we are sort of in a position where we're getting back to pre-COVID levels of revenue, then the focus will be on margin expansion. 
And as we have [ messaged ] before, we are really focused on drawing the $100 million to $150 million of incremental EBITDA compared to 2019 levels. And we have made quite a bit of progress on that. And a lot of it is tied to the food and beverage department where there's been significant level of management reduction. The severance that we had in the third quarter is directly tied to reduction of almost 30% of management headcount, which we believe is going to be a permanent reduction going forward."

We do believe that maintaining broad geographic diversification is the way to run the business. That said, some markets are going to open up better and sooner than other markets. So we will take all that into consideration in our underwriting criteria as we evaluate opportunities going forward. 
With respect to competitive positioning, I just make an observation that today, the debt markets are generally closed for the level of debt that private equity firms typically need to drive their returns -- their levered returns and high teens to low 20s or, call it, mid-teens to low 20s. 
So we're not seeing any really competition out there today. In fairness, there's just not a lot of product on the market right now. I mean we are evaluating every deal that we would deem to be attractive. We haven't come across anything that  meets our underwriting criteria, given the facts and circumstances of where we are in the cycle and the recovery case."

Well, I think what the brands deliver to us is a testament to the way we have been able to grow the business in a very challenged environment. And we love the fact that the brands are listening today, and I'll let Sourav jump in on this in a few minutes. They heard us loud and clear. They heard us with respect to brand standards. As you know, that there are roughly 300 brand standards at the major brands. And that would be Marriott, Hyatt and Hilton, and we have worked closely with them to reevaluate each of those standards going forward. And it relates to the most basic, David, food and beverage offerings. 
When the restaurants have to be open, how long do they have to be open, what you have to offer to your customers. The fact that we are talking about and seeing -- and I'm going to let Sourav give a little more detail on this, and seeing a true reduction in expenses of between $100 million and $150 million based on 2019 pro forma performance, I think, is a strong testament to the fact that the brands get it today. 
They are one with us when it comes to understanding the challenges that owners face. And we interface with both brands, our 2 major operators, Marriott and Hyatt on a weekly basis. So Sourav, do you want to talk a little bit about how we're -- what sort of progress we're making on the $100 million to $150 million?"

David, so I will start-up by saying that Marriott has actually restructured and reduced above property shared services, for sales and marketing, revenue management and IT and are right now working towards reductions of their program shared services fees for the following year. For this year, Hyatt has also reduced the fixed component of their above property IT costs by 15% and chain marketing fees by as much as 50%. And moving forward, they're really committed to making their fees more variable so that the cost is actually tied to exactly what you were talking about, the value proposition to the owner. 
In terms of the $100 million to $150 million, the way we think about it is, we would expect that long term, there will be permanent reduction of the fixed portion of the above property cost by as much as 10% to 20%. So putting that into the context of dollars, that would be somewhere between $20 million to $25 million of that $100 million to $150 million. Obviously, I would remind everybody that's tied to 2019 revenues. So assuming we get back to '19 revenues, we would be on the other property piece, $20 million, $25 million of savings, with a 10% to 20% reduction of the fixed piece of the above property costs."

And depending on different types of properties that customers may not very well -- they may not want people in their rooms to clean the rooms as long as they can get clean linens and towels and bathroom amenities that they need deliver to the front door. 
So with respect to food and beverage, I think that we have seen a meaningful change on the F&B side going forward. I don't think you're going to see, as one example, breakfast buffets or likely hot breakfast buffets are likely to be a thing of the past. Hot offerings, the M clubs and the Hyatt concierge lounges are likely to be a thing of the past. So those are going to be permanent cost savings.

So at the property level, it's really understanding what the customer wants and what the customer needs and how we would shift the operating model based on that. 
So the minimum sort of base labor standards are being completely redefined. So going forward, and it's going to be tied to what Jim talked about earlier, is how brand standards get reevaluated based on its customer preferences. So this is an opportunity where we are able to actually do a zero-based budgeting round up budgets to figure out what is the right labor model. And that's where we are pretty confident. We think we're going to get savings not only from a housekeeping perspective, but from food and beverage, particularly in the kitchen department as well."
