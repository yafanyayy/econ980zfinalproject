Joining me today are Marc Bitzer, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Peters, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks to be tracked with a presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com. 
Before we begin, I'll remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and other periodic reports. We want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of results from our ongoing business operations. We also think the adjusted measures will provide you a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. Listeners are directed to the supplemental information package posted on the Investor Relations section of our website for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable commissions. 
At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for analyst questions. As a reminder, we ask that participants ask no more than 2 questions. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Marc."

We demonstrated a strong",498,"Thanks, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 3, we show our fourth quarter 2019 highlights. We delivered very strong results, organic net sales growth of 1.2% and ongoing EBIT margin expansion to 7.2%, a 100 basis point increase. We demonstrated a strong performance across the globe as all regions delivered positive EBIT. 
North America led with record EBIT margins of 13.3%, despite industry demand softness in the U.S. and Canada. In our Europe, Middle East and Africa regions, we continue to realize the full benefits of our strategic actions. This represents the second consecutive quarter of sequential EBIT improvement in the European region, providing a strong confidence in our ability to drive a region to profitability in 2020. 
Additionally, we delivered strong free cash flow of over $900 million, with positive contributions from all regions. This result was driven by working capital improvements and capital spend efficiencies. Lastly, we continue to strengthen our balance sheet and made strong progress towards our long-term gross debt-to-EBITDA target of approximately [ $2 million ]. 
Turning to Slide 4. I will discuss our full year highlights. We delivered record ongoing earnings per share of $16, above our $14.75 to $15.50 guidance, with a very strong ongoing EBIT margin expansion of 60 basis points and free cash flow of over $900 million compared to guidance of approximately $800 million. 
We took decisive action in a challenging environment by announcing and successfully executing on our global cost-based pricing initiatives and driving positive mix through product innovation. Additionally, we remain disciplined in our approach to cost takeout and continue to optimize our overall value chain while overcoming significant headwinds from tariffs and material cost inflation. Despite significant trade and macroeconomic challenges, we've fully funded our business investment needs and returned strong levels of cash to shareholders through continued share repurchases and increased our dividend for the 7th consecutive year. These results demonstrate the fundamental strength of our business and provide us confidence when we have the right brand in place to deliver our long-term goals. 
Turning to Slide 5. We show the drivers of our fourth quarter and full year margin expansion. In the fourth quarter, price/mix delivered 100 basis points of margin expansion as we realize the benefits of pricing actions and mix benefits from our product launches. Additionally, we delivered positive net cost take out in the quarter. 
Further, improving trends in raw materials more than offset continued tariff headwinds in North America, resulting in a favorable impact of 25 basis points. These margin benefits were partially offset by continued marketing and technology investments and the unfavorable impact of currency. Over full year, very strong margin expansion from price/mix was partially offset by the impact of tariffs, increased brand investments and currency. Overall, we're very pleased to deliver and even slightly over deliver on our margin commitment and are confident this positive momentum will continue to drive strong results in 2020. 
Now I'll turn it over to Jim to review our regional results."

Turning to Slide 7, I'll review the fourth quarter results for our North America region. We delivered stable revenue despite industry softness in the U.S. and Canada, highlighting the agility and underlying strength of our business. Additionally, we delivered record EBIT with margin expansion to 13.3%, as strong price/mix execution and disciplined cost takeout offset headwinds from fixed cost leverage and continued cost inflation. The region drove margin improvement of 150 basis points in the quarter, making it the ninth consecutive quarter of consistent margin expansion. 
Turning to Slide 8, we review the fourth quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Excluding business exits, unit volumes were approximately flat, with growth in Italy, France and Eastern Europe, which was offset by soft Middle East and Africa demand. We are pleased to see strong top line exit rates in December across the region, including year-over-year growth in Middle East and Africa. Momentum from our cost reduction and strategic initiatives delivered positive EBIT, with margin expansion of 210 basis points. These initiatives remain fully on track, and we delivered in line with our guidance of approximately $100 million EBIT benefit on an annual basis, with approximately $75 million to be realized in 2019. This sustained improvement provides us confidence in our ability to return the region to profitability in 2020. 
Now we turn to Slide 9 to review the fourth quarter results for our Latin America region. Unit volumes significantly increased alongside a rebound in Brazil industry demand, offsetting continued weakness in Mexico. Organic net sales, which excludes 2018 Embraco sales, increased approximately 17%, driven by Brazil share gains and very strong direct-to-consumer sales. EBIT margins contracted in the quarter as cost productivity benefits and favorable raw material inflation were more than offset by currency devaluation in Brazil and Argentina. 
Finally, as a reminder, our fourth quarter [ 2019 ] results include the impact of the Embraco compressor business in its consolidated results. 
We now turn to the fourth quarter results for our Asia region, which are shown on Slide 10. Excluding the impact of currency, net sales were approximately flat as strong top line growth in India was offset by negative industry demand in China. India delivered double-digit EBIT and continued share gains, which was offset by brand transition investments in China. These investments remain on track, with Whirlpool brand share increasing sequentially and year-over-year. 
Now I'd like to turn it back over to Marc to review our guidance and operational priorities."

In line with our long-term goals, we expected to drive organic net sales growth of approximately 3%. We expect to deliver approximately 7.5% ongoing EBIT margin, an increase of about 60 basis points. Lastly, our free cash flow guidance is $800 million to $900 million, which includes a net unfavorable impact of $140 million from onetime items. 
Turning to Slide 13. We show the drivers of our approximately 7.5% ongoing EBIT margin guidance in 2020. We expect approximately 25 basis points of improvement related to price/mix as we deliver new and innovative products and services to our customers. We expect net cost to drive approximately 50 basis points of improvements as we realize the benefits of our global standardization and complexity reduction initiatives. Additionally, based on what has been announced to date, we do not expect tariffs to have a year-over-year impact on 2020 results. Our favorable trend in raw materials are expected to drive approximately 50 basis points of margin expansion. Further, we expect a negative margin impact of approximately 50 basis points as we continue to invest in our digital transformation journey and an unfavorable impact from currency of approximately 25 basis points. 
Moving to slides 14 and 15, we want to highlight just a few of our innovative products, which allow us to drive positive price/mix during 2020. The first slide shows how we will achieve product leadership in the North America premium top load laundry segment. These products will launch throughout the first quarter of this year, replacing our entire premium top load laundry segment. These connected capable products have purposeful innovation to meet customer needs such as Load and Go dispenser, a new pretreat station and an extra power function. 
Second example on Slide 15 highlights our new dishwasher build in our first-ever true global architecture, which is set to launch in North America and Asia in the first quarter and at a later stage in Europe. By leveraging our architecture globally, we are able to drive significant improvement in part and complexity reduction, therefore, driving cost efficiencies. Even more importantly, this innovative product features a new full-sized third rack with a full functioning spray arm, the largest third rack available in the market. We fully expect to see major growth in our mass and premium segments as a result of these innovative consumer-relevant features. Again, these are just a few examples of exciting innovations that we expect to launch this year that will continue to drive positive price/mix. 
Now I'll turn it back to Jim to highlight a few remaining guidance items."

We expect to deliver ongoing earnings per share of $16 to $17 in 2020. Our ongoing tax rate is expected to be 20% to 25% compared to 15.3% in 2019, resulting in a year-over-year headwind of approximately $1.55. A Europea",854,"Thanks, Marc. Turning to Slide 16. We expect to deliver ongoing earnings per share of $16 to $17 in 2020. Our ongoing tax rate is expected to be 20% to 25% compared to 15.3% in 2019, resulting in a year-over-year headwind of approximately $1.55. A European tax law change in late 2019 favorably impacted our effective tax rate. Excluding this benefit, our tax rate would have been near the midpoint of our previous guidance. 
Additionally, several of our tax reform benefits and strategies from prior years are no longer effective in 2020, further increasing our rate to our current 20% to 25% range. 
Secondly, as we mentioned earlier, we expect to drive EBIT margin expansion in all regions totaling approximately 60 basis points, resulting in strong earnings accretion. Our earnings per share guidance includes a headwind of $0.60, as 2019 EBIT includes approximately $50 million related to Embraco. Additionally, we expect moderately lower interest expense after the repayment of our $1 billion term loan in 2019. 
Lastly, we highlight the carryover benefit from our 2019 share buyback. While we expect to continue to repurchase shares at a moderate level, we do not provide specific guidance for 2020 and do not reflect that as a driver. On Slide 17, we show our regional guidance for the year. 
Starting with industry demand, we maintain our cautious demand outlook for North America, while U.S. housing starts show positive signs of strengthening that has not yet translated into higher appliance demand. In EMEA, we expect a continuation of modest growth. While in Latin America, we expect growth of 3% to 4% as improvements in Brazil are offset by continued weakness in Mexico. Asia industry is expected to be approximately flat as growth in India is offset by continued demand pressure in China. In total, we expect the global appliance industry to be approximately flat for 2020. 
Regarding our EBIT guidance, we expect continued margin expansion in North America, driven by focused cost discipline and favorable price/mix related to new product introductions. 
In EMEA, we fully expect to continue to realize the benefits of our strategic actions to restore EMEA to profitability, resulting in EBIT margin expansion of over 170 basis points. 
As a reminder, we executed several strategic actions, including our business exits in the first half of 2019, driving benefits primarily in the second half. In Latin America, we expect to deliver EBIT margins of approximately 6% as demand improvements and accelerating direct-to-consumer sales in Brazil are offset by demand weakness in Mexico and currency devaluation in Argentina and Brazil. Lastly, we expect to achieve EBIT margins of 3% to 4% in Asia as strong India operations are partially offset by weak demand expectations in China. 
In total, we expect to deliver approximately 60 basis points of margin improvement and are confident that our operational priorities and initiatives will deliver continued progress towards our long-term goals. 
Turning to Slide 18. I will discuss the drivers of our 2020 free cash flow. We expect to deliver approximately $1.7 billion in cash earnings, primarily driven by margin expansion, offset by the sale of Embraco. We expect $550 million in capital expenditures as we continue to invest in our business. Additionally, we expect to deliver approximately $50 million of working capital improvement, primarily through inventory reduction initiatives as we fully transition key product launches across the globe. And we expect $200 million of restructuring cash outlays, which includes the reindustrialization of our Naples, Italy manufacturing facility. Lastly, free cash flow was negatively impacted by approximately $140 million related to several onetime items. Further details of these items can be found in the appendix of this presentation. In total, we expect to deliver $800 million to $900 million of free cash flow. 
Turning to Slide 19. We provide an update on our capital allocation priorities for the year. We remain fully committed to funding the business for growth, while continuing to strengthen our balance sheet and return cash to shareholders. Consistent with our balanced approach to capital allocation, we repurchased approximately $50 million of shares in the fourth quarter and expect to continue repurchasing shares at moderate levels in 2020. 
In line with guidance at Investor Day, our gross debt-to-EBITDA is on track towards our long-term target of approximately 2. Lastly, I'd like to announce that starting in April, we will no longer report units sold in our earnings materials, including our 10-K and 10-Q. As we continue to redefine what product is, this will lead to an increase in revenue from products not reported as units, such as the KitchenAid smart oven plus baking stone and the upcoming launch of [ Yummies ] wireless smart thermometer. Further, we continue to invest in our digital transformation journey and unlock long-term value creation through incremental revenue from digital products and services such as our [ Yellipro ] subscription service. As a result, units are becoming less of an indicator of our overall sales performance. Consequently, we will eliminate units reporting in our earnings materials, including our 10-Q and 10-K. 
Now we will end our formal remarks and open it up for questions."

Now keep in mind, first of all, on the pure majors business, and if you want to take 1 indication, the AHAM numbers were minus 1.8 for the quarter, which, just to remind everybody, does not encompass the entire spectrum of what we sell. So that's, of course, one part of that. 
If you look at the pure majors business, we approximately held market share in Q4. So we feel pretty good about where we are for market share, in particular, the promotion period. On the other parts of the business, keep in mind, Canada is in there. Canada continues to have a market decline, and the Canadian market is soft and that has an impact. 
On the SBA volume, frankly coming into the quarter, we did expect that the trade brings inventories back to normal levels around the end of the year, and they did. So the trade inventories on the SDA side are lower than the year before. But we feel very good about the sell proof of KitchenAid SDA, which is pretty solid and pretty stable. So these are pretty much a major component. And maybe, Jim, you want to comment again on the units reporting?"

And a lot more of the stuff that we sell now today, whether it be stand mix or attachments at the licensed products at the, as I mentioned, consumables or services just don't fall into there.

There are almost a perennial question, i.e., they have been around for the last 10 years. In the last 10 years, we expanded our margin on a consistent base in North America. So we -- of course, it's an intense competitive environment. But I think we've also impressively demonstrated that we can expand margins despite a highly competitive environment. 
In particular, when it comes to the onshoring of a tool washing machine factories, as we always said, we welcome that because it's -- a level playing field, and we feel very confident that we can compete in that environment. So as such, no, we did not see a negative impact on the broader competitive environment from the onshoring of that production. I would say it's pretty much the same intense environment. 
Particularly, as it relates to your question around the promotional environment, yes, in Q4, we saw a slight uptick on a promotional intensity, particularly from 2 competitors, but not the entire marketplace. And that doesn't entirely surprise us. But you've also seen that despite a broader market contraction, we delivered 13.3% EBIT margin in North America, which demonstrates that even in a promotional environment, even in the declining markets, we are able to deliver very, very strong margins."

From a net cost perspective, we also began to see some cost progression there. And what we're seeing is, one, and as we talked about going into 2020, a reduction in headwinds in terms of what we're seeing on materials. Tariffs were very stable within the quarter. So that was positive for us. And then we did make some investments similar to what you see on our walk for the whole quarter.

So when it comes to inflation, let me first repeat what we said several times. We -- coming into 2019, we basically had a cumulative inflation of around $700 million in our business.

We -- coming into 2019, we basically had a cumulative inflation of around $700 million in our business. That is the result of raw materials, tariffs, cost inflation throughout the entire value chain, in particular, logistics. That was still in total headwind pretty much throughout mid-year 2019. And as of Q3, and in particular, Q4, we saw that slowly coming around in terms of a total net cost takeout. 
If you break it down more in terms of the external factors on this one, yes, we saw globally a turn of a raw material pretty much around Q3 and then more impact [ in ] Q4. And as you've seen in our guidance for 2020, we also expect another improvement on the raw material side. What has changed since our last earnings call is our outlook on the tariffs because the last outlook, we had to work with what was announced at that time. And based on what we know today now, the tariffs will not have a negative year-over-year impact. And as a result of that, we basically see [ with ] 0.5% margin expansion just coming from better raw materials. 
The over inflation elements like logistics or other cost elements, so far, we don't see yet turning around. So that is still working against us, and that's what we're trying to address. But again, summarizing, I would describe 2020, we'll see less of an inflationary environment. But it's not completely gone, and it's certainly not reversed. And it's obviously our key operational priority to kind of double down and really improve our cost takeout throughout the entire system."

And frankly, I would say we delivered on all 3 of these levers. So I think it's a combination of these ones which drove the year-over-year improvement. 
But in particular, when it comes to the core markets, and this may be is embedded in our overall unit number, which we have for Europe, we had in our core markets growth in Q4. And that's a good thing. So we stabilized or regained market share in most of our core markets. And again, that's a very encouraging sign as we look into 2020."

But I think also, as Marc just talked about, within EMEA, we also expect to gain back some of the share we lost there. So that will help drive us from a revenue perspective, despite an industry being flat globally. 
The second thing is, as we mentioned, there's an incremental amount of price mix in there, which also does help us on a revenue base. We assume that to be slightly positive for the year. So both of those, that would probably be the second biggest driver

The good news is we're making good progress on the fixed cost takeout in Europe and some other parts. We see some benefits from our global product architecture, and it's all coming to materialize.

First of all, to repeat the numbers, we expect North America industry to be somewhere between minus 1% and plus 1%. So pretty much flat year-over-year. As you know, we are basically simplified by 2 major components in the industry demand. One is the replacement demand [ via ] one, which is somewhat related to housing or remodeling. 
On the replacement, and that's a little bit the same like last year, we're now comping against the low years post recession. And that had been around us for the last 1 or 2 years and probably will be around us for another year or so, and just because you're comping against these low years. And that was also -- already a [ factor ] in 2019. 
Coming into 2019, frankly, we expected more momentum coming out of housing. And of course, the -- and then again, we're now going back in time, Q4 '18, weak housing impacted what we sold in the housing-related market in 2019. The housing was, I would say, a little bit the softer side compared to what we originally expected coming into 2019. 
As you turn the page in 2020, I would say, we're reasonably optimistic on housing, but we just want to wait and see. What I mean with that is the initial data points, which we got in December from housing were, in fact, very encouraging. But it's the first positive data points, and we want to see that stabilizing. 
I would also add, when you look at the news from homebuilders, these were, in fact, very strong, very encouraging signs. But I also want to remind everybody is between an order of a new house and the actual [ plan ] shipments, you typically have 9 to 12 months. So the good signs, which we've seen now on the order side, it takes a while until it shows up in our revenue line. So -- but I would say, if housing stabilizes, and see more positive trends that we've seen in December, I would say that spells good news for our industry in first."

Beyond this one is office coronavirus. From what you can see today, it may have 3 potential impacts. One is the China domestic market. Obviously, when people don't go into stores, the market will decline. You all know that our exposure to the China domestic market is limited. So yes, that's not going to hurt us a whole lot. 
Two is then on production and three is on components. 
Production, the china production is largely serving Asia and to only, a lesser extent, Europe and to almost very small extent in North America. As you know, North America, 80% of what we sell in North America or U.S. is produced in U.S. So the main exposure is somewhat limited, in particular, with 1 factory where we export from Chinese almost a thousand miles away from Wuhan. So we're a little bit, I would say, protected, but it's a little bit further way. 
The third element is components. Keep in mind, this whole thing happens around the Chinese New Year. Every year around Chinese New Year, you plan with your supplier inventory levels, when they stop production and start production. That would say, we're pretty well covered. We're also well covered for this 3 or 4 days of extension for Chinese New Year. And beyond this one, we've got to see. 
The very thing that you also need to keep in mind, throughout the last couple of years, the most critical components we went aggressively for dual sourcing. So we're not -- we're single source only in very, very few components. We largely dual source and which gives you a little bit of a hedging."

Certainly, on the 2 products, which we've just shown on top load in dishwasher, the platform or architecture, which we have with almost 10 years [indiscernible]. So I mean, bringing in such an architecture with some great features met should open opportunities for some share growth. And I'm not talking about promotional share growth. I'm talking about structural share growth in a healthy business. 
So yes, we have certain ambitions for share growth in North America. Related to your question about retailers. Yes, it's obvious that we kind of windfall, which came out of a serious decline for many other retailers that has diminished. I mean, that's based on existing. But right now, I would say it's a reasonably stable retail environment. The home improvement having a strong growth in home appliances, best by being very well established, but also some other good region players. So I think it's -- right now, we don't see a dramatic move across the retail landscape. We've seen some ins and outs when it comes to inventory management of retailers. And I think you all have seen that in the AM shipment data in October and then subsequent in December. So there's been some moves, which, of course, impact us and our entire supply chain. But beyond this one, we don't see dramatic move across the different retailers."

I would say, right now, our guidance for next year industry is pretty much flat.

First of all, thank you for joining us all. And let me just came to the last question. Let me just quickly wrap up and summarize. First of all, I want to start out with all the numbers in and out. I want to remind everybody, we had an all-time record year last year. We feel very good about it, and we closed an all-time record year with the best quarter ever in our history, which I think is more remarkable given that we did not have a lot of tailwinds throughout the year. Industry demand didn't help us. We still saw cost inflation for most part of the year. So we feel very good about what we've achieved last year. But now in January 2020. The most important thing about last year is that it gave us a good momentum as we exited the year. So we feel very good about momentum, which will carry into 2020, and I hope you heard also that confidence throughout the earnings call. As we look into 2020, and we laid that out, we have 3 operational priorities. We are very focused on getting the cost out of the system. We are focused on executing the product launches, which we talked about. And obviously, there's a lot more launches beyond those [ 3 ] ones, which we highlighted. 
And from a region perspective, of course, we have a key focus, not only in maintaining strong margins in North America, but particularly turning -- continue to turn around Europe and China. That is a key focus. 
But then in a broader perspective, and this comes back to our Investor Day, I want to remind everybody, our strategy has not changed. Beyond the operational priorities and delivering on our commitments, we have a very strong focus on continuing to execute along our strategic imperatives, which is not only about product leadership, but it's our entire digital transformation be on redefining what the product is, be it on winning digital consumer journey. So there's a strong focus in our company around the strategic transformation. And we feel very good about where we are, and we will kind of increase our efforts throughout the year to kind of create a long-term, strong and sustainable business. 
With that in mind, I just want to thank you for joining us today and talk to you next quarter."

We delivered very strong results: organic net sales growth of 1.2% and ongoing EBIT margin expansion to 7.2%, a 100 basis point increase. We demonstrated a strong performance across the globe as all regions delivered positive EBIT. 
North America led with record EBIT margins of 13.3% despite industry demand softness in the U.S. and Canada. In our Europe, Middle East and Africa region, we continued to realize the full benefits of our strategic actions. This represents the second consecutive quarter of sequential EBIT improvement in the European region, providing a strong confidence in our ability to drive a region to profitability in 2020. 
Additionally, we delivered strong free cash flow of over $900 million, with positive contributions from all regions. This result was driven by working capital improvements and capital spend efficiencies. Lastly, we continue to strengthen our balance sheet and made strong progress towards our long-term gross debt-to-EBITDA target of approximately 2.
Turning to Slide 4. I will discuss our full year highlights. We delivered record ongoing earnings per share of $16, above our $14.75 to $15.50 guidance, with a very strong ongoing EBIT margin expansion of 60 basis points and free cash flow of over $900 million compared to guidance of approximately $800 million. 
We took decisive actions in a challenging environment by announcing and successfully executing on our global cost-based pricing initiatives and driving positive mix through product innovation. Additionally, we remain disciplined in our approach to cost takeout and continue to optimize our overall value chain while overcoming significant headwinds from tariffs and material cost inflation. 
Despite significant trade and macroeconomic challenges, we fully funded our business investment needs and returned strong levels of cash to shareholders through continued share repurchases and increased our dividend for the 7th consecutive year. These results demonstrate the fundamental strength of our business and provide us confidence that we have the right strategy in place to deliver our long-term goals. 
Turning to Slide 5. We show the drivers of our fourth quarter and full year margin expansion. In the fourth quarter, price/mix delivered 100 basis points of margin expansion as we realize the benefits of pricing actions and mix benefits from our product launches. Additionally, we delivered positive net cost takeouts in the quarter. Further, improving trends in raw materials more than offset continued tariff headwinds in North America, resulting in a favorable impact of 25 basis points. These margin benefits were partially offset by continued marketing and technology investments and the unfavorable impact of currency. 
Over full year, very strong margin expansion from price/mix was partially offset by the impact of tariffs, increased brand investments and currency. Overall, we're very pleased to deliver and even slightly overdeliver on our margin commitment and are confident this positive momentum will continue to drive strong results in 2020. 
Now I'll turn it over to Jim to review our regional results."

Turning to Slide 7, I'll review the fourth quarter results for our North America region. We delivered stable revenue despite industry softness in the U.S. and Canada, highlighting the agility and underlying strength of our business. Additionally, we delivered record EBIT with margin expansion to 13.3% as strong price/mix execution and disciplined cost takeout offset headwinds from fixed cost leverage and continued cost inflation. The region drove margin improvement of 150 basis points in the quarter, making it the ninth consecutive quarter of consistent margin expansion. 
Turning to Slide 8. We review the fourth quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Excluding business exits, unit volumes were approximately flat, with growth in Italy, France and Eastern Europe, which was offset by soft Middle East and Africa demand. We are pleased to see strong top line exit rates in December across the region, including year-over-year growth in Middle East and Africa. Momentum from our cost reduction and strategic initiatives delivered positive EBIT with margin expansion of 210 basis points. These initiatives remain fully on track and delivered in line with our guidance of approximately $100 million EBIT benefit on an annual basis, with approximately $75 million to be realized in 2019. This sustained improvement provides us confidence in our ability to return the region to profitability in 2020. 
Now we turn to Slide 9 to review the fourth quarter results for our Latin America region. Unit volumes significantly increased alongside a rebound in Brazil industry demand, offsetting continued weakness in Mexico. Organic net sales, which excludes 2018 Embraco sales, increased approximately 17% driven by Brazil share gains and very strong direct-to-consumer sales. EBIT margins contracted in the quarter as cost productivity benefits and favorable raw material inflation were more than offset by currency devaluation in Brazil and Argentina. Finally, as a reminder, our fourth quarter 2018 results include the impact of the Embraco compressor business in its consolidated results. 
We now turn to the fourth quarter results for our Asia region, which are shown on Slide 10. Excluding the impact of currency, net sales were approximately flat as strong top line growth in India was offset by negative industry demand in China. India delivered double-digit EBIT and continued share gains, which was offset by brand transition investments in China. These investments remain on track with Whirlpool brand share increasing sequentially and year-over-year. 
Now I'd like to turn it back over to Marc to review our guidance and operational priorities."

In line with our long-term goals, we expected to drive organic net sales growth of approximately 3%. We expect to deliver approximately 7.5% ongoing EBIT margin, an increase of about 60 basis points. Lastly, our free cash flow guidance is $800 million to $900 million, which includes a net unfavorable impact of $140 million from onetime items. 
Turning to Slide 13. We show the drivers of our approximately 7.5% ongoing EBIT margin guidance in 2020. We expect approximately 25 basis points of improvement related to price/mix as we deliver new and innovative products and services to our customers. We expect net cost to drive approximately 50 basis points of improvements as we realize the benefits of our global standardization and complexity reduction initiatives. Additionally, based on what has been announced to date, we do not expect tariffs to have a year-over-year impact on 2020 results. A favorable trend in raw materials are expected to drive approximately 50 basis points of margin expansion. Further, we expect a negative margin impact of approximately 50 basis points as we continue to invest in our digital transformation journey and an unfavorable impact from currency of approximately 25 basis points. 
Moving to Slides 14 and 15. We want to highlight just a few of our innovative products which allow us to drive positive price/mix during 2020. The first slide shows how we will achieve product leadership in the North America premium top load laundry segment. These products will launch throughout the first quarter of this year, replacing our entire premium top load laundry segment. These connected capable products have purposeful innovation to meet customer needs such as Load & Go dispenser, a new pretreat station and an extra power function. 
Second example on Slide 15 highlights our new dishwasher built in our first-ever true global architecture, which is set to launch in North America and Asia in the first quarter and at a later stage in Europe. By leveraging our architecture globally, we are able to drive significant improvement in part and complexity reduction, therefore driving cost efficiencies. Even more importantly, this innovative product features a new full-sized third rack with a fully functioning spray arm, the largest third rack available in the market. We fully expect to see major growth in our mass and premium segments as a result of these innovative consumer-relevant features. Again, these are just a few examples of exciting innovations that we expect to launch this year that will continue to drive positive price/mix. 
Now I'll turn it back to Jim to highlight a few remaining guidance items."

We expect to deliver ongoing earnings per share of $16 to $17 in 2020. Our ongoing tax rate is expected to be 20% to 25% compared to 15.3% in 2019, resulting in a year-over-year headwind of approximately $1.55. A European tax law change in late 2019 favorably impacted our effective tax rate. Excluding this benefit, our tax rate would have been near the midpoint of our previous guidance. Additionally, several of our tax reform benefits and strategies from prior years are no longer effective in 2020, further increasing our rate to our current 20% to 25% range. 
Secondly, as we mentioned earlier, we expect to drive EBIT margin expansion in all regions totaling approximately 60 basis points, resulting in strong earnings accretion. Our earnings per share guidance includes a headwind of $0.60 as 2019 EBIT includes approximately $50 million related to Embraco. Additionally, we expect moderately lower interest expense after the repayment of our $1 billion term loan in 2019. 
Lastly, we highlight the carryover benefit from our 2019 share buybacks. While we expect to continue to repurchase shares at a moderate level, we do not provide specific guidance for 2020 and do not reflect that as a driver. 
On Slide 17, we show our regional guidance for the year. Starting with industry demand, we maintain our cautious demand outlook for North America while U.S. housing starts show positive signs of strengthening that has not yet translated into higher appliance demand. In EMEA, we expect a continuation of modest growth, while in Latin America, we expect growth of 3% to 4% as improvements in Brazil are offset by continued weakness in Mexico. Asia industry is expected to be approximately flat as growth in India is offset by continued demand pressure in China. In total, we expect the global appliance industry to be approximately flat for 2020. 
Regarding our EBIT guidance, we expect continued margin expansion in North America, driven by focused cost discipline and favorable price/mix related to new product introductions. In EMEA, we fully expect to continue to realize the benefits of our strategic actions to restore EMEA to profitability, resulting in EBIT margin expansion of over 170 basis points. As a reminder, we executed several strategic actions, including our business exits in the first half of 2019, driving benefits primarily in the second half. In Latin America, we expect to deliver EBIT margins of approximately 6% as demand improvements and accelerating direct-to-consumer sales in Brazil are offset by demand weakness in Mexico and currency devaluation in Argentina and Brazil. Lastly, we expect to achieve EBIT margins of 3% to 4% in Asia as strong India operations are partially offset by weak demand expectations in China. In total, we expect to deliver approximately 60 basis points of margin improvement and are confident that our operational priorities and initiatives will deliver continued progress towards our long-term goals. 
Turning to Slide 18. I will discuss the drivers of our 2020 free cash flow. We expect to deliver approximately $1.7 billion in cash earnings, primarily driven by margin expansion, offset by the sale of Embraco. We expect $550 million in capital expenditures as we continue to invest in our business. Additionally, we expect to deliver approximately $50 million of working capital improvement, primarily through inventory reduction initiatives as we fully transition key product launches across the globe. And we expect $200 million of restructuring cash outlays, which includes the reindustrialization of our Naples, Italy manufacturing facility. Lastly, free cash flow was negatively impacted by approximately $140 million related to several onetime items. Further details of these items can be found in the appendix of this presentation. In total, we expect to deliver $800 million to $900 million of free cash flow. 
Turning to Slide 19. We provide an update on our capital allocation priorities for the year. We remain fully committed to funding the business for growth while continuing to strengthen our balance sheet and return cash to shareholders. Consistent with our balanced approach to capital allocation, we repurchased approximately $50 million of shares in the fourth quarter and expect to continue repurchasing shares at moderate levels in 2020. In line with guidance at Investor Day, our gross debt-to-EBITDA is on track towards our long-term target of approximately 2. 
Lastly, I'd like to announce that starting in April, we will no longer report units sold in our earnings materials, including our 10-K and 10-Q. As we continue to redefine what product is, this will lead to an increase in revenue from products not reported as units, such as the KitchenAid Smart Oven plus baking stone and the upcoming launch of Yummly's wireless smart thermometer. Further, we continue to invest in our digital transformation journey and unlock long-term value creation through incremental revenue from digital products and services such as our Yummly Pro subscription service. As a result, units are becoming less of an indicator of our overall sales performance. Consequently, we will eliminate units reporting in our earnings materials, including our 10-Q and 10-K. 
Now we will end our formal remarks and open it up for questions."

Now keep in mind, first of all, on the pure majors business, and if you want to take one indication, the AHAM numbers were minus 1.8 for the quarter, which, just to remind everybody, does not encompass the entire spectrum of what we sell. So that's, of course, one part of that. If you look at the pure majors business, we approximately held market share in Q4. So we feel pretty good about where we are from a market share, in particular, during the promotional period.
On the other parts of the business, keep in mind, Canada is in there. Canada continues to have a market decline, and the Canadian market is soft and that has an impact. On the SDA volume, frankly, coming into the quarter, we did expect that the trade brings inventories back to normal levels around the end of the year, and they did. So the trade inventories on the SDA side are lower than the year before. But we feel very good about the [ sales ] of KitchenAid SDA, which is pretty solid and pretty stable. So these are pretty much the major components. 
And maybe, Jim, you want to comment again on the units reporting?"

As you mentioned already, with question around the competitive background in North America, they are almost a perennial question, so i.e., they have been around for the last 10 years. And in the last 10 years, we expanded our margin on a consistent basis in North America. So we -- of course, it's an intense competitive environment. But I think we've also impressively demonstrated that we can expand margins despite a highly competitive environment. 
In particular, when it comes to the onshoring of the 2 washing machine factories, as we always said, we welcome that because it's mainly a level playing field, and we feel very confident that we can compete in that environment. So as such, no, we did not see a negative impact on the broader competitive environment from the onshoring of their production. I would say it's pretty much the same intense environment. 
Particularly, as it relates to your question around the promotional environment, yes, in Q4, we saw a slight uptick on promotional intensity, particularly from 2 competitors but not the entire marketplace. And that doesn't entirely surprise us. But we've also seen that despite a broader market contraction, we delivered 13.3% EBIT margin in North America, which demonstrates that even in a promotional environment, even with the declining markets, we are able to deliver very, very strong margins."

We did obviously have positive price and mix within North America within the quarter. From a net cost perspective, we also began to see some cost progression there. And what we're seeing is, one, as we talked about going into 2020, a reduction in headwinds in terms of what we're seeing on materials. Tariffs were very stable within the quarter. So that was positive for us. And then we did make some investments similar to what you see on our walk for the whole quarter. 
So there's nothing unusual within North America outside of what we demonstrated globally, that it was really pricing and mix and then a positive cost environment that offset some of the cost headwinds we had to deal with."

So when it comes to inflation, and let me first repeat what we said several times, we -- coming into 2019, we basically had a cumulative inflation of around $700 million in our business. That is the result of raw materials, tariffs, cost inflation throughout the entire value chain, in particular, in logistics. That was still in total headwind pretty much throughout mid-year 2019. And as of Q3, and in particular Q4, we saw that slowly coming around in terms of a total net cost takeout. 
If you break it down more in terms of the external factors on this one, yes, we saw globally a turn of the raw materials pretty much around Q3 and then more impact in Q4. And as you've seen in our guidance for 2020, we also expect another improvement on the raw material side. What has changed since our last earnings call is our outlook on the tariffs because in the last outlook, we had to work with what was announced at that time. And based on what we know today now, the tariffs will not have a negative year-over-year impact. And as a result of that, we basically see this 0.5% margin expansion just coming from better raw materials. 
The other inflation elements like logistics or other cost elements, so far, we don't see yet turning around. So that is still working against us, and that's what we're trying to address. But again summarizing, I would describe 2020, we will see less of an inflationary environment, but it's not completely gone and it's certainly not reversed. And it's obviously our key operational priority to kind of double down and really improve our cost takeout throughout the entire system."

And frankly, I would say we delivered on all 3 of these levers. So I think it's a combination of these ones which drove the year-over-year improvement. 
But in particular, when it comes to the core markets, and this may be -- is embedded in our overall unit number which we have for Europe, we had in our core markets growth in Q4. And that's a good thing. So we stabilized or regained market share in most of our core markets. And again, that's a very encouraging sign as we look into 2020."

The second thing is, as we mentioned, there's an incremental amount of price/mix in there, which also does help us on a revenue base. We assume that to be slightly positive for the year. So both of those, that would probably be the second biggest driver that I would say."

But the other element is we still have logistics costs which are elevated throughout the world. That is still a factor. The good news is we're making good progress on the fixed cost takeout in Europe and some other parts. We see some benefits from our global product architecture, so it's all coming to materialize.

As you know, they are basically simplified by 2 major components in the industry demand: one is the replacement demand; we have one which is somewhat related to housing or remodeling. On the replacement, and that's a little bit the same like last year, we're now comping against the low years post-recession. And that had been around us for the last 1 or 2 years and probably will be around us for another year or so, just because you're comping against these low years. And that was already a factor in 2019. 
Coming into 2019, frankly, we expected more momentum coming out of housing. And of course, the -- and then again, we're now -- going back in time, Q4 '18, the weak housing impacted what we sold in the housing-related market in 2019. So the housing was, I would say, a little bit on the softer side compared to what we originally expected coming into 2019. 
As you turn the page in 2020, I would say we're reasonably optimistic on housing, but we just want to wait and see. What I mean with that is the initial data points which we got in December from housing were, in fact, very encouraging. But it's the first positive data points, and we want to see that stabilizing. I would also add when you look at the news from homebuilders, these were, in fact, very strong and very encouraging signs. But I also want to remind everybody, between an order of a new house and the actual appliance shipment, you typically have 9 to 12 months. So the good signs which we see now on the order side, it takes a while until it shows up in our revenue line. So -- but I would say, if housing stabilizes and sees more positive trends that we've seen in December, I would say that spells good news for our industry in first."

I guess within the revenue growth math, can you talk about how strong is the mix? And just how confident are you that the mix will remain strong through 2020? 
And I guess, you've got a lot of innovation in the market right now. Is this a matter of just we had a good year in mix and then we ended up against some pretty tough mix comps? Or are we in the beginning of maybe a 2-, 3-, 4-year stretch driven by innovation of very strong mix contribution to the P&L?"

Beyond this one is -- of this coronavirus, from what you can see today, it may have 3 potential impacts: One is the China domestic market. Obviously, when people don't go into stores, the market will decline. You all know that our exposure to the China domestic market is limited. So yes, that's not going to hurt us a whole lot.
Two is then on production and three is on components. Production, China production is largely serving Asia; and to only a lesser extent, Europe; and to almost a very small extent, North America. 
As you know, North America, 80% of what we sell in North America or in U.S. is produced in U.S. So the bad exposure is somewhat limited, in particular with 1 factory where we export from China. It's almost a thousand miles away from Wuhan. So we're a little bit, I won't say protected, but it's a little bit further way. 
The third element is components. Keep in mind, this whole thing happens around the Chinese New Year. Every year around Chinese New Year, you plan with your supplier inventory levels, when they stop production, when they start production. I would say we're pretty well covered. We're also well covered for this 3 or 4 days of extension for Chinese New Year. And beyond this one, we got to see. And the other thing which you also need to keep in mind, throughout the last couple of years, the most critical components, we went aggressively for dual-sourcing. So we're not -- we're single-sourced only in very, very few components. We're largely dual-sourced, which gives you a little bit of a hedging."

So I mean bringing in such an architecture with great features, that should open opportunities for some share growth. And I'm not talking about promotional share growth. I'm talking about structural share growth in a healthy business. So yes, we have certain ambition for share growth in North America. 
Related to your question about retailers, yes, it's obvious that the kind of windfall which came out of a serious decline for many other retailers, that has diminished. I mean that's basing on existing. But right now, I would say it's a reasonably stable retail environment. The home improvement -- having a strong growth in home appliances, Best Buy being very well established, but also some other good regional players. So I think it's -- right now we don't see a dramatic move across the retail landscape. We've seen some ins and outs when it comes to inventory management of retailers.

First of all, thank you for joining us all. And let me, given that we just came to the last question, let me just quickly wrap up and summarize. First of all, I want to start out -- with all the numbers in and out, I want to remind everybody, we had an all-time record year last year. We feel very good about it. And we closed an all-time record year with the best quarter ever in our history, which I think is more remarkable given that we did not have a lot of tailwinds throughout the year. Industry demand didn't help us. We still saw cost inflation throughout most parts of the year. So we feel very good about what we've achieved last year. But now we're in January 2020. The most important thing about last year is that it gave us a good momentum as we exited the year. So we feel very good about momentum, which we'll carry into 2020, and I hope you heard also that confidence throughout the earnings call. 
As we look into 2020, and we laid that out, we have 3 operational priorities: We are very focused on getting the cost out of the system. We are focused on executing the product launches, which we talked about. And obviously, there's a lot more launches beyond those 2 ones, which we highlighted. 
And from a regional perspective, of course, we have a key focus not only in maintaining strong margins in North America, but particularly turning -- continue to turn around Europe and China. That is a key focus. But then in a broader perspective, and this comes back to our Investor Day, I want to remind everybody, our strategy has not changed. Beyond the operational priorities and delivering on our commitments, we have a very strong focus on continuing to execute along our strategic imperatives, which is not only about product leadership, but it's our entire digital transformation, be it on redefining what the product is, be it on winning digital consumer journey. So there's a strong focus in our company around the strategic transformation, and we feel very good about where we are. And we will kind of increase our efforts throughout the year to kind of create a long-term, strong and sustainable business.

We delivered very strong results: organic net sales growth of 1.2% and ongoing EBIT margin expansion to 7.2%, a 100 basis point increase. We demonstrated a strong performance across the globe as all regions delivered positive EBIT. 
North America led with record EBIT margins of 13.3% despite industry demand softness in the U.S. and Canada. In our Europe, Middle East and Africa region, we continued to realize the full benefits of our strategic actions. This represents the second consecutive quarter of sequential EBIT improvement in the European region, providing a strong confidence in our ability to drive a region to profitability in 2020. 
Additionally, we delivered strong free cash flow of over $900 million, with positive contributions from all regions. This result was driven by working capital improvements and capital spend efficiencies. Lastly, we continue to strengthen our balance sheet and made strong progress towards our long-term gross debt-to-EBITDA target of approximately 2.
Turning to Slide 4. I will discuss our full year highlights. We delivered record ongoing earnings per share of $16, above our $14.75 to $15.50 guidance, with a very strong ongoing EBIT margin expansion of 60 basis points and free cash flow of over $900 million compared to guidance of approximately $800 million. 
We took decisive actions in a challenging environment by announcing and successfully executing on our global cost-based pricing initiatives and driving positive mix through product innovation. Additionally, we remain disciplined in our approach to cost takeout and continue to optimize our overall value chain while overcoming significant headwinds from tariffs and material cost inflation. 
Despite significant trade and macroeconomic challenges, we fully funded our business investment needs and returned strong levels of cash to shareholders through continued share repurchases and increased our dividend for the 7th consecutive year. These results demonstrate the fundamental strength of our business and provide us confidence that we have the right strategy in place to deliver our long-term goals. 
Turning to Slide 5. We show the drivers of our fourth quarter and full year margin expansion. In the fourth quarter, price/mix delivered 100 basis points of margin expansion as we realize the benefits of pricing actions and mix benefits from our product launches. Additionally, we delivered positive net cost takeouts in the quarter. Further, improving trends in raw materials more than offset continued tariff headwinds in North America, resulting in a favorable impact of 25 basis points. These margin benefits were partially offset by continued marketing and technology investments and the unfavorable impact of currency. 
Over full year, very strong margin expansion from price/mix was partially offset by the impact of tariffs, increased brand investments and currency. Overall, we're very pleased to deliver and even slightly overdeliver on our margin commitment and are confident this positive momentum will continue to drive strong results in 2020. 
Now I'll turn it over to Jim to review our regional results."

Excluding business exits, unit volumes were approximately flat, with growth in Italy, France and Eastern Europe, which was offset by soft Middle East and Africa demand. We are pleased to see strong top line exit rates in December across the region, including year-over-year growth in Middle East and Africa. Momentum from our cost reduction and strategic initiatives delivered positive EBIT with margin expansion of 210 basis points. These initiatives remain fully on track and delivered in line with our guidance of approximately $100 million EBIT benefit on an annual basis, with approximately $75 million to be realized in 2019. This sustained improvement provides us confidence in our ability to return the region to profitability in 2020. 
Now we turn to Slide 9 to review the fourth quarter results for our Latin America region. Unit volumes significantly increased alongside a rebound in Brazil industry demand, offsetting continued weakness in Mexico. Organic net sales, which excludes 2018 Embraco sales, increased approximately 17% driven by Brazil share gains and very strong direct-to-consumer sales. EBIT margins contracted in the quarter as cost productivity benefits and favorable raw material inflation were more than offset by currency devaluation in Brazil and Argentina. Finally, as a reminder, our fourth quarter 2018 results include the impact of the Embraco compressor business in its consolidated results. 
We now turn to the fourth quarter results for our Asia region, which are shown on Slide 10. Excluding the impact of currency, net sales were approximately flat as strong top line growth in India was offset by negative industry demand in China. India delivered double-digit EBIT and continued share gains, which was offset by brand transition investments in China. These investments remain on track with Whirlpool brand share increasing sequentially and year-over-year. 
Now I'd like to turn it back over to Marc to review our guidance and operational priorities."

In line with our long-term goals, we expected to drive organic net sales growth of approximately 3%. We expect to deliver approximately 7.5% ongoing EBIT margin, an increase of about 60 basis points. Lastly, our free cash flow guidance is $800 million to $900 million, which includes a net unfavorable impact of $140 million from onetime items. 
Turning to Slide 13. We show the drivers of our approximately 7.5% ongoing EBIT margin guidance in 2020. We expect approximately 25 basis points of improvement related to price/mix as we deliver new and innovative products and services to our customers. We expect net cost to drive approximately 50 basis points of improvements as we realize the benefits of our global standardization and complexity reduction initiatives. Additionally, based on what has been announced to date, we do not expect tariffs to have a year-over-year impact on 2020 results. A favorable trend in raw materials are expected to drive approximately 50 basis points of margin expansion. Further, we expect a negative margin impact of approximately 50 basis points as we continue to invest in our digital transformation journey and an unfavorable impact from currency of approximately 25 basis points. 
Moving to Slides 14 and 15. We want to highlight just a few of our innovative products which allow us to drive positive price/mix during 2020. The first slide shows how we will achieve product leadership in the North America premium top load laundry segment. These products will launch throughout the first quarter of this year, replacing our entire premium top load laundry segment. These connected capable products have purposeful innovation to meet customer needs such as Load & Go dispenser, a new pretreat station and an extra power function. 
Second example on Slide 15 highlights our new dishwasher built in our first-ever true global architecture, which is set to launch in North America and Asia in the first quarter and at a later stage in Europe. By leveraging our architecture globally, we are able to drive significant improvement in part and complexity reduction, therefore driving cost efficiencies. Even more importantly, this innovative product features a new full-sized third rack with a fully functioning spray arm, the largest third rack available in the market. We fully expect to see major growth in our mass and premium segments as a result of these innovative consumer-relevant features. Again, these are just a few examples of exciting innovations that we expect to launch this year that will continue to drive positive price/mix. 
Now I'll turn it back to Jim to highlight a few remaining guidance items."

We expect to deliver ongoing earnings per share of $16 to $17 in 2020. Our ongoing tax rate is expected to be 20% to 25% compared to 15.3% in 2019, resulting in a year-over-year headwind of approximately $1.55. A Europea",851,"Thanks, Marc. Turning to Slide 16. We expect to deliver ongoing earnings per share of $16 to $17 in 2020. Our ongoing tax rate is expected to be 20% to 25% compared to 15.3% in 2019, resulting in a year-over-year headwind of approximately $1.55. A European tax law change in late 2019 favorably impacted our effective tax rate. Excluding this benefit, our tax rate would have been near the midpoint of our previous guidance. Additionally, several of our tax reform benefits and strategies from prior years are no longer effective in 2020, further increasing our rate to our current 20% to 25% range. 
Secondly, as we mentioned earlier, we expect to drive EBIT margin expansion in all regions totaling approximately 60 basis points, resulting in strong earnings accretion. Our earnings per share guidance includes a headwind of $0.60 as 2019 EBIT includes approximately $50 million related to Embraco. Additionally, we expect moderately lower interest expense after the repayment of our $1 billion term loan in 2019. 
Lastly, we highlight the carryover benefit from our 2019 share buybacks. While we expect to continue to repurchase shares at a moderate level, we do not provide specific guidance for 2020 and do not reflect that as a driver. 
On Slide 17, we show our regional guidance for the year. Starting with industry demand, we maintain our cautious demand outlook for North America while U.S. housing starts show positive signs of strengthening that has not yet translated into higher appliance demand. In EMEA, we expect a continuation of modest growth, while in Latin America, we expect growth of 3% to 4% as improvements in Brazil are offset by continued weakness in Mexico. Asia industry is expected to be approximately flat as growth in India is offset by continued demand pressure in China. In total, we expect the global appliance industry to be approximately flat for 2020. 
Regarding our EBIT guidance, we expect continued margin expansion in North America, driven by focused cost discipline and favorable price/mix related to new product introductions. In EMEA, we fully expect to continue to realize the benefits of our strategic actions to restore EMEA to profitability, resulting in EBIT margin expansion of over 170 basis points. As a reminder, we executed several strategic actions, including our business exits in the first half of 2019, driving benefits primarily in the second half. In Latin America, we expect to deliver EBIT margins of approximately 6% as demand improvements and accelerating direct-to-consumer sales in Brazil are offset by demand weakness in Mexico and currency devaluation in Argentina and Brazil. Lastly, we expect to achieve EBIT margins of 3% to 4% in Asia as strong India operations are partially offset by weak demand expectations in China. In total, we expect to deliver approximately 60 basis points of margin improvement and are confident that our operational priorities and initiatives will deliver continued progress towards our long-term goals. 
Turning to Slide 18. I will discuss the drivers of our 2020 free cash flow. We expect to deliver approximately $1.7 billion in cash earnings, primarily driven by margin expansion, offset by the sale of Embraco. We expect $550 million in capital expenditures as we continue to invest in our business. Additionally, we expect to deliver approximately $50 million of working capital improvement, primarily through inventory reduction initiatives as we fully transition key product launches across the globe. And we expect $200 million of restructuring cash outlays, which includes the reindustrialization of our Naples, Italy manufacturing facility. Lastly, free cash flow was negatively impacted by approximately $140 million related to several onetime items. Further details of these items can be found in the appendix of this presentation. In total, we expect to deliver $800 million to $900 million of free cash flow. 
Turning to Slide 19. We provide an update on our capital allocation priorities for the year. We remain fully committed to funding the business for growth while continuing to strengthen our balance sheet and return cash to shareholders. Consistent with our balanced approach to capital allocation, we repurchased approximately $50 million of shares in the fourth quarter and expect to continue repurchasing shares at moderate levels in 2020. In line with guidance at Investor Day, our gross debt-to-EBITDA is on track towards our long-term target of approximately 2. 
Lastly, I'd like to announce that starting in April, we will no longer report units sold in our earnings materials, including our 10-K and 10-Q. As we continue to redefine what product is, this will lead to an increase in revenue from products not reported as units, such as the KitchenAid Smart Oven plus baking stone and the upcoming launch of Yummly's wireless smart thermometer. Further, we continue to invest in our digital transformation journey and unlock long-term value creation through incremental revenue from digital products and services such as our Yummly Pro subscription service. As a result, units are becoming less of an indicator of our overall sales performance. Consequently, we will eliminate units reporting in our earnings materials, including our 10-Q and 10-K. 
Now we will end our formal remarks and open it up for questions."

Now keep in mind, first of all, on the pure majors business, and if you want to take one indication, the AHAM numbers were minus 1.8 for the quarter, which, just to remind everybody, does not encompass the entire spectrum of what we sell. So that's, of course, one part of that. If you look at the pure majors business, we approximately held market share in Q4. So we feel pretty good about where we are from a market share, in particular, during the promotional period.
On the other parts of the business, keep in mind, Canada is in there. Canada continues to have a market decline, and the Canadian market is soft and that has an impact. On the SDA volume, frankly, coming into the quarter, we did expect that the trade brings inventories back to normal levels around the end of the year, and they didn't. So the trade inventories on the SDA side are lower than the year before. But we feel very good about the sell through KitchenAid SDA, which is pretty solid and pretty stable. So these are pretty much the major components.

And a lot more of the stuff that we sell now today, whether it be stand mixer attachments, it be licensed products, it be, as I mentioned, consumables or services just don't fall into there.

As you mentioned already, with question around the competitive background in North America, they are almost a perennial question, so i.e., they have been around for the last 10 years. And in the last 10 years, we expanded our margin on a consistent basis in North America. So we -- of course, it's an intense competitive environment. But I think we've also impressively demonstrated that we can expand margins despite a highly competitive environment. 
In particular, when it comes to the onshoring of the 2 washing machine factories, as we always said, we welcome that because it's mainly a level playing field, and we feel very confident that we can compete in that environment. So as such, no, we did not see a negative impact on the broader competitive environment from the onshoring of their production. I would say it's pretty much the same intense environment. 
Particularly, as it relates to your question around the promotional environment, yes, in Q4, we saw a slight uptick on promotional intensity, particularly from 2 competitors but not the entire marketplace. And that doesn't entirely surprise us. But we've also seen that despite a broader market contraction, we delivered 13.3% EBIT margin in North America, which demonstrates that even in a promotional environment, even with the declining markets, we are able to deliver very, very strong margins."

And what we're seeing is, one, as we talked about going into 2020, a reduction in headwinds in terms of what we're seeing on materials. Tariffs were very stable within the quarter. So that was positive for us. And then we did make some investments similar to what you see on our walk for the whole quarter.

So when it comes to inflation, and let me first repeat what we said several times, we -- coming into 2019, we basically had a cumulative inflation of around $700 million in our business. That is the result of raw materials, tariffs, cost inflation throughout the entire value chain, in particular, in logistics. That was still in total headwind pretty much throughout mid-year 2019. And as of Q3, and in particular Q4, we saw that slowly coming around in terms of a total net cost takeout. 
If you break it down more in terms of the external factors on this one, yes, we saw globally a turn of the raw materials pretty much around Q3 and then more impact in Q4. And as you've seen in our guidance for 2020, we also expect another improvement on the raw material side. What has changed since our last earnings call is our outlook on the tariffs because in the last outlook we had to work with what was announced at that time. And based on what we know today now, the tariffs will not have a negative year-over-year impact. And as a result of that, we basically see this 0.5% margin expansion just coming from better raw materials. 
The other inflation elements like logistics or other cost elements, so far, we don't see yet turning around. So that is still working against us, and that's what we're trying to address. But again summarizing, I would describe 2020, we will see less of an inflationary environment, but it's not completely gone and it's certainly not reversed. And it's obviously our key operational priority to kind of double down and really improve our cost takeout throughout the entire system."

But in particular, when it comes to the core markets, and this may be -- is embedded in our overall unit number which we have for Europe, we had in our core markets growth in Q4.

So that will help drive us from a revenue perspective despite an industry being flat globally. 
The second thing is, as we mentioned, there's an incremental amount of price/mix in there, which also does help us on a revenue base. We assume that to be slightly positive for the year. So both of those, that would probably be the second biggest driver that I would say."

But the other element is we still have logistics costs which are elevated throughout the world. That is still a factor. The good news is we're making good progress on the fixed cost takeout in Europe and some other parts. We see some benefits from our global product architecture, so it's all coming to materialize. And yes, internally, our job over time is to tackle it more, in particular with the supply chain and logistics costs."

As you know, they are basically simplified by 2 major components in the industry demand: one is the replacement demand; we have one which is somewhat related to housing or remodeling. On the replacement, and that's a little bit the same like last year, we're now comping against the low years post-recession. And that had been around us for the last 1 or 2 years and probably will be around us for another year or so, just because you're comping against these low years. And that was already a factor in 2019. 
Coming into 2019, frankly, we expected more momentum coming out of housing. And of course, the -- and then again, we're now -- going back in time, Q4 '18, the weak housing impacted what we sold in the housing-related market in 2019. So the housing was, I would say, a little bit on the softer side compared to what we originally expected coming into 2019. 
As you turn the page in 2020, I would say we're reasonably optimistic on housing, but we just want to wait and see. What I mean with that is the initial data points which we got in December from housing were, in fact, very encouraging. But it's the first positive data points, and we want to see that stabilizing. I would also add when you look at the news from homebuilders, these were, in fact, very strong and very encouraging signs. But I also want to remind everybody, between an order of a new house and the actual appliance shipment, you typically have 9 to 12 months. So the good signs which we see now on the order side, it takes a while until it shows up in our revenue line. So -- but I would say, if housing stabilizes and sees more positive trends that we've seen in December, I would say that spells good news for our industry in first."

Beyond this one is -- of this coronavirus, from what you can see today, it may have 3 potential impacts: One is the China domestic market. Obviously, when people don't go into stores, the market will decline. You all know that our exposure to the China domestic market is limited. So yes, that's not going to hurt us a whole lot.
Two is then on production and three is on components. Production, China production is largely serving Asia; and to only a lesser extent, Europe; and to almost a very small extent, North America. 
As you know, North America, 80% of what we sell in North America or in U.S. is produced in U.S. So the bad exposure is somewhat limited, in particular with 1 factory where we export from China. It's almost a thousand miles away from Wuhan. So we're a little bit, I won't say protected, but it's a little bit further way. 
The third element is components. Keep in mind, this whole thing happens around the Chinese New Year. Every year around Chinese New Year, you plan with your supplier inventory levels, when they stop production, when they start production. I would say we're pretty well covered. We're also well covered for this 3 or 4 days of extension for Chinese New Year. And beyond this one, we got to see. And the other thing which you also need to keep in mind, throughout the last couple of years, the most critical components, we went aggressively for dual-sourcing. So we're not -- we're single-sourced only in very, very few components. We're largely dual-sourced, which gives you a little bit of a hedging."

Related to your question about retailers, yes, it's obvious that the kind of windfall which came out of a Sear's decline for many other retailers, that has diminished. I mean that's basically nonexisting. But right now, I would say it's a reasonably stable retail environment. The home improvement -- having a strong growth in home appliances, Best Buy being very well established, but also some other good regional players. So I think it's -- right now we don't see a dramatic move across the retail landscape. We've seen some ins and outs when it comes to inventory management of retailers.

How do you think about -- or what does that say to you about kind of the market that we're seeing some of these categories in a sustained growth challenging environment relative to, Marc, the fixed cost? Because this global architecture that you mentioned in the laundry seems to be a really important factor for Whirlpool given your global platform to kind of extract leverage from categories that really are challenged in terms of growth."

So that should help the cooking, the dishwasher, refrigeration business, but I would not get -- read too much into this one. So I wouldn't break down the pieces too much. I would say, right now our guidance for next year industry is pretty much flat. But very frankly, I think the uncertain factor to the upside could be the housing and how housing now develops, if that's stabilized and if we see the growth trends extending beyond the December number. But again, don't read too much into the different subcategories."

First of all, thank you for joining us all. And let me, given that we just came to the last question, let me just quickly wrap up and summarize. First of all, I want to start out -- with all the numbers in and out, I want to remind everybody, we had an all-time record year last year. We feel very good about it. And we closed an all-time record year with the best quarter ever in our history, which I think is more remarkable given that we did not have a lot of tailwinds throughout the year. Industry demand didn't help us. We still saw cost inflation throughout most parts of the year. So we feel very good about what we've achieved last year. But now we're in January 2020. The most important thing about last year is that it gave us a good momentum as we exited the year. So we feel very good about momentum, which we'll carry into 2020, and I hope you heard also that confidence throughout the earnings call. 
As we look into 2020, and we laid that out, we have 3 operational priorities: We are very focused on getting the cost out of the system. We are focused on executing the product launches, which we talked about. And obviously, there's a lot more launches beyond those 2 ones, which we highlighted. 
And from a regional perspective, of course, we have a key focus not only in maintaining strong margins in North America, but particularly turning -- continue to turn around Europe and China. That is a key focus. But then in a broader perspective, and this comes back to our Investor Day, I want to remind everybody, our strategy has not changed. Beyond the operational priorities and delivering on our commitments, we have a very strong focus on continuing to execute along our strategic imperatives, which is not only about product leadership, but it's our entire digital transformation, be it on redefining what the product is, be it on winning digital consumer journey. So there's a strong focus in our company around the strategic transformation, and we feel very good about where we are. And we will kind of increase our efforts throughout the year to kind of create a long-term, strong and sustainable business. 
With that in mind, I just want to thank you for joining us today, and talk to you next quarter."

Before we discuss our first quarter business results, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the unprecedented circumstances we're all currently experiencing and the efforts we have undertaken as an organization to support our people, consumers and communities. 
The health and safety of our employees continues to be our top priority as we navigate through this crisis. I'd like to take a moment to thank them for the hard work and ongoing efforts during this challenging time. These efforts began in early January with the creation of a cross-functional and cross-regional task force to aid in developing and driving globally aligned communications and action plans. In February, we took decisive action to ensure the safety of our 77,000 employees around the world, including banning all domestic and international employee travel while also ensuring our corporate and manufacturing locations abided by all local, state and federal guidelines and safety measures. Additionally, we implemented our work from home policy resulting in 95% of office roles now being performed remotely. Also, we continue to safely operate our plants and manage through periodic slowdowns and shutdowns as they arise. 
As it relates to business continuity, we took decisive actions in late January to ensure we were able to continue supplying our consumers with our essential products and services. These actions focused on ensuring ample supply of critical components and detailed review of inventory across key product categories. We also have remote enabled call centers that allow us to maintain reliable post-purchase service to our consumers. 
Now more than ever, families across the globe are relying on our products and services to take care of their families. They are depending on our products to clean, cook and to provide proper food and medicine storage in their homes while also providing a place in the kitchen for them to come together as a family. 
Finally, we took a number of actions to give back to local communities in which we operate, including providing funding to support COVID-19 research in local hospitals, donations of PPE and appliances to hospitals and organizations as well as providing additional donations to local food bank shareholders and small businesses. 
Overall, thanks to the strong actions and efforts of our teams, we've been able to significantly limit the number of cases in our companies around the globe. 
Turning to Slide 5, I'm highly confident in our ability to manage through these uncertain times, and I strongly believe that we have the right actions in place to protect our operating margins and the financial strength to protect our liquidity position throughout 2020. Thanks to the hard work of our employees and our relentless focus on delivering on our commitments to consumers, we delivered strong Q1 results, demonstrating our resilience as an organization. As the depth and the duration of this crisis remains unknown, we are taking strong actions to mitigate the anticipated impact of volume deleveraging and sustain our operating margins. Further, we have positioned ourselves well with ample liquidity and the financial flexibility required to weather this current crisis.  Lastly, we remain committed to investing in our future while also taking actions now to win during the eventual economic rebound. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Jim to review our first quarter results."

On Slide 7, we show our first quarter 2020 highlights. We delivered organic net sales in line with the prior year with an ongoing EBIT margin and EPS of 6.1% and $2.82, respectively, highlighting the resilience of our global operations given the growing impact of COVID-19 throughout the quarter. Our North America, Latin America, and Europe/Middle East/Africa regions demonstrated their strength and agility, delivering solid year-over-year margin results despite operational disruptions related to COVID-19. Lastly, we delivered free cash flow improvement of approximately $100 million due to strong working capital management particularly in accounts receivable and inventory. 
Turning to Slide 8, we show the drivers of our first quarter EBIT margin. Price/mix negatively impacted margins by 175 basis points due to onetime product transition expenses and unfavorable product mix shifts due to COVID-19 related consumer purchases. As we highlighted on our Q4 call, we launched new lines of dish and laundry products in Q1 2020 driving a onetime transition expense of approximately 75 basis points. Furthermore, as consumer behaviors change due to COVID-19 safety guidelines, we saw increased demand for microwaves, low-end refrigerators and freezers resulting in negative price/mix. Although we expect product transition expenses to return to normal levels in the second quarter, we expect these changes in consumer purchases to be a headwind during the crisis. This unfavorable margin impact was fully offset by accelerated cost takeout actions and favorable raw materials leading to a margin impact of 175 basis points. Lastly, strong cost discipline related to marketing and technology investments partially offset the impact of currency. 
Overall, we are pleased to deliver margins in line with the prior year. This is indicative of our strong cost discipline across the globe and we are confident these actions will continue to sustain our 2020 margins. 
Turning to Slide 9, I'll review our first quarter regional results. In North America, we saw a stable industry for the quarter and delivered net sales in line with the prior year. Additionally, we delivered EBIT margins of nearly 12% as strong cost discipline partially offset negative price/mix related to increased product transition expenses and lower mix related to COVID-19 consumer purchases. 
In our Europe/Middle East/Africa region, we experienced positive industry demand across key countries through mid-February. However, the growing impact of COVID-19 resulted in operational disruptions and demand declines towards the end of February and throughout March, particularly in Italy and France. We are pleased to see continued momentum from our cost reduction and strategic initiatives, which delivered the fifth consecutive quarter of EBIT improvement with margins expanding 40 basis points despite significant COVID-19 demand and operational disruptions. Although we expect to see intensified demand pressure in the second quarter, we remain confident that our underlying business continues to make strong progress in our return to profitability. 
In Latin America, we saw solid industry demand across Brazil and Mexico, along with strong share gains in Brazil, driving organic net sales growth of over 20%. EBIT margins were approximately flat compared to the prior year as strong cost discipline offset currency devaluation in Brazil. Finally, as a reminder, our first quarter 2019 results include the impact of the Embraco compressor business in Latin America's results. 
In our Asia region, revenue declined over 20% as China demand declined sharply in the quarter due to COVID-19 related disruptions. This was followed by a government enforced shutdown in India which has now been extended into early May. In China, our manufacturing facilities have returned to normal operating levels and we have seen demand stabilize with some initial indications of a rebound as consumers slowly reenter the marketplace. 
Overall, we are very pleased with our first quarter EBIT margin results of 6.1%, given the approximately 150 basis point EBIT margin impact from COVID-19. These results clearly demonstrate the agility and resiliency of our global operations. 
Turning to Slide 11, Mark and I will discuss our current perspective on 2020. I will now turn it over to Mark to begin."
314515,645580026,1967889,"Whirlpool Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 01, 2020",2020-05-01,"Earnings Calls","Whirlpool Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim. The broader macroeconomic environment continuing to rapidly evolve, the full impact of COVID-19 on our business results remain highly uncertain and we're unable to provide a meaningful full year guidance at this time. That said, we want to pr",931,"Thanks, Jim. The broader macroeconomic environment continuing to rapidly evolve, the full impact of COVID-19 on our business results remain highly uncertain and we're unable to provide a meaningful full year guidance at this time. That said, we want to provide the answers to 3 fundamental questions which I'll go into more detail on the following slides. 
First, what's the shape of a recovery? In this section, I'll provide an overview of the current sell-through trends in key countries, and an update on our full year net sales expectations. We anticipate a U-type recovery throughout 2020 resulting in a full year organic net sales decline of 10% to 15%. Second, can we sustain our operating margin? Here, I will discuss the fundamental difference in our margin profile entering the COVID-19 crisis compared to the 2008 recession and also highlight the additional cost actions we will drive throughout 2020 to help sustain our operating margins. Thirdly, what's our liquidity position? Finally, Jim will discuss our strong cash and liquidity position which will allow us to cope with the economic uncertainty we continue to face across the globe. 
Turning to Slide 12, I'll highlight the preliminary data that supports our perspective of a U-shaped recovery throughout 2020. Please note that we do not intend to share this data going forward but we felt, given the uncertainty of the current situation, that this data will provide valuable proof points as we all assess the impact of COVID-19. As we monitor the development of COVID-19 cases and its related impact on appliance demand within China, Italy and the U.S., we've begun to see similar U-shaped demand patterns emerge. China, we see clear signs of a U-shape demand pattern with recovery closely linked, although slightly lagging to the reduction of new t1 cases.  Turning to Slide 13, while Italy's trends are not as mature as China, the demand patterns are well in line. Turning to Slide 14, U.S. is obviously at an earlier stage of battling the COVID-19. Early signs point to similar U-shape demand trend as seen in China and Italy.  It is important to note, however, that the demand decline in the United States is clearly not as pronounced as in China and Italy, and we are currently experiencing sell-out declines of around 20% to 25%, which is less than half of what we've seen in other markets. We see 2 reasons for this fundamental difference in demand patterns. One, the U.S. has a very significant portion of replacement sales of more than 50% of our total industry, and two, the home improvement channel [ kept ] stores opened during this crisis, allowing consumers to continue purchasing appliances. Based on the consistent demand trends we are seeing across 3 of our key countries, each at different phases of crisis, we are expecting a full year 2020 organic net sales decline of 10% to 15%, with a majority of the decline occurring in the second quarter, followed by a slow recovery in the third quarter and a slight growth in fourth quarter.
Turning to Slide 15, the EBIT margin chart highlights the clear difference in starting position entering the COVID-19 crisis compared to the 2008 financial crisis. In the quarters preceding the 2008 financial crisis, we delivered EBIT margins of about 5%. Upon entering the 2008 financial crisis, we saw EBIT margins drop sharply to around 3.5% before bottoming out at a negative 1% in the fourth quarter of 2008. Contrast this with our current starting point in which we recently delivered 2019, ongoing EBIT margin of 7% or greater from second quarter on and over 6% margins in the first quarter of 2020, inclusive of 150 basis points impact of COVID-19. 
We are starting from a fundamentally stronger place due to the decisive actions we took post 2008 recession. We took many difficult but necessary actions related to the fixed cost structure of our business, including restructuring actions, plant optimizations and the exit of certain nonprofitable product segments, ensuring that we would be able to withstand the next crisis. Since that time, we remain disciplined in our approach to fixed cost management. Fixed cost discipline has structurally improved our margin profile allowing us to up enter this crisis in a position of strength. 
Turning to Slide 16, I'll discuss the additional strong actions put in place to sustain our margins over the near term. First, as our teams monitored the spread of COVID-19 from Asia to Europe -- I meant to U.S. and beyond, our operational teams acted early and decisively to ensure we appropriately matched inventory levels and our supply base to demand. Second, we aggressively target significant reductions in both structural and discretionary costs, including a reduction in discretionary marketing and promotion spend and strict headcount control across all regions as well as unpaid leave, furloughs among our actions. In parallel, we implemented a controlled trial process and put rigorous guidelines in place to manage our expenses going forward. Third, we continue to focus on ensuring we capitalize on the deflationary raw materials market. Finally, we've maintained our strict focus on working capital management, ensuring we have a proper risk mitigation plan in place through sourcing strategies enacted and are appropriately managing our inventory levels across the globe. 
With these additional actions in place, we are now targeting over $500 million in net cost and raw material savings in 2020, up over $300 million from our previous guidance. 
Moving to Slide 17, I now turn it over to Jim to highlight our overall financial position and ability to weather this current crisis."

As a result of the strategic actions we took leading up to this crisis, we entered the crisis with a strong balance sheet. First, we have a very strong liquidity position as evidenced by our current cash position of $2.8 billion, with approx",348,"Thanks, Mark. As a result of the strategic actions we took leading up to this crisis, we entered the crisis with a strong balance sheet. First, we have a very strong liquidity position as evidenced by our current cash position of $2.8 billion, with approximately $2 billion available in remaining committed credit facilities. This is inclusive of a recently executed $500 million short-term credit facility. Second, anchored by our strong balance sheet, we maintain ample buffer to withstand increased debt or a reduction in earnings without tripping our covenants. Our debt to capitalization limit is 0.65 and we are currently at approximately 0.5 while our interest coverage ratio requires a minimum of 3x and we are currently above 10x. 
Third, we have access to additional levers to unlock cash. We continue to evaluate additional liquidity options. And from an operational standpoint, we will continue to effectively manage our working capital. Fourth, I'd like to highlight that we refinanced EUR 500 million of long-term debt in February this year and have no additional bond maturities until the second quarter of 2021. Furthermore, I'd like to remind everyone that we pre-funded our U.S. pension in 2018 which effectively suspended our need to make further payments until 2023 or beyond. It is through our strong financial position and our continued actions that we strive to maintain our investment-grade credit rating. 
Lastly, I'd like to touch on our capital allocation plans which have temporarily changed in light of our current situation. Although we repurchased approximately $120 million in shares in the first quarter we will be suspending additional share repurchases until our future liquidity needs become clear. That said, we did declare our quarterly dividend and remain strongly committed to returning value to shareholders through these difficult economic times. 
Overall, we are confident that we have the liquidity needed to support our operations during this crisis and remain focused on our long-term commitment to our gross debt-to-EBITDA goal of 2x. 
Now on Slide 18, I'll turn it back over to Mark to discuss why we're well-positioned to win in the economic recovery."

I'd like to take a moment now to discuss how we are well-positioned to capitalize on the eventual economic rebound in the short term while simultaneously well-positioned for future growth over the long term. Throughout this crisis, where necessary we have slowed our operations, adjusting operating line layouts and speed to adapt to government orders, new safety guidelines and dramatic shifts in appliance demand. This will allow us to quickly respond to positive demand changes and rapidly ramp up to normal level of operations. Additionally, we anticipate there will be pent-up demand in the short-term as discretionary purchases have largely been delayed. 
As a clear leader in home appliances across the globe, we are extremely well-positioned to capture this demand upon its return.  To further take advantage of recovery, we are leveraging our best-in-class manufacturing supply chain operations, remaining agile in our approach to production and inventory management. 
As we look longer term, we believe that we are uniquely structured to take advantage of post-crisis demand changes. One of the changes we expect to remain is the rediscovery of the home and the kitchen as a center of living. Needless to say, this will be a positive catalyst for our entire industry and our unmatched brand portfolio and innovation pipeline clearly give us a head start in capitalizing on this trend. 
Additionally, we are anticipating an acceleration in the adoption of online purchasing for large home appliances post crisis. As such, the investments we have and continue to make in e-commerce and in direct-to-consumer sales as part of our digital transformation journey are key levers of our long-term growth. 
Lastly, we remain committed to our ESG priorities. As highlighted in our recently released sustainability report, we have a long-standing history of investing in the safety and well-being of our employees and the environmental efficiency of our products and operations and in support of the communities we call home. 
In closing, I'd like to summarize our key messages on Slide 19. We remain committed to the health and safety of our employees around the globe and will continue to adapt our policies and procedures as the situation with COVID-19 continues to unfold. Our Q1 results highlight the strength and the resilience of our business, and we will continue to take decisive cost actions to ensure the health and viability of our business for the long-term with a continued focus on sustaining strong margin throughout the crisis. Additionally, we have ample liquidity to weather any demand recovery scenario and remain fully committed to driving our business towards our leverage goal of 2x over the long term. 
Further, we are well-prepared to swiftly ramp up operations and leverage our global leadership position to win in the eventual economic recovery. It is because of these actions and the strong experience of our management team that we're confident in our ability to weather this crisis and emerge in a position of strength. We remain firmly focused on executing our business priorities and are fully committed to driving strong shareholder returns. 
Now we will end our formal remarks and open up for questions."

First, I was hoping to get a sense of decrementals, and I apologize if I missed that in some of the opening comments. But particularly what I think a lot of companies have done and by the way almost none of them have kind of laid out their thoughts for a full year sales impact. So very much appreciate that perspective. But one of the other areas that I think has been helpful is to try and get a sense of how to think about decrementals in the second quarter. Which certainly, generally speaking are the most extreme given some of the abrupt shutdown inefficiencies that occur and how those decrementals might improve throughout the year as the cost savings that you've outlined that kick in?"

Let me maybe just take your question and split it up in 2 pieces. First of all, obviously, everything depends now on the revenue assumptions. And the overall demand pattern where we all recognize there's a very significant amount of uncertainty. And -- but I think our perspective and today with the information which we have is a U-shape recovery. Or demand development, which means we expect the majority of a negative demand to occur in Q2. I do expect a slight drag still in Q3 and Q4 recovery. So that gives you a little bit of a sense of what we anticipate from a broad demand perspective. That being said, that also means we have the biggest deleveraging effect on operations in the second quarter and maybe some elements also in the third quarter. As we -- and I think we mentioned that in some previous earnings call. Of course, the leverage effect you have on production is extremely different by production type, factory, occupational level, et cetera. But I think as a rough, and I underline a very rough, rule of thumb, you can obviously assume about 18% to 20% is our leverage factor, i.e., every dollar you lose is about $0.20 of deleveraging. I think it's however very important to highlight that in the significant increase of our net cost takeout we already factored in the negative effect which we will have from our deleveraging. So that is all factored in on the cost side. Of course, the margin side is a different one. So we anticipate that we can absorb it which is not going to be easy and on top of that increase our net cost take out."

And then the heart of the question for my second question really is if you could give us a sense of the breakdown of that 500 million of net cost takeouts across the different buckets that you manage, if any of those might be temporary, that you could layer back in, in a 2021 timeframe, commensurate with improvement in demand?"

So Michael, first of all, to clarify, the 500 million is a full year, and we haven't given the specification about how much comes in Q2 and Q3. But as you can imagine, it takes a little to ramp it up. But to be clear, the 500 is after already all these inefficiencies. So that is net-net of everything. So it's a pretty clean number. So it's after the negative impact of deleveraging. In terms of a composition of 500 and as you may recall, in the opening earnings call of this year, we roughly indicated about a 200 million. So what you have in between first of all as you indicated, you lose some. And that's the inefficiencies, which are -- I mean, you take the number which we gave you before. And you also have a negative currency impact because a lot of materials we buy, for example, in Brazil, we have a negative currency impact. On the good side, you have a slightly better raw material, which we have factored in. But then in addition, we have very significant expense control, expense management, SG&A efforts and also people cost. And that is a combination of both, to your point, kind of temporary actions but also structural actions. So it's not only temporary actions. So there is quite a bit of structural cost take out which we have factored in, in the 500. But again, I want to reemphasize, it's after all these negative deleveraging effects."

Mark, just a follow-up on the last line of questions. I guess, if I'm thinking about that bridge and applying 20% decrementals on your full year sales guide and then adding back some cost takeout, it seems to suggest that the math would get you to EBIT that's only modestly down for the year and I think margin percentage would actually be up. So I guess I'm just struggling to bridge that a little because a number of other companies have talked about more like 40% decrementals, 2x normal. And then after a cost takeout, maybe getting back towards normal. So it just seems -- I appreciate you guys are around that tailwinds, but it seems a little out of sync with what we're hearing from some others. So maybe a little more color on that, please."

And let me first start and maybe Jim is also going to answer this one. First of all, on the -- specifically on question, raw materials, yes, we see a slightly more positive tailwind from raw materials. But as I mentioned before, keep in mind,",276,"So Michael. And let me first start and maybe Jim is also going to answer this one. First of all, on the -- specifically on question, raw materials, yes, we see a slightly more positive tailwind from raw materials. But as I mentioned before, keep in mind, about half of that additional tailwind is already eaten up with currency losses. So on a full year base compared to what we had before, maybe give you  a quarter to half a point more takeout from pure raw materials. But it's not as dramatic as you may assume because steel prices are largely locked in because these are annual contracts. You have a little bit of incremental benefit on plastic and resins, but that's about it. Having said all that, so yes, our 500 million net cost takeout that is our big lever which we have to protect our operating margins. We have not given and will not give a full year margin guideline because there's a lot of other parameters coming into place. But yes, that's our tool to protect our margins. But keep also in mind you have even on the top line, not only the overall revenue growth, but the mix, which -- and that is not very untypical from a prior recession, but mix you should expect throughout the crisis is slightly negative. So you you can't anticipate the same kind of positive price margin effect as we've seen in the last 1 or 2 years. Because in economic crisis is not necessarily be environment where you get a huge positive mix. So you have a negative mix also in a full year assumption."

We -- for once, I want to share with you, just to give you also same kind of information as we look at it every day. With that in mind, in particular U.S. question, the 20 25 is revenue related because as you highlighted, on top of volume, you have a slight negative mix. And that's -- again, that's not atypical for these kind of recessions. I think it's -- and I want to reemphasize what I all said earlier is I think what we -- and that's good news, well, relatively speaking, good news relative to some other markets. We do not see the U.S. market dropping as much as we've seen in Italy, France or China. Very simple because of a high degree or high percentage of replacement demand. And the fact that we still have home improvement, but also some independent retailers open right now. So the consumer has a place to go and fulfill that replacement need. And that's a fundamental difference in the U.S. compared to many of the other markets which we see throughout the world."

And again, if you look back to 2008 and 2009 and what we did with fixed costs, back then, and we're able to keep it out till now, it will be the same thing as we continue to reduce our cost level, but those will be benefits that will be seen more in 2021 and beyond as things begin to stabilize. I think the other unknown as I talk about this year is we do have a lot of currency fluctuation within there. That could also have an impact on our bottom line at least in the near term.

So in a certain way, that tells you how much progress we've done in the cost takeout in getting this business in a much better structural run rate.

In very simple terms, you got to look at the supply chain stability from 2 perspectives. One, how do you keep your factories up and running? And two, how can you make sure your components keep on coming into the factories. On the factories, we made early on the conscious decision to keep our factories running even though at a much lower pace and much lower volume. And in a certain we basically ran them very inefficiently because our assumption is that even a slow but steady supply chain is better than a stop and go. Now obviously, we still had to follow sometimes certain government lockdowns or in some cases, we had to clean and sanitize a factory, but at any given time over the last weeks, we had 80% to 85% of our factories running. So the factories are in a pretty stable and good situation. Now in components, as you can imagine, our first focus on components supply and steady was related to China. That was our first area of concern. And I would say an extraordinary amount of effort and how work our team was able to get the supply chain situation in China in control. And we did not -- not with our challenges, but we did not experience any significant component shortages coming out of China. Right now, our focus, as you alluded to, is a little bit of Mexico, because the Mexico guidelines have not been synchronized with the guidelines of Canada and U.S. So we had some issues of stop and go of certain players. I think we're being worked through, but they have not been completely resolved, but we remain confident they will be resolved in the next coming weeks."

I mean, if anybody knows exactly the shape of a recovery, then good luck. As you know, there has been all letters of the Alphabet being used to describe a potential form of recovery.

It would be -- we would love to see it. I just don't think it's happening. And at this point, you also cannot exclude an L-shape kind of development of its own prices. But again, I would arguably add right now, which we see are in paper U-shape. The reason why we say that is -- again, as I mentioned before, for 2 reasons. One is the early demand patterns, which we see coming out of the China market, some European markets clearly point toward the U-shape. And it's very different from financial recession because the depth of the crisis is more severe than financial crisis, but it appears from what we see from these markets that the kind of duration of the crisis is [indiscernible]. The other reason, and again, that's probably more macroeconomic, we should also not lose sight of this coronavirus falls on a different environment than it did in 2008. There is no housing bubble. Quite the opposite. The financial institutions are in a much stronger shape than we were in 2018. I think it's a different macroeconomic context where the coronavirus happened. But again, that's right now our most likely assumption. I think time will tell. Is it a U? Is it an L? We believe it's a U, but not an immediate recovery before Q4."

So we started the year pretty well which is probably a good indication of our listings, which we got with different retailers. But now we, of course, like everybody else, being hit with a virus. But I'm actually pretty confident that we can pick up on where we started in Q1. I would also argue, because of a very, very strong supply chain management in Europe where we limited the number of factory closures really to be bare minimum. Our supply base inventory situation and stability of the supply base is actually a pretty good one. So we're confident we can get out of a gate pretty good. We have good availability always with some limitations, but given what the overall crisis did to everybody, we're in a pretty good shape to come out of this one."

As you know, first of all, from a broader environment, the U.S. market is compared to other international markets, still with heavy buys on the in-store as opposed to the e-commerce market, which, of course, right now, in the crisis, the ecommerce side has increased quite a bit, but it's still a very store-based shopping purchase in the U.S. So as such, what we saw in the channels right now is heavily driven by which stores were open. And that's just reality. And a lot will depend on Q2 in terms of at what pace do closed stores come back online and are reopening. That's I think how you should read it. But right now, in the broader scheme, yes, by definition, what we saw in March and April, there is a heavy shift towards the home improvement channel in the U.S. And again, that's entirely driven by store openings. To your point about the mix, and again, it's not atypical what we saw so versus 2008 and 2009. Particularly in the outset of this crisis, you see a heavy mix down. And particularly now there was -- when people were holding, they bought a freezer, they bought a second fridge, and these don't come with high mix. Typically, and what we see also already happening in China, that starts stabilizing as the crisis progresses. But for the premium and super premium purchase to then pick up, I think you will still have to wait a couple of quarters. And then again, that's not entirely surprising because that's a discretionary purchase which is often driven by an entire kitchen remodel. So I think until we see a really rich part of the mix coming back, I think we will talk a couple of quarters. Yes. I think just to kind of add to what Mark said is the 3/4 of a point that we saw due to the new product introductions, we had anticipated that. And that was built into our estimate at the beginning of the year. But Q1 and Q2 is when we'll see more just the shift in mix due to the crisis. And then that will eventually come back to a more normal level."

So Ken, first of all, on the replacement, as we said in earlier conference calls, right now for 2020, we assume that the replacement -- part of entire industry demand is more than 50%.

I think what 52% or 53%, what we gave you as a number. So if we see a market decline, that comes out of a non replacement side of a business, so as a percentage, is now even higher, but it's in absolute terms, that's a pretty steady number from replacement. And we also clearly positioned that replacement side almost as a floor of a market because we're still comping against the low years of 2008, 2009, 2010. So we feel pretty good. That's the floor, and it will not drop a whole lot further. So that's a steady side. The high end discretionary one is, I think, where you in the short term, and I would say, 2 to 4 quarters, you will see still some negative, and that's not surprising. And by the way, very, very similar to what we've seen in 2009 and 2010. Particularly in your question about the new homes and the builder channel, keep in mind we are at the very tail end of any house completion. Blinds are one of the last products which come into any build. And as you all have seen with the builders, the builders had a very strong order intake and starts pretty much until early March, mid-March. I think there has now been some drops in late March and April. But the projects and the houses which the builders have started they will complete. So we do see from our side certainly in Q2 and Q3 still a very steady stream of new homes and what we do there with the appliances. The key question, of course, is when how does the broader builder markets now develop. And I think there's arguments made why it will continue to grow, like below mortgage rates and fundamental demand still. But of course, consumer confidence will play a key factor. As long as this overall recession is limited in duration, I don't think we will see a major lasting impact on consumer confidence. But of course, that's 1 of the big uncertain elements right now."

But specifically, I mean, we keep going into this. So your fixed costs are lower. You guys removed a lot of fixed cost last cycle. With the cost -- so obviously, a lot of your 20% -- you have a lot of variable costs. So with the material declines that you expect being the 500 million, can you just -- is it really that fixed cost is different that is supporting the math because the labor -- the material costs you're following, but is it really the fixed cost that is so different in 2020 if sales were down high single digits in the U.S. versus what we saw in '08?"

And so what you were seeing is that we kept the fixed cost as we grew revenues and grew volumes across the globe and especially within the U.S. and now as we've had the decline, it's not as significant as it was back then as an impact to our bottom line because of that already low fixed cost base we're starting on.

First of all, if you compare 2008 to the current one, the starting point of our margins in 2008 coming into the crisis were lower. And as you've seen on my chart, in the first quarter, as a company in total, North America, we basically barely made a profit. Actually, we had a small loss on the EBIT base. Now fast forward to the current one, the volume drop right now and that's what we forecasted is more than a financial crisis. So under normal circumstances, if you would take out 2008 picture, yes, that will be very painful for us. But going back to Jim's point, we manage fixed cost to put that differently our breakeven point in all the factories is significantly lower than it was before. So we will be able to absorb that volume loss in a much better way than we did in 2018. And that's been the work over the last couple of years. The other comment I also want to make is yes the coronavirus as such, yes, you can call it black swan event, which came with our preannouncement. The recession as such is not a complete shock. And we've been working already over the last year on additional cost take-out on balance sheet measures. So and matters just allowed us to now ramp up a cost take-out even more so compared to 2008. And that's -- and we started that in not just now. We started pretty much some time ago and we just ramped it up in addition. So I think the situation is very different. Our preparedness is a little bit different. And our fundamental starting point and breakeven point in factories is very different."

And then we also reduced some of our marketing and technology expenses as we just put strict controls on some of our discretionary spending. I think as you think about this for the rest of the year, obviously, that rate will ramp up throughout the year.

So we feel pretty good about that number. I think the point which you asked earlier can replacement purchases be delayed, I would say, to a very limited extent. And again, that's where you have some experience from 2008, 2009 helps. So a dishwasher which can be replaced or need to be replaced, yes, bank can be delayed. But even in 2008 and 2009, we didn't see these kind of things delayed more than 1 or 2 quarters. A washer or refrigerator replacement will not be delayed.

Before we discuss our first quarter business results, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the unprecedented circumstances we're all currently experiencing and the efforts we have undertaken as an organization to support our people, consumers and communities.
The health and safety of our employees continues to be our top priority as we navigate through this crisis. I'd like to take a moment to thank them for the hard work and ongoing efforts during this challenging time. These efforts began in early January with the creation of a cross-functional and cross-regional task force to aid in developing and driving globally aligned communications and action plans. In February, we took decisive action to ensure the safety of our 77,000 employees around the world, including banning all domestic and international employee travel while also ensuring our corporate and manufacturing locations abide by all local state and federal guidelines and safety measures. Additionally, we implemented our work-from-home policy, resulting in 95% of office roles now being performed remotely. Also, we continue to safely operate our plants and manage through periodic slowdowns and shutdowns as they arise.
As it relates to business continuity, we took decisive actions in late January to ensure we were able to continue supplying our consumers with our essential products and services. These actions focused on ensuring ample supply of critical components and detailed review of inventory across key product categories. We also have remote-enabled call centers that allow us to maintain reliable post-purchase service to our consumers. Now more than ever, families across the globe are relying on our products and services to take care of their families. They are depending on our products to clean, cook and to provide proper food and medicine storage in their homes while also providing a place in the kitchen for them to come together as a family.
Finally, we took a number of actions to give back to local communities in which we operate, including providing funding to support COVID-19 research in local hospitals, donations of PPE and appliances to hospitals and organizations as well as providing additional donations to local food bank shelters and small businesses.  
Overall, thanks to the strong actions and efforts of our teams, we've been able to significantly limit the number of cases in our companies around the globe.  
Turning to Slide 5, I'm highly confident in our ability to manage through these uncertain times, and I strongly believe that we have the right actions in place to protect our operating margins and the financial strength to protect our liquidity position throughout 2020. Thanks to the hard work of our employees and our relentless focus on delivering on our commitments to consumers, we delivered strong Q1 results, demonstrating our resilience as an organization. As the depth and the duration of this crisis remains unknown, we are taking strong actions to mitigate the anticipated impact of volume deleveraging and sustain our operating margins. Further, we have positioned ourselves well with ample liquidity and the financial flexibility required to weather this current crisis.
Lastly, we remain committed to investing in our future while also taking actions now to win during the eventual economic rebound.
Now I'd like to turn it over to Jim to review our first quarter results."

Turning to Slide 8, we show the drivers of our first quarter EBIT margin. Price/mix negatively impacted margins by 175 basis points due to onetime product transition expenses and unfavorable product mix shifts due to COVID-19-related consumer purchases. As we highlighted on our Q4 call, we launched new lines of dish and laundry products in Q1 2020, driving a onetime transition expense of approximately 75 basis points. Furthermore, as consumer behaviors change due to COVID-19 safety guidelines, we saw increased demand for microwaves, low-end refrigerators and freezers resulting in negative price/mix. Although we expect product transition expenses to return to normal levels in the second quarter, we expect these changes in consumer purchases to be a headwind during the crisis. This unfavorable margin impact was fully offset by accelerated cost takeout actions and favorable raw materials leading to a margin impact of 175 basis points. Lastly, strong cost discipline related to marketing and technology investments partially offset the impact of currency. Overall, we are pleased to deliver margins in line with the prior year. This is indicative of our strong cost discipline across the globe and we are confident these actions will continue to sustain our 2020 margins.
Turning to Slide 9, I'll review our first quarter regional results. In North America, we saw a stable industry for the quarter and delivered net sales in line with the prior year. Additionally, we delivered EBIT margins of nearly 12% as strong cost discipline partially offset negative price/mix related to increased product transition expenses and lower mix related to COVID-19 consumer purchases.  
In our Europe, Middle East and Africa region, we experienced positive industry demand across key countries through mid-February. However, the growing impact of COVID-19 resulted in operational disruptions and demand declines towards the end of February and throughout March, particularly in Italy and France. We are pleased to see continued momentum from our cost reduction and strategic initiatives, which delivered the fifth consecutive quarter of EBIT improvement with margins expanding 40 basis points despite significant COVID-19 demand and operational disruptions. Although we expect to see intensified demand pressure in the second quarter, we remain confident that our underlying business continues to make strong progress in our return to profitability.
In Latin America, we saw solid industry demand across Brazil and Mexico, along with strong share gains in Brazil, driving organic net sales growth of over 20%. EBIT margins were approximately flat compared to the prior year as strong cost discipline offset currency devaluation in Brazil. Finally, as a reminder, our first quarter 2019 results include the impact of the Embraco compressor business in Latin America's results.
In our Asia region, revenue declined over 20% as China demand declined sharply in the quarter due to COVID-19-related disruptions. This was followed by a government-enforced shutdown in India which has now been extended into early May. In China, our manufacturing facilities have returned to normal operating levels and we have seen demand stabilize with some initial indications of a rebound as consumers slowly reenter the marketplace.  
Overall, we are very pleased with our first quarter EBIT margin results of 6.1% given the approximately 150 basis point EBIT margin impact from COVID-19. These results clearly demonstrate the agility and resiliency of our global operations.
Turning to Slide 11, Marc and I will discuss our current perspective on 2020. I will now turn it over to Marc to begin."

The broader macroeconomic environment continuing to rapidly evolve, the full impact of COVID-19 on our business results remain highly uncertain and we're unable to provide a meaningful full year guidance at this time. That said, we want to provide the answers to 3 fundamental questions, which I'll go into more detail on the following slides.  
First, what's the shape of a recovery? In this section, I'll provide an overview of the current sell-through trends in key countries, and an update on our full year net sales expectations. We anticipate a U-type recovery throughout 2020, resulting in a full year organic net sales decline of 10% to 15%. Second, can we sustain our operating margin? Here, I will discuss the fundamental difference in our margin profile entering the COVID-19 crisis compared to the 2008 recession and also highlight the additional cost actions we will drive throughout 2020 to help sustain our operating margins. Thirdly, what's our liquidity position? Finally, Jim will discuss our strong cash and liquidity position which will allow us to cope with the economic uncertainty we continue to face across the globe.  
Turning to Slide 12, I'll highlight the preliminary data that supports our perspective of a U-shaped recovery throughout 2020. Please note that we do not intend to share this data going forward but we felt, given the uncertainty of the current situation, that this data will provide valuable proof points as we all assess the impact of COVID-19. As we monitor the development of COVID-19 cases and its related impact on appliance demand within China, Italy and the U.S., we've begun to see similar U-shaped demand patterns emerge. China, we see clear signs of a U-shaped demand pattern with recovery closely linked, although slightly lagging to the reduction of new COVID-19 cases.
Turning to Slide 13, while Italy's trends are not as mature as China's, the demand patterns are well in line. 
Turning to Slide 14, even though the U.S. is obviously at an earlier stage of battling the COVID-19, early signs point to a similar U-shaped demand trend as seen in China and Italy. It is important to note, however, that the demand decline in the United States is clearly not as pronounced as in China and Italy, and we are currently experiencing sell-out declines of around 20% to 25%, which is less than half of what we've seen in other markets. We see 2 reasons for this fundamental difference in demand patterns. One, the U.S. has a very significant portion of replacement sales of more than 50% of our total industry, and two, the home improvement channel kept stores open during this crisis, allowing consumers to continue purchasing appliances. Based on the consistent demand trends we are seeing across 3 of our key countries, each at different phases of crisis, we are expecting a full year 2020 organic net sales decline of 10% to 15%, with a majority of the decline occurring in the second quarter, followed by a slow recovery in the third quarter and a slight growth in fourth quarter.
Turning to Slide 15, the EBIT margin chart highlights the clear difference in starting position entering the COVID-19 crisis compared to the 2008 financial crisis. In the quarters preceding the 2008 financial crisis, we delivered EBIT margins of about 5%. Upon entering the 2008 financial crisis, we saw EBIT margins drop sharply to around 3.5% before bottoming out at a negative 1% in the fourth quarter of 2008. Contrast this with our current starting point in which we recently delivered 2019 ongoing EBIT margin of 7% or greater from second quarter on and over 6% margins in the first quarter of 2020, inclusive of 150 basis points impact of COVID-19. We are starting from a fundamentally stronger place due to the decisive actions we took post 2008 recession. We took many difficult but necessary actions related to the fixed cost structure of our business, including restructuring actions, plant optimizations and the exit of certain nonprofitable product segments, ensuring that we would be able to withstand the next crisis. Since that time, we've remain disciplined in our approach to fixed cost management. Fixed cost discipline has structurally improved our margin profile allowing us to enter this crisis in a position of strength.
Turning to Slide 16, I'll discuss the additional strong actions put in place to sustain our margins over the near term. First, as our teams monitored the spread of COVID-19 from Asia to Europe and then to U.S. and beyond, our operational teams acted early and decisively to ensure we appropriately matched inventory levels and our supply base to demand. Second, we aggressively target significant reductions in both structural and discretionary costs, including a reduction in discretionary marketing and promotion spend and strict headcount control across all regions as well as unpaid leave, furloughs among our actions. In parallel, we implemented a controlled trial process and put rigorous guidelines in place to manage our expenses going forward. Third, we continue to focus on ensuring we capitalize on the deflationary raw materials market. Finally, we've maintained our strict focus on working capital management, ensuring we have a proper risk mitigation plan in place, dual-sourcing strategies enacted and are appropriately managing our inventory levels across the globe.  
With these additional actions in place, we are now targeting over $500 million in net cost and raw material savings in 2020, up over $300 million from our previous guidance.
Moving to Slide 17, I now turn it over to Jim to highlight our overall financial position and ability to weather this current crisis."

As a result of the strategic actions we took leading up to this crisis, we entered the crisis with a strong balance sheet. First, we have a very strong liquidity position as evidenced by our current cash position of $2.8 billion, with approximately $2 billion available in remaining committed credit facilities. This is inclusive of a recently executed $500 million short-term credit facility. Second, anchored by our strong balance sheet, we maintain ample buffer to withstand increased debt or a reduction in earnings without tripping our covenants. Our debt-to-capitalization limit is 0.65 and we are currently at approximately 0.5, while our interest coverage ratio requires a minimum of 3x and we are currently above 10x. Third, we have access to additional levers to unlock cash. We continue to evaluate additional liquidity options and from an operational standpoint, we will continue to effectively manage our working capital. Fourth, I'd like to highlight that we refinanced EUR 500 million of long-term debt in February this year and have no additional bond maturities until the second quarter of 2021. Furthermore, I'd like to remind everyone that we pre-funded our U.S. pension in 2018 which effectively suspended our need to make further payments until 2023 or beyond. It is through our strong financial position and our continued actions that we strive to maintain our investment-grade credit rating.
Lastly, I'd like to touch on our capital allocation plans which have temporarily changed in light of our current situation. Although we repurchased approximately $120 million in shares in the first quarter, we will be suspending additional share repurchases until our future liquidity needs become clear. That said, we did declare our quarterly dividend and remain strongly committed to returning value to shareholders through these difficult economic times.
Overall, we are confident that we have the liquidity needed to support our operations during this crisis and remain focused on our long-term commitment to our gross debt-to-EBITDA goal of 2x.  
Now on Slide 18, I'll turn it back over to Marc to discuss why we're well-positioned to win in the economic recovery."
314515,645580026,1968082,"Whirlpool Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 01, 2020",2020-05-01,"Earnings Calls","Whirlpool Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim.

I'd like to take a moment now to discuss how we are well-positioned to capitalize on the eventual economic rebound in the short term, while simultaneously well-positioned for future growth over the long term. Throughout this crisis, where necessary we have slowed our operations, adjusting operating line layouts and speed to adapt to government orders, new safety guidelines and dramatic shifts in appliance demand. This will allow us to quickly respond to positive demand changes and rapidly ramp up to normal level of operations. Additionally, we anticipate there will be pent-up demand in the short-term as discretionary purchase have largely been delayed.
As a clear leader in home appliances across the globe, we are extremely well-positioned to capture this demand upon its return. To further take advantage of a recovery, we are leveraging our best-in-class manufacturing supply chain operations, remaining agile in our approach to production and inventory management. As we look longer term, we believe that we are uniquely structured to take advantage of post-crisis demand changes. One of the changes we expect to remain is the rediscovery of the home and the kitchen as a center of living. Needless to say, this will be a positive catalyst for our entire industry and our unmatched brand portfolio and innovation pipeline clearly gives us a head start in capitalizing on this trend.  
Additionally, we are anticipating an acceleration in the adoption of online purchasing for large home appliances post-crisis. As such, the investments we have and continue to make in e-commerce and in direct-to-consumer sales as part of our digital transformation journey are key levers of our long-term growth.
Lastly, we remain committed to our ESG priorities. As highlighted in our recently released sustainability report, we have a long-standing history of investing in the safety and well-being of our employees and the environmental efficiency of our products and operations and in support of the communities we call home.
In closing, I'd like to summarize our key messages on Slide 19. We remain committed to the health and safety of our employees around the globe and will continue to adapt our policies and procedures as the situation with COVID-19 continues to unfold. Our Q1 results highlight the strength and the resilience of our business, and we will continue to take decisive cost actions to ensure the health and viability of our business for the long-term with a continued focus on sustaining strong margin throughout the crisis. Additionally, we have ample liquidity to weather any demand recovery scenario and remain fully committed to driving our business towards our leverage goal of 2x over the long term.  
Further, we are well-prepared to swiftly ramp up operations and leverage our global leadership position to win in the eventual economic recovery. It is because of these actions and the strong experience of our management team that we're confident in our ability to weather this crisis and emerge in a position of strength. We remain firmly focused on executing our business priorities and are fully committed to driving strong shareholder returns.
Now we will end our formal remarks and open up for questions."

But particularly what I think a lot of companies have done and -- by the way, almost none of them have kind of laid out their thoughts for a full year sales impact so very much appreciate that perspective. But one of the other areas that I think has been helpful is to try and get a sense of how to think about decrementals in the second quarter, which certainly, generally speaking are the most extreme given some of the abrupt shutdown and inefficiencies that occur and how those decrementals might improve throughout the year as the cost savings that you've outlined kick in."
314515,645580026,1968082,"Whirlpool Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 01, 2020",2020-05-01,"Earnings Calls","Whirlpool Corporation","Executives","Michael, let me maybe just take your question and split it up in 2 pieces. First of all, obviously, everything depends now on the revenue assumptions.

First of all, obviously, everything depends now on the revenue assumptions. And the overall demand pattern where we all recognize there's a very significant amount of uncertainty. And -- but I think our perspective and today with the information which we have is a U-shaped recovery or demand development, which means we expect the majority of a negative demand to occur in Q2. I do expect a slight drag still in Q3 and Q4 recovery. So that gives you a little bit of a sense of what we anticipate from a broad demand perspective. That being said, that also means we have the biggest deleveraging effect on operations in the second quarter and maybe some elements also in the third quarter. As we -- and I think we mentioned that in some previous earnings call. Of course, the leverage effect you have on production is extremely different by production type, factory, occupational level, et cetera. But I think as a rough, and I underline a very rough rule of thumb, you can obviously assume about 18% to 20% is our leverage factor, i.e., every dollar you lose is about $0.20 of deleveraging. I think it's, however, very important to highlight that in the significant increase of our net cost takeout, we already factored in the negative effect which we will have from deleveraging. So that is all factored in on the cost side. Of course, the margin side is a different one. So we anticipate that we can absorb it, which is not going to be easy and on top of that increase our net cost take out."

And I guess -- so if I understand your comments correctly, and it kind of leads me into the second question in any case. So just to clarify that response, are you saying that $500 million would off -- would negate the decrementals or would negate a worse-than-expected impact on the decrementals in the 2Q period where you're going to have that higher level of inefficiency due to the abrupt nature of what's going on in 2Q? And then the heart of the question for my second question really is if you could give us a sense of the breakdown of that $500 million of net cost takeouts across the different buckets that you manage and if any of those might be temporary that you could layer back in, in a 2021 timeframe, commensurate with the improvement in demand?"

So Michael, first of all, to clarify, the $500 million is a full year, and we haven't given the specification about how much comes in Q2 and Q3. But as you can imagine, it takes a little to ramp it up. But to be clear, the $500 million is after alrea",253,"Yes. So Michael, first of all, to clarify, the $500 million is a full year, and we haven't given the specification about how much comes in Q2 and Q3. But as you can imagine, it takes a little to ramp it up. But to be clear, the $500 million is after already all these inefficiencies. So that is net-net of everything. So it's a pretty clean number. So it's after the negative impact of deleveraging. In terms of a composition of the $500 million, and as you may recall, in the opening earnings call of this year, we roughly indicated about a $200 million. So what you have in between -- first of all, as you indicated, you lose some, and that's the inefficiencies, which are -- I mean, you take the number which we gave you before and you also have a negative currency impact because a lot of materials we buy, for example, in Brazil, we have a negative currency impact. On the good side, you have a slightly better raw material, which we have factored in. But then, in addition, we have very significant expense control, expense management, SG&A efforts and also people cost. And that is a combination of both, to your point, kind of temporary actions but also structural actions. So it's not only temporary actions. So there is quite a bit of structural cost takeout which we have factored in, in this $500 million. But again, I want to reemphasize, it's after all these negative deleveraging effects."

I guess, if I'm thinking about that bridge and applying 20% decrementals on your full year sales guide and then adding back some cost takeout, it seems to suggest that the math would get you to EBIT that's only modestly down for the year and I think margin percentage would actually be up. So I guess I'm just struggling to bridge that a little because a number of other companies have talked about more like 40% decrementals, 2x normal. And then after cost takeout, maybe getting back towards normal. So it just seems -- I appreciate you guys are around that tailwinds, but it seems a little out of sync with what we're hearing from some others. So maybe a little more color on that, please."

First of all, on the -- specifically on question, raw materials, yes, we see a slightly more positive tailwind from raw materials. But as I mentioned before, keep in mind, about half of that additional tailwind is already eaten up with currency losses. So on a full year basis compared to what we had before, maybe give you 1/4 to 1/2 a point more takeout from pure raw materials. But it's not as dramatic as you may assume because steel prices are largely locked in because these are annual contracts. You have a little bit of incremental benefit on plastic and resins, but that's about it. Having said all that, so yes, our $500 million net cost takeout that is our big lever which we have to protect our operating margins. We have not given and will not give a full year margin guideline because there's a lot of other parameters coming into place. But yes, that's our tool to predict our margins. But keep also in mind you have, even on the top line, not only the overall revenue growth, but the mix, which -- and that is not very untypical from the prior recession, but mix you should expect throughout the crisis is slightly negative. So you can't anticipate the same kind of positive price margin effect as we've seen in the last 1 or 2 years. Because an economic crisis is not necessarily the environment where you get a huge positive mix. So you have a negative mix also in the full year assumption."

So Michael, I mean just on these sell-out charts. And as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we usually wouldn't include these ones, but given that we're all trying to read into how will the demand shape up, what kind of recovery we see for us, sell-out is still the best early indicator of what we're likely to see happening. And we have it at least for our products in Italy and U.S. We have it on a weekly basis. And that's why we -- for once in a while, I want to share with you, just to give you also same kind of information as we look at it every day. With that in mind, particularly about U.S. question, the 20%, 25% is revenue related because as you highlighted, on top of volume, we have a slight negative mix. And that's, again, that's not atypical for these kind of recessions. I think it's -- and I want to reemphasize what I also said earlier is I think what we -- and that's good news, well, relatively speaking, good news relative to some other markets. We do not see the U.S. market dropping as much as we've seen in Italy, France or China. Very simple because of a high degree or high percentage of replacement demand. And the fact that we still have the home improvement, but also some independent retailers open right now. So the consumer has a place to go and fulfill that replacement need. And that's a fundamental difference in the U.S. compared to many of the other markets which we see throughout the world."

Should it be higher, better than it has been in the past, and especially maybe thinking about the '08, '09 scenario and when you came out of that?"

And again, if you look back to 2008 and 2009 and what we did with fixed costs back then, and we're able to keep it out till now, it will be the same thing as we continue to reduce our cost level, but those will be benefits that will be seen more in 2021 and beyond as things begin to stabilize. I think the other unknown as I talked about this year is we do have a lot of currency fluctuation within there. That could also have an impact on our bottom line at least in the near term. So I think just for the remainder of this year, you should start to think about the incremental volume in the 18% to 20% type of range."

And the depth of a demand drop has been more severe than we right now see in the U.S. I mean, again, you saw Italy, the numbers, and they will be very similar if you look at markets like France or some of the other markets. So the impact has been earlier and even stronger. Now in a certain way, you can look at the Q1 numbers even though in absolute terms, we still made a loss, but it was better year-over-year. So in a certain way, that tells you how much progress we've done in the cost takeout in getting this business in a much better structural run rate. Because, as you can imagine, with these kind of volume drops, under normal circumstances, you would have a very, very negative impact even year-over-year. So I would see -- in a way, I would even see Q1 as a confirmation we were on the right track because they got on the right track. We got to get through a storm which will also be obviously very severe in Q2. But structurally, from a pure cost takeout and how we are refocusing the business, I still believe we're on a really right track here."

And that's why we don't really show anything on Latin America right now because it is a little bit further behind.

In very simple terms, you got to look at the supply chain stability from 2 perspectives. One, how do you keep your factories up and running, and two, how can you make sure your components keep on coming into the factories. On the factories, we made early on the conscious decision to keep our factories running even though at a much lower pace and a much lower volume. And in a certain we basically ran them very inefficiently because we -- our assumption is that even a slow but steady supply chain is better than a stop and go. Now obviously, we still had to follow sometimes certain government lockdowns or in some cases, we had to clean and sanitize the factory, but at any given time over the last weeks, we had 80% to 85% of our factories running. So the factories are in a pretty stable and good situation. 
Now in components, as you can imagine, our first focus on components supply and steady was related to China. That was our first area of concern. And I would say with an extraordinary amount of effort and hard work, our team was able to get the supply chain situation in China in control. And we did not -- not without challenges, but we did not experience any significant component shortages coming out of China. Right now, our focus, as you alluded to, is a little bit of Mexico, because the Mexico guidelines have not been synchronized with the guidelines of Canada and U.S. So we had some issues of stop and go of certain suppliers. I think they're being worked through, but they have not been completely resolved, but we remain confident they will be resolved in the next coming weeks."

I mean if anybody knows exactly the shape of a recovery, then good luck. As you know, there has been all letters of the alphabet being used to describe a potential form of recovery.

What I -- before I get to the U-shape, what I would exclude right now, I would say, very low probability, the V-shaped recovery. I know there are some folks talking about it. We would love to see it. I just don't think it's happening. And at this point, you also cannot exclude an L-shaped kind of development of this whole prices. But again, I would arguably add right now, which we see are in paper U-shape. The reason why we say that is for -- again, as I mentioned before, for 2 reasons. One is the early demand patterns which we see coming out of the China market. Some European markets clearly point toward the U-shape. And that's very different from financial recession because the depth of the crisis is more severe than financial crisis, but it appears from what we see from these markets that the kind of duration of the crisis is [ folded ]. The other reason, and again, that's probably more macroeconomic, we should also not lose sight of the -- this coronavirus falls on a different environment than it did in 2008. There is no housing bubble. Quite the opposite. The financial institutions are in a much stronger shape than it were in 2008. I think it's a different macroeconomic context where the coronavirus happened. But again, that's -- right now our most likely assumption, I think time will tell. Is it a U? Is it an L? We believe it's a U, but not an immediate recovery before Q4."

I'd say, as we look forward throughout the rest of the year, obviously, there still will be a little bit of a mix impact due to that type of what we call a crisis-type mix. Additionally, depending on the economic situations, what you'll see is a lot of -- duress purchases will continue.

I would also argue, because of a very, very strong supply chain management in Europe where we limited the number of factory closures really to the bare minimum, our supply base inventory situation and stability of the supply base is actually a pretty good one.

So Eric, so first of all, on the U.S. channel, of course, that is heavily impacted simply by the fact which stores are open and which ones are not open. As you know, first of all, from a broader environment, the U.S. market is, compared to other international markets, still with heavy buys on the in-store as opposed to the e-commerce market, which, of course, here right now in the crisis, the e-commerce side has increased quite a bit, but it's still a very store-based shopping purchase in the U.S. So as such, what we saw in the channels right now is heavily driven by which stores were open. And that's just the reality. And a lot will depend on Q2 in terms of at what pace do the closed stores come back online and are reopening. And that's I think how you should read it. But right now, in the broader scheme, yes, by definition, what we saw in March and April, there is a heavy shift towards the home improvement channel in the U.S. And again, that's entirely driven by store openings. 
To your point about the mix, and again, it's not atypical what we saw so versus 2008 and 2009. In particular, the outset of this crisis, you see a heavy mix down. And particularly now there was -- when people were hoarding, they bought a freezer, they bought a second fridge, and these don't come with high mix. Typically, and what we see also already happening in China, that starts stabilizing as the crisis progresses. But for the premium and super premium purchase to then pick up, I think you will still have to wait a couple of quarters. And then again, that's not entirely surprising because that's the discretionary purchase which is often very driven by an entire kitchen remodel.

So Ken, first of all, on the replacement, as we said in earlier conference calls, right now for 2020, we assume that the replacement -- part of entire industry demand is more than 50%.

I think, what, 52% or 53%, what we gave you as a number. So if we see a market decline, that comes out of a nonreplacement side of a business. So as a percentage, is now even higher, but it's in absolute terms. So that's a pretty steady number from replacement. And we also clearly positioned that replacement side almost as a floor of a market because we're still comping against the low years of 2008, 2009, 2010. So we feel pretty good. That's the floor, and it will not drop a whole lot further. So that's a steady side. 
The high end discretionary one is, I think, where you, in the short term, and I would say, 2 to 4 quarters, you will see still some negative, and that's not surprising. And by the way, very, very similar to what we've seen in 2009 and 2010. Particularly in your question about the new homes and the builder channel, keep in mind we are at the very tail end of any house completion. Appliances are one of the last products which come into any build. And as you all have seen with the builders, the builders had a very strong order intake and starts pretty much until early March, mid-March. I think there has now been some drops in late March and April. But the projects and the houses which the builders have started, they will complete. So we do see from our side, certainly in Q2 and Q3, still a very steady stream of new homes and what we do there with the appliances. The key question, of course, is then how does the broader builder markets now develop. And I think there's arguments made why it will continue to grow, like below mortgage rates and fundamental demand still. But of course, consumer confidence will play a key factor. As long as this overall recession is limited in duration, I don't think we will see a major lasting impact on consumer confidence. But of course, that's one of the big uncertain elements right now."

But looking again at just North America, in '08, your sales fell about 10%, you had about a 300 basis point decline in margin, realizing margins were different in terms of the base level. But specifically, I mean, we keep going into this. So your fixed costs are lower. You guys removed a lot of fixed cost last cycle. With the cost -- so obviously, a lot of your 20% -- you have a lot of variable costs. So with the material declines that you expect, meaning the $500 million, can you just -- is it really that fixed cost is different that is supporting the math because the labor -- the material costs you're following, but is it really the fixed cost that is so different in 2020 if sales are down high single digits in the U.S. versus what we saw in '08?"

And so what you were seeing is that we kept the fixed cost as we grew revenues and grew volumes across the globe and especially within the U.S. And now as we've had the decline, it's not as significant as it was back then as an impact to our bottom line because of that already low fixed cost base we're starting on. Then in addition to that, as we talked about, is we will target taking out and we will take out additional costs here. Now some of those will be fixed, some will be variable and that's just how you've got to look at it go forward."

First of all, if you compare 2008 to the current one, the starting point of our margins in 2008 coming into the crisis were lower. And as you've seen on my chart, in the first quarter, as a company in total, North America, we basically barely made a profit. Actually, we had a small loss on the EBIT base. Now fast forward to the current one, the volume drop right now, and that's what we forecasted, is more than a financial crisis. So under normal circumstances, if you would take out 2008 picture, yes, that will be very painful for us. But, and that's to Jim's point, we managed fixed cost. And to put that differently, our breakeven point in all the factories is significantly lower than it was before. So we will be able to absorb that volume loss in a much better way than we did in 2008. And that's been the work over the last couple of years. The other comment I also want to make is yes the coronavirus as such -- yes, you can call it black swan event, which came with our preannouncement. The recession as such is not a complete shock. And we've been working already over the last year on additional cost take-out, on balance sheet measures. So and that has just allowed us to now ramp up a cost take-out even more so compared to 2008. And that's -- and we started that in not just now, we started pretty much some time ago and now we just ramped it up in addition. So I think the situation is very different, our preparedness is a little bit different and our fundamental starting point and breakeven point in factories is very different."

And then we also reduced some of our marketing and technology expenses as we just put strict controls on some of our discretionary spending. I think as you think about this for the rest of the year, obviously, that rate will ramp up throughout the year. And as you look at it across the globe, we would see it being pretty similar across the globe if you just use revenues to kind of spread it out ratably that way. As we are taking cost measures in every part of the world right now, and we're seeing different impacts that we have to offset in every part of the world.

So we feel pretty good about that number. I think the point which you asked earlier, can replacement purchases be delayed? I would say, to a very limited extent. And again, that's where you have some experience from 2008, 2009 helps. So a dishwasher which can be replaced or needs to be replaced, yes, then it can be delayed. But even in 2008 and 2009, we didn't see these kind of things delayed more than 1 or 2 quarters. A washer or refrigerator replacement will not be delayed.

Before we discuss our first quarter business results, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the unprecedented circumstances we're all currently experiencing and the efforts we have undertaken as an organization to support our people, consumers and communities.
The health and safety of our employees continues to be our top priority as we navigate through this crisis. I'd like to take a moment to thank them for the hard work and ongoing efforts during this challenging time. These efforts began in early January with the creation of a cross-functional and cross-regional task force to aid in developing and driving globally aligned communications and action plans. In February, we took decisive action to ensure the safety of our 77,000 employees around the world, including banning all domestic and international employee travel while also ensuring our corporate and manufacturing locations abide by all local state and federal guidelines and safety measures. Additionally, we implemented our work-from-home policy, resulting in 95% of office roles now being performed remotely. Also, we continue to safely operate our plants and manage through periodic slowdowns and shutdowns as they arise.
As it relates to business continuity, we took decisive actions in late January to ensure we were able to continue supplying our consumers with our essential products and services. These actions focused on ensuring ample supply of critical components, and detailed review of inventory across key product categories. We also have remote-enabled call centers that allow us to maintain reliable post-purchase service to our consumers. Now more than ever, families across the globe are relying on our products and services to take care of their families. They are depending on our products to clean, cook and to provide proper food and medicine storage in their homes while also providing a place in the kitchen for them to come together as a family.
Finally, we took a number of actions to give back to local communities in which we operate, including providing funding to support COVID-19 research in local hospitals, donations of PPE and appliances to hospitals and organizations, as well as providing additional donations to local food banks, shelters and small businesses.  
Overall, thanks to the strong actions and efforts of our teams, we've been able to significantly limit the number of cases in our companies around the globe.  
Turning to Slide 5, I'm highly confident in our ability to manage through these uncertain times, and I strongly believe that we have the right actions in place to protect our operating margins and the financial strength to protect our liquidity position throughout 2020. Thanks to the hard work of our employees and our relentless focus on delivering on our commitments to consumers, we delivered strong Q1 results, demonstrating our resilience as an organization. As the depth and the duration of this crisis remains unknown, we are taking strong actions to mitigate the anticipated impact of volume deleveraging and sustain our operating margins. Further, we have positioned ourselves well, with ample liquidity and the financial flexibility required to weather this current crisis.
Lastly, we remain committed to investing in our future while also taking actions now to win during the eventual economic rebound.
Now I'd like to turn it over to Jim to review our first quarter results."

On Slide 7, we show our first quarter 2020 highlights. We delivered organic net sales in line with the prior year with an ongoing EBIT margin and EPS of 6.1% and $2.82, respectively, highlighting the resilience of our global operations given the growing impact of COVID-19 throughout the quarter. Our North America, Latin America, and Europe, Middle East and Africa regions demonstrated their strength and agility, delivering solid year-over-year margin results despite operational disruptions related to COVID-19. Lastly, we delivered free cash flow improvement of approximately $100 million due to strong working capital management, particularly in accounts receivable and inventory.  
Turning to Slide 8, we show the drivers of our first quarter EBIT margin. Price/mix negatively impacted margins by 175 basis points due to onetime product transition expenses and unfavorable product mix shifts due to COVID-19-related consumer purchases. As we highlighted on our Q4 call, we launched new lines of dish and laundry products in Q1 2020, driving a onetime transition expense of approximately 75 basis points. Furthermore, as consumer behaviors changed due to COVID-19 safety guidelines, we saw increased demand for microwaves, low-end refrigerators and freezers, resulting in negative price/mix. Although we expect product transition expenses to return to normal levels in the second quarter, we expect these changes in consumer purchases to be a headwind during the crisis. This unfavorable margin impact was fully offset by accelerated cost takeout actions and favorable raw materials, leading to a margin impact of 175 basis points. Lastly, strong cost discipline related to marketing and technology investments partially offset the impact of currency. Overall, we are pleased to deliver margins in line with the prior year. This is indicative of our strong cost discipline across the globe, and we are confident these actions will continue to sustain our 2020 margins.
Turning to Slide 9, I'll review our first quarter regional results. In North America, we saw a stable industry for the quarter and delivered net sales in line with the prior year. Additionally, we delivered EBIT margins of nearly 12% as strong cost discipline partially offset negative price/mix related to increased product transition expenses and lower mix related to COVID-19 consumer purchases.  
In our Europe, Middle East and Africa region, we experienced positive industry demand across key countries through mid-February. However, the growing impact of COVID-19 resulted in operational disruptions and demand declines towards the end of February and throughout March, particularly in Italy and France. We are pleased to see continued momentum from our cost reduction and strategic initiatives, which delivered the fifth consecutive quarter of EBIT improvement, with margins expanding 40 basis points despite significant COVID-19 demand and operational disruptions. Although we expect to see intensified demand pressure in the second quarter, we remain confident that our underlying business continues to make strong progress in our return to profitability.
In Latin America, we saw solid industry demand across Brazil and Mexico, along with strong share gains in Brazil, driving organic net sales growth of over 20%. EBIT margins were approximately flat compared to the prior year as strong cost discipline offset currency devaluation in Brazil. Finally, as a reminder, our first quarter 2019 results include the impact of the Embraco compressor business in Latin America's results.
In our Asia region, revenue declined over 20% as China demand declined sharply in the quarter due to COVID-19-related disruptions. This was followed by a government-enforced shutdown in India which has now been extended into early May. In China, our manufacturing facilities have returned to normal operating levels, and we have seen demand stabilize with some initial indications of a rebound as consumers slowly reenter the marketplace.  
Overall, we are very pleased with our first quarter EBIT margin results of 6.1% given the approximately 150 basis point EBIT margin impact from COVID-19. These results clearly demonstrate the agility and resiliency of our global operations.

314515,645580026,1989601,"Whirlpool Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 01, 2020",2020-05-01,"Earnings Calls","Whirlpool Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim. The broader macroeconomic environment continuing to rapidly evolve, the full impact of COVID-19 on our business results remain highly uncertain and we're unable to provide a meaningful full year guidance at this time.

The broader macroeconomic environment continuing to rapidly evolve, the full impact of COVID-19 on our business results remain highly uncertain and we're unable to provide a meaningful full year guidance at this time. That said, we want to provide the answers to 3 fundamental questions, which I'll go into more detail on the following slides.  
First, what's the shape of a recovery? In this section, I'll provide an overview of the current sell-through trends in key countries and an update on our full year net sales expectations. We anticipate a U-type recovery throughout 2020, resulting in a full year organic net sales decline of 10% to 15%. Second, can we sustain our operating margin? Here, I will discuss the fundamental difference in our margin profile entering the COVID-19 crisis compared to the 2008 recession and also highlight the additional cost actions we will drive throughout 2020 to help sustain our operating margins. Thirdly, what's our liquidity position? Finally, Jim will discuss our strong cash and liquidity position which will allow us to cope with the economic uncertainty we continue to face across the globe.  
Turning to Slide 12, I'll highlight the preliminary data that supports our perspective of a U-shaped recovery throughout 2020. Please note that we do not intend to share this data going forward but we felt, given the uncertainty of the current situation, that this data will provide valuable proof points as we all assess the impact of COVID-19. As we monitor the development of COVID-19 cases and its related impact on appliance demand within China, Italy and the U.S., we've begun to see similar U-shaped demand patterns emerge. China, we see clear signs of a U-shaped demand pattern with recovery closely linked although slightly lagging to the reduction of new COVID-19 cases.
Turning to Slide 13. While Italy's trends are not as mature as China's, the demand patterns are well in line. 
Turning to Slide 14. Even though the U.S. is obviously at an earlier stage of battling the COVID-19, early signs point to a similar U-shaped demand trend as seen in China and Italy. It is important to note, however, that the demand decline in the United States is clearly not as pronounced as in China and Italy, and we are currently experiencing sell-out declines of around 20% to 25%, which is less than half of what we've seen in other markets. We see 2 reasons for this fundamental difference in demand patterns. One, the U.S. has a very significant portion of replacement sales of more than 50% of our total industry, and two, the home improvement channel kept stores open during this crisis, allowing consumers to continue purchasing appliances. Based on the consistent demand trends we are seeing across 3 of our key countries, each at different phases of crisis, we are expecting a full year 2020 organic net sales decline of 10% to 15%, with a majority of the decline occurring in the second quarter, followed by a slow recovery in the third quarter and a slight growth in fourth quarter.
Turning to Slide 15, the EBIT margin chart highlights the clear difference in starting position entering the COVID-19 crisis compared to the 2008 financial crisis. In the quarters preceding the 2008 financial crisis, we delivered EBIT margins of about 5%. Upon entering the 2008 financial crisis, we saw EBIT margins drop sharply to around 3.5% before bottoming out at a negative 1% in the fourth quarter of 2008. Contrast this with our current starting point in which we recently delivered 2019 ongoing EBIT margin of 7% or greater from second quarter on and over 6% margins in the first quarter of 2020, inclusive of 150 basis points impact of COVID-19. We are starting from a fundamentally stronger place due to the decisive actions we took post 2008 recession. We took many difficult but necessary actions related to the fixed cost structure of our business, including restructuring actions, plant optimizations and the exit of certain nonprofitable product segments, ensuring that we would be able to withstand the next crisis. Since that time, we've remain disciplined in our approach to fixed cost management. Fixed cost discipline has structurally improved our margin profile, allowing us to enter this crisis in a position of strength.
Turning to Slide 16, I'll discuss the additional strong actions put in place to sustain our margins over the near term. First, as our teams monitored the spread of COVID-19 from Asia to Europe and then to U.S. and beyond, our operational teams acted early and decisively to ensure we appropriately matched inventory levels and our supply base to demand. Second, we aggressively target significant reductions in both structural and discretionary costs, including a reduction in discretionary marketing and promotion spend and strict headcount control across all regions as well as unpaid leave, furloughs, among other actions. In parallel, we implemented a controlled trial process and put rigorous guidelines in place to manage our expenses going forward. Third, we continued to focus on ensuring we capitalize on the deflationary raw materials market. Finally, we've maintained our strict focus on working capital management, ensuring we have a proper risk mitigation plan in place, dual-sourcing strategies enacted and are appropriately managing our inventory levels across the globe.  
With these additional actions in place, we are now targeting over $500 million in net cost and raw material savings in 2020, up over $300 million from our previous guidance.
Moving to Slide 17, I now turn it over to Jim to highlight our overall financial position and ability to weather this current crisis."

As a result of the strategic actions we took leading up to this crisis, we entered the crisis with a strong balance sheet. First, we have a very strong liquidity position as evidenced by our current cash position of $2.8 billion, with approximately $2 billion available in remaining committed credit facilities. This is inclusive of a recently executed $500 million short-term credit facility. Second, anchored by our strong balance sheet, we maintain ample buffer to withstand increased debt or a reduction in earnings without tripping our covenants. Our debt-to-capitalization limit is 0.65 and we are currently at approximately 0.5, while our interest coverage ratio requires a minimum of 3x and we are currently above 10x. Third, we have access to additional levers to unlock cash. We continue to evaluate additional liquidity options, and from an operational standpoint, we will continue to effectively manage our working capital. Fourth, I'd like to highlight that we refinanced EUR 500 million of long-term debt in February of this year, and have no additional bond maturities until the second quarter of 2021. Furthermore, I'd like to remind everyone that we pre-funded our U.S. pension in 2018, which effectively suspended our need to make further payments until 2023 or beyond. It is through our strong financial position and our continued actions that we strive to maintain our investment-grade credit rating.
Lastly, I'd like to touch on our capital allocation plans which have temporarily changed in light of our current situation. Although we repurchased approximately $120 million in shares in the first quarter, we will be suspending additional share repurchases until our future liquidity needs become clear. That said, we did declare our quarterly dividend and remain strongly committed to returning value to shareholders through these difficult economic times.
Overall, we are confident that we have the liquidity needed to support our operations during this crisis, and remain focused on our long-term commitment to our gross debt-to-EBITDA goal of 2x.  
Now on Slide 18, I'll turn it back over to Marc to discuss why we're well-positioned to win in the economic recovery."

I'd like to take a moment now to discuss how we are well-positioned to capitalize on the eventual economic rebound in the short term, while simultaneously well-positioned for future growth over the long term. Throughout this crisis, where necessary we have slowed our operations, adjusting operating line layouts and speed to adapt to government orders, new safety guidelines and dramatic shifts in appliance demand. This will allow us to quickly respond to positive demand changes and rapidly ramp up to normal level of operations. Additionally, we anticipate there will be pent-up demand in the short-term as discretionary purchase have largely been delayed.
As a clear leader in home appliances across the globe, we are extremely well-positioned to capture this demand upon its return. To further take advantage of a recovery, we are leveraging our best-in-class manufacturing supply chain operations, remaining agile in our approach to production and inventory management. As we look longer term, we believe that we are uniquely structured to take advantage of post-crisis demand changes. One of the changes we expect to remain is the rediscovery of the home and the kitchen as a center of living. Needless to say, this will be a positive catalyst for our entire industry, and our unmatched brand portfolio and innovation pipeline clearly gives us a head start in capitalizing on this trend.  
Additionally, we are anticipating an acceleration in the adoption of online purchasing for large home appliances post-crisis. As such, the investments we have and continue to make in e-commerce and in direct-to-consumer sales as part of our digital transformation journey are key levers of our long-term growth.
Lastly, we remain committed to our ESG priorities. As highlighted in our recently released sustainability report, we have a long-standing history of investing in the safety and well-being of our employees and the environmental efficiency of our products and operations and in support of the communities we call home.
In closing, I'd like to summarize our key messages on Slide 19. We remain committed to the health and safety of our employees around the globe and will continue to adapt our policies and procedures as the situation with COVID-19 continues to unfold. Our Q1 results highlight the strength and the resilience of our business, and we will continue to take decisive cost actions to ensure the health and viability of our business for the long-term with a continued focus on sustaining strong margin throughout the crisis. Additionally, we have ample liquidity to weather any demand recovery scenario and remain fully committed to driving our business towards our leverage goal of 2x over the long term.  
Further, we are well-prepared to swiftly ramp up operations and leverage our global leadership position to win in the eventual economic recovery. It is because of these actions and the strong experience of our management team that we're confident in our ability to weather this crisis and emerge in a position of strength. We remain firmly focused on executing our business priorities and are fully committed to driving strong shareholder returns.
Now we will end our formal remarks and open up for questions."

But particularly what I think a lot of companies have done and -- by the way, almost none of them have kind of laid out their thoughts for a full year sales impact, so very much appreciate that perspective. But one of the other areas that I think has been helpful is to try and get a sense of how to think about decrementals in the second quarter, which certainly, generally speaking, are the most extreme given some of the abrupt shutdown and inefficiencies that occur, and how those decrementals might improve throughout the year as the cost savings that you've outlined kick in."

First of all, obviously, everything depends now on the revenue assumptions. And the overall demand pattern where we all recognize there's a very significant amount of uncertainty. And -- but I think our perspective and today with the information which we have is a U-shaped recovery or demand development, which means we expect the majority of a negative in demand to occur in Q2. I do expect a slight drag still in Q3, and Q4 recovery. So that gives you a little bit of a sense of what we anticipate from a broad demand perspective. That being said, that also means we have the biggest deleveraging effect on operations in the second quarter and maybe some elements also in the third quarter. As we -- and I think we mentioned that in some previous earnings call. Of course, the leverage effect you have on production is extremely different by production type, factory, occupational level, et cetera. But I think as a rough, and I underline, a very rough rule of thumb, you can obviously assume about 18% to 20% is our leverage factor, i.e., every dollar you lose is about $0.20 of deleveraging. I think it's, however, very important to highlight that in the significant increase of our net cost takeout, we already factored in the negative effect which we will have from deleveraging. So that is all factored in on the cost side. Of course, the margin side is a different one. So we anticipate that we can absorb it, which is not going to be easy, and on top of that increase our net cost take out."

And I guess -- so if I understand your comments correctly, and it kind of leads me into the second question in any case. So just to clarify that response, are you saying that $500 million would off -- would negate the decrementals or would negate a worse-than-expected impact on the decrementals in the 2Q period where you're going to have that higher level of inefficiency due to the abrupt nature of what's going on in 2Q? And then the heart of the question for my second question really is if you could give us a sense of the breakdown of that $500 million of net cost takeouts across the different buckets that you manage and if any of those might be temporary that you could layer back in, in a 2021 timeframe, commensurate with the improvement in demand?"

So Michael, first of all, to clarify, the $500 million is a full year, and we haven't given the specification about how much comes in Q2 and Q3. But as you can imagine, it takes a little to ramp it up. But to be clear, the $500 million is after already all these inefficiencies. So that is net-net of everything. So it's a pretty clean number. So it's after the negative impact of deleveraging. In terms of a composition of the $500 million, and as you may recall, in the opening earnings call of this year, we roughly indicated about a $200 million. So what you have in between -- first of all, as you indicated, you lose some, and that's the inefficiencies, which are -- I mean you take the number which we gave you before and you also have a negative currency impact because a lot of materials we buy, for example, in Brazil, we have a negative currency impact.
On the good side, you have a slightly better raw material, which we have factored in. But then, in addition, we have very significant expense control, expense management, SG&A efforts and also people cost. And that is a combination of both, to your point, kind of temporary actions but also structural actions. So it's not only temporary actions. So there is quite a bit of structural cost takeout which we have factored in, in this $500 million. But again, I want to reemphasize, it's after all these negative deleveraging effects."

I guess if I'm thinking about that bridge and applying 20% decrementals on your full year sales guide and then adding back some cost takeout, it seems to suggest that the math would get you to EBIT that's only modestly down for the year and I think margin percentage would actually be up. So I guess I'm just struggling to bridge that a little because a number of other companies have talked about more like 40% decrementals, 2x normal. And then after cost takeout, maybe getting back towards normal. So it just seems -- I appreciate you guys are around that tailwinds, but it seems a little out of sync with what we're hearing from some others. So maybe a little more color on that, please."

First of all, on the -- specifically on question of raw materials, yes, we see a slightly more positive tailwind from raw materials. But as I mentioned before, keep in mind, about half of that additional tailwind is already eaten up with currency losses. So on a full year basis compared to what we had before, maybe give you 1/4 to 1/2 a point more takeout from pure raw materials. But it's not as dramatic as you may assume because steel prices are largely locked in because these are annual contracts. You have a little bit of incremental benefit on plastic and resins, but that's about it. Having said all that, so yes, our $500 million net cost takeout, that is our big lever which we have to protect our operating margins. We have not given and will not give a full year margin guideline because there's a lot of other parameters coming into place. But yes, that's our tool to predict our margins. But keep also in mind you have, even on the top line, not only the overall revenue growth, but the mix, which -- and that is not very untypical from the prior recession, but mix you should expect throughout the crisis is slightly negative. So you can't anticipate the same kind of positive price margin effect as we've seen in the last 1 or 2 years, because an economic crisis is not necessarily the environment where you get a huge positive mix. So you have a negative mix also in the full year assumption."

So Michael, I mean just on these sell-out charts. And as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we usually wouldn't include these ones, but given that we're all trying to read into how will the demand shape up, what kind of recovery we see for us, sell-out is still the best early indicator of what we're likely to see happening. And we have it at least for our products in Italy and U.S. We have it on a weekly basis. And that's why we -- for once in a while, I want to share it with you, just to give you also same kind of information that we look at every day. With that in mind, particularly about U.S. question, the 20%, 25% is revenue related because as you highlighted, on top of volume, we have a slight negative mix. And that's, again, that's not atypical for these kind of recessions. I think it's -- and I want to reemphasize what I also said earlier is I think what we -- and that's good news, well, relatively speaking, good news relative to some of the other markets. We do not see the U.S. market dropping as much as we've seen in Italy, France or China. Very simple, because of a high degree or high percentage of replacement demand, and the fact that we still have the home improvement, but also some independent retailers open right now. So the consumer has a place to go and fulfill that replacement need. And that's a fundamental difference in the U.S. compared to many of the other markets which we see throughout the world."

Now over time, we will see the benefits of the cost takeout running in and that will help our margins in the long run. And again, if you look back to 2008 and 2009 and what we did with fixed costs back then, and we're able to keep it out till now, it will be the same thing as we continue to reduce our cost level, but those will be benefits that will be seen more in 2021 and beyond as things begin to stabilize. I think the other unknown as I talked about this year is we do have a lot of currency fluctuation within there. That could also have an impact on our bottom line, at least in the near term. So I think just for the remainder of this year, you should start to think about the incremental volume in the 18% to 20% type of range."

So the impact has been earlier and even stronger. Now in a certain way, you can look at the Q1 numbers even though in absolute terms, we still made a loss, but it was better year-over-year. So in a certain way, that tells you how much progress we've done in the cost takeout in getting this business in a much better structural run rate. Because, as you can imagine, with these kind of volume drops, under normal circumstances, you would have a very, very negative impact even year-over-year. So I would see -- in a way, I would even see Q1 as a confirmation we were on the right track because they got run right track.

Let me maybe expand a little bit on the supply question and go beyond Mexico. In very simple terms, you got to look at the supply chain stability from 2 perspectives: one, how do you keep your factories up and running; and two, how can you make sure your components keep on coming into the factories. On the factories, we made early on the conscious decision to keep our factories running even though at a much lower pace and a much lower volume. And in a certain way we basically ran them very inefficiently because we -- our assumption is that even a slow but steady supply chain is better than a stop and go. Now obviously, we still had to follow sometimes certain government lockdowns or in some cases, we had to clean and sanitize the factory, but at any given time over the last weeks, we had 80% to 85% of our factories running. So the factories are in a pretty stable and good situation. 
Now in components, as you can imagine, our first focus on components supply and steady was related to China. That was our first area of concern. And I would say with an extraordinary amount of effort and hard work, our team was able to get the supply chain situation in China in control. And we did not -- not without challenges, but we did not experience any significant component shortages coming out of China. Right now, our focus, as you alluded to, is a little bit of Mexico, because the Mexico guidelines have not been synchronized with the guidelines of Canada and U.S. So we had some issues of stop and go of certain suppliers. I think they're being worked through, but they have not been completely resolved, but we remain confident they will be resolved in the next coming weeks."

I mean if anybody knows exactly the shape of a recovery, then good luck. As you know, there has been all letters of the alphabet being used to describe a potential form of recovery. And what we're seeing is right now, we believe the most likely scenario is a U-shaped recovery, but that's not a certainty. What I -- before I get to the U-shape, what I would exclude right now, I would say, very low probability, the V-shaped recovery. I know there are some folks talking about it. We would love to see it. I just don't think it's happening. And at this point, you also cannot exclude an L-shaped kind of development of this whole crisis. But again, I would argue the odds right now which we see are in favor of a U-shape. The reason why we say that is for -- again, as I mentioned before, for 2 reasons. One is the early demand patterns which we see coming out of the China market. Some European markets clearly point towards the U-shape. And that's very different from financial recession because the depth of the crisis is more severe than financial crisis, but it appears from what we see from these markets that the kind of duration of the crisis is shorter. The other reason, and again, that's probably more macroeconomic, we should also not lose sight of the -- this coronavirus falls on a different environment than it did in 2008. There is no housing bubble. Quite the opposite. The financial institutions are in a much stronger shape than they were in 2008. I think it's a different macroeconomic context where this coronavirus happened. But again, that's -- right now our most likely assumption, I think time will tell. Is it a U? Is it an L? We believe it's a U, but not an immediate recovery before Q4."

I would also argue, because of a very, very strong supply chain management in Europe where we limited the number of factory closures really to the bare minimum, our supply base inventory situation and stability of the supply base is actually a pretty good one.

So Eric, so first of all, on the U.S. channel, of course, that is heavily impacted simply by the fact which stores are open and which ones are not open. As you know, first of all, from a broader environment, the U.S. market is, compared to other international markets, still with heavy buys on the in-store as opposed to the e-commerce market, which, of course, here right now in the crisis, the e-commerce side has increased quite a bit, but it's still a very store-based shopping purchase in the U.S. So as such, what we saw in the channels right now is heavily driven by which stores were open. And that's just the reality. And a lot will depend on Q2 in terms of at what pace do the closed stores come back online and are reopening. And that's I think how you should read it. But right now, in the broader scheme, yes, by definition, what we saw in March and April, there is a heavy shift towards the home improvement channel in the U.S. And again, that's entirely driven by store openings. 
To your point about the mix, and again, it's not atypical what we saw so versus 2008 and 2009. In particular, the outset of this crisis, you see a heavy mix down. And particularly now there was -- when people were hoarding, they bought a freezer, they bought a second fridge, and these don't come with high mix. Typically, and what we see also already happening in China, that starts stabilizing as the crisis progresses. But for the premium and super premium purchase to then pick up, I think you will still have to wait a couple of quarters. And then again, that's not entirely surprising because that's the discretionary purchase which is often very driven by an entire kitchen remodel.

So Ken, first of all, on the replacement, as we said in earlier conference calls, right now for 2020, we assume that the replacement part of entire industry demand is more than 50%.

I think, what, 52% or 53%, what we gave you as a number. So if we see a market decline, that comes out of a nonreplacement side of a business. So as a percentage, is now even higher, but it's in absolute terms. So that's a pretty steady number from replacement. And we also clearly positioned that replacement side almost as a floor of a market because we're still comping against the low years of 2008, 2009, 2010. So we feel pretty good. That's the floor, and it will not drop a whole lot further. So that's the steady side. 
The high end discretionary one is, I think, where you, in the short term, and I would say, 2 to 4 quarters, you will see still some negative, and that's not surprising. And by the way, very, very similar to what we've seen in 2009 and 2010. Particularly in your question about the new homes and the builder channel, keep in mind we are at the very tail end of any house completion. Appliances are one of the last products which come into any build. And as you all have seen with the builders, the builders had a very strong order intake and starts pretty much until early March, mid-March. I think there has now been some drops in late March and April. But the projects and the houses which the builders have started, they will complete. So we do see from our side, certainly in Q2 and Q3, still a very steady stream of new homes and what we do there with the appliances. The key question, of course, is then how does the broader builder markets now develop. And I think there's arguments made why it will continue to grow, like the low mortgage rates and fundamental demand still. But of course, consumer confidence will play a key factor. As long as this overall recession is limited in duration, I don't think we will see a major lasting impact on consumer confidence. But of course, that's one of the big uncertain elements right now."

But specifically, I mean, we keep going into this. So your fixed costs are lower. You guys removed a lot of fixed cost last cycle. With the cost -- so obviously, a lot of your 20%, you have a lot of variable costs. So with the material declines that you expect, meaning the $500 million, can you just -- is it really that fixed cost is different that is supporting the math because the labor -- the material costs you're following, but is it really the fixed cost that is so different in 2020 if sales are down high single digits in the U.S. versus what we saw in '08?"

And so what you were seeing is that we kept the fixed cost as we grew revenues and grew volumes across the globe and especially within the U.S. And now as we've had the decline, it's not as significant as it was back then as an impact to our bottom line because of that already low fixed cost base we're starting on.

First of all, if you compare 2008 to the current one, the starting point of our margins in 2008 coming into the crisis were lower. And as you've seen on my chart, in the first quarter, as a company in total, North America, we basically barely made a profit. Actually, we had a small loss on the EBIT base. Now fast forward to the current one, the volume drop right now, and that's what we forecasted, is more than a financial crisis.  So under normal circumstances, if you would take out 2008 picture, yes, that will be very painful for us. But, and that's to Jim's point, we manage fixed costs. And to put that differently, our breakeven point in all the factories is significantly lower than it was before. So we will be able to absorb that volume loss in a much better way than we did in 2008. And that's been the work over the last couple of years.
The other comment I also want to make is, yes, the coronavirus as such -- yes, you can call it a black swan event, which came with our preannouncement. The recession as such is not a complete shock. And we've been working already over the last year on additional cost take-out, on balance sheet measures. So and that has just allowed us to now ramp up a cost take-out even more so compared to 2008. And that's -- and we started that in not just now, we started pretty much some time ago and now we just ramped it up in addition. So I think the situation is very different, our preparedness is a little bit different and our fundamental starting point and breakeven point in factories is very different."

We've not seen that in 2008 and 2009, and we don't see that right now. So the vast majority of replacement purchases are hard to delay and will not be delayed by consumers. And we didn't experience that so far."

Before we discuss our first quarter business results, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the unprecedented circumstances we're all currently experiencing and the efforts we have undertaken as an organization to support our people, consumers and communities.
The health and safety of our employees continues to be our top priority as we navigate through this crisis. I'd like to take a moment to thank them for the hard work and ongoing efforts during this challenging time. These efforts began in early January with the creation of a cross-functional and cross-regional task force to aid in developing and driving globally aligned communications and action plans. In February, we took decisive action to ensure the safety of our 77,000 employees around the world, including banning all domestic and international employee travel while also ensuring our corporate and manufacturing locations abide by all local state and federal guidelines and safety measures. Additionally, we implemented our work-from-home policy, resulting in 95% of office roles now being performed remotely. Also, we continue to safely operate our plants and manage through periodic slowdowns and shutdowns as they arise.
As it relates to business continuity, we took decisive actions in late January to ensure we were able to continue supplying our consumers with our essential products and services. These actions focused on ensuring ample supply of critical components, and detailed review of inventory across key product categories. We also have remote-enabled call centers that allow us to maintain reliable post-purchase service to our consumers. Now more than ever, families across the globe are relying on our products and services to take care of their families. They are depending on our products to clean, cook and to provide proper food and medicine storage in their homes while also providing a place in the kitchen for them to come together as a family.
Finally, we took a number of actions to give back to local communities in which we operate, including providing funding to support COVID-19 research in local hospitals, donations of PPE and appliances to hospitals and organizations, as well as providing additional donations to local food banks, shelters and small businesses. 
Overall, thanks to the strong actions and efforts of our teams, we've been able to significantly limit the number of cases in our companies around the globe. 
Turning to Slide 5, I'm highly confident in our ability to manage through these uncertain times, and I strongly believe that we have the right actions in place to protect our operating margins and the financial strength to protect our liquidity position throughout 2020. Thanks to the hard work of our employees and our relentless focus on delivering on our commitments to consumers, we delivered strong Q1 results, demonstrating our resilience as an organization. As the depth and the duration of this crisis remains unknown, we are taking strong actions to mitigate the anticipated impact of volume deleveraging and sustain our operating margins. Further, we have positioned ourselves well, with ample liquidity and the financial flexibility required to weather this current crisis.
Lastly, we remain committed to investing in our future while also taking actions now to win during the eventual economic rebound.
Now I'd like to turn it over to Jim to review our first quarter results."

On Slide 7, we show our first quarter 2020 highlights. We delivered organic net sales in line with the prior year with an ongoing EBIT margin and EPS of 6.1% and $2.82, respectively, highlighting the resilience of our global operations given the growing impact of COVID-19 throughout the quarter. Our North America, Latin America, and Europe, Middle East and Africa regions demonstrated their strength and agility, delivering solid year-over-year margin results despite operational disruptions related to COVID-19. Lastly, we delivered free cash flow improvement of approximately $100 million due to strong working capital management, particularly in accounts receivable and inventory. 
Turning to Slide 8, we show the drivers of our first quarter EBIT margin. Price/mix negatively impacted margins by 175 basis points due to onetime product transition expenses and unfavorable product mix shifts due to COVID-19-related consumer purchases. As we highlighted on our Q4 call, we launched new lines of dish and laundry products in Q1 2020, driving a onetime transition expense of approximately 75 basis points. Furthermore, as consumer behaviors changed due to COVID-19 safety guidelines, we saw increased demand for microwaves, low-end refrigerators and freezers, resulting in negative price/mix. 
Although we expect product transition expenses to return to normal levels in the second quarter, we expect these changes in consumer purchases to be a headwind during the crisis. This unfavorable margin impact was fully offset by accelerated cost takeout actions and favorable raw materials, leading to a margin impact of 175 basis points. Lastly, strong cost discipline related to marketing and technology investments partially offset the impact of currency. Overall, we are pleased to deliver margins in line with the prior year. This is indicative of our strong cost discipline across the globe, and we are confident these actions will continue to sustain our 2020 margins.
Turning to Slide 9, I'll review our first quarter regional results. In North America, we saw a stable industry for the quarter and delivered net sales in line with the prior year. Additionally, we delivered EBIT margins of nearly 12% as strong cost discipline partially offset negative price/mix related to increased product transition expenses and lower mix related to COVID-19 consumer purchases. 
In our Europe, Middle East and Africa region, we experienced positive industry demand across key countries through mid-February. However, the growing impact of COVID-19 resulted in operational disruptions and demand declines towards the end of February and throughout March, particularly in Italy and France. We are pleased to see continued momentum from our cost reduction and strategic initiatives, which delivered the fifth consecutive quarter of EBIT improvement, with margins expanding 40 basis points despite significant COVID-19 demand and operational disruptions. Although we expect to see intensified demand pressure in the second quarter, we remain confident that our underlying business continues to make strong progress in our return to profitability.
In Latin America, we saw solid industry demand across Brazil and Mexico, along with strong share gains in Brazil, driving organic net sales growth of over 20%. EBIT margins were approximately flat compared to the prior year as strong cost discipline offset currency devaluation in Brazil. Finally, as a reminder, our first quarter 2019 results include the impact of the Embraco compressor business in Latin America's results.
In our Asia region, revenue declined over 20% as China demand declined sharply in the quarter due to COVID-19-related disruptions. This was followed by a government-enforced shutdown in India which has now been extended into early May. In China, our manufacturing facilities have returned to normal operating levels, and we have seen demand stabilize with some initial indications of a rebound as consumers slowly reenter the marketplace. 
Overall, we are very pleased with our first quarter EBIT margin results of 6.1% given the approximately 150 basis point EBIT margin impact from COVID-19. These results clearly demonstrate the agility and resiliency of our global operations.
Turning to Slide 11, Marc and I will discuss our current perspective on 2020. I will now turn it over to Marc to begin."
314515,645580026,1990306,"Whirlpool Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 01, 2020",2020-05-01,"Earnings Calls","Whirlpool Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim.

The broader macroeconomic environment continuing to rapidly evolve, the full impact of COVID-19 on our business results remain highly uncertain and we're unable to provide a meaningful full year guidance at this time. That said, we want to provide the answers to 3 fundamental questions, which I'll go into more detail on the following slides. 
First, what's the shape of a recovery? In this section, I'll provide an overview of the current sell-through trends in key countries and an update on our full year net sales expectations. We anticipate a U-type recovery throughout 2020, resulting in a full year organic net sales decline of 10% to 15%. Second, can we sustain our operating margin? Here, I will discuss the fundamental difference in our margin profile entering the COVID-19 crisis compared to the 2008 recession and also highlight the additional cost actions we will drive throughout 2020 to help sustain our operating margins. Thirdly, what's our liquidity position? Finally, Jim will discuss our strong cash and liquidity position which will allow us to cope with the economic uncertainty we continue to face across the globe. 
Turning to Slide 12, I'll highlight the preliminary data that supports our perspective of a U-shaped recovery throughout 2020. Please note that we do not intend to share this data going forward but we felt, given the uncertainty of the current situation, that this data will provide valuable proof points as we all assess the impact of COVID-19. As we monitor the development of COVID-19 cases and its related impact on appliance demand within China, Italy and the U.S., we've begun to see similar U-shaped demand patterns emerge. China, we see clear signs of a U-shaped demand pattern with recovery closely linked although slightly lagging to the reduction of new COVID-19 cases.
Turning to Slide 13. While Italy's trends are not as mature as China's, the demand patterns are well in line. 
Turning to Slide 14. Even though the U.S. is obviously at an earlier stage of battling the COVID-19, early signs point to a similar U-shaped demand trend as seen in China and Italy. It is important to note, however, that the demand decline in the United States is clearly not as pronounced as in China and Italy, and we are currently experiencing sell-out declines of around 20% to 25%, which is less than half of what we've seen in other markets. We see 2 reasons for this fundamental difference in demand patterns. One, the U.S. has a very significant portion of replacement sales of more than 50% of our total industry, and two, the home improvement channel kept stores open during this crisis, allowing consumers to continue purchasing appliances. Based on the consistent demand trends we are seeing across 3 of our key countries, each at different phases of crisis, we are expecting a full year 2020 organic net sales decline of 10% to 15%, with a majority of the decline occurring in the second quarter, followed by a slow recovery in the third quarter and a slight growth in fourth quarter.
Turning to Slide 15, the EBIT margin chart highlights the clear difference in starting position entering the COVID-19 crisis compared to the 2008 financial crisis. In the quarters preceding the 2008 financial crisis, we delivered EBIT margins of about 5%. Upon entering the 2008 financial crisis, we saw EBIT margins drop sharply to around 3.5% before bottoming out at a negative 1% in the fourth quarter of 2008. Contrast this with our current starting point in which we recently delivered 2019 ongoing EBIT margin of 7% or greater from second quarter on and over 6% margins in the first quarter of 2020, inclusive of 150 basis points impact of COVID-19. 
We are starting from a fundamentally stronger place due to the decisive actions we took post 2008 recession. We took many difficult but necessary actions related to the fixed cost structure of our business, including restructuring actions, plant optimizations and the exit of certain nonprofitable product segments, ensuring that we would be able to withstand the next crisis. Since that time, we've remain disciplined in our approach to fixed cost management. Fixed cost discipline has structurally improved our margin profile, allowing us to enter this crisis in a position of strength.
Turning to Slide 16, I'll discuss the additional strong actions put in place to sustain our margins over the near term. First, as our teams monitored the spread of COVID-19 from Asia to Europe and then to U.S. and beyond, our operational teams acted early and decisively to ensure we appropriately matched inventory levels and our supply base to demand. Second, we aggressively target significant reductions in both structural and discretionary costs, including a reduction in discretionary marketing and promotion spend and strict headcount control across all regions as well as unpaid leave, furloughs, among other actions. 
In parallel, we implemented a controlled trial process and put rigorous guidelines in place to manage our expenses going forward. Third, we continued to focus on ensuring we capitalize on the deflationary raw materials market. Finally, we've maintained our strict focus on working capital management, ensuring we have a proper risk mitigation plan in place, dual-sourcing strategies enacted and are appropriately managing our inventory levels across the globe. 
With these additional actions in place, we are now targeting over $500 million in net cost and raw material savings in 2020, up over $300 million from our previous guidance.
Moving to Slide 17, I now turn it over to Jim to highlight our overall financial position and ability to weather this current crisis."

As a result of the strategic actions we took leading up to this crisis, we entered the crisis with a strong balance sheet. First, we have a very strong liquidity position as evidenced by our current cash position of $2.8 billion, with approximately $2 billion available in remaining committed credit facilities. This is inclusive of a recently executed $500 million short-term credit facility. Second, anchored by our strong balance sheet, we maintain ample buffer to withstand increased debt or a reduction in earnings without tripping our covenants. Our debt-to-capitalization limit is 0.65 and we are currently at approximately 0.5, while our interest coverage ratio requires a minimum of 3x and we are currently above 10x. Third, we have access to additional levers to unlock cash. We continue to evaluate additional liquidity options, and from an operational standpoint, we will continue to effectively manage our working capital. Fourth, I'd like to highlight that we refinanced EUR 500 million of long-term debt in February of this year, and have no additional bond maturities until the second quarter of 2021. 
Furthermore, I'd like to remind everyone that we pre-funded our U.S. pension in 2018, which effectively suspended our need to make further payments until 2023 or beyond. It is through our strong financial position and our continued actions that we strive to maintain our investment-grade credit rating.
Lastly, I'd like to touch on our capital allocation plans which have temporarily changed in light of our current situation. Although we repurchased approximately $120 million in shares in the first quarter, we will be suspending additional share repurchases until our future liquidity needs become clear. That said, we did declare our quarterly dividend and remain strongly committed to returning value to shareholders through these difficult economic times.
Overall, we are confident that we have the liquidity needed to support our operations during this crisis, and remain focused on our long-term commitment to our gross debt-to-EBITDA goal of 2x. 
Now on Slide 18, I'll turn it back over to Marc to discuss why we're well-positioned to win in the economic recovery."

I'd like to take a moment now to discuss how we are well-positioned to capitalize on the eventual economic rebound in the short term, while simultaneously well-positioned for future growth over the long term. Throughout this crisis, where necessary we have slowed our operations, adjusting operating line layouts and speed to adapt to government orders, new safety guidelines and dramatic shifts in appliance demand. This will allow us to quickly respond to positive demand changes and rapidly ramp up to normal level of operations. Additionally, we anticipate there will be pent-up demand in the short term as discretionary purchase have largely been delayed.
As a clear leader in home appliances across the globe, we are extremely well-positioned to capture this demand upon its return. To further take advantage of a recovery, we are leveraging our best-in-class manufacturing supply chain operations, remaining agile in our approach to production and inventory management. As we look longer term, we believe that we are uniquely structured to take advantage of post-crisis demand changes. One of the changes we expect to remain is the rediscovery of the home and the kitchen as a center of living. Needless to say, this will be a positive catalyst for our entire industry, and our unmatched brand portfolio and innovation pipeline clearly gives us a head start in capitalizing on this trend. 
Additionally, we are anticipating an acceleration in the adoption of online purchasing for large home appliances post-crisis. As such, the investments we have and continue to make in e-commerce and in direct-to-consumer sales as part of our digital transformation journey are key levers of our long-term growth.
Lastly, we remain committed to our ESG priorities. As highlighted in our recently released sustainability report, we have a long-standing history of investing in the safety and well-being of our employees and the environmental efficiency of our products and operations and in support of the communities we call home.
In closing, I'd like to summarize our key messages on Slide 19. We remain committed to the health and safety of our employees around the globe and will continue to adapt our policies and procedures as the situation with COVID-19 continues to unfold. Our Q1 results highlight the strength and the resilience of our business, and we will continue to take decisive cost actions to ensure the health and viability of our business for the long term with a continued focus on sustaining strong margin throughout the crisis. Additionally, we have ample liquidity to weather any demand recovery scenario and remain fully committed to driving our business towards our leverage goal of 2x over the long term. 
Further, we are well-prepared to swiftly ramp up operations and leverage our global leadership position to win in the eventual economic recovery. It is because of these actions and the strong experience of our management team that we're confident in our ability to weather this crisis and emerge in a position of strength. We remain firmly focused on executing our business priorities and are fully committed to driving strong shareholder returns.
Now we will end our formal remarks and open up for questions."

But particularly what I think a lot of companies have done and -- by the way, almost none of them have kind of laid out their thoughts for a full year sales impact, so very much appreciate that perspective. But one of the other areas that I think has been helpful is to try and get a sense of how to think about decrementals in the second quarter, which certainly, generally speaking, are the most extreme given some of the abrupt shutdown and inefficiencies that occur, and how those decrementals might improve throughout the year as the cost savings that you've outlined kick in."
314515,645580026,1990306,"Whirlpool Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 01, 2020",2020-05-01,"Earnings Calls","Whirlpool Corporation","Executives","Michael, let me maybe just take your question and split it up in 2 pieces. First of all, obviously, everything depends now on the revenue assumptions. And the overall demand pattern where we all recognize there's a very significant amount of uncertainty.",284,"Michael, let me maybe just take your question and split it up in 2 pieces. First of all, obviously, everything depends now on the revenue assumptions. And the overall demand pattern where we all recognize there's a very significant amount of uncertainty. And -- but I think our perspective and today with the information which we have is a U-shaped recovery or demand development, which means we expect the majority of a negative in demand to occur in Q2. I do expect a slight drag still in Q3 and Q4 recovery. So that gives you a little bit of a sense of what we anticipate from a broad demand perspective. 
That being said, that also means we have the biggest deleveraging effect on operations in the second quarter and maybe some elements also in the third quarter. As we -- and I think we mentioned that in some previous earnings call. Of course, the leverage effect you have on production is extremely different by production type, factory, occupational level, et cetera. But I think as a rough, and I underline, a very rough rule of thumb, you can obviously assume about 18% to 20% is our leverage factor, i.e., every dollar you lose is about $0.20 of deleveraging. I think it's, however, very important to highlight that in the significant increase of our net cost takeout, we already factored in the negative effect which we will have from deleveraging. So that is all factored in on the cost side. Of course, the margin side is a different one. So we anticipate that we can absorb it, which is not going to be easy, and on top of that increase our net cost take out."

And I guess -- so if I understand your comments correctly, and it kind of leads me into the second question in any case. So just to clarify that response, are you saying that $500 million would off -- would negate the decrementals or would negate a worse-than-expected impact on the decrementals in the 2Q period where you're going to have that higher level of inefficiency due to the abrupt nature of what's going on in 2Q? And then the heart of the question for my second question really is if you could give us a sense of the breakdown of that $500 million of net cost takeouts across the different buckets that you manage and if any of those might be temporary that you could layer back in, in a 2021 time frame, commensurate with the improvement in demand?"

So Michael, first of all, to clarify, the $500 million is a full year, and we haven't given the specification about how much comes in Q2 and Q3.

So Michael, first of all, to clarify, the $500 million is a full year, and we haven't given the specification about how much comes in Q2 and Q3. But as you can imagine, it takes a little to ramp it up. But to be clear, the $500 million is after already all these inefficiencies. So that is net-net of everything. So it's a pretty clean number. So it's after the negative impact of deleveraging. In terms of a composition of the $500 million, and as you may recall, in the opening earnings call of this year, we roughly indicated about a $200 million. So what you have in between -- first of all, as you indicated, you lose some, and that's the inefficiencies, which are -- I mean you take the number which we gave you before and you also have a negative currency impact because a lot of materials we buy, for example, in Brazil, we have a negative currency impact.
On the good side, you have a slightly better raw material, which we have factored in. But then, in addition, we have very significant expense control, expense management, SG&A efforts and also people cost. And that is a combination of both, to your point, kind of temporary actions but also structural actions. So it's not only temporary actions. So there is quite a bit of structural cost takeout which we have factored in, in this $500 million. But again, I want to reemphasize, it's after all these negative deleveraging effects."

I guess if I'm thinking about that bridge and applying 20% decrementals on your full year sales guide and then adding back some cost takeout, it seems to suggest that the math would get you to EBIT that's only modestly down for the year and I think margin percentage would actually be up. So I guess I'm just struggling to bridge that a little because a number of other companies have talked about more like 40% decrementals, 2x normal. And then after cost takeout, maybe getting back towards normal. So it just seems -- I appreciate you guys are around that tailwinds, but it seems a little out of sync with what we're hearing from some others. So maybe a little more color on that, please."

First of all, on the -- specifically on question of raw materials, yes, we see a slightly more positive tailwind from raw materials. But as I mentioned before, keep in mind, about half of that additional tailwind is already eaten up with currency losses. So on a full year basis compared to what we had before, maybe give you 1/4 to 1/2 a point more takeout from pure raw materials. But it's not as dramatic as you may assume because steel prices are largely locked in because these are annual contracts. You have a little bit of incremental benefit on plastic and resins, but that's about it. 
Having said all that, so yes, our $500 million net cost takeout, that is our big lever which we have to protect our operating margins. We have not given and will not give a full year margin guideline because there's a lot of other parameters coming into place. But yes, that's our tool to predict our margins. But keep also in mind you have, even on the top line, not only the overall revenue growth, but the mix, which -- and that is not very untypical from the prior recession, but mix you should expect throughout the crisis is slightly negative. So you can't anticipate the same kind of positive price margin effect as we've seen in the last 1 or 2 years because an economic crisis is not necessarily the environment where you get a huge positive mix. So you have a negative mix also in the full year assumption."

And that's why we -- for once in a while, I want to share it with you, just to give you also same kind of information that we look at every day. 
With that in mind, particularly about U.S. question, the 20%, 25% is revenue related because as you highlighted, on top of volume, we have a slight negative mix. And that's, again, that's not atypical for these kind of recessions. I think it's -- and I want to reemphasize what I also said earlier is I think what we -- and that's good news, well, relatively speaking, good news relative to some of the other markets. We do not see the U.S. market dropping as much as we've seen in Italy, France or China. Very simple, because of a high degree or high percentage of replacement demand, and the fact that we still have the home improvement, but also some independent retailers open right now. So the consumer has a place to go and fulfill that replacement need. And that's a fundamental difference in the U.S. compared to many of the other markets which we see throughout the world."

Now over time, we will see the benefits of the cost takeout running in and that will help our margins in the long run. 
And again, if you look back to 2008 and 2009 and what we did with fixed costs back then, and we're able to keep it out till now, it will be the same thing as we continue to reduce our cost level, but those will be benefits that will be seen more in 2021 and beyond as things begin to stabilize. I think the other unknown as I talked about this year is we do have a lot of currency fluctuation within there. That could also have an impact on our bottom line, at least in the near term. So I think just for the remainder of this year, you should start to think about the incremental volume in the 18% to 20% type of range."

So the impact has been earlier and even stronger. Now in a certain way, you can look at the Q1 numbers even though in absolute terms, we still made a loss, but it was better year-over-year. 
So in a certain way, that tells you how much progress we've done in the cost takeout in getting this business in a much better structural run rate. Because, as you can imagine, with these kind of volume drops, under normal circumstances, you would have a very, very negative impact even year-over-year. So I would see -- in a way, I would even see Q1 as a confirmation we were on the right track because they got run right track.

Let me maybe expand a little bit on the supply question and go beyond Mexico. In very simple terms, you got to look at the supply chain stability from 2 perspectives: one, how do you keep your factories up and running; and two, how can you make sure your components keep on coming into the factories. On the factories, we made early on the conscious decision to keep our factories running even though at a much lower pace and a much lower volume. And in a certain way we basically ran them very inefficiently because we -- our assumption is that even a slow but steady supply chain is better than a stop and go. Now obviously, we still had to follow sometimes certain government lockdowns or in some cases, we had to clean and sanitize the factory, but at any given time over the last weeks, we had 80% to 85% of our factories running. So the factories are in a pretty stable and good situation. 
Now in components, as you can imagine, our first focus on components supply and steady was related to China. That was our first area of concern. And I would say with an extraordinary amount of effort and hard work, our team was able to get the supply chain situation in China in control. And we did not -- not without challenges, but we did not experience any significant component shortages coming out of China. Right now, our focus, as you alluded to, is a little bit of Mexico because the Mexico guidelines have not been synchronized with the guidelines of Canada and U.S. So we had some issues of stop and go of certain suppliers. I think they're being worked through, but they have not been completely resolved, but we remain confident they will be resolved in the next coming weeks."

I mean if anybody knows exactly the shape of a recovery, then good luck. As you know, there has been all letters of the alphabet being used to describe a potential form of recovery.

I just don't think it's happening. 
And at this point, you also cannot exclude an L-shaped kind of development of this whole crisis. But again, I would argue the odds right now which we see are in favor of a U-shape. The reason why we say that is for -- again, as I mentioned before, for 2 reasons. One is the early demand patterns which we see coming out of the China market. Some European markets clearly point towards the U-shape. And that's very different from financial recession because the depth of the crisis is more severe than financial crisis, but it appears from what we see from these markets that the kind of duration of the crisis is shorter. 
The other reason, and again, that's probably more macroeconomic, we should also not lose sight of the -- this coronavirus falls on a different environment than it did in 2008. There is no housing bubble. Quite the opposite. The financial institutions are in a much stronger shape than they were in 2008. I think it's a different macroeconomic context where this coronavirus happened. But again, that's -- right now our most likely assumption, I think time will tell. Is it a U? Is it an L?

So we actually felt pretty confident, and that's just Italy. But I would say we have seen similar developments in other markets. 
So we started the year pretty well, which is probably a good indication of our listings which we got with different retailers. But now we, of course, like everybody else, being hit with the virus. But I'm actually pretty confident that we can pick up on where we started in Q1. I would also argue, because of a very, very strong supply chain management in Europe where we limited the number of factory closures really to the bare minimum, our supply base inventory situation and stability of the supply base is actually a pretty good one. So we're confident we can get out of the gate pretty good. We have a good availability, always with some limitations, but given what the overall crisis did to everybody, we're in a pretty good shape to come out of this one."

So Eric, so first of all, on the U.S. channel, of course, that is heavily impacted simply by the fact which stores are open and which ones are not open. As you know, first of all, from a broader environment, the U.S. market is, compared to other international markets, still with heavy buys on the in-store as opposed to the e-commerce market, which, of course, here right now in the crisis, the e-commerce side has increased quite a bit, but it's still a very store-based shopping purchase in the U.S. So as such, what we saw in the channels right now is heavily driven by which stores were open. And that's just the reality. And a lot will depend on Q2 in terms of at what pace do the closed stores come back online and are reopening. And that's I think how you should read it. But right now, in the broader scheme, yes, by definition, what we saw in March and April, there is a heavy shift towards the home improvement channel in the U.S. And again, that's entirely driven by store openings. 
To your point about the mix, and again, it's not atypical what we saw so versus 2008 and 2009. In particular, the outset of this crisis, you see a heavy mix down. And particularly now there was -- when people were hoarding, they bought a freezer, they bought a second fridge, and these don't come with high mix. Typically, and what we see also already happening in China, that starts stabilizing as the crisis progresses. But for the premium and super premium purchase to then pick up, I think you will still have to wait a couple of quarters. And then again, that's not entirely surprising because that's the discretionary purchase which is often very driven by an entire kitchen remodel. So I think until we see the really -- the rich part of the mix coming back, I think we will talk a couple of quarters."

I think what, 52% or 53%, what we gave you as a number. So if we see a market decline, that comes out of a nonreplacement side of a business. So as a percentage, is now even higher, but it's in absolute terms. So that's a pretty steady number from replacement. And we also clearly positioned that replacement side almost as a floor of a market because we're still comping against the low years of 2008, 2009, 2010. So we feel pretty good. That's the floor, and it will not drop a whole lot further. So that's the steady side. 
The high end discretionary one is, I think, where you, in the short term, and I would say, 2 to 4 quarters, you will see still some negative, and that's not surprising. And by the way, very, very similar to what we've seen in 2009 and 2010. Particularly in your question about the new homes and the builder channel, keep in mind we are at the very tail end of any house completion. Appliances are one of the last products which come into any build. And as you all have seen with the builders, the builders had a very strong order intake and starts pretty much until early March, mid-March. I think there has now been some drops in late March and April. But the projects and the houses which the builders have started, they will complete. 
So we do see from our side, certainly in Q2 and Q3, still a very steady stream of new homes and what we do there with the appliances. The key question, of course, is then how does the broader builder markets now develop. And I think there's arguments made why it will continue to grow, like the low mortgage rates and fundamental demand still. But of course, consumer confidence will play a key factor. As long as this overall recession is limited in duration, I don't think we will see a major lasting impact on consumer confidence. But of course, that's one of the big uncertain elements right now."

But looking again at just North America, in '08, your sales fell about 10%, you had about a 300 basis point decline in margin, realizing margins were different in terms of the base level. But specifically, I mean, we keep going into this. So your fixed costs are lower. You guys removed a lot of fixed cost last cycle. With the cost -- so obviously, a lot of your 20%, you have a lot of variable costs. So with the material declines that you expect, meaning the $500 million, can you just -- is it really that fixed cost is different that is supporting the math because the labor -- the material costs you're following, but is it really the fixed cost that is so different in 2020 if sales are down high single digits in the U.S. versus what we saw in '08?"

And so what you were seeing is that we kept the fixed cost as we grew revenues and grew volumes across the globe and especially within the U.S. And now as we've had the decline, it's not as significant as it was back then as an impact to our bottom line because of that already low fixed cost base we're starting on. Then in addition to that, as we talked about, is we will target taking out and we will take out additional costs here.

First of all, if you compare 2008 to the current one, the starting point of our margins in 2008 coming into the crisis were lower. And as you've seen on my chart, in the first quarter, as a company in total, North America, we basically barely made a profit. 
Actually, we had a small loss on the EBIT base. Now fast forward to the current one, the volume drop right now, and that's what we forecasted, is more than a financial crisis. So under normal circumstances, if you would take out 2008 picture, yes, that will be very painful for us. But -- and that's to Jim's point, we manage fixed costs. And to put that differently, our breakeven point in all the factories is significantly lower than it was before. So we will be able to absorb that volume loss in a much better way than we did in 2008. And that's been the work over the last couple of years.
The other comment I also want to make is, yes, the coronavirus as such -- yes, you can call it a black swan event, which came with our preannouncement. The recession as such is not a complete shock. And we've been working already over the last year on additional cost take-out, on balance sheet measures. So and that has just allowed us to now ramp up a cost take-out even more so compared to 2008. And that's -- and we started that in not just now, we started pretty much some time ago and now we just ramped it up in addition. So I think the situation is very different, our preparedness is a little bit different and our fundamental starting point and breakeven point in factories is very different."

I think the point which you asked earlier, can replacement purchases be delayed? I would say, to a very limited extent. And again, that's where you have some experience from 2008, 2009 helps. So a dishwasher which can be replaced or needs to be replaced, yes, then it can be delayed. But even in 2008 and 2009, we didn't see these kind of things delayed more than 1 or 2 quarters. A washer or refrigerator replacement will not be delayed. We've not seen that in 2008 and 2009, and we don't see that right now.

Now turning to Slide 4, we discuss our second quarter 2020 highlights. We delivered resilient results globally with ongoing earnings per diluted share of $2.15, and an ongoing EBIT margin of 5.2%, despite significant and continued COVID-19-related challenges. 
In North America, we delivered a very strong performance of 12.6% EBIT margins, an expansion of 20 basis points and a clear indication of a region's strength and agility. Across the globe, we took decisive and meaningful actions, driving strong levels of cost take out. Lastly, we delivered year-over-year free cash flow improvement of $124 million due to strong working capital management, particularly in accounts receivables and inventory. 
Turning to Slide 5. We show the drivers of our second quarter EBIT margin. Price/mix negatively impacted margin by 75 basis points, as unfavorable product mix shifts, due to COVID-19-related consumer purchases, were partially offset by effective promotion management in North America. Our cost take out actions delivered approximately 150 basis points of margin expansion, partially offsetting a 300 basis point headwind from lower fixed cost absorption, driven by COVID-19 production disruptions and inventory reduction. 
Additionally, continued favorable raw material trends positively benefited margins by approximately 100 basis points. Lastly, strong cost discipline, related to marketing and technology investments, partially offset the unfavorable impact of currency, primarily in our Latin America region. Overall, we are very pleased to deliver solid operating margins in what was undoubtedly the most difficult quarter of a global pandemic. This impressively demonstrates the strong execution of our global teams and resiliency of our business model. 
And now I'll turn it over to Jim to review our recent results."

Turning to Slide 7. I'll review our second quarter regional results. In North America, COVID-related demand and operational disruptions resulted in double-digit revenue decline, with solid recovery in June as restrictions eased across most states. This year-over-year revenue decline of approximately 13% is comparably better than other regions due to home improvement channels remaining open. Despite lower demand, we delivered EBIT margins of 12.6% in the quarter, due to strong cost discipline and reduced marketing investments. 
From an operational standpoint, we continue to experience supply disruptions due to reduced production yield in U.S. factories and component shortages out of Mexico. Overall, we are pleased with the continued strength of our North America business and the region's ability to maintain strong margins in a challenging environment. 
Turning to Slide 8. I'll review our second quarter results for Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Shutdowns across Europe in April and May, and significant demand weakness across the region, drove our negative second quarter results. However, in June, year-over-year volume growth in all countries, except Russia, driven by strong demand recovery and share gains in key countries, resulted in year-over-year net sales growth and positive EBIT in the month. Looking forward, a strong order pipeline, extending into Q3, combined with our ongoing improvement efforts, provide us confidence the region will return to profitability in the back half of the year. 
Turning to Slide 9. I'll review our second quarter results for our Latin America region. Demand declined strongly throughout the quarter in Mexico and through [indiscernible] Brazil, with June showing strong signs of recovery. Organic net sales declined approximately 4%, as share gains across the region and strong direct-to-consumer sales partially offset demand declines. The region delivered positive EBIT margin as strong cost take out mitigated COVID-related disruptions and continued currency devaluation. 
Finally, as a reminder, our second quarter 2019 results include the impact of the Embraco compressor business in Latin America's results. This will be the final quarter in which comparison periods will contain Embraco results. 
Turning to Slide 10. I'll review our second quarter results for the Asia region. While net sales were significantly impacted by the India shutdowns in April and May, demand rebounded across Asia in June. EBIT declined as cost takeout was offset by significant COVID-related demand challenges. 
In China, the macroeconomic environment has become increasingly stable, though a level of uncertainty remains as we move through the second half of the year. Operationally, we are pleased to have delivered Whirlpool-branded share growth in the quarter. 
In India, results strongly improved sequentially within the quarter, as economic restrictions eased. Overall, we are pleased with our ongoing EBIT margin results of 5.2%, given the approximately 300 basis point impact from COVID-19. These results in our operational strategy and demonstrate the resiliency of our global business. 
Turning to Slide 12. Marc and I will discuss our updated perspective on 2020. I will now turn it over to Marc to begin."

As expected, the second quarter was the most difficult one in terms of the impact of a pandemic on our business. While we are encouraged by the demand trends seen in June and extending into Q3, we are very mindful of the significant uncertainties which remain for the rest of the year. Because of this, we are not reinstating full year guidance, but again, we want to provide our current perspective based on the information available at this time. 
In line with our discussions during the last earnings call, I want to give you an update on the 3 fundamental questions for our business in 2020. One, what's the shape of recovery? Based on our current sell-through trends in key countries, we continue to expect a U-shaped recovery throughout 2020. However, there is a risk for W-shaped demand curve, in particular, as we look into Q4. Overall, we anticipate a full year organic net sales decline of 7% to 12%, an improvement from our previous full year perspective of 10% to 15%, due to a stronger-than-expected second quarter net sales. 
Second, can we sustain our operating margins? Here, I would highlight the clear structural improvement in our margin profile compared to our business results during the [indiscernible] 8 financial crisis, and by that provides us confidence in our ability to sustain healthy operating margins going forward. 
Additionally, we can confirm we are firmly on track to deliver cost savings of $500 million or more in 2020. Third, what's our liquidity position? Finally, Jim will discuss our strong cash position, supported by a clear focus on disciplined working capital management and our enhanced liquidity position, which enables us to withstand the current economic uncertainty we face across the globe. 
Turning to Slide 13. I'll highlight the updated data that continues to support our perspective of the U-shaped recovery throughout 2020. However, please note that we do not intend to share this data beyond this quarter, but we felt, given the uncertainty of the current situation, that this data will provide valuable proof points as we all assess the impact of COVID-19. 
As we continue to monitor the development of COVID-19 cases and its related impact on appliance demand across key countries, we continue to see similar U-shaped demand patterns emerge on date on different time lines. 
In China, COVID-19 cases have significantly reduced, even as the broad economy reopens, leading to a pickup in demand mode with a notable shift from off-line to online. 
In Italy and the U.K., we are seeing clear signs of recovery in June, as COVID-19 cases reduce and the economy begin to reopen. We believe this is pent-up demand from the previous lockdowns, and it remains to be seen if it's yet a structural recovery. 
In the U.S., we have not seen the level of demand declines as we have experienced in other countries. This is the result of key retailers remaining open throughout the pandemic and the impact of government cash transfers to consumers. 
Based on the consistent demand trends we are seeing across many of our key countries, each at different phases of a crisis, we continue to expect the U-shape to recover, resulting in a full year 2020 organic net sales decline of 7% to 12%. 
Turning to Slide 14. I'll discuss our structurally improved margin position. During our last earnings call, we highlighted our margin profile during the last financial crisis. In 2008, we saw EBIT margins dropped sharply to around 3.5% before bottoming out at a negative 1%. Contrast this with our second quarter results, in which we delivered ongoing EBIT margins above 5%, in what is the trough period of a current COVID-related crisis. These results provide a meaningful proof point indicating what we can sustain healthy margins throughout this crisis and demonstrate the effectiveness of a strong and decisive actions we have taken. 
Turning to Slide 15. I'll discuss the actions put in place to sustain our margins over the near-term in more detail. Overall, we're well on track towards delivering cost takeout of $500 million or more as part of our COVID-19 response plan. Year-to-date, we have delivered cost takeout of approximately $180 million with actions in place to realize the remainder of the savings in the second half of the year. 
First, we continue to focus on ensuring we capitalize on the deflationary raw material market. Second, we continue to significantly reduce both structural and discretionary spending. During the quarter, we took the initial steps to implement a large majority of the actions we outlined on our Q1 call. As of today, these actions are 80% completed. And as a result, we expect to see cost savings resulting from these measures accelerate throughout the second half of the year. 
Third, we have maintained our strict focus on working capital management, ensuring we have the proper risk mitigation plans in place and are appropriately managing our inventory levels across the globe. Finally, we recently announced a workforce reduction plan in the U.S. as part of our continued cost reduction efforts. 
Inclusive of our U.S. actions, [indiscernible] restructuring charges and anticipated additional actions, we now expect total restructuring charges of $260 million to $280 million for 2020, above our original guidance of $100 million. 
Moving to Slide 16. I'll now turn it over to Jim to highlight our overall financial position and ability to navigate and ultimately lead out of this crisis."

As a result of continued efforts to support our overall liquidity needs, our financial position remains strong, with ample liquidity and flexibility to withstand the current economic uncertainty. 
First, we have a very strong liquidity position, as evidenced by our current cash position of $2.5 billion, with approximately $2.5 billion available in remaining committed credit facilities. Within the quarter, we executed a $500 million 364-day revolving credit facility and issued a $500 million 30-year bond, adding $1 billion of additional liquidity. 
Subsequently, we used the proceeds from the bond and new credit facility to pay down $1 billion of short-term borrowings under our long-term committed credit facility, maintaining our leverage position compared to the first quarter. 
Second, we continue to maintain ample buffer to withstand increased debt or a reduction in earnings without negatively impacting our covenants. From a covenant perspective, our debt to capitalization limit is 0.65, and we are currently at approximately 0.5, while our interest coverage ratio requires a minimum of 3x, and we are currently above 10x. 
Third, I'd like to remind everyone that we have no additional bond maturities until the second quarter of 2021, which is only approximately $300 million. It is through our strong financial position and our continued actions that we strive to maintain our strong investment-grade credit rating. 
Lastly, I'd like to mention that our revised capital allocation plan remains unchanged at this time. Until our future liquidity needs become clear, our temporary suspension of share repurchases will remain in effect. Overall, we are confident that we have the liquidity needed to support our operations during this crisis, and remain focused on progressing towards our long-term gross debt-to-EBITDA goal of 2x. 
Now on Slide 17. I'll turn it back over to Marc to summarize our key messages."

I wouldn't call that structural. 
And of the remaining 350, there is about 100 million, which are nonstructural, like furloughs or travel expense reduction. But there's 250 million structural actions, which we largely implemented in the second quarter, that's what the 80% refers to, which, of course, will have an impact -- had some impact already in Q2, but the large impact is in the second half. There will be, by definition, just that for the fact of a calendar year. Yes, there's a carryover impact of structural actions into '21. And but keep in mind that also next year, we're running a comparison of a non structure, so you can mitigate some of that. So yes, there is a carryover impact of the structural actions, which is probably in a ballpark of 50 million to 100 million carried over into '21."

And as we also highlighted in our remarks, we saw, in particular -- first of all, throughout the entire quarter, the demand impact was less pronounced than any other market around the world. And that's just a result of key channels remaining open. And frankly, also with consumers benefiting from a government stimulus program with having cash available. So a combination of relatively solid demand and stores remaining open that took probably less of a severe impact in the second quarter than other markets. 
With that in mind, even though we kept our factors running through the entire second quarter, the COVID impact on the supply chain is relevant. It comes back to social distancing in the factories. How you prepare factories for it? You could have had temporary shutdown of factory because of flare ups. And we also had component challenges coming out of Mexico. 
With that in mind, and particularly over the last 6 weeks of a quarter, we were supply constrained. And that led to a market share loss over the last 6 weeks in North America. We are in our way of working through that and out of it. But I also want to be mindful of, as long as COVID is around, as there is a certain risk to the supply chain. We work on existing challenges, and we're confident we will get them behind us. But the risk remain throughout the rest of the year as long as COVID is around us."

So Curt, I believe what you're talking about is the incremental restructuring cost that we added on. And obviously, this is significantly related to the downturn in volume that we had, which is a onetime type of event in terms of a pandemic and the need to reduce our cost structure at a higher level than we had originally anticipated. 
I mean, if you want to think about that, it kind of happens pretty ratably across the globe as you look at it. Because this is the portion the initial $100 million was the restructuring we were doing mainly within EMEA around the closure of the Naples factory and a few other things. These incremental actions are being implemented across the globe, almost in an equal amount about where our revenues are. 
Most of these are -- the majority of these are people costs, and that's just the reduction that you see. We did a couple of different things here is: one, we ran a discretionary early retirement program within the U.S.; Then, additionally, we had some involuntary layoffs that we also did throughout the process. So using both of those tools, those are what add up to most of those costs there. And as I said, you just got to think about it. It's pretty even across the globe because we've taken actions everywhere to bring our business in line with the volume that we see for this year and the potential risks we see going forward."

What you fundamentally need to understand, when you make a factory COVID safe, or as safe as you can do. Because of social distancing, because of recovering the factories because you physically have to extend the line spacing on an assembly line, et cetera. Because of risks, which you have with flaring up of case in certain locations, and frankly, also higher absenteeism, which we are experiencing right now, you can never -- even if you run the factory, you can't run it at 100% capacity. That's a simple reality of COVID. 
In addition, the Mexican components which are delivered into our U.S. factory, we had some challenges because the Mexico situation is in far even more complicated because of the decision about if a factory can operate or not is delegated to the states of Mexico and delegated to individual health inspectors, and that drove just a lot of stop and goes. As you said before, it's not only impacting us, it's -- I would assume it impacts the entire industry. But these are the 2 fundamental elements in this.

And what you see in there is the heavy down mix from a product mix was, in particular, the beginning of a COVID. And then we saw a very significant amount of low-end refrigerators, microwaves, et cetera. And that mix gradually is getting better as long as the pandemic remains. There's now people rediscover the albums, the bookers. I mean they just spend time H kitchen, and there's cash available with consumers. So that ultimately now starts driving better mix.

How should we think about the second half in terms of 3Q, 4Q, you talked about -- previously, you said $70 million, maybe there's a little more in the first quarter, $100 million in the second, or 180 combined, how should that break out 3Q, 4Q?"

In the back half of the year, which leaves another $250 million of our net cost takeout that comes within this time. And as the cost actions begin to ramp up, you could probably think about that as 40% of that may be coming in Q3.

We feel very good about where our working capital levels are from a cash flow perspective. Obviously, our inventories have come down as we've sold a lot of product out of our inventories, but our receivables are a little bit lower. And our payables are significantly lower because of the lower production volumes. 
So we do expect the same seasonality of cash that we see in a normal year. And as sales pick up throughout the fourth quarter, we do expect to collect more cash. 
So -- and the other thing I'd probably add in within there is you'll also see in the back half of the year, more of the benefit of some of the capital products we've been delaying. As you look out throughout the year, we won't have as much outflow to capital expenditures in the back half."

Despite enormous seasonality, don't do a mistake of just adding that improvement to the full year number of next -- last year. And the reason why I'm saying this one is but working capital, and particularly inventory which, as you know, impact cash flow are very unusual. We have the highest amount of inventory reduction ever in the second quarter. 
And when you rebuild inventory, basically negatively impact your working capital, and that has a certain cash range. So there's a little bit of rebalancing around the inventories. I do expect this to be completed before year-end, so we should more or less get back to a normal situation. Partly, we absolutely do expect a positive cash flow, and we're firmly on track on this one."

So I guess, I'd love to get your thoughts in terms of -- based on kind of now getting back reestablished with some of these key retailers and getting your balance of trade back up, getting your mix moving in the right direction, how patient should we be thinking about needing to be to see at least 3% to 4% kind of progress towards that longer-term goal?"

So David, on urban, particularly if you referred to a year ago, as you recall, in last year, Q3 and Q4, we find of the European numbers starting to come around. And we were also encouraged by what we saw certainly before COVID until pretty much February. 
Now we all know 2.5 quarters don't make a trend yet. But it was, of course, frustrating just when we kind of had the quarter trending in the right way that COVID hit. COVID hit Europe in a very hard way, similar to what we've seen in India or other markets and a lot stronger than in North America and Brazil, because essentially, you had entire countries and retailer shutdown. So the April, May was devastating, frankly, from a bottom line, because you had very limited revenue and you had the fixed cost, despite what you did on cost. So April, May was way worse than you see our entire quarterly results. 
June was solid. And in terms of being very -- I mean, profitable, not just above breakeven, but really profitable, a solid demand. And July and August also look good. And frankly, that's why Jim said earlier, we will make a profit in Q3 and subsequently also Q4. 
To your question about, when do we see the 3% or 4%? We haven't yet given guidance for '21. '21 will be a milestone towards these numbers, but maybe not yet fully to these numbers. But we, in a certain way also a factor in '21 in the year-over-year comparison and we mentally need to take off the COVID impact out and knowing that we were on a reasonable run rate, that's what we expect to continue into '21."

It is a peculiar channel, as you were well known, and I'm talking about both the national builders and the smaller builders, which go for the home improvement channel. 
In particular, in the national builders, these are typically multiyear contracts, which are either exclusive with us or they kind of focus on maximum 2 suppliers. So these are long-running contracts, which technically on the kind of purely gross margin are a little bit lower, but because the cost to serve are a little bit lower, they are very good channels for us and a profitable channel for us. And they bring a certain continuity and a very good effect. 
Now on the builders, as you know, there was a little bit, I would say, slowdown, as not surprisingly, in February, March, April, but I think the momentum which we've seen on the builder side coming out of May and June and now for rest of the year was very strong. And so when I refer to cautious, you're optimistic about the rest of our business on builders. I'm optimistic because a combination of low mortgage rates, still in undersupplied markets and the broader nesting trend, which we see across consumers, I think spells good news for the builder channel, which -- in which we are very well positioned. 
As you model the impact of this one, keep always in mind, we're at the very tail end of a value chain of a builder. What I mean of that, appliances are the last thing, typically, which goes into the house. So between a housing start and us seeing the revenues of appliance, there is typically 6 to 9 months.

Now specifically to your question about the supply constraints, keep in mind that impacted, particularly the back half of the quarter. So you had demand declines, which just, across the board, in April, May. And then in June, when the demand was starting to recover, we were faced with some supply constraints. So I would say of entire North America revenue drop, which you saw, was around 12% or 13%, a few percentage points were related to supply, but certainly less than half. There is an industry demand, which was just slowed down in April, May. But with June [indiscernible] one was hampered. So yes, we could have had seen even better revenue without which constraints. 
On the margin side, and again, that's testimony to a very strong execution. It is the combination of decisive and strong cost measures taken throughout the quarter, not only on the cost, which we talked about, but also on RevGen and travel expenses, all the things where we're very strong discipline on how we manage the cost. And then as saw the supply constraints, a good response in terms of promotional strategy, which we basically had to turn. Put that all together, that's led to very strong margins. 
And I think, in the past, there's -- not necessarily by you, but a lot of people always ask, so, yes, we see now the peak margins, but what are trough margins? If you have a North America business with a trough margin of 12.6%, I think it answers a lot of questions."

As you look at that 300 basis point impact that we had, a big portion of that is due to the reduced production levels due to safety requirements we had to put in, due to supplier issues, all the things that Marc talked about before. 
I think to put it in context, the easiest way to think about it look at our inventory numbers and the trends in our inventory numbers. And typically, in Q1 and Q2, we build inventory as we head into our prime season. But as we had supply constraints, we were actually reducing our inventory levels by about $400 million in the second quarter. And on a year-over-year basis, it's about a $500 million difference. So that has -- that's what causes that significant impact. And as you build inventory back to normal, that begins to wash out."

Now turning to Slide 4, we discuss our second quarter 2020 highlights. We delivered resilient results globally with ongoing earnings per diluted share of $2.15 and an ongoing EBIT margin of 5.2%, despite significant and continued COVID-19-related challenges.  
In North America, we delivered a very strong performance of 12.6% EBIT margins, an expansion of 20 basis points and a clear indication of a region's strength and agility. Across the globe, we took decisive and meaningful actions, driving strong levels of cost takeout. 
Lastly, we delivered year-over-year free cash flow improvement of $124 million due to strong working capital management particularly in accounts receivables and inventory.  
Turning to Slide 5, we show the drivers of our second quarter EBIT margin. Price/mix negatively impacted margin by 75 basis points as unfavorable product mix shifts due to COVID-19-related consumer purchases were partially offset by effective promotional management in North America. Our cost takeout actions delivered approximately 150 basis points of margin expansion partially offsetting a 300 basis point headwind from lower fixed cost absorption driven by COVID-19 production disruptions and inventory reduction. Additionally, continued favorable raw material trends positively benefited margins by approximately 100 basis points. 
Lastly, strong cost discipline related to marketing and technology investments partially offset the unfavorable impact of currency primarily in our Latin America region. Overall, we are very pleased to deliver solid operating margins in what was undoubtedly the most difficult quarter of a global pandemic. This impressively demonstrates the strong execution of our global teams and resiliency of our business model.  
And now I'll turn it over to Jim to review our recent results."

Turning to Slide 7, I'll review our second quarter regional results. In North America, COVID-related demand and operational disruptions resulted in double-digit revenue decline, with solid recovery in June as rest",496,"Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 7, I'll review our second quarter regional results. In North America, COVID-related demand and operational disruptions resulted in double-digit revenue decline, with solid recovery in June as restrictions eased across most states. This year-over-year revenue decline of approximately 13% is comparably better than other regions due to home improvement channels remaining open. Despite lower demand, we delivered EBIT margins of 12.6% in the quarter due to strong cost discipline and reduced marketing investments.  
From an operational standpoint, we continue to experience supply disruptions due to reduced production yield in U.S. factories and component shortages out of Mexico. Overall, we are pleased with the continued strength of our North America business and the region's ability to maintain strong margins in a challenging environment.  
Turning to Slide 8. I'll review our second quarter results for Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Shutdowns across Europe in April and May and significant demand weakness across the region drove our negative second quarter results. However, in June, year-over-year volume growth in all countries, except Russia, driven by strong demand recovery and share gains in key countries, resulted in year-over-year net sales growth and positive EBIT in the month. 
Looking forward, a strong order pipeline extending into Q3, combined with our ongoing improvement efforts, provide us confidence the region will return to profitability in the back half of the year.  
Turning to Slide 9. I'll review our second quarter results for our Latin America region. Demand declined strongly throughout the quarter in Mexico and through May in Brazil, with June showing strong signs of recovery. Organic net sales declined approximately 4% as share gains across the region and strong direct-to-consumer sales partially offset demand declines. The region delivered positive EBIT margin as strong cost takeout mitigated COVID-related disruptions and continued currency devaluation.  
Finally, as a reminder, our second quarter 2019 results include the impact of the Embraco compressor business in Latin America's results. This will be the final quarter in which comparison periods will contain Embraco results.  
Turning to Slide 10. I'll review our second quarter results for the Asia region. While net sales were significantly impacted by the India shutdowns in April and May, demand rebounded across Asia in June. EBIT declined as cost takeout was offset by significant COVID-related demand challenges.  
In China, the macroeconomic environment has become increasingly stable, though a level of uncertainty remains as we move through the second half of the year. Operationally, we are pleased to have delivered Whirlpool-branded share growth in the quarter.
In India, results strongly improved sequentially within the quarter as economic restrictions eased. Overall, we are pleased with our ongoing EBIT margin results of 5.2% given the approximately 300 basis point impact from COVID-19. These results in our operational strategy and demonstrate the resiliency of our global business.  
Turning to Slide 12. Marc and I will discuss our updated perspective on 2020. I will now turn it over to Marc to begin."

As expected, the second quarter was the most difficult one in terms of the impact of a pandemic on our business. While we are encouraged by the demand trends seen in June and extending into Q3, we are very mindful of the significant uncertainties which remain for the rest of the year. Because of this, we are not reinstating full year guidance, but again, want to provide our current perspective based on the information available at this time.  
In line with our discussions during the last earnings call, I want to give you an update on the 3 fundamental questions for our business in 2020. 
One, what's the shape of recovery? Based on our current sell-through trends in key countries, we continue to expect a U-shaped recovery throughout 2020. However, there is a risk for W-shaped demand curve, in particular, as we look into Q4. Overall, we anticipate a full year organic net sales decline of 7% to 12%, an improvement from our previous full year perspective of 10% to 15% due to a stronger-than-expected second quarter net sales.  
Second, can we sustain our operating margins? Here, I would highlight the clear structural improvement in our margin profile compared to our business results during the [ 2008 ] financial crisis and by that provides us confidence in our ability to sustain healthy operating margins going forward. Additionally, we can confirm we are firmly on track to deliver cost savings of $500 million or more in 2020. 
Third, what's our liquidity position? Finally, Jim will discuss our strong cash position, supported by a clear focus on disciplined working capital management and our enhanced liquidity position, which enables us to withstand the current economic uncertainty we face across the globe.  
Turning to Slide 13. I'll highlight the updated data that continues to support our perspective of the U-shaped recovery throughout 2020. However, please note that we do not intend to share this data beyond this quarter, but we felt, given the uncertainty of the current situation, that this data will provide valuable proof points as we all assess the impact of COVID-19.  
As we continue to monitor the development of COVID-19 cases and its related impact on appliance demand across key countries, we continue to see similar U-shaped demand patterns emerge on days -- on different time lines.  
In China, COVID-19 cases have significantly reduced even as the broad economy reopens, leading to a pickup in demand mode with a notable shift from off-line to online.  
In Italy and the U.K., we are seeing clear signs of recovery in June as COVID-19 cases reduce and the economies begin to reopen. We believe this is pent-up demand from the previous lockdowns, and it remains to be seen if it's yet a structural recovery.  
In the U.S., we have not seen the level of demand declines as we have experienced in other countries. This is the result of key retailers remaining open throughout the pandemic and the impact of government cash transfers to consumers.  
Based on the consistent demand trends we are seeing across many of our key countries, each at different phases of a crisis, we continue to expect the U-shape to recover, resulting in a full year 2020 organic net sales decline of 7% to 12%.  
Turning to Slide 14. I'll discuss our structurally improved margin position. During our last earnings call, we highlighted our margin profile during the last financial crisis. In 2008, we saw EBIT margins dropped sharply to around 3.5% before bottoming out at a negative 1%. Contrast this with our second quarter results in which we delivered ongoing EBIT margins above 5% in what is the trough period of a current COVID-related crisis. These results provide a meaningful proof point indicating that we can sustain healthy margins throughout this crisis and demonstrate the effectiveness of a strong and decisive actions we have taken.  
Turning to Slide 15. I'll discuss the actions put in place to sustain our margins over the near-term in more detail. Overall, we're well on track towards delivering cost takeout of $500 million or more as part of our COVID-19 response plan. Year-to-date, we have delivered cost takeout of approximately $180 million with actions in place to realize the remainder of the savings in the second half of the year.  
First, we continue to focus on ensuring we capitalize on the deflationary raw material market. Second, we continue to significantly reduce both structural and discretionary spending. During the quarter, we took the initial steps to implement a large majority of the actions we outlined on our Q1 call. As of today, these actions are 80% completed. And as a result, we expect to see cost savings resulting from these measures accelerate throughout the second half of the year. Third, we have maintained our strict focus on working capital management, ensuring we have the proper risk mitigation plans in place and are appropriately managing our inventory levels across the globe. Finally, we recently announced a workforce reduction plan in the U.S. as part of our continued cost-reduction efforts.  
Inclusive of our U.S. actions, Naples' restructuring charges and anticipated additional actions, we now expect total restructuring charges of $260 million to $280 million for 2020, above our original guidance of $100 million.  
Moving to Slide 16. I'll now turn it over to Jim to highlight our overall financial position and ability to navigate and ultimately lead out of this crisis."

First, we have a very strong liquidity pos",296,"Thanks, Marc. As a result of continued efforts to support our overall liquidity needs, our financial position remains strong, with ample liquidity and flexibility to withstand the current economic uncertainty.  
First, we have a very strong liquidity position as evidenced by our current cash position of $2.5 billion with approximately $2.5 billion available in remaining committed credit facilities. Within the quarter, we executed a $500 million 364-day revolving credit facility and issued a $500 million 30-year bond, adding $1 billion of additional liquidity.  
Subsequently, we used the proceeds from the bond and new credit facility to pay down $1 billion of short-term borrowings under our long-term committed credit facility, maintaining our leverage position compared to the first quarter.  
Second, we continue to maintain ample buffer to withstand increased debt or a reduction in earnings without negatively impacting our covenants. From a covenant perspective, our debt-to-capitalization limit is 0.65, and we are currently at approximately  0.5 while our interest coverage ratio requires a minimum of 3x, and we are currently above 10x.  
Third, I'd like to remind everyone that we have no additional bond maturities until the second quarter of 2021, which is only approximately $300 million. It is through our strong financial position and our continued actions that we strive to maintain our strong investment-grade credit rating.  
Lastly, I'd like to mention that our revised capital allocation plan remains unchanged at this time. Until our future liquidity needs become clear, our temporary suspension of share repurchases will remain in effect. Overall, we are confident that we have the liquidity needed to support our operations during this crisis and remain focused on progressing towards our long-term gross debt-to-EBITDA goal of 2x.

I wouldn't call that structural.  
And of the remaining, $350 million, there is about $100 million, which are nonstructural, like furloughs or travel expense reduction. But there's $250 million structural actions, which we largely implemented in the second quarter. That's what the 80% refers to, which, of course, will have an impact -- had some impact already in Q2, but the large impact is in the second half. 
There will be by definition just that for the fact of a calendar year. Yes, there's a carryover impact of the structural actions into '21. And but keep in mind that also next year, we're running a comparison of a nonstructural action, so you mitigate some of that. So yes, there is a carryover impact of the structural actions, which probably in the ballpark of $50 million to $100 million carried over into '21."

So North America and as we also highlighted in our remarks, we saw, in particular -- first of all, throughout the entire quarter, the demand impact was less pronounced than any other market around the world. And that's just the result of key channels remaining open, and frankly, also with consumers benefiting from a government stimulus program with having cash available, so a combination of relatively solid demand and stores remaining open that took probably less of a severe impact in the second quarter than other markets.  
With that in mind, even though we kept our factors running through the entire second quarter, the COVID impact on the supply chain is relevant. It comes back to social distancing in the factories, how you prepare factories for it. You have -- you could have had temporary shutdown of factory because of flare-ups. And we also had component challenges coming out of Mexico.  
With that in mind, and particularly over the last 6 weeks of a quarter, we were supply-constrained. And that led to a market share loss over the last 6 weeks in North America.

So Curt, I believe what you're talking about is the incremental restructuring cost that we added on. And obviously, this is significantly related to the downturn in volume that we had, which is a onetime type of event in terms of a pandemic and the need to reduce our cost structure at a higher level than we had originally anticipated.  
I mean, if you want to think about that, it kind of happens pretty ratably across the globe as you look at it, because this is the portion. The initial $100 million was the restructuring we were doing mainly within EMEA around the closure of the Naples factory and a few other things. These incremental actions are being implemented across the globe, almost in an equal amount about where our revenues are.  
Most of these are -- the majority of these are people costs, and that's just the reduction that you see. We did a couple of different things here. One, we ran a discretionary early retirement program within the U.S.; then, additionally, we had some involuntary layoffs that we also did throughout the process. So using both of those tools, those are what add up to most of those costs there. And as I said, you just got to think about it. It's pretty even across the globe because we've taken actions everywhere to bring our business in line with the volume that we see for this year and the potential risks we see going forward."

What you fundamentally need to understand, when you make a factory COVID-safe or as safe as you can because of social distancing, because of [ covering ] the factories because you physically have to extend the line spacing on an assembly line, et cetera. Because of risks, which you have with flaring up of case in certain locations, and frankly, also higher absenteeism, which we are experiencing right now, you can never -- even if you run the factory, you can't run it at 100% capacity. That's the simple reality of COVID.  
In addition, the Mexican components, which are delivered into our U.S. factory, we had some challenges because we're -- the Mexico situation is in -- far even more complicated because of the decision about if a factory can operate or not is delegated to the states of Mexico and delegated to individual health inspectors.

The important thing is, and that probably partially answers your question is, that negative was in particular in April and May and got a lot better in June or late May, late June.  
And what you see in there is the heavy down mix from a product mix was, in particular, the beginning of a COVID. And then we saw a very significant amount of low-end refrigerators, microwaves, et cetera. And that mix gradually is getting better as long as the pandemic remains. Now people rediscover the ovens, the cookers. I mean they just spend time in the kitchen, and there's cash available with consumers. So that ultimately now starts driving better mix.

We feel very good about where our working capital levels are from a cash flow perspective. Obviously, our inventories have come down as we've sold a lot of product out of our inventories, but our receivables are a little bit lower. And our payables are significantly lower because of the lower production volumes.  
So we do expect the same seasonality of cash that we see in a normal year. And as sales pick up throughout the fourth quarter, we do expect to collect more cash.  
So -- and the other thing I'd probably add in within there is you'll also see in the back half of the year more of the benefit of some of the capital projects we've been delaying. As you look out throughout the year, we won't have as much outflow due to capital expenditures in the back half."

And the reason why I'm saying this one is working capital, in particular, the inventory, which, as you know, impact cash flow, are very unusual. We have the highest amount of inventory reduction ever in the second quarter.  
And when you rebuild inventory, you basically negatively impact your working capital, and that has a certain cash range. So there's a little bit of rebalancing around the inventories. I do expect this to be completed before year-end, so we should more or less get back to a normal situation. But we absolutely do expect a positive cash flow, and we're firmly on track on this one."

Now we all know 2.5 quarters don't make a trend yet. But it was, of course, frustrating just when we kind of had the quarter trending in the right way that COVID hit. 
COVID hit Europe in a very hard way, similar to what we've seen in India or other markets and a lot stronger than in North America and Brazil, because essentially, you had entire countries and retailer shutdown. So the April, May was devastating, frankly, from a bottom line, because you had very limited revenues and you had the fixed cost despite what you did on cost.

In",310,"So David, of course, we can spend a lot of time talking about the builder business. It is a peculiar channel as you were well-known, and I'm talking about both the national builders and the smaller builders, which go for the home improvement channel. 
In particular, in the national builders, these are typically multiyear contracts, which are either exclusive with us or they kind of focus on maximum 2 suppliers. So these are long-running contracts, which, technically, on the kind of purely gross margin, are a little bit lower, but because the cost to serve are a little bit lower, they are a good channels for us and a profitable channel for us. And they bring a certain continuity and a very good effect. 
Now on the builders, as you know, there was a little bit, I would say, slowdown, as not surprisingly, in February, March, April, but I think the momentum which we've seen on the builder side coming out of May and June and now for rest of the year was very strong. And so when I refer to cautiously optimistic about the rest of our business on builders, I'm optimistic, because the combination of low mortgage rates still in undersupplied markets and the broader nesting trend, which we see across consumers, I think spells good news for the builder channel, which -- in which we are very well-positioned. 
As you model the impact of this one, keep always in mind we're at the very tail end of a value chain of a builder. What I mean with that, the appliances are the last thing, typically, which goes into the house. So between a housing start and us seeing the revenues of the appliance, there is typically 6 to 9 months. And but anyhow, so that's -- I would call it, that's very good news down the road."

But the North American supply chain issues, can you talk about how much that might have related to it? I don't want to say sales shortfall, but considering your volumes were down, it sounds like you might have had more, if not for the supply chain issue. 
Your margins were up. And your North America business, you guys obviously believe it's very solid. I think your pricing discipline within a fair competitive environment is affirmed generally and certainly by this quarter. 
So can you talk about the sale shortfall, how the margins were so good? And the conviction you're having around July and August in terms of backlog like -- was it like a 5% shortfall on these supply chain issues? And why is that not necessarily impacting margins? Is pricing actually good if the industry is in kind of short supply? I'm just trying to put these -- the shortfall in context."

Now specifically to your question about the supply constraints. Keep in mind that impacted particularly the back half of the quarter. So you had demand declines, which is just across the board in April, May. And then in June, when the demand was starting to recover, we were faced with some supply constraints. 
So I would say of entire North America revenue drop, which you saw was around 12% or 13%, a few percentage points were related to supply but certainly less than half. There is an industry demand, which was just slowed down in April, May. But with June, one was hampered. So yes, we could have had seen even ""better revenue"" without these constraints. 
On the margin side, and again, that's testimony to a very strong execution. It is the combination of decisive and strong cost measures taken throughout the quarter, not only on the cost which we talked about, but also on rev gen and travel expenses, all the things where we're very strong discipline on how we manage the cost. And then as saw the supply constraints, a good response in terms of the promotional strategy, which we basically had to turn, put that all together, that's led to these very strong margins. 
And I think, in the past, there's -- not necessarily by you, but a lot of people always ask, so, yes, we see now the peak margins, but what are the trough margins? If you have a North America business with trough margin of 12.6%, I think it answers a lot of questions."

I think to put it in context, the easiest way to think about it, look at our inventory numbers and the trends in our inventory numbers, and typically, in Q1 and Q2, we build inventory as we head into our prime season. But as we had supply constraints, we were actually reducing our inventory levels by about $400 million in the second quarter. And on a year-over-year basis, it's about a $500 million difference.

Now turning to Slide 4, we discuss our second quarter 2020 highlights. We delivered resilient results globally with ongoing earnings per diluted share of $2.15 and an ongoing EBIT margin of 5.2%, despite significant and continued COVID-19-related challenges.  
In North America, we delivered a very strong performance of 12.6% EBIT margins, an expansion of 20 basis points and a clear indication of a region's strength and agility. Across the globe, we took decisive and meaningful actions, driving strong levels of cost takeout. 
Lastly, we delivered year-over-year free cash flow improvement of $124 million due to strong working capital management particularly in accounts receivables and inventory.  
Turning to Slide 5, we show the drivers of our second quarter EBIT margin. Price/mix negatively impacted margin by 75 basis points as unfavorable product mix shifts due to COVID-19-related consumer purchases were partially offset by effective promotional management in North America. Our cost takeout actions delivered approximately 150 basis points of margin expansion partially offsetting a 300 basis point headwind from lower fixed cost absorption driven by COVID-19 production disruptions and inventory reduction. Additionally, continued favorable raw material trends positively benefited margins by approximately 100 basis points. 
Lastly, strong cost discipline related to marketing and technology investments partially offset the unfavorable impact of currency primarily in our Latin America region. Overall, we are very pleased to deliver solid operating margins in what was undoubtedly the most difficult quarter of a global pandemic. This impressively demonstrates the strong execution of our global teams and resiliency of our business model.  
And now I'll turn it over to Jim to review our recent results."

Turning to Slide 7, I'll review our second quarter regional results. In North America, COVID-related demand and operational disruptions resulted in double-digit revenue decline, with solid recovery in June as restrictions eased across most states. This year-over-year revenue decline of approximately 13% is comparably better than other regions due to home improvement channels remaining open. Despite lower demand, we delivered EBIT margins of 12.6% in the quarter due to strong cost discipline and reduced marketing investments.  
From an operational standpoint, we continue to experience supply disruptions due to reduced production yield in U.S. factories and component shortages out of Mexico. Overall, we are pleased with the continued strength of our North America business and the region's ability to maintain strong margins in a challenging environment.  
Turning to Slide 8. I'll review our second quarter results for Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Shutdowns across Europe in April and May and significant demand weakness across the region drove our negative second quarter results. However, in June, year-over-year volume growth in all countries, except Russia, driven by strong demand recovery and share gains in key countries, resulted in year-over-year net sales growth and positive EBIT in the month. 
Looking forward, a strong order pipeline extending into Q3, combined with our ongoing improvement efforts, provide us confidence the region will return to profitability in the back half of the year.  
Turning to Slide 9. I'll review our second quarter results for our Latin America region. Demand declined strongly throughout the quarter in Mexico and through May in Brazil, with June showing strong signs of recovery. Organic net sales declined approximately 4% as share gains across the region and strong direct-to-consumer sales partially offset demand declines. The region delivered positive EBIT margin as strong cost takeout mitigated COVID-related disruptions and continued currency devaluation.  
Finally, as a reminder, our second quarter 2019 results include the impact of the Embraco compressor business in Latin America's results. This will be the final quarter in which comparison periods will contain Embraco results.  
Turning to Slide 10. I'll review our second quarter results for the Asia region. While net sales were significantly impacted by the India shutdowns in April and May, demand rebounded across Asia in June. EBIT declined as cost takeout was offset by significant COVID-related demand challenges.  
In China, the macroeconomic environment has become increasingly stable, though a level of uncertainty remains as we move through the second half of the year. Operationally, we are pleased to have delivered Whirlpool-branded share growth in the quarter.
In India, results strongly improved sequentially within the quarter as economic restrictions eased. Overall, we are pleased with our ongoing EBIT margin results of 5.2% given the approximately 300 basis point impact from COVID-19. These results in our operational strategy and demonstrate the resiliency of our global business.  
Turning to Slide 12. Marc and I will discuss our updated perspective on 2020. I will now turn it over to Marc to begin."

As expected, the second quarter was the most difficult one in terms of the impact of a pandemic on our business. While we are encouraged by the demand trends seen in June and extending into Q3, we are very mindful of the significant uncertainties which remain for the rest of the year. Because of this, we are not reinstating full year guidance, but again, want to provide our current perspective based on the information available at this time.  
In line with our discussions during the last earnings call, I want to give you an update on the 3 fundamental questions for our business in 2020. 
One, what's the shape of recovery? Based on our current sell-through trends in key countries, we continue to expect a U-shaped recovery throughout 2020. However, there is a risk for W-shaped demand curve, in particular, as we look into Q4. Overall, we anticipate a full year organic net sales decline of 7% to 12%, an improvement from our previous full year perspective of 10% to 15% due to a stronger-than-expected second quarter net sales.  
Second, can we sustain our operating margins? Here, I would highlight the clear structural improvement in our margin profile compared to our business results during the [ 2008 ] financial crisis and by that provides us confidence in our ability to sustain healthy operating margins going forward. Additionally, we can confirm we are firmly on track to deliver cost savings of $500 million or more in 2020. 
Third, what's our liquidity position? Finally, Jim will discuss our strong cash position, supported by a clear focus on disciplined working capital management and our enhanced liquidity position, which enables us to withstand the current economic uncertainty we face across the globe.  
Turning to Slide 13. I'll highlight the updated data that continues to support our perspective of the U-shaped recovery throughout 2020. However, please note that we do not intend to share this data beyond this quarter, but we felt, given the uncertainty of the current situation, that this data will provide valuable proof points as we all assess the impact of COVID-19.  
As we continue to monitor the development of COVID-19 cases and its related impact on appliance demand across key countries, we continue to see similar U-shaped demand patterns emerge on days -- on different time lines.  
In China, COVID-19 cases have significantly reduced even as the broad economy reopens, leading to a pickup in demand mode with a notable shift from off-line to online.  
In Italy and the U.K., we are seeing clear signs of recovery in June as COVID-19 cases reduce and the economies begin to reopen. We believe this is pent-up demand from the previous lockdowns, and it remains to be seen if it's yet a structural recovery.  
In the U.S., we have not seen the level of demand declines as we have experienced in other countries. This is the result of key retailers remaining open throughout the pandemic and the impact of government cash transfers to consumers.  
Based on the consistent demand trends we are seeing across many of our key countries, each at different phases of a crisis, we continue to expect the U-shape to recover, resulting in a full year 2020 organic net sales decline of 7% to 12%.  
Turning to Slide 14. I'll discuss our structurally improved margin position. During our last earnings call, we highlighted our margin profile during the last financial crisis. In 2008, we saw EBIT margins dropped sharply to around 3.5% before bottoming out at a negative 1%. Contrast this with our second quarter results in which we delivered ongoing EBIT margins above 5% in what is the trough period of a current COVID-related crisis. These results provide a meaningful proof point indicating that we can sustain healthy margins throughout this crisis and demonstrate the effectiveness of a strong and decisive actions we have taken.  
Turning to Slide 15. I'll discuss the actions put in place to sustain our margins over the near-term in more detail. Overall, we're well on track towards delivering cost takeout of $500 million or more as part of our COVID-19 response plan. Year-to-date, we have delivered cost takeout of approximately $180 million with actions in place to realize the remainder of the savings in the second half of the year.  
First, we continue to focus on ensuring we capitalize on the deflationary raw material market. Second, we continue to significantly reduce both structural and discretionary spending. During the quarter, we took the initial steps to implement a large majority of the actions we outlined on our Q1 call. As of today, these actions are 80% completed. And as a result, we expect to see cost savings resulting from these measures accelerate throughout the second half of the year. Third, we have maintained our strict focus on working capital management, ensuring we have the proper risk mitigation plans in place and are appropriately managing our inventory levels across the globe. Finally, we recently announced a workforce reduction plan in the U.S. as part of our continued cost-reduction efforts.  
Inclusive of our U.S. actions, Naples' restructuring charges and anticipated additional actions, we now expect total restructuring charges of $260 million to $280 million for 2020, above our original guidance of $100 million.  
Moving to Slide 16. I'll now turn it over to Jim to highlight our overall financial position and ability to navigate and ultimately lead out of this crisis."

First, we have a very strong liquidity pos",296,"Thanks, Marc. As a result of continued efforts to support our overall liquidity needs, our financial position remains strong, with ample liquidity and flexibility to withstand the current economic uncertainty.  
First, we have a very strong liquidity position as evidenced by our current cash position of $2.5 billion with approximately $2.5 billion available in remaining committed credit facilities. Within the quarter, we executed a $500 million 364-day revolving credit facility and issued a $500 million 30-year bond, adding $1 billion of additional liquidity.  
Subsequently, we used the proceeds from the bond and new credit facility to pay down $1 billion of short-term borrowings under our long-term committed credit facility, maintaining our leverage position compared to the first quarter.  
Second, we continue to maintain ample buffer to withstand increased debt or a reduction in earnings without negatively impacting our covenants. From a covenant perspective, our debt-to-capitalization limit is 0.65, and we are currently at approximately  0.5 while our interest coverage ratio requires a minimum of 3x, and we are currently above 10x.  
Third, I'd like to remind everyone that we have no additional bond maturities until the second quarter of 2021, which is only approximately $300 million. It is through our strong financial position and our continued actions that we strive to maintain our strong investment-grade credit rating.  
Lastly, I'd like to mention that our revised capital allocation plan remains unchanged at this time. Until our future liquidity needs become clear, our temporary suspension of share repurchases will remain in effect. Overall, we are confident that we have the liquidity needed to support our operations during this crisis and remain focused on progressing towards our long-term gross debt-to-EBITDA goal of 2x.  
Now on Slide 17. I'll turn it back over to Marc to summarize our key messages."

Additionally, we continue to maintain a very strong liquidity position and remain firmly committed to driving our business towards our leverage goal of 2x over the long term.  
As we continue to invest in our operational priorities and digital transformation journey, we are positioning ourselves to win in the eventual economic recovery.

I wouldn't call that structural.  
And of the remaining, $350 million, there is about $100 million, which are nonstructural, like furloughs or travel expense reduction. But there's $250 million structural actions, which we largely implemented in the second quarter. That's what the 80% refers to, which, of course, will have an impact -- had some impact already in Q2, but the large impact is in the second half. 
There will be by definition just that for the fact of a calendar year. Yes, there's a carryover impact of the structural actions into '21. And but keep in mind that also next year, we're running a comparison of a nonstructural action, so you mitigate some of that. So yes, there is a carryover impact of the structural actions, which probably in the ballpark of $50 million to $100 million carried over into '21."

So North America and as we also highlighted in our remarks, we saw, in particular -- first of all, throughout the entire quarter, the demand impact was less pronounced than any other market around the world. And that's just the result of key channels remaining open, and frankly, also with consumers benefiting from a government stimulus program with having cash available, so a combination of relatively solid demand and stores remaining open that took probably less of a severe impact in the second quarter than other markets.  
With that in mind, even though we kept our factors running through the entire second quarter, the COVID impact on the supply chain is relevant. It comes back to social distancing in the factories, how you prepare factories for it. You have -- you could have had temporary shutdown of factory because of flare-ups. And we also had component challenges coming out of Mexico.  
With that in mind, and particularly over the last 6 weeks of a quarter, we were supply-constrained. And that led to a market share loss over the last 6 weeks in North America. We are in our way of working through that and out of it. But I also want to be mindful of as long as COVID is around, there is a certain risk to the supply chain. We work on existing challenges, and we're confident we will get them behind us. But the risk remain throughout the rest of the year as long as COVID is around us."

So Curt, I believe what you're talking about is the incremental restructuring cost that we added on. And obviously, this is significantly related to the downturn in volume that we had, which is a onetime type of event in terms of a pandemic and the need to reduce our cost structure at a higher level than we had originally anticipated.  
I mean, if you want to think about that, it kind of happens pretty ratably across the globe as you look at it, because this is the portion. The initial $100 million was the restructuring we were doing mainly within EMEA around the closure of the Naples factory and a few other things. These incremental actions are being implemented across the globe, almost in an equal amount about where our revenues are.  
Most of these are -- the majority of these are people costs, and that's just the reduction that you see. We did a couple of different things here. One, we ran a discretionary early retirement program within the U.S.; then, additionally, we had some involuntary layoffs that we also did throughout the process. So using both of those tools, those are what add up to most of those costs there. And as I said, you just got to think about it. It's pretty even across the globe because we've taken actions everywhere to bring our business in line with the volume that we see for this year and the potential risks we see going forward."

What you fundamentally need to understand, when you make a factory COVID-safe or as safe as you can because of social distancing, because of [ covering ] the factories because you physically have to extend the line spacing on an assembly line, et cetera. Because of risks, which you have with flaring up of case in certain locations, and frankly, also higher absenteeism, which we are experiencing right now, you can never -- even if you run the factory, you can't run it at 100% capacity. That's the simple reality of COVID.  
In addition, the Mexican components, which are delivered into our U.S. factory, we had some challenges because we're -- the Mexico situation is in -- far even more complicated because of the decision about if a factory can operate or not is delegated to the states of Mexico and delegated to individual health inspectors.

The important thing is, and that probably partially answers your question is, that negative was in particular in April and May and got a lot better in June or late May, late June.  
And what you see in there is the heavy down mix from a product mix was, in particular, the beginning of a COVID. And then we saw a very significant amount of low-end refrigerators, microwaves, et cetera. And that mix gradually is getting better as long as the pandemic remains. Now people rediscover the ovens, the cookers. I mean they just spend time in the kitchen, and there's cash available with consumers. So that ultimately now starts driving better mix.

And if you even look at where we are in terms of our cash usage right now compared to prior years and compared to last year, we're 100 -- almost $100 million better than we were last year at this point in time. We feel very good about where our working capital levels are from a cash flow perspective. Obviously, our inventories have come down as we've sold a lot of product out of our inventories, but our receivables are a little bit lower. And our payables are significantly lower because of the lower production volumes.  
So we do expect the same seasonality of cash that we see in a normal year. And as sales pick up throughout the fourth quarter, we do expect to collect more cash.  
So -- and the other thing I'd probably add in within there is you'll also see in the back half of the year more of the benefit of some of the capital projects we've been delaying. As you look out throughout the year, we won't have as much outflow due to capital expenditures in the back half."

And the reason why I'm saying this one is working capital, in particular, the inventory, which, as you know, impact cash flow, are very unusual. We have the highest amount of inventory reduction ever in the second quarter.  
And when you rebuild inventory, you basically negatively impact your working capital, and that has a certain cash range. So there's a little bit of rebalancing around the inventories. I do expect this to be completed before year-end, so we should more or less get back to a normal situation. But we absolutely do expect a positive cash flow, and we're firmly on track on this one."

And the thought that once you could get out of Turkey and get the fixed cost reductions and regain some of the volume, that sort of the first stop on the journey to that longer-term goal was kind of 3% to 4% margins. 
So I guess, I'd love to get your thoughts in terms of -- based on kind of now getting back reestablished with some of the key retailers and getting your balance to trade back up, getting your mix moving in the right direction.

So David, on [ European ], particularly if you referred to a year ago, as you recall, the last year Q3 and Q4, we find it over European numbers starting to come around. And we were also encouraged by what we saw certainly before COVID until pretty much February. 
Now we all know 2.5 quarters don't make a trend yet. But it was, of course, frustrating just when we kind of had the quarter trending in the right way that COVID hit. 
COVID hit Europe in a very hard way, similar to what we've seen in India or other markets and a lot stronger than in North America and Brazil, because essentially, you had entire countries and retailer shutdown. So the April, May was devastating, frankly, from a bottom line, because you had very limited revenues and you had the fixed cost despite what you did on cost. So April, May was way worse than you see our entire quarterly results. 
June was solid. And in terms of being very -- I mean, profitable, not just above breakeven, really profitable, a solid demand. And July and August also look good. And frankly, that's why Jim said earlier, we will make a profit in Q3 and subsequently also Q4. 
To your question about when do we see the 3% or 4%? We haven't yet given guidance for '21. '21 will be a milestone towards these numbers, but maybe not yet fully to these numbers. But we -- in a certain way, it also is a factor in '21. In the year-over-year comparison, we mentally need to take off the COVID impact out.

In",310,"So David, of course, we can spend a lot of time talking about the builder business. It is a peculiar channel as you were well-known, and I'm talking about both the national builders and the smaller builders, which go for the home improvement channel. 
In particular, in the national builders, these are typically multiyear contracts, which are either exclusive with us or they kind of focus on maximum 2 suppliers. So these are long-running contracts, which, technically, on the kind of purely gross margin, are a little bit lower, but because the cost to serve are a little bit lower, they are a good channels for us and a profitable channel for us. And they bring a certain continuity and a very good effect. 
Now on the builders, as you know, there was a little bit, I would say, slowdown, as not surprisingly, in February, March, April, but I think the momentum which we've seen on the builder side coming out of May and June and now for rest of the year was very strong. And so when I refer to cautiously optimistic about the rest of our business on builders, I'm optimistic, because the combination of low mortgage rates still in undersupplied markets and the broader nesting trend, which we see across consumers, I think spells good news for the builder channel, which -- in which we are very well-positioned. 
As you model the impact of this one, keep always in mind we're at the very tail end of a value chain of a builder. What I mean with that, the appliances are the last thing, typically, which goes into the house. So between a housing start and us seeing the revenues of the appliance, there is typically 6 to 9 months. And but anyhow, so that's -- I would call it, that's very good news down the road."

Now specifically to your question about the supply constraints. Keep in mind that impacted particularly the back half of the quarter. So you had demand declines, which is just across the board in April, May. And then in June, when the demand was starting to recover, we were faced with some supply constraints. 
So I would say of entire North America revenue drop, which you saw was around 12% or 13%, a few percentage points were related to supply but certainly less than half. There is an industry demand, which was just slowed down in April, May. But with June, one was hampered. So yes, we could have had seen even ""better revenue"" without these constraints. 
On the margin side, and again, that's testimony to a very strong execution. It is the combination of decisive and strong cost measures taken throughout the quarter, not only on the cost which we talked about, but also on rev gen and travel expenses, all the things where we're very strong discipline on how we manage the cost. And then as saw the supply constraints, a good response in terms of the promotional strategy, which we basically had to turn, put that all together, that's led to these very strong margins. 
And I think, in the past, there's -- not necessarily by you, but a lot of people always ask, so, yes, we see now the peak margins, but what are the trough margins? If you have a North America business with trough margin of 12.6%, I think it answers a lot of questions."

And in times when we need to pull some of that back in, because the return is not there, we have the ability to adjust it.

As you look at that 300 basis point impact that we had, a big portion of that is due to the reduced production levels due to safety requirements we had to put in, due to supplier issues, all the things that Marc talked about before. 
I think to put it in context, the easiest way to think about it, look at our inventory numbers and the trends in our inventory numbers, and typically, in Q1 and Q2, we build inventory as we head into our prime season. But as we had supply constraints, we were actually reducing our inventory levels by about $400 million in the second quarter. And on a year-over-year basis, it's about a $500 million difference. So that has -- that's what causes that significant impact. And as you build inventory back to normal, that begins to wash out."

And it's mainly because what Marc talked about earlier. One, with the supply constraints that we had, retailers, their inventory levels actually were going down as their sell-out increased and our sell-in to them was below what they were selling out. 
So if anything, right now, we also talked about that we have a significant number of orders that we're working through to provide to our customers. That's in excess of the normal backlog we might have. So if anything, I do believe sell-out was stronger than sell-in within the quarter.

Now turning to Slide 4, we discuss our second quarter 2020 highlights. We delivered resilient results globally with ongoing earnings per diluted share of $2.15 and an ongoing EBIT margin of 5.2%, despite significant and continued COVID-19-related challenges.  
In North America, we delivered a very strong performance of 12.6% EBIT margins, an expansion of 20 basis points and a clear indication of a region's strength and agility. Across the globe, we took decisive and meaningful actions, driving strong levels of cost takeout. 
Lastly, we delivered year-over-year free cash flow improvement of $124 million due to strong working capital management particularly in accounts receivables and inventory.  
Turning to Slide 5, we show the drivers of our second quarter EBIT margin. Price/mix negatively impacted margin by 75 basis points as unfavorable product mix shifts due to COVID-19-related consumer purchases were partially offset by effective promotional management in North America. Our cost takeout actions delivered approximately 150 basis points of margin expansion partially offsetting a 300 basis point headwind from lower fixed cost absorption driven by COVID-19 production disruptions and inventory reduction. Additionally, continued favorable raw material trends positively benefited margins by approximately 100 basis points. 
Lastly, strong cost discipline related to marketing and technology investments partially offset the unfavorable impact of currency primarily in our Latin America region. Overall, we are very pleased to deliver solid operating margins in what was undoubtedly the most difficult quarter of a global pandemic. This impressively demonstrates the strong execution of our global teams and resiliency of our business model.  
And now I'll turn it over to Jim to review our recent results."

Turning to Slide 7, I'll review our second quarter regional results. In North America, COVID-related demand and operational disruptions resulted in double-digit revenue decline, with solid recovery in June as rest",496,"Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 7, I'll review our second quarter regional results. In North America, COVID-related demand and operational disruptions resulted in double-digit revenue decline, with solid recovery in June as restrictions eased across most states. This year-over-year revenue decline of approximately 13% is comparably better than other regions due to home improvement channels remaining open. Despite lower demand, we delivered EBIT margins of 12.6% in the quarter due to strong cost discipline and reduced marketing investments.  
From an operational standpoint, we continue to experience supply disruptions due to reduced production yield in U.S. factories and component shortages out of Mexico. Overall, we are pleased with the continued strength of our North America business and the region's ability to maintain strong margins in a challenging environment.  
Turning to Slide 8. I'll review our second quarter results for Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Shutdowns across Europe in April and May and significant demand weakness across the region drove our negative second quarter results. However, in June, year-over-year volume growth in all countries, except Russia, driven by strong demand recovery and share gains in key countries, resulted in year-over-year net sales growth and positive EBIT in the month. 
Looking forward, a strong order pipeline extending into Q3, combined with our ongoing improvement efforts, provide us confidence the region will return to profitability in the back half of the year.  
Turning to Slide 9. I'll review our second quarter results for our Latin America region. Demand declined strongly throughout the quarter in Mexico and through May in Brazil, with June showing strong signs of recovery. Organic net sales declined approximately 4% as share gains across the region and strong direct-to-consumer sales partially offset demand declines. The region delivered positive EBIT margin as strong cost takeout mitigated COVID-related disruptions and continued currency devaluation.  
Finally, as a reminder, our second quarter 2019 results include the impact of the Embraco compressor business in Latin America's results. This will be the final quarter in which comparison periods will contain Embraco results.  
Turning to Slide 10. I'll review our second quarter results for the Asia region. While net sales were significantly impacted by the India shutdowns in April and May, demand rebounded across Asia in June. EBIT declined as cost takeout was offset by significant COVID-related demand challenges.  
In China, the macroeconomic environment has become increasingly stable, though a level of uncertainty remains as we move through the second half of the year. Operationally, we are pleased to have delivered Whirlpool-branded share growth in the quarter.
In India, results strongly improved sequentially within the quarter as economic restrictions eased. Overall, we are pleased with our ongoing EBIT margin results of 5.2% given the approximately 300 basis point impact from COVID-19. These results in our operational strategy and demonstrate the resiliency of our global business.  
Turning to Slide 12. Marc and I will discuss our updated perspective on 2020. I will now turn it over to Marc to begin."

As expected, the second quarter was the most difficult one in terms of the impact of a pandemic on our business. While we are encouraged by the demand trends seen in June and extending into Q3, we are very mindful of the significant uncertainties which remain for the rest of the year. Because of this, we are not reinstating full year guidance, but again, want to provide our current perspective based on the information available at this time.  
In line with our discussions during the last earnings call, I want to give you an update on the 3 fundamental questions for our business in 2020. 
One, what's the shape of recovery? Based on our current sell-through trends in key countries, we continue to expect a U-shaped recovery throughout 2020. However, there is a risk for W-shaped demand curve, in particular, as we look into Q4. Overall, we anticipate a full year organic net sales decline of 7% to 12%, an improvement from our previous full year perspective of 10% to 15% due to a stronger-than-expected second quarter net sales.  
Second, can we sustain our operating margins? Here, I would highlight the clear structural improvement in our margin profile compared to our business results during the [ 2008 ] financial crisis and by that provides us confidence in our ability to sustain healthy operating margins going forward. Additionally, we can confirm we are firmly on track to deliver cost savings of $500 million or more in 2020. 
Third, what's our liquidity position? Finally, Jim will discuss our strong cash position, supported by a clear focus on disciplined working capital management and our enhanced liquidity position, which enables us to withstand the current economic uncertainty we face across the globe.  
Turning to Slide 13. I'll highlight the updated data that continues to support our perspective of the U-shaped recovery throughout 2020. However, please note that we do not intend to share this data beyond this quarter, but we felt, given the uncertainty of the current situation, that this data will provide valuable proof points as we all assess the impact of COVID-19.  
As we continue to monitor the development of COVID-19 cases and its related impact on appliance demand across key countries, we continue to see similar U-shaped demand patterns emerge on days -- on different time lines.  
In China, COVID-19 cases have significantly reduced even as the broad economy reopens, leading to a pickup in demand mode with a notable shift from off-line to online.  
In Italy and the U.K., we are seeing clear signs of recovery in June as COVID-19 cases reduce and the economies begin to reopen. We believe this is pent-up demand from the previous lockdowns, and it remains to be seen if it's yet a structural recovery.  
In the U.S., we have not seen the level of demand declines as we have experienced in other countries. This is the result of key retailers remaining open throughout the pandemic and the impact of government cash transfers to consumers.  
Based on the consistent demand trends we are seeing across many of our key countries, each at different phases of a crisis, we continue to expect the U-shape to recover, resulting in a full year 2020 organic net sales decline of 7% to 12%.  
Turning to Slide 14. I'll discuss our structurally improved margin position. During our last earnings call, we highlighted our margin profile during the last financial crisis. In 2008, we saw EBIT margins dropped sharply to around 3.5% before bottoming out at a negative 1%. Contrast this with our second quarter results in which we delivered ongoing EBIT margins above 5% in what is the trough period of a current COVID-related crisis. These results provide a meaningful proof point indicating that we can sustain healthy margins throughout this crisis and demonstrate the effectiveness of a strong and decisive actions we have taken.  
Turning to Slide 15. I'll discuss the actions put in place to sustain our margins over the near-term in more detail. Overall, we're well on track towards delivering cost takeout of $500 million or more as part of our COVID-19 response plan. Year-to-date, we have delivered cost takeout of approximately $180 million with actions in place to realize the remainder of the savings in the second half of the year.  
First, we continue to focus on ensuring we capitalize on the deflationary raw material market. Second, we continue to significantly reduce both structural and discretionary spending. During the quarter, we took the initial steps to implement a large majority of the actions we outlined on our Q1 call. As of today, these actions are 80% completed. And as a result, we expect to see cost savings resulting from these measures accelerate throughout the second half of the year. Third, we have maintained our strict focus on working capital management, ensuring we have the proper risk mitigation plans in place and are appropriately managing our inventory levels across the globe. Finally, we recently announced a workforce reduction plan in the U.S. as part of our continued cost-reduction efforts.  
Inclusive of our U.S. actions, Naples' restructuring charges and anticipated additional actions, we now expect total restructuring charges of $260 million to $280 million for 2020, above our original guidance of $100 million.  
Moving to Slide 16. I'll now turn it over to Jim to highlight our overall financial position and ability to navigate and ultimately lead out of this crisis."

First, we have a very strong liquidity pos",296,"Thanks, Marc. As a result of continued efforts to support our overall liquidity needs, our financial position remains strong, with ample liquidity and flexibility to withstand the current economic uncertainty.  
First, we have a very strong liquidity position as evidenced by our current cash position of $2.5 billion with approximately $2.5 billion available in remaining committed credit facilities. Within the quarter, we executed a $500 million 364-day revolving credit facility and issued a $500 million 30-year bond, adding $1 billion of additional liquidity.  
Subsequently, we used the proceeds from the bond and new credit facility to pay down $1 billion of short-term borrowings under our long-term committed credit facility, maintaining our leverage position compared to the first quarter.  
Second, we continue to maintain ample buffer to withstand increased debt or a reduction in earnings without negatively impacting our covenants. From a covenant perspective, our debt-to-capitalization limit is 0.65, and we are currently at approximately 0.5 while our interest coverage ratio requires a minimum of 3x, and we are currently above 10x.  
Third, I'd like to remind everyone that we have no additional bond maturities until the second quarter of 2021, which is only approximately $300 million. It is through our strong financial position and our continued actions that we strive to maintain our strong investment-grade credit rating.  
Lastly, I'd like to mention that our revised capital allocation plan remains unchanged at this time. Until our future liquidity needs become clear, our temporary suspension of share repurchases will remain in effect. Overall, we are confident that we have the liquidity needed to support our operations during this crisis and remain focused on progressing towards our long-term gross debt-to-EBITDA goal of 2x.

I wouldn't call that structural.  
And of the remaining, $350 million, there is about $100 million, which are nonstructural, like furloughs or travel expense reduction. But there's $250 million structural actions, which we largely implemented in the second quarter. That's what the 80% refers to, which, of course, will have an impact -- had some impact already in Q2, but the large impact is in the second half. 
There will be by definition just that for the fact of a calendar year. Yes, there's a carryover impact of the structural actions into '21. And but keep in mind that also next year, we're running a comparison of a nonstructural action, so you mitigate some of that. So yes, there is a carryover impact of the structural actions, which probably in the ballpark of $50 million to $100 million carried over into '21."

So North America and as we also highlighted in our remarks, we saw, in particular -- first of all, throughout the entire quarter, the demand impact was less pronounced than any other market around the world. And that's just the result of key channels remaining open, and frankly, also with consumers benefiting from a government stimulus program with having cash available, so a combination of relatively solid demand and stores remaining open that took probably less of a severe impact in the second quarter than other markets.  
With that in mind, even though we kept our factors running through the entire second quarter, the COVID impact on the supply chain is relevant. It comes back to social distancing in the factories, how you prepare factories for it. You have -- you could have had temporary shutdown of factory because of flare-ups. And we also had component challenges coming out of Mexico.  
With that in mind, and particularly over the last 6 weeks of a quarter, we were supply-constrained. And that led to a market share loss over the last 6 weeks in North America.

So Curt, I believe what you're talking about is the incremental restructuring cost that we added on. And obviously, this is significantly related to the downturn in volume that we had, which is a onetime type of event in terms of a pandemic and the need to reduce our cost structure at a higher level than we had originally anticipated.  
I mean, if you want to think about that, it kind of happens pretty ratably across the globe as you look at it, because this is the portion. The initial $100 million was the restructuring we were doing mainly within EMEA around the closure of the Naples factory and a few other things. These incremental actions are being implemented across the globe, almost in an equal amount about where our revenues are.  
Most of these are -- the majority of these are people costs, and that's just the reduction that you see. We did a couple of different things here. One, we ran a discretionary early retirement program within the U.S.; then, additionally, we had some involuntary layoffs that we also did throughout the process. So using both of those tools, those are what add up to most of those costs there. And as I said, you just got to think about it. It's pretty even across the globe because we've taken actions everywhere to bring our business in line with the volume that we see for this year and the potential risks we see going forward."

What you fundamentally need to understand, when you make a factory COVID-safe or as safe as you can because of social distancing, because of [ covering ] the factories because you physically have to extend the line spacing on an assembly line, et cetera. Because of risks, which you have with flaring up of case in certain locations, and frankly, also higher absenteeism, which we are experiencing right now, you can never -- even if you run the factory, you can't run it at 100% capacity. That's the simple reality of COVID.  
In addition, the Mexican components, which are delivered into our U.S. factory, we had some challenges because we're -- the Mexico situation is in -- far even more complicated because of the decision about if a factory can operate or not is delegated to the states of Mexico and delegated to individual health inspectors.

The important thing is, and that probably partially answers your question is, that negative was in particular in April and May and got a lot better in June or late May, late June.  
And what you see in there is the heavy down mix from a product mix was, in particular, the beginning of a COVID. And then we saw a very significant amount of low-end refrigerators, microwaves, et cetera. And that mix gradually is getting better as long as the pandemic remains. Now people rediscover the ovens, the cookers. I mean they just spend time in the kitchen, and there's cash available with consumers. So that ultimately now starts driving better mix.

We feel very good about where our working capital levels are from a cash flow perspective. Obviously, our inventories have come down as we've sold a lot of product out of our inventories, but our receivables are a little bit lower. And our payables are significantly lower because of the lower production volumes.  
So we do expect the same seasonality of cash that we see in a normal year. And as sales pick up throughout the fourth quarter, we do expect to collect more cash.  
So -- and the other thing I'd probably add in within there is you'll also see in the back half of the year more of the benefit of some of the capital projects we've been delaying. As you look out throughout the year, we won't have as much outflow due to capital expenditures in the back half."

And the reason why I'm saying this one is working capital, in particular, the inventory, which, as you know, impact cash flow, are very unusual. We have the highest amount of inventory reduction ever in the second quarter.  
And when you rebuild inventory, you basically negatively impact your working capital, and that has a certain cash range. So there's a little bit of rebalancing around the inventories. I do expect this to be completed before year-end, so we should more or less get back to a normal situation. But we absolutely do expect a positive cash flow, and we're firmly on track on this one."

Now we all know 2.5 quarters don't make a trend yet. But it was, of course, frustrating just when we kind of had the quarter trending in the right way that COVID hit. 
COVID hit Europe in a very hard way, similar to what we've seen in India or other markets and a lot stronger than in North America and Brazil, because essentially, you had entire countries and retailer shutdown. So the April, May was devastating, frankly, from a bottom line, because you had very limited revenues and you had the fixed cost despite what you did on cost.

In",310,"So David, of course, we can spend a lot of time talking about the builder business. It is a peculiar channel as you were well-known, and I'm talking about both the national builders and the smaller builders, which go for the home improvement channel. 
In particular, in the national builders, these are typically multiyear contracts, which are either exclusive with us or they kind of focus on maximum 2 suppliers. So these are long-running contracts, which, technically, on the kind of purely gross margin, are a little bit lower, but because the cost to serve are a little bit lower, they are a good channels for us and a profitable channel for us. And they bring a certain continuity and a very good effect. 
Now on the builders, as you know, there was a little bit, I would say, slowdown, as not surprisingly, in February, March, April, but I think the momentum which we've seen on the builder side coming out of May and June and now for rest of the year was very strong. And so when I refer to cautiously optimistic about the rest of our business on builders, I'm optimistic, because the combination of low mortgage rates still in undersupplied markets and the broader nesting trend, which we see across consumers, I think spells good news for the builder channel, which -- in which we are very well-positioned. 
As you model the impact of this one, keep always in mind we're at the very tail end of a value chain of a builder. What I mean with that, the appliances are the last thing, typically, which goes into the house. So between a housing start and us seeing the revenues of the appliance, there is typically 6 to 9 months. And but anyhow, so that's -- I would call it, that's very good news down the road."

But the North American supply chain issues, can you talk about how much that might have related to it? I don't want to say sales shortfall, but considering your volumes were down, it sounds like you might have had more, if not for the supply chain issue. 
Your margins were up. And your North America business, you guys obviously believe it's very solid. I think your pricing discipline within a fair competitive environment is affirmed generally and certainly by this quarter. 
So can you talk about the sale shortfall, how the margins were so good? And the conviction you're having around July and August in terms of backlog like -- was it like a 5% shortfall on these supply chain issues? And why is that not necessarily impacting margins? Is pricing actually good if the industry is in kind of short supply? I'm just trying to put these -- the shortfall in context."

Now specifically to your question about the supply constraints. Keep in mind that impacted particularly the back half of the quarter. So you had demand declines, which is just across the board in April, May. And then in June, when the demand was starting to recover, we were faced with some supply constraints. 
So I would say of entire North America revenue drop, which you saw was around 12% or 13%, a few percentage points were related to supply but certainly less than half. There is an industry demand, which was just slowed down in April, May. But with June, one was hampered. So yes, we could have had seen even ""better revenue"" without these constraints. 
On the margin side, and again, that's testimony to a very strong execution. It is the combination of decisive and strong cost measures taken throughout the quarter, not only on the cost which we talked about, but also on rev gen and travel expenses, all the things where we're very strong discipline on how we manage the cost. And then as saw the supply constraints, a good response in terms of the promotional strategy, which we basically had to turn, put that all together, that's led to these very strong margins. 
And I think, in the past, there's -- not necessarily by you, but a lot of people always ask, so, yes, we see now the peak margins, but what are the trough margins? If you have a North America business with trough margin of 12.6%, I think it answers a lot of questions."

I think to put it in context, the easiest way to think about it, look at our inventory numbers and the trends in our inventory numbers, and typically, in Q1 and Q2, we build inventory as we head into our prime season. But as we had supply constraints, we were actually reducing our inventory levels by about $400 million in the second quarter. And on a year-over-year basis, it's about a $500 million difference.

We delivered organic net sales growth of 7% driven by industry demand improvement across the globe. While pent-up demand and low inventory levels with our trade customers partially drove demand within the quarter, increasingly, we are seeing the benefit from home nesting and a recovering housing market. Additionally, the flawless execution of our early and decisive COVID-19 response actions to protect our business and ensure our continued ability to meet the needs of our customers resulted in ongoing EPS of $6.91, a $2.94 improvement year-over-year; ongoing EBIT margin of 12%, a year-over-year improvement of 480 basis points; significant margin expansion in our North America, Latin America and EMEA region; and a positive year-to-date free cash flow of $170 million, a $1 billion improvement driven by strong net earnings and disciplined working capital management. 
Due to these strong results, the confidence we have in our business and reasonable year-end visibility, we are reinstating our full year 2020 guidance. We now expect to deliver net sales decline of 5% to 7% and organic net sales decline of 1 to flat, an improvement from our previous full year perspective; ongoing EPS of $17.50 to $18, above our original guidance of $16 to $17; and finally, free cash flow of approximately $900 million at the high end of our original guidance range. 
Additionally, as a reflection of our strong liquidity position, we announce an increase in our quarterly dividend, resulting in the eighth consecutive year of dividend increases. Further, we intend to repay all COVID-19 related short-term borrowings by year-end as we continue to progress towards our long-term leverage target of 2x. 
Turning to Slide 5, we show the drivers of third quarter margin. Price/mix positively impacted margins by 275 basis points, primarily driven by reduced promotional investments given our supply chain constraints. Also, sequentially, we continue to see improving mix trends as consumers slowly shift from the rest and prices purchases to upgrading and investing in their homes. 
Our cost takeout actions delivered approximately 200 basis points of margin expansion as a result of structural actions we took in the second and third quarter, as well as ongoing cost productivity initiatives. Additionally, favorable raw material trends positively benefited margin by approximately 150 basis points. Lastly, the impact of continued investments in marketing and technology initiatives, along with unfavorable currency negatively impacted margins by approximately 150 basis points. 
Overall, we believe our third quarter results highlight the strength and resiliency of our underlying business and the effectiveness of our COVID-19 response plan. 
Now I'll turn it over to Jim to review our regional results."

Turning to Slide 7, I'll review our third quarter regional results. In North America, continued COVID related supply constraints resulted in a revenue decline of 2%. Looking forward, we remain confident in the strong demand for our products as our order backlog remains very high. We delivered record EBIT and EBIT margin driven by flawless execution of our cost takeout and go-to-market actions, including the reduction of marketing investments. 
From an operational standpoint, we continue to experience COVID related disruptions in our supply base, at our factories and in our logistics network. However, we are seeing gradual sequential improvements in line with our expectations. Overall, the region's outstanding results demonstrate the fundamental strength of our North America business, delivering record margins despite ongoing COVID-19 disruptions. 
Turning to Slide 8, I'll review our third quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Continued demand recovery across the region and flooring gains drove year-over-year volume growth of nearly 7%, with double-digit growth in France, Italy and the U.K. Additionally, the region delivered year-over-year improvement in EBIT of $47 million as increased demand and strong cost takeout offset unfavorable currency. Overall, we are very pleased with the strong recovery delivered in the third quarter. The region's Q3 EBIT margin of 3.4% solidly demonstrates the impact of our strategic actions to date and the progress we have made to restore profitability in the region.

Net sales increased 14% with organic net sales growth of 40%, led by strong demand rebound in Brazil and share gains across Brazil and Mexico. The region delivered very strong EBIT margins, driven by increased demand and disciplined go-to-market actions, including continued growth in our direct-to-consumer business, offsetting significant currency devaluation. Overall, we are very pleased with the region's ability to deliver outstanding margin results, further reinforcing the long-term margin potential of Latin America. 
Turning to Slide 10, I'll review our third quarter results for our Asia region. In India, we delivered net sales and EBIT growth driven by demand recovery and share gains despite the continued impact of COVID-19 across the broader economy. In China, while we delivered Whirlpool branded share growth, demand softness resulted in negative EBIT. Overall, we are pleased to see a rebound in our India business and expect regional results to gradually improve as the impact of COVID-19 lessens throughout the year. 
Turning to Slide 12, Mark and I will discuss our reinstated full year 2020 guidance. I will now turn it over to Mark to begin."

As mentioned before, our very strong third quarter results and our confidence in our business going forward, coupled with a reasonably good visibility for the fourth quarter, has led us to the decision to reinstate our full year 2020 guidance",328,"Thanks, Jim. As mentioned before, our very strong third quarter results and our confidence in our business going forward, coupled with a reasonably good visibility for the fourth quarter, has led us to the decision to reinstate our full year 2020 guidance. As a result of increased global demand in the third quarter and positive fourth quarter expectations, net sales guidance improved from a decline of 10% to 15% to a decline of 5% to 7%. And on an organic basis, we expect it to be a decline of 1% to flat. Additionally, we expect to deliver approximately 8.5% ongoing EBIT margin, a year-over-year increase of approximately 160 basis points. Further, we expect to deliver free cash flow of approximately $900 million or 4.7% of sales towards the high end of our original guidance range. In total, we expect to deliver full year ongoing earnings per diluted share of $17.50 to $18, an increase even compared to our original guidance range from the beginning of this turbulent year. 
Turning to Slide 13, we show the drivers of our ongoing EBIT margin guidance. We expect price/mix to deliver approximately 75 basis points of margin expansion as effective go-to-market actions offset the negative mix impact of COVID-19. Additionally, our $500 million cost takeout program remains on track, the $350 million in cost takeout year-to-date. Our cost takeout program will result in approximately 75 basis points of net cost improvement and approximately 100 basis points of raw material deflation to favorable impact margins. 
Further, as we continue to invest in the future, we expect increased marketing and technology investments to drive a negative margin impact of 25 basis points while unfavorable currency, primarily in Latin America is expected to impact margins by approximately 75 basis points. In total, we expect these actions to deliver approximately 8.5% ongoing EBIT margin, 160 basis point improvement. 
Now I'll turn it over to Jim to discuss our 2020 free cash flow guidance on Slide 14."

With strong momentum and expectations of continued margin expansion, we anticipate driving incremental cash earnings of approximately $100 million. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $475 million as we continue to launch innovative products and prioritize investments in world-class manufacturing and our digital transformation journey. Additionally, we will end the year with sustainably low working capital levels. We anticipate restructuring cash outlays of approximately $260 million, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 related restructuring actions. Further, we expect to continue optimizing our real estate portfolio, resulting in similar levels of sale of asset transactions as seen in recent years. Lastly, we expect 2 previously discussed onetime items to negatively impact free cash flow. Overall, we expect to drive free cash flow of approximately $900 million as we focus on driving strong cash earnings and effectively prioritizing our capital investments. 
Turning to Slide 15, we provide an update on our capital allocation priorities for the remainder of the year. We are fully committed to funding the business and prioritizing investments, including our digital transformation journey. Additionally, we are focused on returning cash to shareholders, highlighted by our recent dividend increase announcement. Also, our share repurchase program remains temporarily paused as we prioritize the repayment of all short-term debt by the end of the year. As a result, we anticipate our gross debt-to-EBITDA to be approximately 2.4x by year-end, progressing towards our long-term goal of 2x. 
Turning to Slide 16, we highlight our continued commitment to returning cash to shareholders. As previously mentioned, we announced a quarterly dividend increase in October, resulting in 8 consecutive years of dividend increases. This reflects our strong liquidity position, commitment to shareholders and is in line with our dividend target of approximately 30% of trailing 12 months on. 
[Audio Gap] 
Quarter for a year-to-date total of $350 million. Additionally, while we did benefit from pent-up demand in key countries, we also captured the benefits of more structural demand improvement by leveraging our trusted brand portfolio and proven track record of innovation. It is because of these strong results to date and our unique ability to capitalize on these structural trends that we feel confident reinstating our full year 2020 guidance, which is at the high end or above our original guidance for free cash flow and ongoing earnings per diluted share. 
In closing, our Q3 performance serves as another proof point in our long-term value creation strategy highlighting our ability to drive margin expansion and strong levels of cash despite the challenging macroeconomic environment. 
And now we will end up our formal remarks and open up for questions."

First of all, coming back to the big picture, in Q3, North America had a 47% increase of EBIT. That on -- that came on top of last year's Q3, where we had 12.8% EBIT margin. So I would say, over an exceptionally strong margin improvement, which, to your point, came essentially from 2 sources. One, the progress on a cost reduction, the cost reduction program delivered. And 2 is related to price margin progress. Price margin itself falls into 2 buckets. One is, yes, we have significantly reduced promotion expenses. That is a decision which we took essentially in Q2 to kind of curtail pretty much most promotions. But the second point in the price margin is also related to mix. As we alluded to in our prepared remarks is as we are going through with COVID crisis, we see sequentially positive mix trends. And what I mean with that is kind of initial demand was freezers, microwaves, et cetera, which is still present, but we see more and more demand to higher ticket items. So that sequentially also helped us on the PMR. So these were the fundamental drivers behind our outstanding Q3 margin in North America. 
Now to your question about what is normalized, I didn't know we're using the word normal in this year. But having said that, I would say, I would more point to Q2, actually, David. Q2, a definition was the worst quarter ever from a demand perspective. And North America delivered over 12% margin, which just tells you even with our volumes on North America business and our global business is in a completely different structure position. And I think we've certainly demonstrated the trough margin which was Q2 in a very impressive way. And I think now we're just seeing the benefits of this structurally different business model."

So let me spend a little bit more time, and then probably Jim will also add some comments on supply chain constraints. First of all -- first of all, stepping back where the supply chain constraints are coming from. We are ultimately  COVID-related, which is obvious. Geographically, we're particular focused on North America, Europe, to a lesser extent, South America and India, and there's almost no supply chain constraint coming out of China, Vietnam, Thailand. So it is geographically different. It is ultimately coming from, in particular, North America and Europe. It comes from labor constraints, which you have in the factories. Social distancing measures that you have in factors, which just reduced the line pacing which you have in factories and thus the output. It comes from supply and component shortages who have to deal with similar issues in the factories. And it is increasing coming off from logistic constraints. In particular, in the U.S. way, it's just -- you have a couple of bottlenecks. So these are the fundamental constraints, which frankly are getting better every week. But ultimately, as long as COVID is around us, we have to be prepared for supply chain disruptions. And that's just the nature of it. Having said that, we are getting more and more yields despite these constraints out of our factories week after week. 
Now the other part, which is probably going through everybody's mind is when we refer to back order or backlog. Let me also give you a little bit more color on this one because, again, it's a relevant fact in the current environment. As you know, typically, we don't refer to our order book. Our order book typically as a company is 1 or 2 weeks. It's so little. Maybe typically don't refer to that in the earnings calls, because typically, we have a lot of build to order, real customer orders. So it's a very short order book. Right now across the globe, our order book is about 7 to 8 weeks. So it's significantly bigger than any time before, which you can read as good news because you know we have strong demand in our sales, in particular as we go into Q4. But at the same time, it's frustrating because we're letting consumers down. Many of these orders are back orders. And all I can do is apologize for the delay of certain customer orders. So yes, it's good that we have an exceptionally strong order book, but we are, of course, trying to minimize any customer frustration which we have out there. 
So the short answer to them is as long as COVID will be around us, we have to be prepared for supply chain constraints across the entire industry. This is not Whirlpool unique. However, we are getting better week-by-week and getting more yields despite all these constraints."

First of all, when I hear comments about pull forward, I smile because pull forward and back orders are a little bit of contradiction in terms. I would be happy to pull forward orders or deliver orders, but we have right now back orders. We have the opposite situation. From a structural demand perspective, and this is your question, yes, we saw at the beginning of Q3, there was pent-up demand. And frankly there's even right now trade inventories are super low. So there is a little bit element coming from this one. But what that's very important also as we look into the future, we are encouraged by structural, healthy home and house trends. And what I mean with that, and let me spend a little bit more time on this one. We all know people are spending a lot more time at home. People are investing in the home and house. They're investing in nesting. And initially, you saw in the beginning of the crisis, a lot of investing in what I would call more small pocket ticket items. Obviously, you first change the light bulb before you change the lamp. And we see that now across the entire home, that people are starting to invest in home upgrades. People are rethinking the purpose of the home because they know we spend more time over an extended time period. So we do start seeing structurally positive trends for the home. 
Or to put it even in another way. You have structural positive demand trends, coupled with high disposable income and low mortgage rate.  You put these 2 factors together, you have a very, very healthy mix, which kind of, again, gives us confidence beyond this quarter. And there's there's a reason why some people start referring to the golden age of how because there is a lot of positive trends coming together. And we do not see restructured demand trends and refocus on home and nesting going away short term. COVID hopefully at 1 point will be behind us, these trends will stay."

First with EMEA, we had said that EMEA would return to profitability this year. And obviously, the start of the year with the COVID disruptions made that very difficult. But the positive thing coming out of that now as we see the demand picking up and we talked about it a little bit earlier in terms of gaining share back in certain markets as we believe that we've been able to put that business back on track to where we thought it would be at this point in time, exiting the year, which is a positive thing. Now that -- what that does is that reinforces our longer-term thoughts that this is a high single-digit type of margin business. In the midterm and that we can get it to. So again, the cost takeout has been a very positive trend there, but that will continue because the actions take a little bit longer to implement there. So they're coming on the tail end, and that will help them. Also, as we said, demand is positive there, and we're seeing positive market share gain within there. So I think this is a good sign that we're on track, and we're still confident in the longer-term margins. 
If I take Latin America, we've always talked about that Latin America, and historically it has had periods of time where it's been above 10%. And I believe right now, what you're seeing is the effect of positive demand, especially in Brazil. Also with cost takeout and our ability to drive pricing within those countries there as we've experienced currency impacts and cost fluctuation. So I think both of those are on a positive trend. I still think our longer-term margin guidance that we've given for them applies. But that's what -- where we stand right now."

We have many discussions about how do you even get to 10%. Well, the back half of 2020, we will be about 11% EBIT or higher. That's pretty much embedded in our guidance. So I would read Q3 and Q4 as a proof point of our long-term value creation that it's not undoable that we demonstrate it. We all do recognize Q3 and Q4. There are some operational but still exceptional elements in there. Having said that, they fall on a structurally different business model, as we demonstrated in Q2. There's a lot of structural changes in our business, which makes certain elements not comparable to 5 or 10 years ago. And then we're in a very healthy position from that perspective."

I know your overall free cash flow guidance is towards the higher end. But I'm just talking about this cash earnings piece. So could you just help us think through some of the moving parts there and maybe what's driving that delta? And then if we look at some of these other buckets, how should we think about the progression for, call it, net CapEx? So capital investments plus real estate sales and either the onetime or restructuring costs as we move into 2021? Yes. And Seldon, this is Jim. And I think you've kind of hit where some of the things are. As we look at the cash flow coming out of this year, we are on the higher end of the original guidance we gave, and a lot of that is driven by more positive earnings. At this point in time, the working capital seasonality has been different than we expected throughout the year. And obviously, we've had a benefit from inventory coming out earlier. But as we look at that going into the fourth quarter, we'd say right now that some of that we won't see as big of a lift within the fourth quarter, as we normally do, due to that working capital seasonality. 
Now I think you hit the kind of the important point there is what we are seeing is increased restructuring cash payouts to of the cost actions that we took. And that's the biggest driver of the difference from where we would have started the year and what we thought we'd generate in free cash flow to now when you take into account the additional earnings is that we did have some costs, some cash costs that will come out this year. And then obviously, next year, restructuring cash costs will be significantly lower."

I think the one thing you have to take into account here, especially in the third quarter and we talked about this when we talked about the cost takeout program that there were some nonstructural temporary things and then structural things. And so we had more benefits probably within the third quarter from some of those nonstructural temporary type of things. Then you see within the fourth quarter, we more normalize to the effect of what the structural cost takeout. And we've said for next year, we expect that to continue to benefit us with tailwinds of $50 million to $100 million."

Susan, as we already indicated in Q2 when we laid out the 500 million program, we said there are certain elements like raw materials, but we just don't know exactly how that will materialize next year. But then the remaining piece, there's a fairly significant amount of structural cost, and we fully expect restructural cost take-out to carry over into next year. So if you do the math, it's roughly 50 to 100 million cost carryover into next year. 
Particularly to your question around the production, our production productivity was, of course, is very, very challenging Q2 because, first, you don't have volume, you have under occupation, and now you're working 6 shifts or 6 days a week with 3 shifts, which is the most efficient way to produce. So actually, from a pure factory productivity, this has been an incredible tough year. So in a certain way, that actually should improve next year once we get to more normalized production volumes throughout the year."

And we don't get into the specifics by region, but what we typically say is when you look at the overall program, it applies ratably across the globe if you look at our businesses and the sizes of them. And probably in the third quarter, North America had slightly higher benefits of this just because of our ability to implement those things quicker now. 
As we've talked about within there, there were some temporary things that we did earlier in the year, such as furloughs, travel reductions, not having large meetings and stuff that benefit us. But then once we got into the third quarter, the structural actions in terms of headcount reduction, that came both from a voluntary retirement program that we initiated as well as then some involuntary reductions that we did after that. So again, those are the nature and the types of things you see within that cost now to say, did we cut too deep? I would say no. I think we made very -- the right decisive actions at the time. As we said, there's still a lot of unknown around the globe. 
The second thing is our margins reflect with benefits of those decisions that we made. I'd say if you look at especially the question in terms of as production comes back, most of those reductions were made within the white-collar and the office environment. So in terms of the blue-collar environment, we continue to add workers along with the volumes that we have, and we don't see that as a limit on our ability to a reduction of capacity that would affect our ability to service the industry."

I mean, first of all, to give you a little bit of sense, and I know we're getting no operational details. Essentially, our supply chain is a pull system. And given the constraints which you had to face with components and everything else, you had to overnight shift a pull system into a push system. That is I can't express how difficult of a process that is, but our team has management really, really exceptionally well given the constraint. So I hope that's not going to happen any time in the near future, but you have to push or change from a pull to a push system. Having said that, also, of course, we're rethinking certain decisions which we do about single sourcing the suppliers, do we go to dual sourcing, we are rethinking, but doesn't help us short-term about where do we debottleneck and add additional capacity.

And so we've been able to really work our way through it, but it is just one of the challenges right now. And from a cost perspective, we are seeing very positive cost takeout. But we've had to be able to absorb some of those additional incremental logistics costs that we've had, and we've still been able to offset them and still been able to get products delivered. So while it is an issue, I think that's probably something that we don't see as more long-term and structural."

We have -- in the pricing, there's a less promotional element, and there's an increasing positive mix element in there. And they probably will have different longevity. The less promotion is ultimately a reflection of the decision we took in Q2 when we foresaw that the supply chain constraints are real, and we pulled back a lot of promotion. Because in our industry, you don't decide a promotion for next week. You have to decide pretty much 4, 5 months down the road. So we made this decision early in anticipation -- against the supply constraints. The supply constraints at 1 point will normalize, but will not quickly normalize. 
Now obviously, I can't give you a forward-looking statement about our promotion plan for all the obvious reasons. But judge us on our behaviors in the past in terms of how we manage supply, promotion and value creation in the industry. 
The encouraging thing is, and this is where we do have confidence is the structural mix coming from the home nesting and investing in new nesting is good. And I do not believe this is going to go anytime away."

It's just a backlog you mentioned between housing starts and housing completion and appliance coming in. So it's 
not yet a factor in 2020. However, it gives us confidence for '21 because I do believe the new home construction will be fairly healthy as we look into next year, fairly healthy to very healthy. It's ultimately driven by manpower and constraints which we have. I think that will be the limiting factor in that, but will not be the limiting factor in the housing market.

Before we begin, I remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-Q and other periodic reports.

Now turning to Slide 4, we discuss our third quarter 2020 highlights. We delivered organic net sales growth of 7%, driven by industry demand improvement across the globe. While pent-up demand and low inventory levels with our trade customers partially drove demand within the quarter, increasingly, we are seeing the benefit from home nesting and a recovering housing market. 
Additionally, the flawless execution of our early and decisive COVID-19 response actions to protect our business and ensure our continued ability to meet the needs of our customers resulted in ongoing EPS of $6.91, a $2.94 improvement year-over-year; ongoing EBIT margin of 12%, a year-over-year improvement of 480 basis points; significant margin expansion in our North America, Latin America and EMEA region; and a positive year-to-date free cash flow of $170 million, a $1 billion improvement driven by strong net earnings and disciplined working capital management. 
Due to these strong results, the confidence we have in our business and reasonable year-end visibility, we are reinstating our full year 2020 guidance. We now expect to deliver net sales decline of 5% to 7% and organic net sales decline of 1 to flat, an improvement from our previous full year perspective; ongoing EPS of $17.50 to $18, above our original guidance of $16 to $17; and finally, free cash flow of approximately $900 million at the high end of our original guidance range. Additionally, as a reflection of our strong liquidity position, we announce an increase in our quarterly dividend, resulting in the eighth consecutive year of dividend increases. Further, we intend to repay all COVID-19-related short-term borrowings by year-end as we continue to progress towards our long-term leverage target of 2x.
Turning to Slide 5, we show the drivers of third quarter margin. Price/mix positively impacted margin by 275 basis points, primarily driven by reduced promotional investments given our supply chain constraints. Also, sequentially, we continue to see improving mix trends as consumers slowly shift from the rest and prices purchases to upgrading and investing in their homes.
Our cost takeout actions delivered approximately 200 basis points of margin expansion as a result of structural actions we took in the second and third quarter as well as ongoing cost productivity initiative. Additionally, favorable raw material trends positively benefited margin by approximately 150 basis points. Lastly, the impact of continued investments in marketing and technology initiative, along with unfavorable currency negatively impacted margins by approximately 150 basis points.
Overall, we believe our third quarter results highlight the strength and resiliency of our underlying business and the effectiveness of our COVID-19 response plan.
Now I'll turn it over to Jim to review our regional results."

Turning to Slide 7, I'll review our third quarter regional results. In North America, continued COVID-related supply constraints resulted in a revenue decline of 2%. Looking forward, we remain confident in the strong demand for our products as our order backlog remains very high. We delivered record EBIT and EBIT margin, driven by flawless execution of our cost takeout and go-to-market actions, including the reduction of marketing investments. 
From an operational standpoint, we continue to experience COVID-related disruptions in our supply base at our factories and in our logistics network. However, we are seeing gradual sequential improvements in line with our expectations. Overall, the region's outstanding results demonstrate the fundamental strength of our North America business, delivering record margins despite ongoing COVID-19 disruptions.
Turning to Slide 8, I'll review our third quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Continued demand recovery across the region and flooring gains drove year-over-year volume growth of nearly 7%, with double-digit growth in France, Italy and the U.K. Additionally, the region delivered year-over-year improvement in EBIT of $47 million as increased demand and strong cost takeout offset unfavorable currency. Overall, we are very pleased with the strong recovery delivered in the third quarter. The region's Q3 EBIT margin of 3.4% solidly demonstrates the impact of our strategic actions to date and the progress we have made to restore profitability in the region.
Turning to Slide 9, I'll review our third quarter results for our Latin America region. Net sales increased 14% with organic net sales growth of 40%, led by strong demand rebound in Brazil and share gains across Brazil and Mexico. The region delivered very strong EBIT margins, driven by increased demand and disciplined go-to-market actions, including continued growth in our direct-to-consumer business, offsetting significant currency devaluation. Overall, we are very pleased with the region's ability to deliver outstanding margin results, further reinforcing the long-term margin potential of Latin America.
Turning to Slide 10, I'll review our third quarter results for our Asia region. In India, we delivered net sales and EBIT growth driven by demand recovery and share gains despite the continued impact of COVID-19 across the broader economy. In China, while we delivered Whirlpool-branded share growth, demand softness resulted in negative EBIT. Overall, we are pleased to see a rebound in our India business and expect regional results to gradually improve as the impact of COVID-19 lessens throughout the year.

As mentioned before, our very strong third quarter results and our confidence in our business going forward, coupled with a reasonably good visibility for the fourth quarter, has led us to the decision to reinstate our full year 2020 guidance. As a result of increased global demand in the third quarter and positive fourth quarter expectations, net sales guidance improved from a decline of 10% to 15% to a decline of 5% to 7%. And on an organic basis, we expect it to be a decline of 1% to flat. 
Additionally, we expect to deliver approximately 8.5% ongoing EBIT margin, a year-over-year increase of approximately 160 basis points. Further, we expect to deliver free cash flow of approximately $900 million or 4.7% of sales towards the high end of our original guidance range. In total, we expect to deliver full year ongoing earnings per diluted share of $17.50 to $18, an increase even compared to our original guidance range from the beginning of this turbulent year.
Turning to Slide 13, we show the drivers of our ongoing EBIT margin guidance. We expect price/mix to deliver approximately 75 basis points of margin expansion as effective go-to-market actions offset the negative mix impact of COVID-19. Additionally, our $500 million cost takeout program remains on track, the $350 million in cost takeout year-to-date. Our cost takeout program will result in approximately 75 basis points of net cost improvement and approximately 100 basis points of raw material deflation to favorable impact margins.
Further, as we continue to invest in the future, we expect increased marketing and technology investments to drive a negative margin impact of 25 basis points while unfavorable currency, primarily in Latin America, is expected to impact margins by approximately 75 basis points. In total, we expect these actions to deliver approximately 8.5% ongoing EBIT margin, 160 basis point improvement.

With strong momentum and expectations of continued margin expansion, we anticipate driving incremental cash earnings of approximately $100 million. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $475 million as we continue to launch innovative products and prioritize investments in world-class manufacturing and our digital transformation journey. 
Additionally, we will end the year with sustainably low working capital levels. We anticipate restructuring cash outlays of approximately $260 million, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19-related restructuring actions. Further, we expect to continue optimizing our real estate portfolio, resulting in similar levels of sale of asset transactions as seen in recent years. Lastly, we expect 2 previously discussed onetime items to negatively impact free cash flow. Overall, we expect to drive free cash flow of approximately $900 million as we focus on driving strong cash earnings and effectively prioritizing our capital investments.
Turning to Slide 15, we provide an update on our capital allocation priorities for the remainder of the year. We are fully committed to funding the business and prioritizing investments, including our digital transformation journey. Additionally, we are focused on returning cash to shareholders, highlighted by our recent dividend increase announcement. Also, our share repurchase program remains temporarily paused as we prioritize the repayment of all short-term debt by the end of the year. As a result, we anticipate our gross debt-to-EBITDA to be approximately 2.4x by year-end, progressing towards our long-term goal of 2x.
Turning to Slide 16, we highlight our continued commitment to returning cash to shareholders. As previously mentioned, we announced a quarterly dividend increase in October, resulting in 8 consecutive years of dividend increases. This reflects our strong liquidity position, commitment to shareholders and is in line with our dividend target of approximately 30% of trailing 12 months ongoing net earnings.

Additionally, while we did benefit from pent-up demand in key countries, we also captured the benefits of more structural demand improvement by leveraging our trusted brand portfolio and proven track record of innovation. It is because of these strong results to date and our unique ability to capitalize on these structural trends that we feel confident reinstating our full year 2020 guidance, which is at the high end or above our original guidance for free cash flow and ongoing earnings per diluted share.

First of all, coming back to the big picture, in Q3, North America had a 47% increase of EBIT. That on -- that came on top of last year's Q3, where we had 12.8% EBIT margin. So I would say, over an exceptionally strong margin improvement, which, to your point, came essentially from 2 sources. One, the progress on the cost reduction, the cost-reduction program delivered; and two is related to price margin progress. 
Price margin itself falls into 2 buckets. One is, yes, we have significantly reduced promotion expenses. That is a decision, which we took essentially in Q2 to kind of curtail pretty much most promotions. But the second point in the price margin is also related to mix. As we alluded to in our prepared remarks is as we are going through with COVID crisis, we see sequentially positive mix trends. And what I mean with that is kind of initial demand was freezers, microwaves, et cetera, which is still present, but we see more and more demand to higher ticket items. So that sequentially also helped us on the PMR. So these were the fundamental drivers behind our outstanding Q3 margin in North America.
Now to your question about what is normalized, I didn't know we're using the word normal in this year. But having said that, I would say, I would more point to Q2, actually, David. So Q2, which by definition, was the worst quarter ever from a demand perspective. And North America delivered over 12% margin, which just tells you even with our volumes on North America business and our global business is in a completely different structure position. And I think we've certainly demonstrated the trough margin, whereas -- which was Q2, in a very impressive way. So -- and I think now we're just seeing the benefits of this structurally different business model."

First of all, stepping back where the supply chain constraints are coming from. They are ultimately COVID-related, which is obvious. Geographically, we're particular focused on North America, Europe, to a lesser extent, South America and India, and there's almost no supply chain constraint coming out of China, Vietnam, Thailand. So it is geographically different. It is ultimately coming from, in particular, North America and Europe. It comes from labor constraints, which you have in the factories. Social distancing measures that you have in factories, which just reduced the line pacing, which you have in factories and both the output. It comes from supply and component shortages who have to deal with similar issues in the factories. And it is increasing coming off from logistic constraints. In particular, in the U.S. way, it's just -- you have a couple of bottlenecks. So these are the fundamental constraints, which frankly are getting better every week. But ultimately, as long as COVID is around us, we have to be prepared for supply chain disruptions. And that's just the nature of it. Having said that, we are getting more and more yields despite these constraints out of our factories week-after-week.
Now the other part, which is probably going through everybody's mind is when we refer to back orders or backlog. Let me also give you a little bit more color on this one because, again, it's a relevant fact in the current environment. As you know, typically, we don't refer to our order book. Our order book typically as a company is 1 or 2 weeks. It's so little. And we typically don't refer to that in the earnings calls because, typically, we have a lot of build-to-order, real customer orders. So it's a very short order book. 
Right now, across the globe, our order book is about 7 to 8 weeks. So it's significantly bigger than any time before, which you can read as good news because you know we have strong demand in our sales, in particular also as we go into Q4. But at the same time, it's frustrating because we're letting consumers down. Many of these orders are back orders, and all I can do is apologize for the delay of certain customer orders. So yes, it's good that we have an exceptionally strong order book, but we are, of course, trying to minimize any customer frustration, which we have out there.
So the short answer, Sam is as long as COVID will be around us, we have to be prepared for supply chain constraints across the entire industry. This is not Whirlpool unique. However, we are getting better week-by-week and getting more yields despite all these constraints."

First of all, when I hear comments about pull forward, I smile because pull forward and back orders are a little bit of contradiction in terms. I would be happy to pull forward orders or deliver orders, but we have right now back orders. We have the opposite situation. 
From a structural demand perspective, and this is your question, yes, we saw at the beginning of Q3, there was pent-up demand. And frankly, whereas even right now, trade inventories are super low. So there is a little bit of element coming from this one. But what's -- and that's very important also as we look into the future. We are encouraged by structural, healthy home and house trends. And what I mean with that, and let me spend a little bit more time on this one, we all know people are spending a lot more time at home. People are investing in the home and house. They're investing in nesting. And initially, you saw in the beginning of the crisis, a lot of investing in what I would call more small pocket ticket items. 
Obviously, you first change the light bulb before you change the lamp. And we see that now across the entire home, that people are starting to invest in home upgrades, people are rethinking the purpose of the home because they know we spend more time over an extended time period. So we do start seeing structurally positive trends for the home. Or to put it even in another way, you have structural positive demand trends, coupled with high disposable income and low mortgage rate. If you put these 2 factors together, you have a very, very healthy mix, which kind of, again, gives us confidence beyond this quarter. And there's a reason why some people start referring to the golden age of housing because there is a lot of positive trends coming together, and we do not see restructured demand trends and refocus on home and nesting going away short term. COVID, hopefully, at one point will be behind us, these trends will stay."

First with EMEA, we had said that EMEA would return to profitability this year. And obviously, the start of the year with the COVID disruptions made that very difficult. But the positive thing coming out of that now as we see the demand picking up and we talked about it a little bit earlier in terms of gaining share back in certain markets is we believe that we've been able to put that business back on track to where we thought it would be at this point in time, exiting the year, which is a positive thing. Now that -- what that does is that reinforces our longer-term thoughts that this is a high single-digit type of margin business in the mid-term and that we can get it to. 
So again, the cost takeout has been a very positive trend there, but that will continue because the actions take a little bit longer to implement there. So they're coming on the tail end, and that will help them. Also, as we said, demand is positive there, and we're seeing positive market share gain within there. So I think this is a good sign that we're on track, and we're still confident in the longer-term margins.
So if I take Latin America, we've always talked about that Latin America, and historically, it had periods of time where it's been above 10%. And I believe, right now, what you're seeing is the effect of positive demand, especially in Brazil, also with cost takeouts and our ability to drive pricing within those countries there as we've experienced currency impacts and cost fluctuation. So I think both of those are on a positive trend. I still think our longer-term margin guidance that we've given for them applies, but that's what -- where we stand right now."

We have many discussions about how do you even get to 10%. Well, the back half of 2020, we will be about 11% EBIT or higher. That's pretty much embedded in our guidance. So I would read Q3 and Q4 as a proof point of our long-term value creation that it's not undoable that we demonstrate it. We all do recognize Q3 and Q4. There are some operational, but still exceptional elements in there. Having said that, they fall on a structurally different business model, as we demonstrated in Q2. There's a lot of structural changes in our business, which makes certain elements not comparable to 5 or 10 years ago. And then we're in a very healthy position from that perspective."

But as we look at that going into the fourth quarter, we'd say right now that some of that we won't see as big of a lift within the fourth quarter as we normally do, due to that working capital seasonality.
Now I think you hit the kind of the important point there is what we are seeing is increased restructuring cash payouts to the many of the cost actions that we took. And that's the biggest driver of the difference from where we would have started the year and what we thought we'd generate in free cash flow to now when you take into account the additional earnings is that we did have some costs -- some cash costs that will come out this year.

I think the one thing you have to take into account here, especially in the third quarter, and we talked about this when we talked about the cost takeout program, is that there were some nonstructural temporary things and then structural things. And so we had more benefits probably within the third quarter from some of those nonstructural temporary type of things. Then you see within the fourth quarter, we more normalize to the effect of what the structural cost takeout.

Susan, as we already indicated in Q2 when we laid out the $500 million program, we said there are certain elements like raw materials, but we just don't know exactly how that will materialize next year. But then the remaining piece, there's a fairly significant amount of structural costs, and we fully expect the structural cost takeouts to carry over into next year. So if you do the math, it's roughly $50 million to $100 million cost carryover into next year.
Particularly to your question around the production, production productivity was, of course, is very, very challenging Q2 because, first, you don't have volume, you have under occupation, and now you're working 6 shifts or 6 days a week with 3 shifts, which is not the most efficient way to produce.

And probably in the third quarter, North America had slightly higher benefits of it just because of our ability to implement those things quicker now.
As we've talked about within there, there were some temporary things that we did earlier in the year, such as furloughs, travel reductions, not having large meetings and stuff that benefit us. But then once we got into the third quarter, the structural actions in terms of headcount reduction, that came both from a voluntary retirement program that we initiated as well as then some involuntary reductions that we did after that. So again, those are the nature and the types of things you see within that cost. Now to say, did we cut too deep? I would say no. I think we made very -- the right decisive actions at the time. As we said, there's still a lot of unknown around the globe. The second thing is our margins reflect the benefits of those decisions that we made. I'd say if you look at especially the question in terms of as production comes back, most of those reductions were made within the white-collar and the office environment. So in terms of the blue-collar environment, we continue to add workers along with the volumes that we have, and we don't see that as a limit on our ability to a reduction of capacity that would affect our ability to service the industry."

Part of the reason why I'm also less concerned is because already exiting Q3 and now as we enter Q4, we see every week our market share coming back up again.

Now by that description already, you can also infer that, particularly the early side of demand largely came through big home improvement stores.

I mean, first of all, to give you a little bit of sense, and I know we're getting no operational details. Essentially, our supply chain is a pool system. And given the constraints which you had to face with components and everything else, you had to overnight shift a pull system into a push system. That is -- I can't express how difficult of a process that is, but our team as management, a really, really exceptionally well given the constraint. So I hope that's not going to happen any time in the near future, but you have to push or change from pull to a push system. 
Having said that, also, of course, we're rethinking certain decisions, which we do about single sourcing with suppliers, do we go to dual sourcing. We are rethinking, but doesn't help us short-term about where do we debottleneck and add additional capacity. So these are the kind of things, which we're reflecting right now. However, they don't have an impact in Q4. They're more structural to your point, stepping back in terms of what we will learn and what we will readjust."

The less promotion is ultimately a reflection of the decision we took in Q2 when we foresaw that the supply chain constraints are real, and we pulled back a lot of promotion. Because in our industry, you don't decide a promotion for next week. You have to decide pretty much 4, 5 months down the road. So we made this decision early in anticipation against the supply constraints. The supply constraints at one point will normalize, but will not quickly normalize.
Now obviously, I can't give you a forward-looking statement about our promotion plan for all the obvious reasons. But judge us on our behaviors in the past in terms of how we manage supply, promotion and value creation in the industry.

I mean, so we're trying to prioritize as much as we can. Having said that, I think the real momentum, which I think starts building in the homebuilder market, is not yet visible in our Q3 and Q4 numbers because it's just a backlog, as you mentioned, between housing starts, housing completion and appliance coming in. So that is not yet a factor in 2020. However, it gives us confidence for '21 because I do believe the new home construction will be fairly healthy as we look into next year, fairly healthy to very healthy. It's ultimately driven, similar to our industry, by manpower and constraints, which we have. I think that will be the limiting factor. Demand will not be the limiting factor in the housing market.
