And thanks, everyone, for joining us for our fiscal 2020 second quarter earnings call. We just reported an exceptional quarter, which really underscores the strength of Fox and our unique position in the market. Nowhere with t",2011,"Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon. And thanks, everyone, for joining us for our fiscal 2020 second quarter earnings call. We just reported an exceptional quarter, which really underscores the strength of Fox and our unique position in the market. Nowhere with that strength and uniqueness on greater display than this past weekend, culminating with our groundbreaking broadcast of Super Bowl LIV. 
Let me say at the outset, how pleased I am of the efforts of our entire company. Our people delivered a flawless broadcast of Sunday's game to more than 150 million unique viewers across the country, virtually guaranteeing its place as the most watched live television event of 2020. We surrounded the Super Bowl with an immersive and innovative programming lineup from Miami across FOX Sports, FOX News, FOX Sports 1 and our local stations. And we used this enormous platform to launch season 3 of The Masked Singer right after the game, which became TV's highest-rated reality telecast in 8 years. 
On Sunday, Fox is the largest revenue day in TV history, generating around $600 million of gross revenue and providing an unmatched platform for over 100 advertisers from the pregame through The Masked Singer, and we delivered extraordinary ratings for our advertising, distribution and NFL partners. 
And while there's a massive amount of planning and activity that goes with broadcasting the Super Bowl, it has not been at the expense of delivering other imperatives for our business. During the first 6 months of the fiscal year, we have already achieved a substantial number of key operating milestones in support of Fox's growth and momentum. Among them were: Attaining #1 status for the FOX Network and broadcast and maintaining the #1 position of FOX News in all of cable; delivering our strong sports calendar to viewers and advertisers, particularly across baseball and football; launching the WWE; acquiring Credible; and activating FOX Bet. 
We announced the expansion of our local station footprint with the acquisition of 2 key local market stations. We completed a substantial number of major distribution deals in line with our expectations, including gaining carriage for FOX News and FOX Business on Sling, and we have delivered impressive financial results, led by revenue growth. This quarter, we've really knocked it out of the park. Steve will provide further color around the financial results shortly, but our first half results illustrate the power and importance of our brands to our partners and audiences, validating our strategy to build Fox around live sports, live news and event programming. 
Overall, our top revenue -- our top line revenue is trending nicely. Total affiliate revenue increased by nearly 6% in the first 6 months of the fiscal year and our advertising markets, both national and local, are buoyant, as illustrated by the current scatter market, where we see pricing well over 20% higher than upfront levels. 
The strength of the television advertising market for us is at the level that we have not seen for some time. Across all of Fox, we are seeing growing demand because we are delivering sizable audiences for brands. 
At our national networks, categories that are leading this intensity include financial, insurance, the streamers, technology and foreign auto. At the local level, most of these same categories are prominent, except domestic autos are currently running ahead of foreign. 
On the national news side of our business, FOX News and FOX Business are seeing a significant advertising client expansion across both our linear and digital advertising business, led by the financial and technology categories. The FOX News audience is increasingly sought after by more and more advertisers as they look to reach a large engaged audience, particularly across Middle America. This advertising strength is based, in large part, from delivering on a promise made last May at our upfront that FOX would own the fall across the entire FOX Network. Overall, the FOX Network took the top rating spot for the fall broadcast season, marking its first #1 finish in the 18 to 49 demographic in 10 years. 
Additionally, Fox is the only network to achieve year-over-year gains in both total viewers and in the 18 to 49 demo. Fox also ranked as the #1 entertainment network in the fall in all viewers for the first time in our history, fueled by the success of The Masked Singer, 911 and the top new series. Prodigal Son. We're focused on sustaining this momentum in the second half of the year, with the addition of the Deputy and 911 Lone Star, and nonscripted content like Gordon Ramsay's 24 hours to Hell and Back, the third season of The Masked Singer and our newest show, Lego Masters, which debuts tonight on Fox. I suggest watching with your whole family. It's truly great. 
On the sports side of our business, we continue to drive unparalleled audiences to our signature program. So far this fiscal year, FOX Sports has been home to the U.S. Women's National Soccer Team, a riveting 7-game World Series, the inaugural broadcast presentation of WWE SmackDown, an ambitious new college football strategy and the launch of our partnership with TSG and FOX Bet. And clearly, it was a great year for NFL Football on Fox, which culminated Sunday with the broadcast of Super Bowl LIV. 
For the second year in a row, Fox was able to expand its audience for Thursday Night Football, College Football Saturdays and NFL Sundays. In aggregate, total regular season football viewing on Fox, NFL and college football combined, was up 14% over 2018. It's worth noting that no other network was up more than half this level. 
While the momentum we've seen at the broadcast network has been strong, equally as impressive is the performance of FOX News. FOX News finished calendar 2019 as a top-rated basic cable network across all cable networks for a fourth year in a row, beating its nearest competitors by over 40% and achieving its highest-rated prime time in history. 
Given the well-documented headwinds facing the broader cable industry, FOX News' ability to grow its audience over last year is a testament to the enduring power of the brand. The current news cycle continues to drive passionate viewers to FOX News, and it's hard to see that trend subsiding. 
All of these achievements point to a simple fact: Fox is the home to both the top-rated broadcast network and the most viewed cable network, and that is an exciting position to be in. Equally exciting is to be the home of the 2 events that command the attention of the entire country in the same year. We started calendar 2020 with the first event, the broadcast of Super Bowl LIV on Fox. We now set our focus on the second event, the news equivalent of the Super Bowl, the presidential election. 
FOX News' branded Democracy 2020 election coverage is already in full swing. If history is any guide, audience levels and engagement will build significantly as the cycle progresses through the upcoming primaries and caucuses, the conventions and the presidential debates, all culminating in our election night coverage across FOX News Media on Tuesday, November 3. 
As we build towards November, the financial benefits are not limited to FOX News. We'll see a sizable ad revenue uplift at our local television stations. As referenced in calendar 2018, during the last midterm election, our stations collectively generated record gross political revenues in excess of $200 million, shattering the previous record set during the 2012 Obama/Romney election by 40%. 
Although we are very early in the political season. We are already seeing signs of further increased political spending, with a vast majority of the spend dedicated to the unmatched reach of television. 
We saw it on Sunday, with spending in the Super Bowl on a national level. And we're already -- and we've already been seeing it at our local stations, which positions us to deliver a new record for political revenues in calendar 2020. Our confidence is further strengthened by the fact that we will soon be expanding our station footprint, which already includes stations in Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Virginia into another perennial swing state, Wisconsin, with the previously announced acquisition of the FOX affiliate in Milwaukee. 
As you can tell, I'm thrilled with the rapid progress that we have made and the recognition of the great value of our networks by our distribution partners. As indicated earlier, we have achieved our goals in all the distribution renewals we have completed, which reflects the importance of our content to the market. But of course, we recognize that the trends in the paid subscriber universe has an impact on our business. As you know, we are dependent on our traditional and digital distribution partners and their business plans for our inclusion in their pay television retail offerings. And while I'm not going to predict where a normalized pay TV subscriber base ends up in the near to medium term, I know that this ecosystem will still be the largest component of our revenues for some time. 
Nevertheless, we have begun allocating capital to expand our revenue base while preserving our subscriber fee relationships into direct-to-consumer initiatives, which will grow in importance over time. FOX Nation, FOX Bet and Credible are 3 recent examples of this, but we continue to evaluate opportunities where Fox can bring unique value directly to consumers while sustaining existing business models. 
Nonetheless, there is solid growth and momentum at the company's existing digital businesses, with total engagement increasing last quarter by over 40% versus the previous quarter. FOX News Digital had a record calendar 2019, beating cnn.com in both total views and minutes consumed. And for the first time, FOX News digital averaged over 100 million unique comps per monthly visitors. 
FOX Sports also had a record digital year in calendar 2019, growing both total video views across streaming and social platforms and total minutes consumed by over 20%. It was also our highest streamed regular season for the NFL on Fox, with growth of 57% over last year. And to refer to the Super Bowl one more time, the game was the most streamed ever. 11.7 million users streamed all a part of the Super Bowl, and 70% of their consumption was on FOX-owned platforms. 
While we have remain focused on executing against our operational plans and hitting our financial targets. We have also demonstrated how we look to deploy our capital through an appropriate balance of organic investment, strategic M&A and return of capital to our shareholders. 
On the organic investment side, the previously announced $200 million to $250 million EBITDA investment began to ramp up this past quarter with the broadcast of WWE SmackDown and our investments in greater originality and coproduction rights at the FOX Network, along with investment in our digital initiatives, led by FOX Nation and the refresh of FOX Business. 
In terms of strategic M&A, in October we deployed approximately $260 million for the previously mentioned acquisition of Credible Labs. In the short time we've owned Credible Labs, we have seen the signs of the exceptional growth the business is capable of. For example, during calendar 2019 Credible more than doubled this cumulative registered user base and experienced record closed loan volume, both of which drove substantial top line revenue growth. 
We have also committed around $300 million to acquire the Nexstar television stations in Seattle and Milwaukee, in exchange for our stations in Charlotte. We expect this deal to close in the next month or so. And our commitment to return capital to our shareholders remains an integral element of our capital allocation strategy. In addition to the just announced semiannual dividend, we have now finished the initial $500 million of share repurchases that we commit to when we announced the $2 billion authorization 3 months ago. 
As we have consistently noted, we remain committed to deploying capital in a disciplined manner to maximize shareholder value through this balanced approach. Now I will turn the call over to Steve to provide more detail on our financial results."

As you just heard, our operating momentum continued in the second quarter, and we continue to exceed the internal goals that we commenced the year with. This past quarter, we delivered strong top line growth led by an",1401,"Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. As you just heard, our operating momentum continued in the second quarter, and we continue to exceed the internal goals that we commenced the year with. This past quarter, we delivered strong top line growth led by an increase in total affiliate revenue of 7%. We achieved this growth despite aggregate industry pay TV subscribers continuing to decline at a rate in excess of 4% over calendar year 2019. 
During this period, the losses across traditional distributors, many of whom reported last week, were at least partially offset by continued growth of digital MVPDs, where subscribers have grown 2.3 million. In this past quarter, we saw digital MVPDs grow by over 1.5 million, representing sequential quarterly growth of over 20%. 
As we have highlighted in the past, the natural seasonality of our business means the second quarter is traditionally the low watermark from an EBITDA margin standpoint. This is primarily due to the timing of broadcast sports and entertainment expenses that are concentrated in the fall season. This includes the investments in sports and entertainment content of the FOX Network, which as we have previously outlined, set us up well to complete our remaining distribution renewals in this cycle and achieve our longer-term financial targets. 
Let me now take you through our second quarter results, and along the way, remind you of some key factors that shape the remainder of our fiscal year. 
In the second quarter, the company reported total revenues of $3.78 billion, up 5% over the comparative period in fiscal 2019, reflecting revenue growth across all operating segments. EBITDA was $261 million, which compares to the $445 million generated in the prior year period, as growth at the cable segment was more than offset by lower operating results for the television segment and the impact of corporate expenses at the other segment now being reported on an actual basis. The latter reflects the costs of Fox operating as a stand-alone public company in the current year quarter versus the presentation of carve out financial statements in the prior year. 
From a bottom line perspective, net income attributable to stockholders of $300 million or $0.48 per share was higher than the $8 million or $0.01 per share in the prior year quarter. This growth was primarily due to the change in fair value of the company's investments recognized in other net, including the Stars Group and Roku, which together have a current market value of approximately $1.1 billion. 
Excluding this impact and other onetime items, adjusted EPS of $0.10 was down compared to last year's $0.43 per share, reflecting the change in EBITDA and interest expense, which as we have flagged in the past, now reflects the amount associated with operating as a stand-alone company. 
So now turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter, where cable network EBITDA of $556 million was up 7% on revenue growth of 2%. Cable affiliate revenues increased 2% as the impact of higher average rates across essentially all of our brands was partially offset by the net decrease in pay television subscribers that I mentioned earlier. Assuming current subscriber volume trends continue, we continue to anticipate modestly accelerating growth in cable affiliate revenue in the second half of the fiscal year as the full impact of rate resets from recent renegotiations begin to take effect. 
Total advertising revenues decreased 5% due to fewer units at FOX News Media, including higher preemptions associated with its breaking news coverage of the impeachment hearings; and the absence of the UFC programming at the national Sports Networks. These impacts were partially offset by strong results from our coverage of the MLB American League Championship series between the New York Yankees and Houston Astros on FOX Sports 1. 
Cable and other revenues grew by $32 million. This increase was driven by higher sports sublicensing revenue and pay-per-view boxing revenues associated with the heavyweight bout between Wilder and Ortiz as well as subscription revenues from FOX Nation. 
EBITDA in our cable segment increased 7% over the prior year, reflecting these higher revenues while costs were essentially held flat. From a cost perspective, savings from our nonrenewal of UFC programming were offset by the contractual increases on existing sports right agreements at the National Sports Networks, along with higher costs at FOX News Media, which includes our investment in digital. 
It is worth noting that we anticipate elevated growth in heavy segment expenses in our fiscal third quarter versus the prior year. This is driven by increased costs in our National Sports Networks, reflecting both contractual increases for our sports rights; and the production costs of the shoulder programming around the broadcast of Super Bowl LIV. It also includes increased costs at FOX News Media related to our coverage of the presidential election and continued investment in Fox Nation. 
The television segment reported an EBITDA loss of $214 million, higher than the loss of $14 million in the prior year quarter on revenue growth of 5%. The revenue growth was led by an 18% increase in television affiliate revenues, reflecting double-digit programming fee growth from nonowned station affiliates, and double-digit direct retransmission revenue growth at our owned and operated stations. 
Television advertising revenues in the quarter increased $39 million or 2%. This was achieved despite us lapping the record political advertising revenues at our owned and operated stations from the midterm elections in the prior year quarter. This result was underpinned by the very robust advertising market conditions that Lachlan just described, coupled with stronger NFL ratings, the programming successes we have delivered at FOX Entertainment, a compelling 7-game World Series, and the introduction to the schedule of WWE Friday Night SmackDown. 
EBITDA at our television segment decreased $200 million over the prior year as an increase in expenses of over $300 million more than offset strong revenue growth. The increase in expenses was due to the anticipated increase in sports programming amortization and production expenses, led by the NFL, along with the investments we have made in television segment programming. During the quarter, these investments included the premier of WWE; the expansion of original entertainment programming; and our participation in co-production arrangements with third-party studios. 
Finally, from a P&L perspective, the net EBITDA loss in our other segment amounted to $81 million, which reflects a full quarter of stand-alone costs as opposed to the carve-out basis of presentation in the corresponding quarter of the prior year. 
Turning now to cash flow. Over the first 6 months of fiscal 2020, the company generated negative free cash flow of $366 million, which we calculate as net cash used in operating activities plus cash invested in property, plant and equipment. As a reminder, this anticipated use of capital reflects the typical seasonality you should expect to see in the business. Here, the first half of our fiscal year is impacted by the working capital deficit that results from the concentration of our annual sports rights payments and the recognized but yet to collect peak advertising revenues that are associated with our sports and entertainment programming in the full broadcast season. These factors will reverse in the second half of our fiscal year as we harvest cash from the collection on prior quarter's advertising revenues and payments for sports rights subside resulting in a significant cash surplus. 
On a full year basis, we will benefit from the natural low working capital usage of our business along with our cash tax benefit, and will therefore convert a significant percentage of the company's EBITDA to free cash flow. 
From an overall balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with just under $2 billion in cash and $6.8 billion in debt. As Lachlan mentioned earlier, we have completed the initial $500 million stock repurchase goal that we outlined 3 months ago, comprising $350 million of Class A shares and $150 million of Class B shares. We will also have seen that we just declared our semi-annual dividend of $0.23 a share. 
Finally, as part of our balanced approach to capital allocation, we closed on the acquisition of a 67% stake in Credible Labs in early October. And with regulatory approvals now secured, we expect to soon close the previously announced Nexstar television stations transaction at a net purchase price of approximately $300 million. 
And with that, I would now like to turn the call back to Joe."

So we were able to use that to achieve multi-year pricing for those channels at levels that were at or above what we planned, and distribution fully with our distribution partners. So I think those were the 2 that we were really focused on."

We are absolutely still expecting to hit that number and cross that hurdle. So -- and that's factoring in the subscriber volume declines. So I think we're really doing a terrific job in driving those affiliate fees. 
In regards to Roku, as sort of widely reported last Friday, our distribution deal with Roku was expiring. We went through, frankly, a very normal course, sort of negotiation with them, not unlike the negotiations we have with all of our distributors. What happens in these negotiations, and often this is what becomes public as both sides prepare for a nonresolution of the issues. But ultimately, they, like all of our distributors and platforms saw the value of the FOX brands and content on their platform, and we were able to resolve our differences and agreed to a new agreement, really, I think, to mutual benefit. Throughout it all, it was very professional. We have a huge regard for Anthony Wood and his management team at Roku. We think they're doing a tremendous stake. They've positioned the company to really be one of the -- the leading, if not the lead beneficiary of over-the-top streaming, and we are happy shareholders in the company. 
I think we're ready for the next question."

And obviously, not just at the FOX Network, but at FOX News as well. And the -- as I mentioned in my earlier comments, we see that ratings strength really just continuing. In fact last night, over the State of the Union broadcast, I think I know because I have seen the numbers, maybe many of you have already, but FOX News  ratings were double the ratings of CNN and MSNBC combined. So it really is a tremendous performance. 
What we've been doing, and I think others have followed our lead, is working to build in as many advertising units as we can. This includes using the innovative use of, sort of, squeezing back advertising and having sort of a split screen -- split-screen sort of experience where you can cover some of the breaking news, while also showing the ad or the ad break. So we are gathering as much of that revenue as possible. 
I think the important note though, around FOX News advertising, is really the expansion in the number of marketers and partners that we have on FOX News. There's a growing sense in the market that if you want to reach Middle America, there's no better place than placing your brand, your advertising than on FOX News. So the advertising team is doing a tremendous job. And we expect to capture a significant amount of sort of the upside revenue as we run through this political season. And that's not to say, they're not that we haven't mentioned, the local stations obviously in California, we are about 2 markets, in Texas where we have 3 markets, North Carolina, Virginia, Minnesota. And now with the addition soon of Wisconsin, we are very well placed in swing states, will there be a significant amount of our of advertising spend towards this election."

So clearly, our audiences are engaging with our content. They're engaging with our content today in a number of different forms, not just broadcast. I mentioned in my earlier remarks, I think it was 11.7 million people watched the Super Bowl via streaming, our broadcast Super Bowl via streaming. And 70%, which is actually remarkable numbers, 70% of those -- of that 11.7 million watched it on platforms that we own. So I think we are already sort of progressing down that path. 
And I should also just call out Fox Nation, which is obviously really excellence in our direct-to-consumer product out of FOX News. 80% of the people who sample Fox Nation to take our free trial, 80% of them convert to paid subscribers. In December and January were the 2 highest months in history in terms of both subscriber acquisition but also, and just as importantly, in terms of engagement on the platform.

And thanks, everyone, for joining us for our fiscal 2020 second quarter earnings call. We just reported an exceptional quarter, which really underscores the strength of Fox and our unique position in the market. Nowhere with t",2011,"Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon. And thanks, everyone, for joining us for our fiscal 2020 second quarter earnings call. We just reported an exceptional quarter, which really underscores the strength of Fox and our unique position in the market. Nowhere with that strength and uniqueness on greater display than this past weekend, culminating with our groundbreaking broadcast of Super Bowl LIV. 
Let me say at the outset how pleased I am of the efforts of our entire company. Our people delivered a flawless broadcast of Sunday's game to more than 150 million unique viewers across the country, virtually guaranteeing its place as the most watched live television event of 2020. We surrounded the Super Bowl with an immersive and innovative programming lineup from Miami across FOX Sports, FOX News, FOX Sports 1 and our local stations. And we used this enormous platform to launch season 3 of The Masked Singer right after the game, which became TV's highest-rated reality telecast in 8 years.  
On Sunday, Fox had the largest revenue day in TV history, generating around $600 million of gross revenue and providing an unmatched platform for over 100 advertisers from the pregame through The Masked Singer, and we delivered extraordinary ratings for our advertising, distribution and NFL partners. 
And while there's a massive amount of planning and activity that goes with broadcasting the Super Bowl, it has not been at the expense of delivering other imperatives for our business. During the first 6 months of the fiscal year, we have already achieved a substantial number of key operating milestones in support of Fox's growth and momentum. Among them were: Attaining #1 status for the FOX Network and broadcast and maintaining the #1 position of FOX News in all of cable; delivering a strong sports calendar to viewers and advertisers, particularly across baseball and football; launching the WWE; acquiring Credible; and activating FOX Bet. 
We announced the expansion of our local station footprint with the acquisition of 2 key local market stations. We completed a substantial number of major distribution deals, in line with our expectations, including gaining carriage for FOX News and FOX Business on Sling, and we have delivered impressive financial results, led by revenue growth. 
This quarter, we've really knocked it out of the park. Steve will provide further color around the financial results shortly, but our first half results illustrate the power and importance of our brands to our partners and audiences, validating our strategy to build Fox around live sports, live news and event programming. 
Overall, our top revenue -- our top line revenue is trending nicely. Total affiliate revenue increased by nearly 6% in the first 6 months of the fiscal year and our advertising markets, both national and local, are buoyant, as illustrated by the current scatter market, where we see pricing well over 20% higher than upfront levels. 
The strength of the television advertising market for us is at a level that we have not seen for some time. Across all of Fox, we are seeing growing demand because we are delivering sizable audiences for brands. 
At our national networks, categories that are leading this intensity include financial, insurance, the streamers, technology and foreign auto. At the local level, most of these same categories are prominent, except domestic autos are currently running ahead of foreign. 
On the national news side of our business, FOX News and FOX Business are seeing a significant advertising client expansion across both our linear and digital advertising business, led by the financial and technology categories. The FOX News audience is increasingly sought after by more and more advertisers as they look to reach a large engaged audience, particularly across Middle America. This advertising strength is based, in large part, from delivering on a promise made last May at our upfront that FOX would own the fall across the entire FOX Network. Overall, the FOX Network took the top rating spot for the fall broadcast season, marking its first #1 finish in the 18 to 49 demographic in 10 years.
Additionally, Fox is the only network to achieve year-over-year gains in both total viewers and in the 18 to 49 demo. Fox also ranked as the #1 entertainment network in the fall in all viewers for the first time in our history, fueled by the success of The Masked Singer, 9-1-1 and the top new series, Prodigal Son. We're focused on sustaining this momentum in the second half of the year with the addition of the Deputy and 9-1-1: Lone Star, and non-scripted content like Gordon Ramsay's 24 Hours to Hell and Back, the third season of The Masked Singer and our newest show, Lego Masters, which debuts tonight on Fox. I suggest watching with your whole family. It's truly great. 
On the sports side of our business, we continue to drive unparalleled audiences to our signature programming. So far this fiscal year, FOX Sports has been home to the U.S. Women's National Soccer Team, a riveting 7-game World Series, the inaugural broadcast presentation of WWE SmackDown, an ambitious new college football strategy and the launch of our partnership with TSG and FOX Bet. And clearly, it was a great year for NFL Football on Fox, which culminated Sunday with the broadcast of Super Bowl LIV. 
For the second year in a row, Fox was able to expand its audience for Thursday Night Football, College Football Saturdays and NFL Sundays. In aggregate, total regular season football viewing on Fox, NFL and college football combined, was up 14% over 2018. It's worth noting that no other network was up more than half this level. 
While the momentum we've seen at the broadcast network has been strong, equally as impressive is the performance of FOX News. FOX News finished calendar 2019 as a top-rated basic cable network across all cable networks for a fourth year in a row, beating its nearest competitors by over 40% and achieving its highest-rated prime time in history. 
Given the well-documented headwinds facing the broader cable industry, FOX News' ability to grow its audience over last year is a testament to the enduring power of the brand. The current news cycle continues to drive passionate viewers to FOX News, and it's hard to see that trend subsiding. 
All of these achievements point to a simple fact: Fox is the home to both the top-rated broadcast network and the most viewed cable network, and that is an exciting position to be in. Equally exciting is to be the home of the 2 events that command the attention of the entire country in the same year. We started calendar 2020 with the first event, the broadcast of Super Bowl LIV on Fox. We now set our focus on the second event, the news equivalent of the Super Bowl, the presidential election. 
FOX News' branded Democracy 2020 election coverage is already in full swing. If history is any guide, audience levels and engagement will build significantly as the cycle progresses through the upcoming primaries and caucuses, the conventions and the presidential debates, all culminating in our election night coverage across FOX News Media on Tuesday, November 3. 
As we build towards November, the financial benefits are not limited to FOX News. We'll see a sizable ad revenue uplift at our local television stations. As referenced in calendar 2018, during the last midterm election, our stations collectively generated record gross political revenues in excess of $200 million, shattering the previous record set during the 2012 Obama/Romney election by 40%. 
Although we are very early in the political season, we are already seeing signs of further increased political spending, with a vast majority of the spend dedicated to the unmatched reach of television. 
We saw it on Sunday, with spending in the Super Bowl on a national level. And we're already -- and we've already been seeing it at our local stations, which positions us to deliver a new record for political revenues in calendar 2020. Our confidence is further strengthened by the fact that we will soon be expanding our station footprint, which already includes stations in Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Virginia into another perennial swing state, Wisconsin, with the previously announced acquisition of the FOX affiliate in Milwaukee.
As you can tell, I'm thrilled with the rapid progress that we have made and the recognition of the great value of our networks by our distribution partners. As indicated earlier, we have achieved our goals in all the distribution renewals we have completed, which reflects the importance of our content to the market. But of course, we recognize that the trends in the paid subscriber universe has an impact on our business. As you know, we are dependent on our traditional and digital distribution partners and their business plans for our inclusion in their pay television retail offerings. And while I'm not going to predict where a normalized pay TV subscriber base ends up in the near to medium term, I know that this ecosystem will still be the largest component of our revenues for some time. 
Nevertheless, we have begun allocating capital to expand our revenue base while preserving our subscriber fee relationships into direct-to-consumer initiatives, which will grow in importance over time. FOX Nation, FOX Bet and Credible are 3 recent examples of this, but we continue to evaluate opportunities where Fox can bring unique value directly to consumers while sustaining existing business models. 
Nonetheless, there is solid growth and momentum at the company's existing digital businesses, with total engagement increasing last quarter by over 40% versus the previous quarter. FOX News Digital had a record calendar 2019, beating cnn.com in both total views and minutes consumed. And for the first time, FOX News digital averaged over 100 million unique comps per monthly visitors. 
FOX Sports also had a record digital year in calendar 2019, growing both total video views across streaming and social platforms and total minutes consumed by over 20%. It was also our highest streamed regular season for the NFL on Fox, with growth of 57% over last year. And to refer to the Super Bowl one more time, the game was the most streamed ever. 11.7 million users streamed all or part of the Super Bowl, and 70% of their consumption was on FOX-owned platforms. 
While we have remain focused on executing against our operational plans and hitting our financial targets, we have also demonstrated how we look to deploy our capital through an appropriate balance of organic investment, strategic M&A and return of capital to our shareholders. 
On the organic investment side, the previously announced $200 million to $250 million EBITDA investment began to ramp up this past quarter with the broadcast of WWE SmackDown and our investments in greater originality and coproduction rights at the FOX Network, along with investment in our digital initiatives, led by FOX Nation and the refresh of FOX Business. 
In terms of strategic M&A, in October, we deployed approximately $260 million for the previously mentioned acquisition of Credible Labs. In the short time we've owned Credible Labs, we have seen the signs of the exceptional growth the business is capable of. For example, during calendar 2019, Credible more than doubled its cumulative registered user base and experienced record closed loan volume, both of which drove substantial top line revenue growth. 
We have also committed around $300 million to acquire the Nexstar television stations in Seattle and Milwaukee, in exchange for our stations in Charlotte. We expect this deal to close in the next month or so. And our commitment to return capital to our shareholders remains an integral element of our capital allocation strategy. In addition to the just announced semiannual dividend, we have now finished the initial $500 million of share repurchases that we committed to when we announced the $2 billion authorization 3 months ago. 
As we have consistently noted, we remain committed to deploying capital in a disciplined manner to maximize shareholder value through this balanced approach. Now I will turn the call over to Steve to provide more detail on our financial results."
546623668,650949629,1900780,"Fox Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2020",2020-02-05,"Earnings Calls","Fox Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. As you just heard, our operating momentum continued in the second quarter, and we continue to exceed the internal goals that we commenced the year with. This past quarter, we delivered strong top line growth, led by an",1400,"Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. As you just heard, our operating momentum continued in the second quarter, and we continue to exceed the internal goals that we commenced the year with. This past quarter, we delivered strong top line growth, led by an increase in total affiliate revenue of 7%. We achieved this growth despite aggregate industry pay TV subscribers continuing to decline at a rate in excess of 4% over calendar year 2019. 
During this period, the losses across traditional distributors, many of whom reported last week, were at least partially offset by continued growth of digital MVPDs, where subscribers have grown 2.3 million. In this past quarter, we saw digital MVPDs grow by over 1.5 million, representing sequential quarterly growth of over 20%. 
As we have highlighted in the past, the natural seasonality of our business means the second quarter is traditionally the low watermark from an EBITDA margin standpoint. This is primarily due to the timing of broadcast sports and entertainment expenses that are concentrated in the fall season. This includes the investments in sports and entertainment content of the FOX Network, which as we have previously outlined, set us up well to complete our remaining distribution renewals in this cycle and achieve our longer-term financial targets. 
Let me now take you through our second quarter results, and along the way, remind you of some key factors that shape the remainder of our fiscal year. 
In the second quarter, the company reported total revenues of $3.78 billion, up 5% over the comparative period in fiscal 2019, reflecting revenue growth across all operating segments. EBITDA was $261 million, which compares to the $445 million generated in the prior year period, as growth at the cable segment was more than offset by lower operating results for the television segment and the impact of corporate expenses at the other segment now being reported on an actual basis. The latter reflects the costs of Fox operating as a stand-alone public company in the current year quarter versus the presentation of carve-out financial statements in the prior year. 
From a bottom line perspective, net income attributable to stockholders of $300 million or $0.48 per share was higher than the $8 million or $0.01 per share in the prior year quarter. This growth was primarily due to the change in fair value of the company's investments recognized in other net, including the Stars Group and Roku, which together have a current market value of approximately $1.1 billion. 
Excluding this impact and other onetime items, adjusted EPS of $0.10 was down compared to last year's $0.43 per share, reflecting the change in EBITDA and interest expense, which as we have flagged in the past, now reflects the amount associated with operating as a stand-alone company. 
So now turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter, where cable network EBITDA of $556 million was up 7% on revenue growth of 2%. Cable affiliate revenues increased 2% as the impact of higher average rates across essentially all of our brands was partially offset by the net decrease in pay television subscribers that I mentioned earlier. Assuming current subscriber volume trends continue, we continue to anticipate modestly accelerating growth in cable affiliate revenue in the second half of the fiscal year as the full impact of rate resets from recent renegotiations begin to take effect. 
Total advertising revenues decreased 5% due to fewer units at FOX News Media, including higher preemptions associated with its breaking news coverage of the impeachment hearings; and the absence of the UFC programming at the national sports networks. These impacts were partially offset by strong results from our coverage of the MLB American League Championship series between the New York Yankees and Houston Astros on FOX Sports 1. 
Cable and other revenues grew by $32 million. This increase was driven by higher sports sublicensing revenue and pay-per-view boxing revenues associated with the heavyweight bout between Wilder and Ortiz as well as subscription revenues from FOX Nation. 
EBITDA in our cable segment increased 7% over the prior year, reflecting these higher revenues while costs were essentially held flat. From a cost perspective, savings from our nonrenewal of UFC programming were offset by the contractual increases on existing sports right agreements at the national sports networks, along with higher costs at FOX News Media, which includes our investment in digital. 
It is worth noting that we anticipate elevated growth in cable segment expenses in our fiscal third quarter versus the prior year. This is driven by increased costs at our national sports networks, reflecting both contractual increases for our sports rights; and the production costs of the shoulder programming around the broadcast of Super Bowl LIV. It also includes increased costs at FOX News Media related to our coverage of the presidential election and continued investment in Fox Nation. 
The television segment reported an EBITDA loss of $214 million, higher than the loss of $14 million in the prior year quarter on revenue growth of 5%. The revenue growth was led by an 18% increase in television affiliate revenues, reflecting double-digit programming fee growth from non-owned station affiliates, and double-digit direct retransmission revenue growth at our owned and operated stations. 
Television advertising revenues in the quarter increased $39 million or 2%. This was achieved despite us lapping the record political advertising revenues at our owned and operated stations from the midterm elections in the prior year quarter. This result was underpinned by the very robust advertising market conditions that Lachlan just described, coupled with stronger NFL ratings, the programming successes we have delivered at FOX Entertainment, a compelling 7-game World Series, and the introduction to the schedule of WWE Friday Night SmackDown.
EBITDA at our television segment decreased $200 million over the prior year as an increase in expenses of over $300 million more than offset strong revenue growth. The increase in expenses was due to the anticipated increase in sports programming amortization and production expenses, led by the NFL, along with the investments we have made in television segment programming. During the quarter, these investments included the premier of WWE, the expansion of original entertainment programming and our participation in co-production arrangements with third-party studios. 
Finally, from a P&L perspective, the net EBITDA loss in our other segment amounted to $81 million, which reflects a full quarter of stand-alone costs as opposed to the carve-out basis of presentation in the corresponding quarter of the prior year. 
Turning now to cash flow. Over the first 6 months of fiscal 2020, the company generated negative free cash flow of $366 million, which we calculate as net cash used in operating activities plus cash invested in property, plant and equipment. As a reminder, this anticipated use of capital reflects the typical seasonality you should expect to see in the business. Here, the first half of our fiscal year is impacted by the working capital deficit that results from the concentration of our annual sports rights payments and the recognized but yet to collect peak advertising revenues that are associated with our sports and entertainment programming in the full broadcast season. These factors will reverse in the second half of our fiscal year as we harvest cash from the collection on prior quarter's advertising revenues and payments for sports rights subside, resulting in a significant cash surplus. 
On a full year basis, we will benefit from the natural low working capital usage of our business along with our cash tax benefit, and we'll therefore convert a significant percentage of the company's EBITDA to free cash flow. 
From an overall balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with just under $2 billion in cash and $6.8 billion in debt. As Lachlan mentioned earlier, we have completed the initial $500 million stock repurchase goal that we outlined 3 months ago, comprising $350 million of Class A shares and $150 million of Class B shares. You will also have seen that we just declared our semi-annual dividend of $0.23 a share. 
Finally, as part of our balanced approach to capital allocation, we closed on the acquisition of a 67% stake in Credible Labs in early October. And with regulatory approvals now secured, we expect to soon close the previously announced Nexstar television stations transaction at a net purchase price of approximately $300 million. 
And with that, I would now like to turn the call back to Joe."

And you're right, when we said in the separation that our goals were different than we were at 21CF, it was because we now have the opportunity to use the full power leverage of both FOX Network and FOX news on a pricing standpoint and a full distribution standpoint. And your phrase of bargaining clout, those, as Lachlan referred to earlier, are the 2 most successful television channels in America right now. So we were able to use that to achieve multi-year pricing for those channels at levels that were at or above what we planned, and distribution fully with our distribution partners. So I think those were the 2 that we were really focused on."

We are absolutely still expecting to hit that number and cross that hurdle. So -- and that's factoring in the subscriber volume declines. So I think we're really doing a terrific job in driving those affiliate fees. 
In regards to Roku, as sort of widely reported last Friday, our distribution deal with Roku was expiring. We went through, frankly, a very normal course, sort of negotiation with them, not unlike the negotiations we have with all of our distributors. What happens in these negotiations, and often this is what becomes public, is both sides prepare for a non-resolution of the issues. But ultimately, they, like all of our distributors and platforms, saw the value of the FOX brands and content on their platform, and we were able to resolve our differences and agreed to a new agreement, really, I think, to mutual benefit. Throughout it all, it was very professional. We have a huge regard for Anthony Wood and his management team at Roku. We think they're doing a tremendous stake. They've positioned the company to really be one of the leading, if not the lead beneficiary of over-the-top streaming, and we are happy shareholders in the company. 
I think we're ready for the next question."

And obviously, not just at the FOX Network, but at FOX News as well. And the -- as I mentioned in my earlier comments, we see that ratings strength really just continuing. In fact last night, over the State of the Union broadcast, I think -- well, I know because I've seen the numbers, maybe many of you have already, but FOX News ratings were double the ratings of CNN and MSNBC combined. So it really is a tremendous performance. 
What we've been doing, and I think others have followed our lead, is working to build in as many advertising units as we can. This includes using the innovative use of, sort of, squeezing back advertising and having sort of a split screen sort of experience where you can cover some of the breaking news, while also showing the ad or the ad break. So we are gathering as much of that revenue as possible. 
I think the important note though around FOX News advertising is really the expansion in the number of marketers and partners that we have on FOX News. There's a growing sense in the market that if you want to reach Middle America, there's no better place than placing your brand, your advertising than on FOX News. So the advertising team is doing a tremendous job. And we expect to capture a significant amount of sort of the upside revenue as we run through this political season. And that's not to say, another that I haven't mentioned, the local stations, obviously, in California, we have 2 markets in Texas, where we have 3 markets, North Carolina, Virginia, Minnesota, and now with the addition soon of Wisconsin, we are very well placed in swing states where there'll be a significant amount of advertising spend towards this election."

So clearly, our audiences are engaging with our content. They're engaging with our content today in a number of different forms, not just broadcast. I mentioned in my earlier remarks, I think it was 11.7 million people watched the Super Bowl via streaming, our broadcast Super Bowl via streaming. And 70%, which is actually remarkable numbers, 70% of those -- of that 11.7 million watched it on platforms that we own. So I think we are already sort of progressing down that path. 
And I should also just call out Fox Nation, which is obviously a really excellent sort of direct-to-consumer product out of FOX News. 80% of the people who sample Fox Nation who take our free trial, 80% of them convert to paid subscribers.

And thanks, everyone, for joining us for our fiscal 2020 second quarter earnings call. We just reported an exceptional quarter, which really underscores the strength of Fox and our unique position in the market. Nowhere with that strength and uniqueness on greater display than this past weekend, culminating with our groundbreaking broadcast of Super Bowl LIV.
Let me say at the outset how pleased I am of the efforts of our entire company. Our people delivered a flawless broadcast of Sunday's game to more than 150 million unique viewers across the country, virtually guaranteeing its place as the most watched live television event of 2020. We surrounded the Super Bowl with an immersive and innovative programming lineup from Miami across FOX Sports, FOX News, FOX Sports 1 and our local stations. And we used this enormous platform to launch season 3 of The Masked Singer right after the game, which became TV's highest-rated reality telecast in 8 years.
On Sunday, Fox had the largest revenue day in TV history, generating around $600 million of gross revenue and providing an unmatched platform for over 100 advertisers from the pregame through The Masked Singer, and we delivered extraordinary ratings for our advertising, distribution and NFL partners. 
And while there's a massive amount of planning and activity that goes with broadcasting the Super Bowl, it has not been at the expense of delivering other imperatives for our business. During the first 6 months of the fiscal year, we have already achieved a substantial number of key operating milestones in support of Fox's growth and momentum. Among them were attaining #1 status for the FOX Network in broadcast and maintaining the #1 position of FOX News in all of cable; delivering a strong sports calendar to viewers and advertisers, particularly across baseball and football; launching the WWE; acquiring Credible; and activating FOX Bet. 
We announced the expansion of our local station footprint with the acquisition of 2 key local market stations. We completed a substantial number of major distribution deals in line with our expectations, including gaining carriage for FOX News and FOX Business on Sling, and we have delivered impressive financial results, led by revenue growth. 
This quarter, we've really knocked it out of the park. Steve will provide further color around the financial results shortly, but our first half results illustrate the power and importance of our brands to our partners and audiences, validating our strategy to build Fox around live sports, live news and event programming.
Overall, our top revenue -- our top line revenue is trending nicely. Total affiliate revenue increased by nearly 6% in the first 6 months of the fiscal year and our advertising markets, both national and local, are buoyant, as illustrated by the current scatter market, where we see pricing well over 20% higher than upfront levels. 
The strength of the television advertising market for us is at a level that we have not seen for some time. Across all of Fox, we are seeing growing demand because we are delivering sizable audiences for brands. 
At our national networks, categories that are leading this intensity include financial, insurance, the streamers, technology and foreign auto. At the local level, most of these same categories are prominent, except domestic autos are currently running ahead of foreign.
On the national news side of our business, FOX News and FOX Business are seeing a significant advertising client expansion across both our linear and digital advertising business, led by the financial and technology categories. The FOX News audience is increasingly sought after by more and more advertisers as they look to reach a large engaged audience, particularly across Middle America. This advertising strength is based, in large part, from delivering on a promise made last May at our upfront that FOX would Own the Fall across the entire FOX Network. Overall, the FOX Network took the top rating spot for the fall broadcast season, marking its first #1 finish in the 18 to 49 demographic in 10 years.
Additionally, Fox is the only network to achieve year-over-year gains in both total viewers and in the 18 to 49 demo. Fox also ranked as the #1 entertainment network in the fall in all viewers for the first time in our history, fueled by the success of The Masked Singer, 9-1-1 and the top new series, Prodigal Son. We're focused on sustaining this momentum in the second half of the year with the addition of the Deputy and 9-1-1: Lone Star, and non-scripted content like Gordon Ramsay's 24 Hours to Hell and Back, the third season of The Masked Singer and our newest show, LEGO Masters, which debuts tonight on Fox. I suggest watching with your whole family. It's truly great.
On the sports side of our business, we continue to drive unparalleled audiences to our signature programming. So far this fiscal year, FOX Sports has been home to the U.S. Women's National Soccer Team, a riveting 7-game World Series, the inaugural broadcast presentation of WWE SmackDown, an ambitious new college football strategy and the launch of our partnership with TSG and FOX Bet. And clearly, it was a great year for NFL Football on Fox, which culminated Sunday with the broadcast of Super Bowl LIV.
For the second year in a row, Fox was able to expand its audience for Thursday Night Football, college football Saturdays and NFL Sundays. In aggregate, total regular season football viewing on Fox, NFL and college football combined, was up 14% over 2018. It's worth noting that no other network was up more than half this level.
While the momentum we've seen at the broadcast network has been strong, equally as impressive is the performance of FOX News. FOX News finished calendar 2019 as a top-rated basic cable network across all cable networks for fourth year in a row, beating its nearest competitors by over 40% and achieving its highest-rated prime time in history.
Given the well-documented headwinds facing the broader cable industry, FOX News' ability to grow its audience over last year is a testament to the enduring power of the brand. The current news cycle continues to drive passionate viewers to FOX News, and it's hard to see that trend subsiding.
All of these achievements point to a simple fact: Fox is the home to both the top-rated broadcast network and the most viewed cable network, and that is an exciting position to be in. Equally exciting is to be the home of the 2 events that command the attention of the entire country in the same year. We started calendar 2020 with the first event, the broadcast of Super Bowl LIV on Fox. We now set our focus on the second event, the news equivalent of the Super Bowl, the presidential election.
FOX News' branded Democracy 2020 election coverage is already in full swing. If history is any guide, audience levels and engagement will build significantly as the cycle progresses through the upcoming primaries and caucuses, the conventions and the presidential debates, all culminating in our election night coverage across FOX News Media on Tuesday, November 3.
As we build towards November, the financial benefits are not limited to FOX News. We'll see a sizable ad revenue uplift at our local television stations. As referenced in calendar 2018, during the last midterm election, our stations collectively generated record gross political revenues in excess of $200 million, shattering the previous record set during the 2012 Obama/Romney election by 40%. 
Although we are very early in the political season, we are already seeing signs of further increased political spending, with a vast majority of the spend dedicated to the unmatched reach of television.
We saw it on Sunday, with spending in the Super Bowl on a national level. And we're already -- and we've already been seeing it at our local stations, which positions us to deliver a new record for political revenues in calendar 2020. Our confidence is further strengthened by the fact that we will soon be expanding our station footprint, which already includes stations in Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Virginia into another perennial swing state, Wisconsin, with the previously announced acquisition of the FOX affiliate in Milwaukee.
As you can tell, I'm thrilled with the rapid progress that we have made and the recognition of the great value of our networks by our distribution partners. As indicated earlier, we have achieved our goals in all the distribution renewals we have completed, which reflects the importance of our content to the market. But of course, we recognize that the trends in the paid subscriber universe has an impact on our business. As you know, we are dependent on our traditional and digital distribution partners and their business plans for our inclusion in their pay television retail offerings. And while I'm not going to predict where a normalized pay TV subscriber base ends up in the near to medium term, I know that this ecosystem will still be the largest component of our revenues for some time.
Nevertheless, we have begun allocating capital to expand our revenue base, while preserving our subscriber fee relationships into direct-to-consumer initiatives, which will grow in importance over time. FOX Nation, FOX Bet and Credible are 3 recent examples of this, but we continue to evaluate opportunities where Fox can bring unique value directly to consumers while sustaining existing business models.
Nonetheless, there is solid growth and momentum at the company's existing digital businesses, with total engagement increasing last quarter by over 40% versus the previous quarter. FOX News Digital had a record calendar 2019, beating CNN.com in both total views and minutes consumed. And for the first time, FOX News Digital averaged over 100 million unique Comscore monthly visitors.
FOX Sports also had a record digital year in calendar 2019, growing both total video views across streaming and social platforms and total minutes consumed by over 20%. It was also our highest streamed regular season for the NFL on Fox, with growth of 57% over last year. And to refer to the Super Bowl one more time, the game was the most streamed ever. 11.7 million users streamed all or part of the Super Bowl, and 70% of their consumption was on FOX-owned platforms.
While we have remain focused on executing against our operational plans and hitting our financial targets, we have also demonstrated how we look to deploy our capital through an appropriate balance of organic investment, strategic M&A and return of capital to our shareholders.
On the organic investment side, the previously announced $200 million to $250 million EBITDA investment began to ramp up this past quarter with the broadcast of WWE SmackDown and our investment in greater originality and coproduction rights at the FOX Network, along with investment in our digital initiatives, led by FOX Nation and the refresh of FOX Business.
In terms of strategic M&A, in October, we deployed approximately $260 million for the previously mentioned acquisition of Credible Labs. In the short time we've owned Credible Labs, we have seen the signs of the exceptional growth the business is capable of. For example, during calendar 2019, Credible more than doubled its cumulative registered user base and experienced record closed loan volume, both of which drove substantial top line revenue growth.
We have also committed around $300 million to acquire the Nexstar television stations in Seattle and Milwaukee, in exchange for our stations in Charlotte. We expect this deal to close in the next month or so. And our commitment to return capital to our shareholders remains an integral element of our capital allocation strategy. In addition to the just announced semiannual dividend, we have now finished the initial $500 million of share repurchases that we committed to when we announced the $2 billion authorization 3 months ago.
As we have consistently noted, we remain committed to deploying capital in a disciplined manner to maximize shareholder value through this balanced approach. Now I will turn the call over to Steve to provide more detail on our financial results."
546623668,650949629,1905442,"Fox Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2020",2020-02-05,"Earnings Calls","Fox Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. As you just heard, our operating momentum continued in the second quarter, and we continue to exceed the internal goals that we commenced the year with. This past quarter, we delivered strong top line growth, led by an",1398,"Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. As you just heard, our operating momentum continued in the second quarter, and we continue to exceed the internal goals that we commenced the year with. This past quarter, we delivered strong top line growth, led by an increase in total affiliate revenue of 7%. We achieved this growth despite aggregate industry pay TV subscribers continuing to decline at a rate in excess of 4% over calendar year 2019.
During this period, the losses across traditional distributors, many of whom reported last week, were at least partially offset by continued growth of digital MVPDs, where subscribers have grown 2.3 million. In this past quarter, we saw digital MVPDs grow by over 1.5 million, representing sequential quarterly growth of over 20%.
As we have highlighted in the past, the natural seasonality of our business means the second quarter is traditionally the low watermark from an EBITDA margin standpoint. This is primarily due to the timing of broadcast, sports and entertainment expenses that are concentrated in the fall season. This includes the investments in sports and entertainment content of the FOX Network, which, as we have previously outlined, set us up well to complete our remaining distribution renewals in this cycle and achieve our longer-term financial targets.
Let me now take you through our second quarter results, and along the way, remind you of some key factors that shape the remainder of our fiscal year.
In the second quarter, the company reported total revenues of $3.78 billion, up 5% over the comparative period in fiscal 2019, reflecting revenue growth across all operating segments. EBITDA was $261 million, which compares to the $445 million generated in the prior year period, as growth at the cable segment was more than offset by lower operating results for the television segment and the impact of corporate expenses at the other segment now being reported on an actual basis. The latter reflects the costs of Fox operating as a stand-alone public company in the current year quarter versus the presentation of carve-out financial statements in the prior year.
From a bottom line perspective, net income attributable to stockholders of $300 million or $0.48 per share was higher than the $8 million or $0.01 per share in the prior year quarter. This growth was primarily due to the change in fair value of the company's investments recognized in other net, including the Stars Group and Roku, which together have a current market value of approximately $1.1 billion.
Excluding this impact and other onetime items, adjusted EPS of $0.10 was down compared to last year's $0.43 per share, reflecting the change in EBITDA and interest expense, which as we have flagged in the past, now reflects the amount associated with operating as a stand-alone company.
So now turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter, where cable network EBITDA of $556 million was up 7% on revenue growth of 2%. Cable affiliate revenues increased 2% as the impact of higher average rates across essentially all of our brands was partially offset by the net decrease in pay television subscribers that I mentioned earlier. Assuming current subscriber volume trends continue, we continue to anticipate modestly accelerating growth in cable affiliate revenue in the second half of the fiscal year as the full impact of rate resets from recent renegotiations begin to take effect.
Cable advertising revenues decreased 5% due to few units at FOX News Media, including higher preemptions associated with its breaking news coverage of the impeachment hearings; and the absence of the UFC programming at the national sports networks. These impacts were partially offset by strong results from our coverage of the MLB American League Championship Series between New York Yankees and Houston Astros on FOX Sports 1.
Cable other revenues grew by $32 million. This increase was driven by higher sports sublicensing revenue and pay-per-view boxing revenues associated with the heavyweight bout between Wilder and Ortiz as well as subscription revenues from FOX Nation.
EBITDA in our cable segment increased 7% over the prior year, reflecting these higher revenues while costs were essentially held flat. From a cost perspective, savings from our nonrenewal of UFC programming were offset by the contractual increases on existing sports rights agreements at the national sports networks, along with higher costs at FOX News Media, which includes our investment in digital.
It is worth noting that we anticipate elevated growth in cable segment expenses in our fiscal third quarter versus the prior year. This is driven by increased costs at our national sports networks, reflecting both contractual increases for our sports rights and the production costs of the shoulder programming around the broadcast of Super Bowl LIV. It also includes increased costs at FOX News Media related to our coverage of the presidential election and continued investment in Fox Nation.
The television segment reported an EBITDA loss of $214 million, higher than the loss of $14 million in the prior year quarter on revenue growth of 5%. The revenue growth was led by an 18% increase in television affiliate revenues, reflecting double-digit programming fee growth from non-owned station affiliates and double-digit direct retransmission revenue growth at our owned and operated stations.
Television advertising revenues in the quarter increased $39 million or 2%. This was achieved despite us lapping the record political advertising revenues at our owned and operated stations from the midterm elections in the prior year quarter. This result was underpinned by the very robust advertising market conditions that Lachlan just described, coupled with stronger NFL ratings, the programming successes we have delivered at FOX Entertainment, a compelling 7-game World Series, and the introduction to the schedule of WWE Friday Night SmackDown.
EBITDA at our television segment decreased $200 million over the prior year as an increase in expenses of over $300 million more than offset strong revenue growth. The increase in expenses was due to the anticipated increase in sports programming amortization and production expenses, led by the NFL, along with the investments we have made in television segment programming. During the quarter, these investments included the premier of WWE, the expansion of original entertainment programming and our participation in co-production arrangements with third-party studios.
Finally, from a P&L perspective, the net EBITDA loss in our other segment amounted to $81 million, which reflects a full quarter of stand-alone costs as opposed to the carve-out basis of presentation in the corresponding quarter of the prior year. 
Turning now to cash flow. Over the first 6 months of fiscal 2020, the company generated negative free cash flow of $366 million, which we calculate as net cash used in operating activities plus cash invested in property, plant and equipment. As a reminder, this anticipated use of capital reflects the typical seasonality you should expect to see in the business. Here, the first half of our fiscal year is impacted by the working capital deficit that results from the concentration of our annual sports rights payments and the recognized but yet to collect peak advertising revenues that are associated with our sports and entertainment programming in the full broadcast season. These factors will reverse in the second half of our fiscal year as we harvest cash from the collection on prior quarter's advertising revenues and payments for sports rights subside, resulting in a significant cash surplus.
On a full year basis, we will benefit from the natural low working capital usage of our business along with our cash tax benefit, and we'll therefore convert a significant percentage of the company's EBITDA to free cash flow.
From an overall balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with just under $2 billion in cash and $6.8 billion in debt. As Lachlan mentioned earlier, we have completed the initial $500 million stock repurchase goal that we outlined 3 months ago, comprising $350 million of Class A shares and $150 million of Class B shares. You will also have seen that we just declared our semi-annual dividend of $0.23 a share. 
Finally, as part of our balanced approach to capital allocation, we closed on the acquisition of a 67% stake in Credible Labs in early October. And with regulatory approvals now secured, we expect to soon close the previously announced Nexstar television stations transaction at a net purchase price of approximately $300 million.
And with that, I would now like to turn the call back to Joe."

And your phrase of bargaining clout, those, as Lachlan referred to earlier, are the 2 most successful television channels in America right now. So we were able to use that to achieve multi-year pricing for those channels at levels that were at or above what we planned and distribution fully with our distribution partners. So I think those were the 2 that we were really focused on."

So -- and that's factoring in the subscriber volume declines. So I think we're really doing a terrific job in driving those affiliate fees.
In regards to Roku, as sort of widely reported last Friday, our distribution deal with Roku was expiring. We went through, frankly, a very normal course sort of negotiation with them, not unlike the negotiations we have with all of our distributors. What happens in these negotiations, and often this is what becomes public, is both sides prepare for a non-resolution of the issues. But ultimately, they, like all of our distributors and platforms, saw the value of the FOX brands and content on their platform, and we were able to resolve our differences and agreed to a new agreement, really, I think, to mutual benefit. Throughout it all, it was very professional. We have a huge regard for Anthony Wood and his management team at Roku. We think they're doing a tremendous stake. They've positioned the company to really be one of the leading, if not the lead beneficiary of over-the-top streaming, and we are happy shareholders in the company.
I think we're ready for the next question."

And obviously, not just at the FOX Network, but at FOX News as well. And the -- as I mentioned in my earlier comments, we see that ratings strength really just continuing. In fact last night, over the State of the Union broadcast, I think -- well, I know because I've seen the numbers, maybe many of you have already, but FOX News ratings were double the ratings of CNN and MSNBC combined. So it really is a tremendous performance.
What we've been doing, and I think others have followed our lead, is working to build in as many advertising units as we can. This includes using the innovative use of, sort of, squeezing back advertising and having sort of a split screen sort of experience where you can cover some breaking news, while also showing the ad or the ad break. So we are gathering as much of that revenue as possible.
I think the important note though around FOX News advertising is really the expansion in the number of marketers and partners that we have on FOX News. There's a growing sense in the market that if you want to reach Middle America, there's no better place than placing your brand, your advertising than on FOX News. So the advertising team is doing a tremendous job. And we expect to capture a significant amount of sort of the upside revenue as we run through this political season. And that's not to say, that I haven't mentioned it, the local stations, obviously, in California, we have 2 markets; in Texas, where we have 3 markets; North Carolina; Virginia; Minnesota and now with the addition soon of Wisconsin, we are very well placed in swing states, where there'll be a significant amount of advertising spend towards this election."

And our strengths are very clearly live news, live sports and big event entertainment programming. And if we -- you asked, do we have what we need to succeed in those sectors? Whether it's on broadcast or in a direct-to-consumer experience, we have 2 of the most watched channels in America, the #1 broadcast network and the #1 cable channel. So clearly, our audiences are engaging with our content. They're engaging with our content today in a number of different forms, not just broadcast. I mentioned in my earlier remarks, I think it was 11.7 million people watched the Super Bowl via streaming, our broadcast Super Bowl via streaming. And 70%, which is actually remarkable numbers, 70% of those -- of that 11.7 million watched it on platforms that we own. So I think we are already sort of progressing down that path.
And I should also just call out Fox Nation, which is obviously a really excellent sort of direct-to-consumer product out of FOX News. 80% of the people who sample Fox Nation, who take our free trial, 80% of them convert to paid subscribers. And December and January were the 2 highest months in history in terms of both subscriber acquisition, but also, and just as importantly, in terms of engagement on the platform. So we're really very happy with how Fox Nation is progressing as well."

But what has to happen in the broader environment for that to become an interesting pivot for the company?
And if I could, I was just going to ask John and [indiscernible] question, you had Masked Singer on last year, second half of the season as well. So you're starting to comp year-over-year on that.

But of course, you've seen a lot of advertising already starting to come in from the Democratic side. It's relatively short. And I think it was reported, the Bloomberg campaign has expected to sort of double its advertising spend earlier this week, but the Bloomberg campaign is buying on a week-to-week basis.

And thanks, everyone, for joining us for our fiscal 2020 second quarter earnings call. We just reported an exceptional quarter, which really underscores the strength of Fox and our unique position in the market. Nowhere with t",2009,"Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon. And thanks, everyone, for joining us for our fiscal 2020 second quarter earnings call. We just reported an exceptional quarter, which really underscores the strength of Fox and our unique position in the market. Nowhere with that strength and uniqueness on greater display than this past weekend, culminating with our groundbreaking broadcast of Super Bowl LIV.
Let me say at the outset how pleased I am of the efforts of our entire company. Our people delivered a flawless broadcast of Sunday's game to more than 150 million unique viewers across the country, virtually guaranteeing its place as the most watched live television event of 2020. We surrounded the Super Bowl with an immersive and innovative programming lineup from Miami across FOX Sports, FOX News, FOX Sports 1 and our local stations. And we used this enormous platform to launch season 3 of The Masked Singer right after the game, which became TV's highest-rated reality telecast in 8 years.
On Sunday, Fox had the largest revenue day in TV history, generating around $600 million of gross revenue and providing an unmatched platform for over 100 advertisers from the pregame through The Masked Singer, and we delivered extraordinary ratings for our advertising, distribution and NFL partners. 
And while there's a massive amount of planning and activity that goes with broadcasting the Super Bowl, it has not been at the expense of delivering other imperatives for our business. During the first 6 months of the fiscal year, we have already achieved a substantial number of key operating milestones in support of Fox's growth and momentum. Among them were attaining #1 status for the FOX Network in broadcast and maintaining the #1 position of FOX News in all of cable; delivering a strong sports calendar to viewers and advertisers, particularly across baseball and football; launching the WWE; acquiring Credible; and activating FOX Bet. 
We announced the expansion of our local station footprint with the acquisition of 2 key local market stations. We completed a substantial number of major distribution deals in line with our expectations, including gaining carriage for FOX News and FOX Business on Sling, and we have delivered impressive financial results, led by revenue growth. 
This quarter, we've really knocked it out of the park. Steve will provide further color around the financial results shortly, but our first half results illustrate the power and importance of our brands to our partners and audiences, validating our strategy to build Fox around live sports, live news and event programming.
Overall, our top revenue -- our top line revenue is trending nicely. Total affiliate revenue increased by nearly 6% in the first 6 months of the fiscal year and our advertising markets, both national and local, are buoyant, as illustrated by the current scatter market, where we see pricing well over 20% higher than upfront levels. 
The strength of the television advertising market for us is at a level that we have not seen for some time. Across all of Fox, we are seeing growing demand because we are delivering sizable audiences for brands. 
At our national networks, categories that are leading this intensity include financial, insurance, the streamers, technology and foreign auto. At the local level, most of these same categories are prominent, except domestic autos are currently running ahead of foreign.
On the national news side of our business, FOX News and FOX Business are seeing a significant advertising client expansion across both our linear and digital advertising business, led by the financial and technology categories. The FOX News audience is increasingly sought after by more and more advertisers as they look to reach a large engaged audience, particularly across Middle America. This advertising strength is based, in large part, from delivering on a promise made last May at our upfront that FOX would Own the Fall across the entire FOX Network. Overall, the FOX Network took the top rating spot for the fall broadcast season, marking its first #1 finish in the 18 to 49 demographic in 10 years.
Additionally, Fox is the only network to achieve year-over-year gains in both total viewers and in the 18 to 49 demo. Fox also ranked as the #1 entertainment network in the fall in all viewers for the first time in our history, fueled by the success of The Masked Singer, 9-1-1 and the top new series, Prodigal Son. We're focused on sustaining this momentum in the second half of the year with the addition of the Deputy and 9-1-1: Lone Star, and non-scripted content like Gordon Ramsay's 24 Hours to Hell and Back, the third season of The Masked Singer and our newest show, LEGO Masters, which debuts tonight on Fox. I suggest watching with your whole family. It's truly great.
On the sports side of our business, we continue to drive unparalleled audiences to our signature programming. So far this fiscal year, FOX Sports has been home to the U.S. Women's National Soccer Team, a riveting 7-game World Series, the inaugural broadcast presentation of WWE SmackDown, an ambitious new college football strategy and the launch of our partnership with TSG and FOX Bet. And clearly, it was a great year for NFL Football on Fox, which culminated Sunday with the broadcast of Super Bowl LIV.
For the second year in a row, Fox was able to expand its audience for Thursday Night Football, college football Saturdays and NFL Sundays. In aggregate, total regular season football viewing on Fox, NFL and college football combined, was up 14% over 2018. It's worth noting that no other network was up more than half this level.
While the momentum we've seen at the broadcast network has been strong, equally as impressive is the performance of FOX News. FOX News finished calendar 2019 as a top-rated basic cable network across all cable networks for fourth year in a row, beating its nearest competitors by over 40% and achieving its highest-rated prime time in history.
Given the well-documented headwinds facing the broader cable industry, FOX News' ability to grow its audience over last year is a testament to the enduring power of the brand. The current news cycle continues to drive passionate viewers to FOX News, and it's hard to see that trend subsiding.
All of these achievements point to a simple fact: Fox is the home to both the top-rated broadcast network and the most viewed cable network, and that is an exciting position to be in. Equally exciting is to be the home of the 2 events that command the attention of the entire country in the same year. We started calendar 2020 with the first event, the broadcast of Super Bowl LIV on Fox. We now set our focus on the second event, the news equivalent of the Super Bowl, the presidential election.
FOX News' branded Democracy 2020 election coverage is already in full swing. If history is any guide, audience levels and engagement will build significantly as the cycle progresses through the upcoming primaries and caucuses, the conventions and the presidential debates, all culminating in our election night coverage across FOX News Media on Tuesday, November 3.
As we build towards November, the financial benefits are not limited to FOX News. We'll see a sizable ad revenue uplift at our local television stations. As referenced in calendar 2018, during the last midterm election, our stations collectively generated record gross political revenues in excess of $200 million, shattering the previous record set during the 2012 Obama/Romney election by 40%. 
Although we are very early in the political season, we are already seeing signs of further increased political spending, with a vast majority of the spend dedicated to the unmatched reach of television.
We saw it on Sunday, with spending in the Super Bowl on a national level. And we're already -- and we've already been seeing it at our local stations, which positions us to deliver a new record for political revenues in calendar 2020. Our confidence is further strengthened by the fact that we will soon be expanding our station footprint, which already includes stations in Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Virginia into another perennial swing state, Wisconsin, with the previously announced acquisition of the FOX affiliate in Milwaukee.
As you can tell, I'm thrilled with the rapid progress that we have made and the recognition of the great value of our networks by our distribution partners. As indicated earlier, we have achieved our goals in all the distribution renewals we have completed, which reflects the importance of our content to the market. But of course, we recognize that the trends in the paid subscriber universe has an impact on our business. As you know, we are dependent on our traditional and digital distribution partners and their business plans for our inclusion in their pay television retail offerings. And while I'm not going to predict where a normalized pay TV subscriber base ends up in the near to medium term, I know that this ecosystem will still be the largest component of our revenues for some time.
Nevertheless, we have begun allocating capital to expand our revenue base, while preserving our subscriber fee relationships into direct-to-consumer initiatives, which will grow in importance over time. FOX Nation, FOX Bet and Credible are 3 recent examples of this, but we continue to evaluate opportunities where Fox can bring unique value directly to consumers while sustaining existing business models.
Nonetheless, there is solid growth and momentum at the company's existing digital businesses, with total engagement increasing last quarter by over 40% versus the previous quarter. FOX News Digital had a record calendar 2019, beating CNN.com in both total views and minutes consumed. And for the first time, FOX News Digital averaged over 100 million unique Comscore monthly visitors.
FOX Sports also had a record digital year in calendar 2019, growing both total video views across streaming and social platforms and total minutes consumed by over 20%. It was also our highest streamed regular season for the NFL on Fox, with growth of 57% over last year. And to refer to the Super Bowl one more time, the game was the most streamed ever. 11.7 million users streamed all or part of the Super Bowl, and 70% of their consumption was on FOX-owned platforms.
While we have remain focused on executing against our operational plans and hitting our financial targets, we have also demonstrated how we look to deploy our capital through an appropriate balance of organic investment, strategic M&A and return of capital to our shareholders.
On the organic investment side, the previously announced $200 million to $250 million EBITDA investment began to ramp up this past quarter with the broadcast of WWE SmackDown and our investment in greater originality and coproduction rights at the FOX Network, along with investment in our digital initiatives, led by FOX Nation and the refresh of FOX Business.
In terms of strategic M&A, in October, we deployed approximately $260 million for the previously mentioned acquisition of Credible Labs. In the short time we've owned Credible Labs, we have seen the signs of the exceptional growth the business is capable of. For example, during calendar 2019, Credible more than doubled its cumulative registered user base and experienced record closed loan volume, both of which drove substantial top line revenue growth.
We have also committed around $300 million to acquire the Nexstar television stations in Seattle and Milwaukee, in exchange for our stations in Charlotte. We expect this deal to close in the next month or so. And our commitment to return capital to our shareholders remains an integral element of our capital allocation strategy. In addition to the just announced semiannual dividend, we have now finished the initial $500 million of share repurchases that we committed to when we announced the $2 billion authorization 3 months ago.
As we have consistently noted, we remain committed to deploying capital in a disciplined manner to maximize shareholder value through this balanced approach. Now I will turn the call over to Steve to provide more detail on our financial results."
546623668,650949629,1909759,"Fox Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2020",2020-02-05,"Earnings Calls","Fox Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. As you just heard, our operating momentum continued in the second quarter, and we continue to exceed the internal goals that we commenced the year with. This past quarter, we delivered strong top line growth, led by an",1398,"Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. As you just heard, our operating momentum continued in the second quarter, and we continue to exceed the internal goals that we commenced the year with. This past quarter, we delivered strong top line growth, led by an increase in total affiliate revenue of 7%. We achieved this growth despite aggregate industry pay TV subscribers continuing to decline at a rate in excess of 4% over calendar year 2019.
During this period, the losses across traditional distributors, many of whom reported last week, were at least partially offset by continued growth of digital MVPDs, where subscribers have grown 2.3 million. In this past quarter, we saw digital MVPDs grow by over 1.5 million, representing sequential quarterly growth of over 20%.
As we have highlighted in the past, the natural seasonality of our business means the second quarter is traditionally the low watermark from an EBITDA margin standpoint. This is primarily due to the timing of broadcast, sports and entertainment expenses that are concentrated in the fall season. This includes the investments in sports and entertainment content of the FOX Network, which, as we have previously outlined, set us up well to complete our remaining distribution renewals in this cycle and achieve our longer-term financial targets.
Let me now take you through our second quarter results, and along the way, remind you of some key factors that shape the remainder of our fiscal year.
In the second quarter, the company reported total revenues of $3.78 billion, up 5% over the comparative period in fiscal 2019, reflecting revenue growth across all operating segments. EBITDA was $261 million, which compares to the $445 million generated in the prior year period, as growth at the cable segment was more than offset by lower operating results for the television segment and the impact of corporate expenses at the other segment now being reported on an actual basis. The latter reflects the costs of Fox operating as a stand-alone public company in the current year quarter versus the presentation of carve-out financial statements in the prior year.
From a bottom line perspective, net income attributable to stockholders of $300 million or $0.48 per share was higher than the $8 million or $0.01 per share in the prior year quarter. This growth was primarily due to the change in fair value of the company's investments recognized in other net, including the Stars Group and Roku, which together have a current market value of approximately $1.1 billion.
Excluding this impact and other onetime items, adjusted EPS of $0.10 was down compared to last year's $0.43 per share, reflecting the change in EBITDA and interest expense, which as we have flagged in the past, now reflects the amount associated with operating as a stand-alone company.
So now turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter, where cable network EBITDA of $556 million was up 7% on revenue growth of 2%. Cable affiliate revenues increased 2% as the impact of higher average rates across essentially all of our brands was partially offset by the net decrease in pay television subscribers that I mentioned earlier. Assuming current subscriber volume trends continue, we continue to anticipate modestly accelerating growth in cable affiliate revenue in the second half of the fiscal year as the full impact of rate resets from recent renegotiations begin to take effect.
Cable advertising revenues decreased 5% due to few units at FOX News Media, including higher preemptions associated with its breaking news coverage of the impeachment hearings; and the absence of the UFC programming at the national sports networks. These impacts were partially offset by strong results from our coverage of the MLB American League Championship Series between New York Yankees and Houston Astros on FOX Sports 1.
Cable other revenues grew by $32 million. This increase was driven by higher sports sublicensing revenue and pay-per-view boxing revenues associated with the heavyweight bout between Wilder and Ortiz as well as subscription revenues from FOX Nation.
EBITDA in our cable segment increased 7% over the prior year, reflecting these higher revenues while costs were essentially held flat. From a cost perspective, savings from our nonrenewal of UFC programming were offset by the contractual increases on existing sports rights agreements at the national sports networks, along with higher costs at FOX News Media, which includes our investment in digital.
It is worth noting that we anticipate elevated growth in cable segment expenses in our fiscal third quarter versus the prior year. This is driven by increased costs at our national sports networks, reflecting both contractual increases for our sports rights and the production costs of the shoulder programming around the broadcast of Super Bowl LIV. It also includes increased costs at FOX News Media related to our coverage of the presidential election and continued investment in Fox Nation.
The television segment reported an EBITDA loss of $214 million, higher than the loss of $14 million in the prior year quarter on revenue growth of 5%. The revenue growth was led by an 18% increase in television affiliate revenues, reflecting double-digit programming fee growth from non-owned station affiliates and double-digit direct retransmission revenue growth at our owned and operated stations.
Television advertising revenues in the quarter increased $39 million or 2%. This was achieved despite us lapping the record political advertising revenues at our owned and operated stations from the midterm elections in the prior year quarter. This result was underpinned by the very robust advertising market conditions that Lachlan just described, coupled with stronger NFL ratings, the programming successes we have delivered at FOX Entertainment, a compelling 7-game World Series, and the introduction to the schedule of WWE Friday Night SmackDown.
EBITDA at our television segment decreased $200 million over the prior year as an increase in expenses of over $300 million more than offset strong revenue growth. The increase in expenses was due to the anticipated increase in sports programming amortization and production expenses, led by the NFL, along with the investments we have made in television segment programming. During the quarter, these investments included the premier of WWE, the expansion of original entertainment programming and our participation in co-production arrangements with third-party studios.
Finally, from a P&L perspective, the net EBITDA loss in our other segment amounted to $81 million, which reflects a full quarter of stand-alone costs as opposed to the carve-out basis of presentation in the corresponding quarter of the prior year. 
Turning now to cash flow. Over the first 6 months of fiscal 2020, the company generated negative free cash flow of $366 million, which we calculate as net cash used in operating activities plus cash invested in property, plant and equipment. As a reminder, this anticipated use of capital reflects the typical seasonality you should expect to see in the business. Here, the first half of our fiscal year is impacted by the working capital deficit that results from the concentration of our annual sports rights payments and the recognized but yet to collect peak advertising revenues that are associated with our sports and entertainment programming in the full broadcast season. These factors will reverse in the second half of our fiscal year as we harvest cash from the collection on prior quarter's advertising revenues and payments for sports rights subside, resulting in a significant cash surplus.
On a full year basis, we will benefit from the natural low working capital usage of our business along with our cash tax benefit, and we'll therefore convert a significant percentage of the company's EBITDA to free cash flow.
From an overall balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with just under $2 billion in cash and $6.8 billion in debt. As Lachlan mentioned earlier, we have completed the initial $500 million stock repurchase goal that we outlined 3 months ago, comprising $350 million of Class A shares and $150 million of Class B shares. You will also have seen that we just declared our semi-annual dividend of $0.23 a share. 
Finally, as part of our balanced approach to capital allocation, we closed on the acquisition of a 67% stake in Credible Labs in early October. And with regulatory approvals now secured, we expect to soon close the previously announced Nexstar television stations transaction at a net purchase price of approximately $300 million.
And with that, I would now like to turn the call back to Joe."

And then secondly, I believe you still own 5% stake in Roku. Could you talk about how that asset fits in with your capital allocation scheme, especially in light of what happened last week with the impasse you guys had with Roku?"

And you're right, when we said in the separation that our goals were different than we were at 21CF, it was because we now have the opportunity to use the full power and leverage of both FOX Network and FOX news on a pricing standpoint and a full distribution standpoint. And your phrase of bargaining clout, those, as Lachlan referred to earlier, are the 2 most successful television channels in America right now. So we were able to use that to achieve multi-year pricing for those channels at levels that were at or above what we planned and distribution fully with our distribution partners. So I think those were the 2 that we were really focused on."

So -- and that's factoring in the subscriber volume declines. So I think we're really doing a terrific job in driving those affiliate fees.
In regards to Roku, as sort of widely reported last Friday, our distribution deal with Roku was expiring. We went through, frankly, a very normal course sort of negotiation with them, not unlike the negotiations we have with all of our distributors. What happens in these negotiations, and often this is what becomes public, is both sides prepare for a non-resolution of the issues. But ultimately, they, like all of our distributors and platforms, saw the value of the FOX brands and content on their platform, and we were able to resolve our differences and agreed to a new agreement, really, I think, to mutual benefit. Throughout it all, it was very professional. We have a huge regard for Anthony Wood and his management team at Roku. We think they're doing a tremendous stake. They've positioned the company to really be one of the leading, if not the lead beneficiary of over-the-top streaming, and we are happy shareholders in the company.
I think we're ready for the next question."

And obviously, not just at the FOX Network, but at FOX News as well. And the -- as I mentioned in my earlier comments, we see that ratings strength really just continuing. In fact last night, over the State of the Union broadcast, I think -- well, I know because I've seen the numbers, maybe many of you have already, but FOX News ratings were double the ratings of CNN and MSNBC combined. So it really is a tremendous performance.
What we've been doing, and I think others have followed our lead, is working to build in as many advertising units as we can. This includes using the innovative use of, sort of, squeezing back advertising and having sort of a split screen sort of experience where you can cover some breaking news, while also showing the ad or the ad break. So we are gathering as much of that revenue as possible.
I think the important note though around FOX News advertising is really the expansion in the number of marketers and partners that we have on FOX News. There's a growing sense in the market that if you want to reach Middle America, there's no better place than placing your brand, your advertising than on FOX News. So the advertising team is doing a tremendous job. And we expect to capture a significant amount of sort of the upside revenue as we run through this political season. And that's not to say, that I haven't mentioned it, the local stations, obviously, in California, we have 2 markets; in Texas, where we have 3 markets; North Carolina; Virginia; Minnesota and now with the addition soon of Wisconsin, we are very well placed in swing states, where there'll be a significant amount of advertising spend towards this election."

Whether it's on broadcast or in a direct-to-consumer experience, we have 2 of the most watched channels in America, the #1 broadcast network and the #1 cable channel. So clearly, our audiences are engaging with our content. They're engaging with our content today in a number of different forms, not just broadcast. I mentioned in my earlier remarks, I think it was 11.7 million people watched the Super Bowl via streaming, our broadcast Super Bowl via streaming. And 70%, which is actually remarkable numbers, 70% of those -- of that 11.7 million watched it on platforms that we own. So I think we are already sort of progressing down that path.
And I should also just call out Fox Nation, which is obviously a really excellent sort of direct-to-consumer product out of FOX News. 80% of the people who sample Fox Nation, who take our free trial, 80% of them convert to paid subscribers.

Good afternoon, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We are living through extraordinary times. Since we last all spoke together, who would have imagined our lives could have all been turned so upside down. The impact of COVID-19 has impacted our economy, our businesses, our colleagues and ourselves. We owe deep gratitude to the nurses, doctors, police, teachers, aged care workers, volunteers and countless other frontline workers for their incredible and brave sacrifices. At Fox, we thank every one of them. Their work humbles ours. 
We have spent these last few months protecting the health of our employees, providing essential news, information and entertainment to our communities, all while bolstering the strength of our company in order to best tackle the challenges ahead. At the outset, let me say that if there is anything you take away from my remarks today, it should be that Fox is in a strong position to deal with the impact of this pandemic. Our strength was clearly demonstrated in the quarter, which was only partially impacted by the pandemic and is illustrative of the outstanding results FOX delivers in unaffected cycles. The strength of Fox has also been on display in the weeks since the end of the quarter as we navigate these unprecedented times to continue to provide our services to communities across the country. 
Starting with a review of our third quarter, you will have seen that we delivered exceptional financial results, achieving revenue and EBITDA growth of 25% and 20%, respectively, adjusted earnings per share growth of 22% and generating over $1.5 billion of free cash flow. Our revenue growth was multipronged. It feels like a lifetime ago, but as a reminder, the quarter began with our record-breaking broadcast of Super Bowl 54, where we generated around $600 million of gross revenue across the company. But the strength in the quarter extended well beyond the Super Bowl. Local advertising at the FOX Television stations grew by over 20% as Super Bowl revenues were supplemented with over $35 million of gross political ad revenues in the quarter. 
At Fox News, advertising revenues grew by 15%, led by a 45% increase in digital ad revenues. And we had another strong affiliate quarter with total company affiliate revenues growing by 10%, despite a touch over 5% reduction in pay TV subscribers. Steve will cover the details of our financial results shortly. 
Operationally, the quarters of Fox News and Fox Business delivered their largest audiences in each network's history with FOX News ratings up approximately 40% year-on-year. The success of Fox News Media's brands extended beyond their linear properties. Fox News Digital achieved its highest quarter ever across all KPIs, including over 11 billion digital page views. Company-wide digital reach grew 42%, while digital engagement nearly doubled year-on-year. 
Elsewhere on screens, the quarter brought us another successful season of The Masked Singer and the #1 new broadcast reality series, the family-friendly hit, Lego Masters, 2 shows that we hope will shape the Fox Network lineup for years to come. While still early days, our strategy to leverage the cross promotional power of our platform to support shows we have an ownership interest in, is showing encouraging results. Bless The Heart was the #1 new comedy and adds another leg to our Sunday Animation Block, while Prodigal Son was the second highest-rated new scripted drama on television. 
Locally, the FOX television stations continued the expansion of their news coverage, adding an additional 5 hours per week across Atlanta and Los Angeles. The station's unified programming strategy drove ratings growth in essentially every day part, including [indiscernible] and Latent News. Corporately, during the past quarter, we completed important transactions to support the ongoing growth and momentum of Fox. Among them were the closing of our agreement with Nexstar in which we expanded our local market footprint through the acquisition of key stations in Seattle and Milwaukee, and the transfer of our [indiscernible] stations to them. The early renewal of our distribution agreement with one of our largest partners, Comcast, and our full portfolio of channels. And the announcement and subsequent closing of our acquisition of Tubi, which immediately expands our direct-to-consumer capabilities and provides our advertisers with even more opportunities to reach audiences at great scale. 
Coupled with the combined power of Fox's existing networks, Tubi provides a substantial base from which we will drive long-term growth in the direct-to-consumer market. As an example of the scale, in April, Tubi generated total viewing time of over 200 million hours, which is up more than 150% versus prior year. This was also the first full quarter reflecting the results of Credible, our digital loan marketplace business. And while we are only just at the beginning of exploring the marketing synergies between Fox and Credible, the business has had a great quarter, doubling its closed loan volume and revenue year-on-year. 
Overall, the financial and operating results through the first 9 months of the year confirms just how sturdy our business is and demonstrates the power and importance of our live sports, news and event programming to our partners and our audiences. Of course, our achievements have been rightly overshadowed by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and by the challenges it has presented to all of the company's stakeholders, including our colleagues, the communities we serve, our business partners and our shareholders. 
We understand our responsibility to each stakeholder and are mindful of them in the balanced actions we are taking to address the crisis. As I mentioned earlier, our main priority remains the health, safety and well-being of our more than 8,000 colleagues. We continue to follow federal, state and local guidelines when it comes to our workforce in our locations across the U.S. Those whose job functions allow it have been working remotely since mid-March. And we have over 70% of our employees off-site at the moment. We are grateful to those essential employees whose jobs remain -- require them to work on-site for their commitment and for their resolve. 
We have taken actions to protect and ensure the well-being of these employees, particularly for those that are out in the community, informing the country of every aspect of the pandemic at a national and local level. While taking steps to keep our colleagues safe, we also continue to provide our viewers with the information they seek to better understand this pandemic on a national and local basis. In this spirit, we swiftly launched coronavirusnow.com, a free to use website featuring the latest news about the pandemic. Drawn on our news gathering and digital capabilities across the country, bolstered by third-party content from government and health organizations such as the Center for Disease Control, we've created the site to provide our employees, viewers and communities with reliable up-to-date information about this public health issue. 
Over 1.3 million Americans have accessed these specific resources. It's a wonderful example of the breadth of Fox coming together to provide a public service to our audiences at a critical time and in a new and distinctive way. Further, working with our distribution partners to ensure that all Americans could receive the latest national and local news regarding coronavirus, we offered free access to the FOX News channel and Fox Television stations starting in mid-March and continuing for over a month. We are doing impactful work across our platforms to inform our viewers and to give back to our audiences. 
Fox raised over $13 million for Feeding America and the first responders, Children's Foundation, through our broadcast of Fox Versant, the iHeart Living Room Concert for America, which paid tribute to the brave medical professionals and local heroes who are working on so many aspects of the pandemic. In early April, Fox News and Facebook cohosted a coronavirus town hall, featuring medical and business experts, including members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. Fox News and Facebook jointly donated $1 million to Feeding America's COVID-19 Response fund. In partnership with NASCAR and with the NFL, Fox Sports donated to Feed The Children, the American Red Cross and Feeding America. Fox Sports and FOX News talent have taped special service -- public service announcements, encouraging viewers to stay home and to seek the latest items from the CDC. To date, we broadcast nearly 30,000 COVID-19 PSAs. 
Our FOX Television stations have spearheaded charitable initiatives to assist their local communities from benefiting food banks and presenting on-air school essence for students with limited access to technology. And an initiative I am particularly proud of is the preparation and delivery of 2,000 meals a day for the disabled community in Los Angeles by our Fox Studios food service staff. This gives us the dual benefit of keeping our amazing staff in work while providing much needed support to the people of LA. We'll continue with many of these and other initiatives where we can be helpful. And I've asked each of our 8,000-plus employees to look for ways they can contribute to their community while working from home. 
At the same time, we're keeping a close eye on the evolving impact of the crisis on our business, adjusting the way we operate in the near term, communicating with our partners and evaluating our longer-term models to ensure that we maintain the strength of Fox for the future. Clearly, we are not immune to the impact of COVID-19 and we and acknowledge the continuing pandemic will influence our future financial results. The uncertain nature of the situation, however, makes it challenging for us to estimate the future performance of our business, particularly over the near to medium term. 
So what has been the impact on our business to date? At a macro level, sports events have been deferred and the production of certain entertainment content slated for the fall has been suspended. However, our activities around news have grown and intensified. Our local and national news ratings have been strong with FOX News ending the third quarter with its largest audience in history. We have seen this momentum accelerate into the current quarter with audience levels rising further, most notably in the younger student demos. This quarter so far has seen the network's adult 25 to 54 audience nearly double from prior year levels. This growth has not gone unnoticed by advertisers with new business coming to Fox News from clients looking to reach these younger demos or to transition dormant sports dollars to news, or to present different marketing messages in light of the virus, thereby mitigating most of the pullback in the categories that you would expect, such as auto, entertainment and retail. 
Categories that have moved spending into FOX News to reach our expanded and engaged audiences include insurance, fast service restaurants, telecom, streaming and tech. With the impact of the pandemic is most apparent in our business is at our local stations across the country, where despite viewership gains for our local news programming, fiscal fourth quarter advertising revenues are pacing down around 50% from year ago levels. The local auto, local retail, local travel, and local entertainment categories are leading this decline for us and the rest of the TV market -- local TV market. We will only see the pattern of how these categories will return after states and municipalities open back up for business. 
On our last earnings call, I indicated that all signs pointed to a robust political ad cycle for our local markets. As a result of the contraction of the field of presidential candidates and the postponement of many state primaries due to pandemic, we have seen a slowdown in the active political advertising spend that we saw in the third quarter. However, traditionally, the political campaign significantly ramped up spending in our first fiscal quarter, and we expect with election day still 6 months away, that this category will intensify again as we approach November. 
Turning to sports, which accounts for over 40% of our total annual advertising revenue. Very little of this revenue has been affected so far by the shutdowns. Our sports revenue is concentrated in the fall when baseball's postseason and the college and NFL football seasons are most active. We're in close contact with all of our sports partners and know that they are being thoughtful around their scheduling decisions by prioritizing the health and safety of all of the personnel associated with their sports, their fans and their production partners like us. We'll look to them for their conclusions around when they will commence play. Whenever they are ready to start, we'll be ready to produce and to broadcast. 
Like the rest of America, we can't wait for the first pitch thrown, the first ball hyped and the roar of engines starting again. On the entertainment side, COVID-19 has caused the temporary cessation of nearly all program production in the industry. Regardless, Fox will enter the next broadcast year with a great deal of stability. This is partially because animation production has been less affected than live action, and we expect to return in the fall with all new seasons of The Simpsons, Bless The Hearts, Bob's Burgers and Family Guy. Also slated for the fall, we have already completed new seasons of our Gordon Ramsey franchises, Health Kitchen, and Master Chef Jr. and have all new series finished and ready to go to air, including the psychological thriller Next and the southern gothic soap opera, Filthy Rich. 
At this time, should the conditions allow for it, we are planning for production in early August of season 4 of The Masked Singer, which will target for fall debut. We have also begun preparing new seasons of 9-1-1, 9-1-1 Lone Star, Prodigal Son and LEGO Masters for mid-season launch dates. Given the uncertainty that our advertisers are facing in their own businesses, along with the potential variability in our programming schedule, you'll have noted the cancellation of our advertising upfront, which would otherwise have taken place next Monday. Although we will not be hosting this traditional event this year, we remain in constant dialogue with our advertising partners to ensure that we provide them with the flexibility needed to navigate these unprecedented times. 
Fox executives have been front and center with our clients, hosting video conferences to speak about the marketplace and the impact on their businesses. While the flexibility that we provide our partners will certainly be reflected in reduced advertising revenues in the current quarter, it is our priority to preserve these long-term relationships and do what we can to ensure the health and sustainability of their businesses and brands. 
Finally, as for distribution, we are pleased with the increased viewing that we are delivering for our partners' video offerings and for our Fox affiliated stations across the country. As it relates to pay TV subscribers, it is unclear so far of the impact of COVID-19 will materially alter recent trends. We know that a few major distributors have publicly expressed a bearish outlook for their video subs. And there will no doubt be recessionary economic pressures across a significant number of pay TV households in the near term. These factors alone would likely exacerbate the recent trends in subscriber declines. But we also know from Nielsen Ratings that more people are consuming TV right now, particularly in the news category. And we know there is strong pent-up demand for live and event programming that is the cornerstone of our portfolio brands. Beginning, for example, with the return of NASCAR in just 11 days. 
While the bias would have to lean toward near-term pressure on subscriber levels, how all of these factors interact and get reflected in the subscriber numbers will become more clear as the year progresses. 
I'll wrap up my comments where I started. Fox is in a strong position to weather this turmoil. Our outsized exposure to news [indiscernible] that should be less impacted than others and the timing of the sports that we broadcast has curbed the immediate impact on us so far. We entered this crisis in a position of financial strength, and we remain well capitalized and highly liquid. Our steadfastly conservative financial management and our strong free cash flow profile underpin the company's balance sheet, even with the uncertainty around the shape and pace of the economic recovery in the United States. As we emerge, Fox focused collection of brands skewed heavily towards live and event programming will be even more in demand by advertisers and audiences alike. 
I am confident that we'll come out of this crisis as a stronger, more efficient and more agile company positioned for the future toward our continued goal of maximizing long-term shareholder value. And now I'll turn the call over to Steve."
546623668,664859456,1974356,"Fox Corporation, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, May 06, 2020",2020-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Fox Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. Let me start with a brief summary of our third quarter results before going on to discuss current trading conditions. As Lachlan mentioned earlier, Q3 was a clear demonstration of Fox's financial strength. The compan",1748,"Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. Let me start with a brief summary of our third quarter results before going on to discuss current trading conditions. 
As Lachlan mentioned earlier, Q3 was a clear demonstration of Fox's financial strength. The company reported total revenues of $3.44 billion, up 25% over the comparative period in fiscal 2019, reflecting revenue growth across all operating segments. Total company advertising revenues increased 44%, led by the broadcast of Super Bowl 54, while total company affiliate revenues increased 10%, demonstrating the strength of our brands and our focused portfolio of channels. We achieved double-digit affiliate revenue growth despite the rate of net subscriber declines of just over 5%. 
Quarterly EBITDA was $920 million, and notwithstanding the comparison to carve out financials in the prior year period, still represented a growth of 20% led by increases of the television and cable network programming segment partially offset by the impact of corporate expenses at the other segment. The increase in these expenses reflects the full costs of Fox operating as a stand-alone public company in the current year versus the presentation of carve out financial statements in the prior year quarter. From a bottom line perspective, net income attributable to stockholders of $78 million or $0.13 a share was lower than the $529 million or $0.85 per share in the prior year quarter. This decline was primarily due to the change in fair value of the company's investments recognized in other net. Most notably, the book loss incurred following the sale of our stake in Roku in March. 
From an economic perspective, the Roku sale, which equated to 9x our initial investment, delivered a post-tax gain relative to initial cash investment of approximately $300 million and strategically allowed us to convert a minority shareholding into the full ownership of leading AVoD player duty. Excluding this impact and other noncore items, adjusted EPS of $0.93 was up significantly compared to last year's $0.76 per share, reflecting the growth in EBITDA, partially offset by higher net interest expense, which as we have flagged in the past, primarily reflects interest on the stand-alone debt structure of Fox versus the carve-out presentation in the prior year quarter. 
So now turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter, with cable EBITDA of $792 million was up 7% on revenue growth of 6%. As expected, we saw growth in cable affiliate revenues accelerate to 4% as the impact of new distribution agreements and higher average rates across essentially all of our brands was partially offset by the net decrease in pay television subscribers. This growth also reflects the launch of FOX News and Fox Business on Sling late last year. Cable advertising revenues increased 10%, led by results at Fox News Media, including the impact of higher ratings and continued strength in our digital sales, partially offset by higher preemptions associated with breaking news coverage. 
Segment advertising growth was also impacted by fewer light NASCAR events at Fox Sports 1, due to the postponement of early season races as a result of COVID-19. Other cable revenues grew by $18 million, driven by contractual sports to licensing revenues, primarily associated with college basketball content in the quarter. EBITDA at our cable segment increased 7% over the prior year, reflecting these higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses. Fox News Media costs were up in the quarter due to coverage of the presidential primaries and continued digital investment in Fox Nation, which were partially offset in the segment by lower programming rights amortization of FOX Sports 1 from fewer live NASCAR events. 
The quarter also included onetime costs at Fox Sports and Fox News Media related to the production of shoulder programming leading up to the broadcast of Super Bowl 54. The Television segment reported EBITDA of $224 million, an increase of $125 million over the prior year quarter on revenue growth of 41%. The revenue growth was led by a 56% increase in television advertising revenues, including the impact across our network and stations from Super Bowl Sunday. Excluding the impact of the Super Bowl and the impact of 1 less NFL divisional playoff gate compared to the prior year, advertising revenues would have been up 1%, primarily due to strong CPM growth for the FOX Network and higher political advertising revenues at the FOX Television station. These were partially offset by the impact of COVID-19 on our local stations during the closing weeks of the quarter. 
Television affiliate revenues increased 22% in the period, reflecting double-digit increases for both our programming fees from non-owned station affiliates and direct retransmission revenues at our owned and operated stations. EBITDA at our television segment increased $125 million over the prior year, reflecting these higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses. The increase in expenses was driven by programming rights amortization and production and costs associated with the broadcast of Super Bowl 54, partially offset by the impact of the rotating NFL divisional playoff game and prior year programming write-downs. 
Similar to our second quarter, we continued to make investments in programming, which included our first year of WWE content, the expansion of original entertainment programming and our participation in co-production arrangements with third-party studios. Finally, from a P&L perspective, the net EBITDA loss in our other segment amounted to $96 million, which reflects the full quarter of stand-alone costs as opposed to the carve-out basis of presentation in the corresponding quarter of the prior year. We still expect the net EBITDA loss in our other segments to be in the mid- to high $300 million range for the full fiscal year. 
Turning now to cash flow. As expected, our free cash flow generation in the quarter are more than $1.5 billion was strong, supported by the collection of advertising revenues from our fall programming and the fact that our sports rights payments were concentrated in prior quarters. As a reminder, we calculate free cash flow as net cash used in operating activities plus cash invested in property, plant and equipment. As part of our balanced approach to capital allocation, in March, we closed on the previously announced Nexstar Television stations transaction at a net purchase price of approximately $300 million. We also generated net proceeds of approximately $340 million from the sale of our stake in Roku, which were earmarked on the acquisition of Tubi for approximately $445 million in net cash consideration at closing last month. 
During the quarter, we purchased 3.9 million Class A and 2.9 million Class B shares for $173 million. Against our buyback authorization of $2 billion, we have now cumulatively repurchased $600 million, representing nearly 3% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in November. Given the current uncertain economic conditions, we have not bought back shares since the onset of the crisis. From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $3.2 billion in cash and $6.8 billion in debt. Since then, out of an abundance of portion, we took the opportunity to add to our already strong liquidity position by raising $1.2 billion of 5-year and 10-year notes in April, which was significantly oversubscribed. The weighted average cost of this new issuance was approximately 3.3%, thereby making it attractive from a cost perspective to essentially pre-fund our $750 million maturity due in January 22. 
So with the combined benefits of strong free cash flow and liquidity, moderate leverage and the absence of any debt maturity for almost 2 years, we faced the challenges of COVID-19 from a position of financial strength. As Lachlan mentioned, while we are very proud of the operational and the financial results that we have achieved, we are acutely aware of the impact of COVID-19 and the challenges it presents to all of our businesses and all of our stakeholders. We note that there are a number of moving variables, among them the outlook for the gradual reopening of the economy, the timing and the return of sporting events and the evolution of the upfront advertising cycle that make it difficult to forecast our business beyond the very short term. 
As such, our commentary today will focus only on our fiscal fourth quarter and only on advertising revenues, which is where we are seeing the most significant impact to our business. The most immediate impact has been on advertising revenue at our local television stations, where inventory is sold essentially on a spot basis, and many of our advertising partners operate in sectors most displaced by COVID-19. If pacing continues at current levels, we would expect our local advertising to be down by approximately 50% as against prior year. 
Meanwhile, our News and Entertainment businesses are expected to be more insulated in the immediate term. News is being supported by strong ratings, the growth of its digital properties, the category mix of its core advertisers, along with the new advertising clients it is attracting that help partially offset decline from the legacy advertising base. At Entertainment, we are already substantially through the broadcast season with our advertising revenues well supported by inventory that was sold during last year's upfront and until recently, a strong scatter market. So before we get to our Sports business, the collective Q4 impact of weaker advertising demand at our local TV stations, national news and entertainment businesses is anticipated to be around $200 million to $240 million or 25% to 30% compared to prior year. Across these businesses, we do not anticipate COVID-19 having a meaningful impact on Q4 costs. 
Now turning to our Sports business, where uncertainty around schedule makes it impossible to forecast top line impact. However, it is worth pointing out that we typically amortize the associated rights fees and production expenses on our P&L when the games or events actually air on our networks. So from a bottom line perspective, advertising revenues from events being postponed is often offset by the P&L expense benefit of not having the rights cost. Although these uncertainties make it challenging for us to estimate the future performance of our business, as Lachlan mentioned in his our financial results to illustrate, the company entered this crisis in a position of operating and financial strength. We will continue to manage our business and balance sheet in a disciplined and conservative manner so that we emerge as well positioned as possible to take advantage of opportunities during the recovery. 
And with that, I'd now like to turn the call back to Joe."

There are variations of one, but I'll answer them both, and I appreciate them both. So in terms of efficiencies, I think what we have -- because we are in such a strong position, we haven't looked at how we drive efficiencies in terms of a specific COVID-19 impact. Our employees are fully engaged in running each of their businesses. Our businesses are all fully operational. And as you know, when we separated from Disney, we went through a process that time of really creating what we felt was a very efficient platform from which to go forward. 
Having said that, we've looked at how we produce sports, how we produce news, how we operate as a team, many of our corporate functions. And we've learned the lessons from telecommuting, working in more flexible and more innovative ways. And we think, absolutely, going forward, there are significant ways we can be more efficient and more agile as a company, as I mentioned in my earlier comments. So there is a process we're working through. It's a process we're working through before COVID-19. And we certainly see that there's opportunities there. 
From a sports perspective, look, we're very pleased, obviously, with the return of NASCAR on May 17. We've seen a very strong demand from our clients to be associated with and to market within that race and within future races. So we're very pleased with what we see from an advertiser demand. We have worked, I should say, with our clients over the last 6 weeks, incredibly closely, engaged through -- not physically closely, but digitally closely engaged in literally hundreds of teleconferences, we're taking them through the marketplace, having us understand the impact of COVID-19 on their businesses and how we can help them as we come out of this health crisis going forward. That process is now evolving, where we can now have much more specific conversations with them, particularly about the fall. 
We're pleased that the NFL will be releasing their schedule 8:00 tomorrow night, Eastern time. That obviously gives us a trigger to be much more specific in our conversations with our clients. But we are seeing tremendous pent-up demand for sports programming and live event programming. As for the WWE, I have to give a shout out to the WWE. They have done a tremendous job delivering us live content, week in, week out under very difficult circumstances. And we're very appreciative of them for it. So thank you, Jessica."

I should say FOX Nation has had -- I think April was the second strongest month for FOX Nation, and it continues, which is interesting as it gets bigger, to achieve an over 80% conversion rate from free trial to independent subscribers. So the consumers of FOX Nation are absolutely enjoying and paying for that product as it grows. 
So -- and we've talked before about FOX Bet and Credible as a part of a direct-to-consumer strategy. But as far as Tubi goes, we feel that we are not getting back into the entertainment production -- original production business through Tubi. We see our existing Slater brands as being very important to the growth of Tubi. What we can do both through the entertainment network and its content, you can see today, the #1 television show on Tubi is The Marked Singer and is driving a lot of important viewership and advertising impressions. And what we can do with sports and news and our local stations in the future, we think is very exciting. So Tubi is a great business. It's grown 150% year-on-year in terms of in terms of video hours viewed, but we can make it an even greater business. And we're getting to know the team, and we like them a lot. We think they're going to do great things. 
So -- but it is important that it's our brands and Tubi's distribution, I think, is going to really be very exciting. On the NFL, obviously, COVID-19, we haven't been able to sit down across the table with the NFL to discuss their future plans and the renewal of our deals. We have been in contact with the NFL every day about a whole range of other things. So we remain very close to them. There's nothing that we see in the marketplace today that makes us feel any differently about the value of our partnership with the NFL. They've been a tremendous partner of ours for over 25 years. And we've built our business as they've built theirs, and we look forward to that continuing for many years to come."

I understand the process is very different this year, and there's a tremendous amount of flexibility. But do you believe there will be some upfront markets that will occur, meaning that advertisers will be willing to make commitments for the fall and for next year? And I guess when you look at Fox's portfolio before it's being such a big component of it, do you feel that they will remain on the sidelines until you do get better visibility on that front? I know you mentioned having the line of games coming out, so it will be helpful, but is it enough to sort of get them to kind of make these commitments?"

So as I mentioned before, I think with Jessica's question, we've been fully engaged with our clients and agencies over the last 6 weeks. We don't see that changing. We don't see a virtual singular upfront as the right thing to do today because all of our clients are affected by COVID-19 in different ways. And they will all emerge from their COVID-19 impacts in different ways. So for example, our retail clients or our auto clients will emerge from COVID-19 in a very different way from, say, our financial services or insurance clients. Entertainment will be very different from telecom or professional services. 
And so it's important for us as we've engaged with them to understand what their needs are and to tailor our partnership with them in very unique and specific ways, and that will continue. Obviously, there are triggers to those conversations such as the NFL schedule being released, such as NASCAR being back on air, on the track. And those are exciting milestones. But we'll continue to work closely with each of our clients and work to their specific needs to work them into our schedule. I think one of the key things to remember, Alexia, is aside from the sports schedule, which is starting to take shape, our entertainment schedule in the fall looks incredibly stable. Really thanks to a large amount of our programming already being filmed and edited and phrased in the can. 
The only open question in our fall entertainment schedule is whether we get massing or back into production in time for a fall schedule or for a mid-season schedule. The rest of our schedule, and by the way, I should mention, I think I did in my earlier comments, the fact that animation is virtually -- production schedule of animation is virtually untouched, knock on wood, by COVID-19 has been a great boon to us. So we are very confident and pleased that we have a strong entertainment schedule in the fall. Now this, of course, the elephant in the room is the tremendous ratings of news. Our news ratings are the strongest they've ever been. The demographics within those ratings within those viewership is younger and as attractive as it's ever been, and we're very pleased with that. So it's not just about sports, sports coming back, but it's about news and entertainment that we are very confident and we'll have a strong quarter."

One thing that's been occurring behind the scenes all the time is virtual riders rooms and virtual development where people don't have to be on expensive movie studio a lot.

So I thin",458,"Yes. And Doug, just picking up on the accounting and just we called out -- just going back to the Investor Day, again, we called out $200 million to $250 million of programming investments and we're on pace to be in that range for the full year. So I think we've spent close to sort of $170 million of that so far in the first 3 quarters of the year. So we're still on pace, and as Lachlan mentioned, continue to look at how we invest in that going forward. The accounting won't change for us in terms of the amount of entertainment programming, which we generally sort of go through on first run. So there'll be no changes on amortization. 
And then as to the idiosyncratic investment or M&A. The -- look, I think you can put it into 2 different categories. One is expanding our existing strength, on our existing base. So for example, if I look at Tubi and I think of the digital video impressions that they garner us, we can both strengthen Tubi from a content point of view and we can strengthen them from an ad sales point of view. They benefit tremendously from the association with us. We think it's a tremendous acquisition that really plays to Fox strengths. But it's doing what we do today. It's putting with new technologies and advertising video-on-demand basis, puts our content in front of new markets with greater reach and gives more opportunity for our advertisers. So it's perhaps a simple strategy, but we think one that's really very exciting for us. So one bucket is the businesses that are in our wheelhouse. They're expanding what we already do in an exciting way. The other, which you can book credible and Fox bet into those categories is how do we look at businesses that -- where we can monetize our existing audiences in different ways. So not -- so when you look at our revenues today, our revenue is equally split roughly between advertising and affiliate revenue to grow new revenue streams, less reliant on those 2 is an important goal of ours. Credible. We're incredibly excited. It's doubled in size of last year, doubled its loan volumes and doubled its revenue. And Fox Bet had an incredible Super Bowl, obviously, since COVID-19. There's less sports being played. But I should say that part of that acquisition was an equity stake in TSG, which has done rather well with the merger with [indiscernible], which I should congratulate Peter Jackson for, closed on Monday. 
So those businesses are really about getting -- those best strategy is really about getting into new businesses based upon our existing audiences and serving our existing audiences in new ways."

I don't want to complete too because they're obviously different. But clearly, when we talk about our projections for a 50% reduction in local advertising, that's a mix of all sorts of different categories, right? The categories that you would expect are being affected significantly worse by COVID-19, they're pacing below -- or say, worse than 50% below. So travel, entertainment, restaurants are all pacing worse than 50%. But that's ameliorated by many categories that are down significantly less than that. Professional services, insurance and some categories, frankly, that are up like pharmaceutical. So it's a real mix. Again, as we said before, we can't really say from a local perspective, how local markets are going to recover. It will be state by state as various states and municipalities lift their shelter home orders. But we are beginning to see sort of positive signs in the pacing going forward. Over the last 2 weeks, now, I'm not talking including national, over the last couple of weeks, we have seen a severe lessening of requests for flexibility with advertising. I think people -- advertisers and marketers are starting to look forward into the first quarter of next fiscal year and are beginning to think about how they market and get their products and their brands in front of our consumers again. So we're just -- it's early days, but we're just beginning to see that positive shift. 
As to political advertising, despite the impact of COVID-19 in the last couple of weeks of the third quarter, the third quarter still was a record political year for us -- sorry, quarter for us, the third quarter for us. Fourth quarter always is a trough as the advertising start -- political advertising starts to pick up again in the first fiscal quarter of the next fiscal year. So we expect that trend to continue. We expect the political advertising to ramp up in the first quarter of the next fiscal year. And we believe we are still on track for a record political season. The reason we say that is, if you look at our markets, obviously, it's going to be a hard fought election. We have 9 of our 18 markets or about half our markets are battleground states, including Arizona, Florida, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, to some extent also Georgia, Michigan and Minnesota. 10 of our markets have U.S. Senate races. I won't list them all. And 2 of our markets have gubernatorial races. Of course, the house has contest in every market. 
So we think our markets are -- I wouldn't say fortuitously, but are certainly positioned well to capture a lion's share of the political revenue really in the first quarter of the next fiscal year."

Good afternoon, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. 
We are living through extraordinary times. Since we last all spoke together, who would have imagined our lives could have all been turned so upside down. The impact of COVID-19 has impacted our economy, our businesses, our colleagues and ourselves. We owe deep gratitude to the nurses, doctors, police, teachers, aged care workers, volunteers and countless other front-line workers for their incredible and brave sacrifices. At Fox, we thank every one of them. Their work humbles ours. 
We have spent these last few months protecting the health of our employees; providing essential news, information and entertainment to our communities; all while bolstering the strength of our company in order to best tackle the challenges ahead. At the outset, let me say that, if there is anything you take away from my remarks today, it should be that Fox is in a strong position to deal with the impact of this pandemic. Our strength was clearly demonstrated in the quarter, which was only partially impacted by the pandemic and is illustrative of the outstanding results Fox delivers in unaffected cycles. The strength of Fox has also been on display in the weeks since the end of the quarter as we navigate these unprecedented times to continue to provide our services to communities across the country. 
Starting with a review of our third quarter, you will have seen that we delivered exceptional financial results, achieving revenue and EBITDA growth of 25% and 20%, respectively, adjusted earnings per share growth of 22%, and generating over $1.5 billion of free cash flow. Our revenue growth was multipronged. It feels like a lifetime ago, but as a reminder, the quarter began with our record-breaking broadcast of Super Bowl 54, where we generated around $600 million of gross revenue across the company. But the strength in the quarter extended well beyond the Super Bowl. Local advertising at the FOX Television stations grew by over 20% as Super Bowl revenues were supplemented with over $35 million of gross political ad revenues in the quarter. 
At FOX News, advertising revenues grew by 15%, led by a 45% increase in digital ad revenues. And we had another strong affiliate quarter with total company affiliate revenues growing by 10%, despite a touch over 5% reduction in pay-TV subscribers. Steve will cover the details of our financial results shortly. 
Operationally, the quarter saw FOX News and FOX Business deliver their largest audiences in each network's history with FOX News ratings up approximately 40% year-on-year. The success of FOX News Media's brands extended beyond their linear properties. FOX News Digital achieved its highest quarter ever across all KPIs, including over 11 billion digital page views. Company-wide digital reach grew 42%, while digital engagement nearly doubled year-on-year. 
Elsewhere on screens, the quarter brought us another successful season of The Masked Singer and the #1 new broadcast reality series, the family-friendly hit, Lego Masters, 2 shows that we hope will shape the Fox Network lineup for years to come. While still early days, our strategy to leverage the cross-promotional power of our platform to support shows we have an ownership interest in is showing encouraging results. Bless The Harts was the #1 new comedy and adds another leg to our Sunday Animation Block, while Prodigal Son was the second highest-rated new scripted drama on television. 
Locally, the FOX television stations continued the expansion of their news coverage, adding an additional 5 hours per week across Atlanta and Los Angeles. The stations' unified programming strategy drove ratings growth in essentially every day part, including daytime and late news. 
Corporately, during the past quarter, we completed important transactions to support the ongoing growth and momentum of FOX. Among them were the closing of our agreement with Nexstar, in which we expanded our local market footprint through the acquisition of key stations in Seattle and Milwaukee, and the transfer of our Charlotte stations to them; the early renewal of our distribution agreement with one of our largest partners, Comcast, and our full portfolio of channels; and the announcement and subsequent closing of our acquisition of Tubi, which immediately expands our direct-to-consumer capabilities and provides our advertisers with even more opportunities to reach audiences at great scale. 
Coupled with combined power of Fox's existing networks, Tubi provides a substantial base from which we will drive long-term growth in the direct-to-consumer market. As an example of the scale, in April, Tubi generated total viewing time of over 200 million hours, which is up more than 150% versus prior year. This was also the first full quarter reflecting the results of Credible, our digital loan marketplace business. And while we are only just at the beginning of exploring the marketing synergies between Fox and Credible, the business has had a great quarter, doubling its closed loan volume and revenue year-on-year. Overall, the financial and operating results through the first 9 months of the year confirms just how sturdy our business is and demonstrates the power and importance of our live sports, news and event programming to our partners and our audiences. 
Of course, our achievements have been rightly overshadowed by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and by the challenges it has presented to all of the company's stakeholders, including our colleagues, the communities we serve, our business partners and our shareholders. We understand our responsibility to each stakeholder and are mindful of them in the balanced actions we are taking to address the crisis. 
As I mentioned earlier, our main priority remains the health, safety and well-being of our more than 8,000 colleagues. We continue to follow federal, state and local guidelines when it comes to our workforce in our locations across the U.S. Those whose job functions allow it have been working remotely since mid-March. And we have over 70% of our employees offsite at the moment. We are grateful to those essential employees whose jobs remain -- require them to work onsite for their commitment and for their resolve. We have taken actions to protect and ensure the well-being of these employees, particularly for those that are out in the community informing the country of every aspect of the pandemic at a national and local level. 
While taking steps to keep our colleagues safe, we also continue to provide our viewers with the information they seek to better understand this pandemic on a national and local basis. In this spirit, we swiftly launched coronavirusnow.com, a free-to-use website featuring the latest news about the pandemic. Drawing on our news-gathering and digital capabilities across the country, bolstered by third-party content from government and health organizations, such as the Center for Disease Control, we've created the site to provide our employees, viewers and communities with reliable up-to-date information about this public health issue. 
Over 1.3 million Americans have accessed these specific resources. It's a wonderful example of the breadth of Fox coming together to provide a public service to our audiences at a critical time and in a new and distinctive way. Further, working with our distribution partners to ensure that all Americans could receive the latest national and local news regarding coronavirus, we offered free access to the FOX News channel and FOX Television stations starting in mid-March and continuing for over a month. We are doing impactful work across our platforms to inform our viewers and to give back to our audiences. 
Fox raised over $13 million for Feeding America and the First Responders Children's Foundation, through our broadcast of Fox Presents the iHeart Living Room Concert for America, which paid tribute to the brave medical professionals and local heroes who are working on so many aspects of the pandemic. In early April, Fox News and Facebook cohosted a coronavirus town hall, featuring medical and business experts, including members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. Fox News and Facebook jointly donated $1 million to Feeding America's COVID-19 Response fund. In partnership with NASCAR and with the NFL, FOX Sports donated to Feed The Children, the American Red Cross and Feeding America. FOX Sports and FOX News talent have taped special service -- public service announcements, encouraging viewers to stay home and to seek the latest guidance from the CDC. To-date, we have broadcast nearly 30,000 COVID-19 PSAs. 
Our FOX Television stations have spearheaded charitable initiatives to assist their local communities from benefiting food banks and presenting on-air school lessons for students with limited access to technology. And an initiative I am particularly proud of is the preparation and delivery of 2,000 meals a day for the disabled community in Los Angeles by our Fox Studios foodservice staff. This gives us the dual benefit of keeping our amazing staff in work while providing much needed support to the people of LA. 
We'll continue with many of these and other initiatives where we can be helpful. And I've asked each of our 8,000-plus employees to look for ways they can contribute to their community while working from home. 
At the same time, we're keeping a close eye on the evolving impact of the crisis on our business, adjusting the way we operate in the near term, communicating with our partners and evaluating our longer-term models to ensure that we maintain the strength of Fox for the future. Clearly, we are not immune to the impact of COVID-19, and we acknowledge the continuing pandemic will influence our future financial results. The uncertain nature of the situation, however, makes it challenging for us to estimate the future performance of our business, particularly over the near to medium term. 
So what has been the impact on our business to-date? At a macro level, sports events have been deferred and the production of certain entertainment content slated for the fall has been suspended. However, our activities around news have grown and intensified. 
Our local and national news ratings have been strong with FOX News ending the third quarter with its largest audience in history. We have seen this momentum accelerate into the current quarter with audience levels rising further, most notably in the younger student demos. This quarter so far has seen the network's adults 25 to 54 audience nearly double from prior year levels. This growth has not gone unnoticed by advertisers with new business coming to FOX News from clients looking to reach these younger demos or to transition dormant sports dollars to news or to present different marketing messages in light of the virus, thereby mitigating most of the pullback in the categories that you would expect, such as auto, entertainment and retail. 
Categories that have moved spending into FOX News to reach our expanded and engaged audiences include insurance, fast-service restaurants, telecom, streaming and tech. Where the impact of the pandemic is most apparent in our business is at our local stations across the country, where, despite viewership gains for our local news programming, fiscal fourth quarter advertising revenues are pacing down around 50% from year ago levels. The local auto, local retail, local travel, and local entertainment categories are leading this decline for us and the rest of the TV market -- local TV market. We'll only see the pattern of how these categories will return after states and municipalities open back up for business. 
On our last earnings call, I indicated that all signs pointed to a robust political ad cycle for our local markets. As a result of the contraction of the field of presidential candidates and the postponement of many state primaries due to the pandemic, we have seen a slowdown in the active political advertising spend that we saw in the third quarter. However, traditionally, the political campaign significantly ramped up spending in our first fiscal quarter, and we expect, with election day still 6 months away, that this category will intensify again as we approach November. 
Turning to sports, which accounts for over 40% of our total annual advertising revenue. Very little of this revenue has been affected so far by the shutdowns. Our sports revenue is concentrated in the fall when baseball's postseason and the college and NFL football seasons are most active. We're in close contact with all of our sports partners and know that they are being thoughtful around their scheduling decisions by prioritizing the health and safety of all of the personnel associated with their sport, their fans and their production partners like us. We'll look to them for their conclusions around when they will commence play. Whenever they are ready to start, we'll be ready to produce and to broadcast. Like the rest of America, we can't wait for the first pitch thrown, the first ball hiked and the roar of engines starting again. 
On the entertainment side, COVID-19 has caused the temporary cessation of nearly all program production in the industry. Regardless, Fox will enter the next broadcast year with a great deal of stability. This is partially because animation production has been less affected than live action, and we expect to return in the fall with all new seasons of The Simpsons, Bless The Harts, Bob's Burgers and Family Guy. Also slated for the fall, we have already completed new seasons of our Gordon Ramsey franchises, Hell's Kitchen, and MasterChef Junior, and have all new series finished and ready to go to air, including the psychological thriller NeXt and the Southern gothic soap opera, Filthy Rich. 
At this time, should the conditions allow for it, we are planning for production in early August of Season 4 of The Masked Singer, which will target for a fall debut. We have also begun preparing new seasons of 9-1-1, 9-1-1: Lone Star, Prodigal Son and Lego Masters for mid-season launch dates. Given the uncertainty that our advertisers are facing in their own businesses, along with the potential variability in our programming schedule, you'll have noted the cancellation of our advertising Upfront, which would otherwise have taken place next Monday. Although we will not be hosting this traditional event this year, we remain in constant dialogue with our advertising partners to ensure that we provide them with the flexibility needed to navigate these unprecedented times. 
Fox executives have been front and center with our clients, hosting video conferences to speak about the marketplace and the impact on their businesses. While the flexibility that we provide our partners will certainly be reflected in reduced advertising revenues in the current quarter, it is our priority to preserve these long-term relationships and do what we can to ensure the health and sustainability of their businesses and brands. 
Finally, as for distribution, we are pleased with increased viewing that we're delivering for our partners' video offerings and for our FOX-affiliated stations across the country. As it relates to pay-TV subscribers, it's unclear so far of the impact of COVID-19 will materially alter recent trends. We know that a few major distributors have publicly expressed a bearish outlook for their video subs. And there will no doubt be recessionary economic pressures across a significant number of pay-TV households in the near term. 
These factors alone would likely exacerbate the recent trends in subscriber declines. But we also know from Nielsen Ratings that more people are consuming TV right now, particularly in the news category. And we know there is strong pent-up demand for live and event programming that is the cornerstone of our portfolio brands, beginning, for example, with the return of NASCAR in just 11 days. While the bias would have to lean toward near-term pressure on subscriber levels, how all of these factors interact and get reflected in subscriber numbers will become more clear as the year progresses. 
I'll wrap up my comments where I started. Fox is in a strong position to weather this turmoil. Our outsized exposure to news, a genre that should be less impacted than others, and the timing of the sports that we broadcast has curbed the immediate impact on us so far. We entered this crisis in a position of financial strength, and we remain well capitalized and highly liquid. Our steadfastly conservative financial management and our strong free cash flow profile underpin the company's balance sheet, even with the uncertainty around the shape and pace of the economic recovery in the United States. As we emerge, Fox's focused collection of brands skewed heavily towards live and event programming will be even more in demand by advertisers and audiences alike. 
I am confident that we'll come out of this crisis as a stronger, more efficient and more agile company positioned for the future toward our continued goal of maximizing long-term shareholder value. And now I'll turn the call over to Steve."
546623668,664859456,1974661,"Fox Corporation, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, May 06, 2020",2020-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Fox Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. Let me start with a brief summary of our third quarter results before going on to discuss current trading conditions. As Lachlan mentioned earlier, Q3 was a clear demonstration of Fox's financial strength. The compan",1742,"Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. Let me start with a brief summary of our third quarter results before going on to discuss current trading conditions. 
As Lachlan mentioned earlier, Q3 was a clear demonstration of Fox's financial strength. The company reported total revenues of $3.44 billion, up 25% over the comparative period in fiscal 2019, reflecting revenue growth across all operating segments. Total company advertising revenues increased 44%, led by the broadcast of Super Bowl 54, while total company affiliate revenues increased 10%, demonstrating the strength of our brands and our focused portfolio of channels. We achieved double-digit affiliate revenue growth despite the rate of net subscriber declines of just over 5%. 
Quarterly EBITDA was $920 million, and notwithstanding the comparison to carve out financials in the prior year period, still represented growth of 20% led by increases of the television and cable network programming segment partially offset by the impact of corporate expenses at the other segment. The increase in these expenses reflects the full costs of Fox operating as a stand-alone public company in the current year versus the presentation of carve-out financial statement in the prior year quarter. 
From a bottom-line perspective, net income attributable to stockholders of $78 million or $0.13 a share was lower than the $529 million or $0.85 per share in the prior year quarter. This decline was primarily due to the change in fair value of the company's investments recognized in other net. Most notably, the book loss incurred following the sale of our stake in Roku in March. 
From an economic perspective, the Roku sale, which equated to 9x our initial investment, delivered a posttax gain relative to initial cash investment of approximately $300 million and strategically allowed us to convert a minority shareholding into the full ownership of leading AVOD player Tubi. 
Excluding this impact and other noncore items, adjusted EPS of $0.93 was up significantly compared to last year's $0.76 per share, reflecting the growth in EBITDA, partially offset by higher net interest expense, which as we have flagged in the past, primarily reflects interest on the stand-alone debt structure of Fox versus the carve-out presentation in the prior year quarter. 
So now turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter, where cable EBITDA of $792 million was up 7% on revenue growth of 6%. As expected, we saw growth in cable affiliate revenues accelerate to 4% as the impact of new distribution agreements and higher average rates across essentially all of our brands was partially offset by the net decrease in pay television subscribers. This growth also reflects the launch of FOX News and Fox Business on Sling late last year. Cable advertising revenues increased 10%, led by results at FOX News Media, including the impact of higher ratings and continued strength in our digital sales, partially offset by high preemptions associated with breaking news coverage. 
Segment advertising growth was also impacted by fewer live NASCAR events at Fox Sports 1 due to the postponement of early season races as a result of COVID-19. Other cable revenues grew by $18 million, driven by contractual sports sublicensing revenues primarily associated with college basketball content in the quarter. EBITDA at our cable segment increased 7% over the prior year, reflecting these higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses. Fox News Media costs were up in the quarter due to coverage of the presidential primaries and continued digital investment in FOX Nation, which were partially offset in the segment by lower programming rights amortization of Fox Sports 1 from fewer live NASCAR events. The quarter also included onetime costs at FOX Sports and FOX News Media related to the production of shoulder programming leading up to the broadcast of Super Bowl 54. 
The Television segment reported EBITDA of $224 million, an increase of $125 million over the prior year quarter on revenue growth of 41%. The revenue growth was led by a 56% increase in television advertising revenues, including the impact across our network and stations from Super Bowl Sunday. Excluding the impact of the Super Bowl and the impact of one less NFL divisional playoff game compared to the prior year, advertising revenues would have been up 1% primarily due to strong CPM growth for FOX Network and higher political advertising revenues at the Fox Television Stations. These were partially offset by the impact of COVID-19 on our local stations during the closing weeks of the quarter. 
Television affiliate revenues increased 22% in the period, reflecting double-digit increases for both our programming fees from nonowned station affiliates and direct retransmission revenues at our owned and operated stations. EBITDA at our Television segment increased $125 million over the prior year, reflecting these higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses. The increase in expenses was driven by programming rights amortization and production and costs associated with the broadcast of Super Bowl 54, partially offset by the impact of the rotating NFL divisional playoff game and prior year programming write-downs. 
Similar to our second quarter, we continued to make investments in programming, which included our first year of WWE content, the expansion of original entertainment programming and our participation in coproduction arrangements with third-party studios. Finally, from a P&L perspective, the net EBITDA loss in our other segment amounted to $96 million, which reflects the full quarter of stand-alone cost as opposed to the carve-out basis of presentation in the corresponding quarter of the prior year. We still expect the net EBITDA loss in our other segment to be in the mid- to high $300 million range for the full fiscal year. 
Turning now to cash flow. As expected, our free cash flow generation in the quarter of more than $1.5 billion was strong, supported by the collection of advertising revenues from our fall programming and the fact that our sports rights payments were concentrated in prior quarters. As a reminder, we calculate free cash flow as net cash used in operating activity plus cash invested in property, plant and equipment. 
As part of our balanced approach to capital allocation, in March, we closed on the previously announced Nexstar Television stations transaction at a net purchase price of approximately $300 million. We also generated net proceeds of approximately $340 million from the sale of our stake in Roku, which was earmarked from the acquisition of Tubi for approximately $445 million in net cash consideration at closing last month. 
During the quarter, we purchased 3.9 million Class A and 2.9 million Class B shares for $173 million. Against our buyback authorization of $2 billion, we have now cumulatively repurchased $600 million, representing nearly 3% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in November. Given the current uncertain economic conditions, we have not bought back shares since the onset of the crisis. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $3.2 billion in cash and $6.8 billion in debt. Since then, out of an abundance of caution, we took the opportunity to add to our already strong liquidity position by raising $1.2 billion of 5-year and 10-year notes in April, which was significantly oversubscribed. The weighted average cost of this new issuance was approximately 3.3%, thereby making it attractive from a cost perspective to essentially prefund our $750 million maturity due in January '22. 
So with the combined benefits of strong free cash flow and liquidity, moderate leverage and the absence of any debt maturity for almost 2 years, we face the challenges of COVID-19 from a position of financial strength. As Lachlan mentioned, while we are very proud of the operational and the financial results that we have achieved, we're acutely aware of the impact of COVID-19 and the challenges it presents to all of our businesses and all of our stakeholders. We note that there are a number of moving variables, among them the outlook for the gradual reopening of the economy, the timing in the return of sporting events and the evolution of the upfront advertising cycle that make it difficult to forecast our business beyond the very short term. 
As such, our commentary today will focus only on our fiscal fourth quarter and only on advertising revenues, which is where we are seeing the most significant impact to our business. The most immediate impact has been on advertising revenue at our local television stations, where inventory is sold essentially on a spot basis and many of our advertising partners operate in sectors most displaced by COVID-19. If pacing continues at current levels, we would expect our local advertising to be down by approximately 50% as against prior year. 
Meanwhile, our News and Entertainment businesses are expected to be more insulated in the immediate term. News is being supported by strong ratings, the growth of its digital properties, the category mix of its core advertisers, along with the new advertising clients it is attracting that help partially offset decline from the legacy advertising base. At Entertainment, we are already substantially through the broadcast season with our advertising revenues well supported by inventory that was sold during last year's upfront and, until recently, a strong scatter market. So before we get to our Sports business, the collective Q4 impact of weaker advertising demand at our local TV stations, national news and Entertainment businesses is anticipated to be around $200 million to $240 million or 25% to 30% compared to prior year. Across these businesses, we do not anticipate COVID-19 having a meaningful impact on Q4 costs. 
Now turning to our Sports business, where uncertainty around schedule makes it impossible to forecast top line impact. However, it is worth pointing out that we typically amortize the associated rights fees and production expenses on our P&L when the games or events actually air on our networks. So from a bottom line perspective, advertising revenues from events being postponed is often offset by the P&L expense benefit of not having the rights cost. 
Although these uncertainties make it challenging for us to estimate the future performance of our businesses, as Lachlan mentioned in his our financial results to illustrate, the company entered this crisis in a position of operating and financial strength. We will continue to manage our business and balance sheet in a disciplined and conservative manner so that we emerge as well positioned as possible to take advantage of opportunities during the recovery. 
And with that, I'd now like to turn the call back to Joe."

There are variations of one, but I'll answer them both, and I appreciate them both. So in terms of efficiencies, I think what we have -- because we are in such a strong position, we haven't looked at how we drive efficiencies in terms of a specific COVID-19 impact. Our employees are fully engaged in running each of their businesses. Our businesses are all fully operational. And as you know, when we separated from Disney, we went through a process at that time of really creating what we felt was a very efficient platform from which to go forward. 
Having said that, we've looked at how we produce sports, how we produce news, how we operate as a team, many of our corporate functions. And we've learned the lessons from telecommuting, working in more flexible and more innovative ways. And we think, absolutely, going forward, there are significant ways we can be more efficient and more agile as a company, as I mentioned in my earlier comments. So there is a process we're working through. It's a process we're working through before COVID-19. And we certainly see that there's opportunities there. 
From a sports perspective, look, we're very pleased, obviously, with the return of NASCAR on May 17. We've seen a very strong demand from our clients to be associated with and to market within that race and within future races. So we're very pleased with what we see from an advertiser demand. We have worked, I should say, with our clients over the last 6 weeks incredibly closely, engaged through -- not physically closely, but digitally closely engaged in literally hundreds of teleconferences. We're taking them through the marketplace, having us understand the impact of COVID-19 on their businesses and how we can help them as we come out of this health crisis going forward. That process is now evolving where we can now have much more specific conversations with them, particularly about the fall. 
We're pleased that the NFL will be releasing their schedule 8:00 tomorrow night Eastern Time. That obviously gives us a trigger to be much more specific in our conversations with our clients. But we are seeing tremendous pent-up demand for sports programming and live event programming. As for the WWE, I have to give a shout out to the WWE. They have done a tremendous job delivering us live content, week in, week out, under very difficult circumstances. And we're very appreciative of them for it. So thank you, Jessica."

And we've talked before about our direct-to-consumer strategy. We were very pleased with both our kind of authenticated strategy through FOX NOW. It's obviously an authenticated platform for our product but also with the strength and the growth in FOX Nation. I should say FOX Nation has had -- I think April was the second-strongest month for FOX Nation, and it continues, which is interesting as it gets bigger, to achieve an over-80% conversion rate from free trialists into paying subscribers. So the consumers of FOX Nation are absolutely enjoying and paying for that product as it grows. So -- and we've talked before about Fox Bet and Credible as a part of our direct-to-consumer strategy. 
But as far as Tubi goes, we feel that we are not getting back into the entertainment production -- original production business through Tubi. We see our existing slate of brands as being very important to the growth of Tubi. What we can do both through the entertainment network and its content, you can see today. The #1 television show on Tubi is The Marked Singer and is driving a lot of important viewership and advertising impressions. And what we can do with sports and news and our local stations in the future, we think, is very exciting. So Tubi is a great business. It's grown 150% year-on-year in terms of in terms of video hours viewed, but we can make it an even greater business. And we're getting to know the team, and we like them a lot. We think they're going to do great things. So -- but it is important that it's our brands, and Tubi's distribution, I think, is going to really be very exciting. 
On the NFL, obviously, COVID-19, we haven't been able to sit down across the table with the NFL to discuss their future plans and the renewal of our deals. We have been in contact with the NFL every day about a whole range of other things. So we remain very close to them. There's nothing that we see in the marketplace today that makes us feel any differently about the value of our partnership with the NFL. They've been a tremendous partner of ours for over 25 years.

So as I mentioned before, I think with Jessica's question, we've been fully engaged with our clients and ad agencies over the last 6 weeks. We don't see that changing. We don't see a virtual singular upfront as the right thing to do today because all of our clients are affected by COVID-19 in different ways. And they will all emerge from their COVID-19 impacts in different ways. So for example, our retail clients or our auto clients will emerge from COVID-19 in a very different way from, say, our financial services or insurance clients. Entertainment will be very different from telecom or professional services. 
And so it's important for us as we've engaged with them to understand what their needs are and to tailor our partnership with them in very unique and specific ways, and that will continue. Obviously, there are triggers to those conversations, such as the NFL schedule being released, such as NASCAR being back on air, on the track. And those are exciting milestones. But we'll continue to work closely with each of our clients and work to their specific needs to work them into our schedule. 
I think one of the key things to remember, Alexia, is, aside from the sports schedule, which is starting to take shape, our entertainment schedule in the fall looks incredibly stable, really thanks to a large amount of our programming already being filmed and edited and [ to use ] a phrase in the can. 
The only open question in our fall entertainment schedule is whether we get Masked Singer back into production in time for a fall schedule or for a mid-season schedule. The rest of our schedule -- and by the way, I should mention, I think I did in my earlier comments, the fact that animation is virtually -- the production schedule of our animation is virtually untouched, knock on wood, by COVID-19 has been a great boon to us. So we are very confident and pleased that we have a strong entertainment schedule in the fall. 
Now this, of course, the elephant in the room is the tremendous ratings of news. Our news ratings are the strongest they've ever been. The demographics within those ratings within that viewership is younger and as attractive as it's ever been, and we're very pleased with that. So it's not just about sports, sports coming back, but it's about news and entertainment that we are very confident, and we'll have a strong quarter."

And it's interesting because you strung 3 together as part of a direct-to-consumer strategy. So either way, whether it's an idiosyncratic mix or whether it's actually targeted to a specific strategy, any thoughts on what's next for M&A would be helpful."

One thing that's been occurring behind the scenes all the time is virtual riders rooms and virtual development where people don't have to be on an expensive movie studio a lot. For example, all of that work is continuing behind the scenes, which has been positive to see."

So we're still on pace, and as Lachlan mentioned, continue to look at how we invest in that going forward.

One is expanding our existing strength on our existing base. So for example, if I look at Tubi and I think of the digital video impressions that they garner us, we can both strengthen Tubi from a content point of view, and we can strengthen them from an ad sales point of view. They benefit tremendously from the association with us. We think it's a tremendous acquisition that really plays to Fox strengths. But it's doing what we do today. It's putting with new technologies and advertising video-on-demand basis, puts our content in front of new markets with greater reach and gives more opportunity for our advertisers. So it's perhaps a simple strategy, but we think one that's really very exciting for us. 
So one bucket is the businesses that are in our wheelhouse. They're expanding what we already do in an exciting way. The other, which you can put Credible and Fox Bet into those categories is how do we look at businesses that -- where we can monetize our existing audiences in different ways. So not -- so when you look at our revenues today, our revenue is equally split roughly between advertising and affiliate revenue to grow new revenue streams, less reliant on those 2 is an important goal of ours. Credible. We're incredibly excited. It's doubled in size over last year, doubled its loan volumes and doubled its revenue. And Fox Bet had an incredible Super Bowl. Obviously, since COVID-19, there's less sports being played, but I should say that part of that acquisition was an equity stake in TSG, which has done rather well with the merger with Flutter, which I should congratulate Peter Jackson for, which closed on Monday. 
So those businesses are really about getting -- those best strategies are really about getting into new businesses based upon our existing audiences and serving our existing audiences in new ways."

I don't want to [ per plate ] too because they're obviously different. But clearly, when we talk about our projections for a 50% reduction in local advertising, that's a mix of all sorts of different categories, right? The categories that you would expect are being affected significantly worse by COVID-19, they're pacing below -- or say, worse than 50% below. So travel, entertainment, restaurants are all pacing worse than 50%. But that's ameliorated by many categories that are down significantly less than that. Professional services, insurance and some categories, frankly, that are up, like pharmaceutical. So it's a real mix. 
Again, as we said before, we can't really say from a local perspective, how local markets are going to recover. It will be state by state as various states and municipalities lift their shelter-at-home orders. But we are beginning to see positive signs in the pacing going forward. Over the last 2 weeks -- now, I'm not talking including national, over the last couple weeks, we have seen a severe lessening of requests for flexibility with advertising. I think people -- advertisers and marketers are starting to look forward into the first quarter of next fiscal year and are beginning to think about how they market and get their products and their brands in front of our consumers again. So we're just -- it's early days, but we're just beginning to see that positive shift. 
As to political advertising, despite the impact of COVID-19 in the last couple weeks of the third quarter, the third quarter still was a record political year for us -- sorry, quarter for us -- the third quarter for us. Fourth quarter always is a trough as the advertising start -- political advertising starts to pick up again in the first fiscal quarter of the next fiscal year. So we expect that trend to continue. We expect the political advertising to ramp up in the first quarter of the next fiscal year. And we believe we are still on track for a record political season. The reason we say that is, if you look at our markets, obviously, it's going to be a hard-fought election. We have 9 of our 18 markets or about half our markets are battleground states, including Arizona, Florida, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, to some extent also Georgia, Michigan and Minnesota. Ten of our markets have U.S. Senate races. I won't list them all. And 2 of our markets have gubernatorial races. Of course, the House has contests in every market. 
So we think our markets are -- I wouldn't say fortuitously, but are certainly positioned well to capture a lion's share of the political revenue really in the first quarter of the next fiscal year."

Good afternoon, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. 
We are living through extraordinary times. Since we last all spoke together, who would have imagined our lives could have all been turned so upside down. The impact of COVID-19 has impacted our economy, our businesses, our colleagues and ourselves. We owe deep gratitude to the nurses, doctors, police, teachers, aged care workers, volunteers and countless other front-line workers for their incredible and brave sacrifices. At Fox, we thank every one of them. Their work humbles ours. 
We have spent these last few months protecting the health of our employees; providing essential news, information and entertainment to our communities; all while bolstering the strength of our company in order to best tackle the challenges ahead. At the outset, let me say that, if there is anything you take away from my remarks today, it should be that Fox is in a strong position to deal with the impact of this pandemic. Our strength was clearly demonstrated in the quarter, which was only partially impacted by the pandemic and is illustrative of the outstanding results Fox delivers in unaffected cycles. The strength of Fox has also been on display in the weeks since the end of the quarter as we navigate these unprecedented times to continue to provide our services to communities across the country. 
Starting with a review of our third quarter, you will have seen that we delivered exceptional financial results, achieving revenue and EBITDA growth of 25% and 20%, respectively, adjusted earnings per share growth of 22%, and generating over $1.5 billion of free cash flow. Our revenue growth was multipronged. It feels like a lifetime ago, but as a reminder, the quarter began with our record-breaking broadcast of Super Bowl 54, where we generated around $600 million of gross revenue across the company. But the strength in the quarter extended well beyond the Super Bowl. Local advertising at the FOX Television stations grew by over 20% as Super Bowl revenues were supplemented with over $35 million of gross political ad revenues in the quarter. 
At FOX News, advertising revenues grew by 15%, led by a 45% increase in digital ad revenues. And we had another strong affiliate quarter with total company affiliate revenues growing by 10%, despite a touch over 5% reduction in pay-TV subscribers. Steve will cover the details of our financial results shortly. 
Operationally, the quarter saw FOX News and FOX Business deliver their largest audiences in each network's history with FOX News ratings up approximately 40% year-on-year. The success of FOX News Media's brands extended beyond their linear properties. FOX News Digital achieved its highest quarter ever across all KPIs, including over 11 billion digital page views. Company-wide digital reach grew 42%, while digital engagement nearly doubled year-on-year. 
Elsewhere on screens, the quarter brought us another successful season of The Masked Singer and the #1 new broadcast reality series, the family-friendly hit, Lego Masters, 2 shows that we hope will shape the Fox Network lineup for years to come. While still early days, our strategy to leverage the cross-promotional power of our platform to support shows we have an ownership interest in is showing encouraging results. Bless The Harts was the #1 new comedy and adds another leg to our Sunday Animation Block, while Prodigal Son was the second highest-rated new scripted drama on television. 
Locally, the FOX television stations continued the expansion of their news coverage, adding an additional 5 hours per week across Atlanta and Los Angeles. The stations' unified programming strategy drove ratings growth in essentially every day part, including daytime and late news. 
Corporately, during the past quarter, we completed important transactions to support the ongoing growth and momentum of FOX. Among them were the closing of our agreement with Nexstar, in which we expanded our local market footprint through the acquisition of key stations in Seattle and Milwaukee, and the transfer of our Charlotte stations to them; the early renewal of our distribution agreement with one of our largest partners, Comcast, and our full portfolio of channels; and the announcement and subsequent closing of our acquisition of Tubi, which immediately expands our direct-to-consumer capabilities and provides our advertisers with even more opportunities to reach audiences at great scale. 
Coupled with combined power of Fox's existing networks, Tubi provides a substantial base from which we will drive long-term growth in the direct-to-consumer market. As an example of the scale, in April, Tubi generated total viewing time of over 200 million hours, which is up more than 150% versus prior year. This was also the first full quarter reflecting the results of Credible, our digital loan marketplace business. And while we are only just at the beginning of exploring the marketing synergies between Fox and Credible, the business has had a great quarter, doubling its closed loan volume and revenue year-on-year. Overall, the financial and operating results through the first 9 months of the year confirms just how sturdy our business is and demonstrates the power and importance of our live sports, news and event programming to our partners and our audiences. 
Of course, our achievements have been rightly overshadowed by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and by the challenges it has presented to all of the company's stakeholders, including our colleagues, the communities we serve, our business partners and our shareholders. We understand our responsibility to each stakeholder and are mindful of them in the balanced actions we are taking to address the crisis. 
As I mentioned earlier, our main priority remains the health, safety and well-being of our more than 8,000 colleagues. We continue to follow federal, state and local guidelines when it comes to our workforce in our locations across the U.S. Those whose job functions allow it have been working remotely since mid-March. And we have over 70% of our employees offsite at the moment. We are grateful to those essential employees whose jobs remain -- require them to work onsite for their commitment and for their resolve. We have taken actions to protect and ensure the well-being of these employees, particularly for those that are out in the community informing the country of every aspect of the pandemic at a national and local level. 
While taking steps to keep our colleagues safe, we also continue to provide our viewers with the information they seek to better understand this pandemic on a national and local basis. In this spirit, we swiftly launched coronavirusnow.com, a free-to-use website featuring the latest news about the pandemic. Drawing on our news-gathering and digital capabilities across the country, bolstered by third-party content from government and health organizations, such as the Center for Disease Control, we've created the site to provide our employees, viewers and communities with reliable up-to-date information about this public health issue. 
Over 1.3 million Americans have accessed these specific resources. It's a wonderful example of the breadth of Fox coming together to provide a public service to our audiences at a critical time and in a new and distinctive way. Further, working with our distribution partners to ensure that all Americans could receive the latest national and local news regarding coronavirus, we offered free access to the FOX News channel and FOX Television stations starting in mid-March and continuing for over a month. We are doing impactful work across our platforms to inform our viewers and to give back to our audiences. 
Fox raised over $13 million for Feeding America and the First Responders Children's Foundation, through our broadcast of Fox Presents the iHeart Living Room Concert for America, which paid tribute to the brave medical professionals and local heroes who are working on so many aspects of the pandemic. In early April, Fox News and Facebook cohosted a coronavirus town hall, featuring medical and business experts, including members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. Fox News and Facebook jointly donated $1 million to Feeding America's COVID-19 Response fund. In partnership with NASCAR and with the NFL, FOX Sports donated to Feed The Children, the American Red Cross and Feeding America. FOX Sports and FOX News talent have taped special service -- public service announcements, encouraging viewers to stay home and to seek the latest guidance from the CDC. To-date, we have broadcast nearly 30,000 COVID-19-related PSAs. 
Our FOX Television stations have spearheaded charitable initiatives to assist their local communities from benefiting food banks and presenting on-air school lessons for students with limited access to technology. And an initiative I am particularly proud of is the preparation and delivery of 2,000 meals a day for the disabled community in Los Angeles by our Fox Studios foodservice staff. This gives us the dual benefit of keeping our amazing staff in work while providing much needed support to the people of LA. 
We'll continue with many of these and other initiatives where we can be helpful. And I've asked each of our 8,000-plus employees to look for ways they can contribute to their community while working from home. 
At the same time, we're keeping a close eye on the evolving impact of the crisis on our business, adjusting the way we operate in the near term, communicating with our partners and evaluating our longer-term models to ensure that we maintain the strength of Fox for the future. Clearly, we are not immune to the impact of COVID-19, and we acknowledge the continuing pandemic will influence our future financial results. The uncertain nature of the situation, however, makes it challenging for us to estimate the future performance of our business, particularly over the near to medium term. 
So what has been the impact on our business to-date? At a macro level, sports events have been deferred and the production of certain entertainment content slated for the fall has been suspended. However, our activities around news have grown and intensified. 
Our local and national news ratings have been strong with FOX News ending the third quarter with its largest audience in history. We have seen this momentum accelerate into the current quarter with audience levels rising further, most notably in the younger-skewing demos. This quarter so far has seen the network's adults 25 to 54 audience nearly double from prior year levels. This growth has not gone unnoticed by advertisers with new business coming to FOX News from clients looking to reach these younger demos or to transition dormant sports dollars to news or to present different marketing messages in light of the virus, thereby mitigating most of the pullback in the categories that you would expect, such as auto, entertainment and retail. 
Categories that have moved spending into FOX News to reach our expanded and engaged audiences include insurance, fast-service restaurants, telecom, streaming and tech. Where the impact of the pandemic is most apparent in our business is at our local stations across the country, where, despite viewership gains for our local news programming, fiscal fourth quarter advertising revenues are pacing down around 50% from year ago levels. The local auto, local retail, local travel, and local entertainment categories are leading this decline for us and the rest of the TV market -- local TV market. We'll only see the pattern of how these categories will return after states and municipalities open back up for business. 
On our last earnings call, I indicated that all signs pointed to a robust political ad cycle for our local markets. As a result of the contraction of the field of presidential candidates and the postponement of many state primaries due to the pandemic, we have seen a slowdown in the active political advertising spend that we saw in the third quarter. However, traditionally, the political campaign significantly ramped up spending in our first fiscal quarter, and we expect, with election day still 6 months away, that this category will intensify again as we approach November. 
Turning to sports, which accounts for over 40% of our total annual advertising revenue. Very little of this revenue has been affected so far by the shutdowns. Our sports revenue is concentrated in the fall when baseball's postseason and the college and NFL football seasons are most active. We're in close contact with all of our sports partners and know that they are being thoughtful around their scheduling decisions by prioritizing the health and safety of all of the personnel associated with their sport, their fans and their production partners like us. We'll look to them for their conclusions around when they will commence play. Whenever they are ready to start, we'll be ready to produce and to broadcast. Like the rest of America, we can't wait for the first pitch thrown, the first ball hiked and the roar of engines starting again. 
On the entertainment side, COVID-19 has caused the temporary cessation of nearly all program production in the industry. Regardless, Fox will enter the next broadcast year with a great deal of stability. This is partially because animation production has been less affected than live action, and we expect to return in the fall with all new seasons of The Simpsons, Bless The Harts, Bob's Burgers and Family Guy. Also slated for the fall, we have already completed new seasons of our Gordon Ramsey franchises, Hell's Kitchen, and MasterChef Junior, and have all new series finished and ready to go to air, including the psychological thriller NeXt and the Southern gothic soap opera, Filthy Rich. 
At this time, should the conditions allow for it, we are planning for production in early August of Season 4 of The Masked Singer, which will target for a fall debut. We have also begun preparing new seasons of 9-1-1, 9-1-1: Lone Star, Prodigal Son and Lego Masters for mid-season launch dates. Given the uncertainty that our advertisers are facing in their own businesses, along with the potential variability in our programming schedule, you'll have noted the cancellation of our advertising upfront, which would otherwise have taken place next Monday. Although we will not be hosting this traditional event this year, we remain in constant dialogue with our advertising partners to ensure that we provide them with the flexibility needed to navigate these unprecedented times. 
Fox executives have been front and center with our clients, hosting video conferences to speak about the marketplace and the impact on their businesses. While the flexibility that we provide our partners will certainly be reflected in reduced advertising revenues in the current quarter, it is our priority to preserve these long-term relationships and do what we can to ensure the health and sustainability of their businesses and brands. 
Finally, as for distribution, we are pleased with increased viewing that we're delivering for our partners' video offerings and for our FOX-affiliated stations across the country. As it relates to pay-TV subscribers, it's unclear so far if the impact of COVID-19 will materially alter recent trends. We know that a few major distributors have publicly expressed a bearish outlook for their video subs. And there will no doubt be recessionary economic pressures across a significant number of pay-TV households in the near term. 
These factors alone would likely exacerbate the recent trends in subscriber declines. But we also know from Nielsen Ratings that more people are consuming TV right now, particularly in the news category. And we know there is strong pent-up demand for live and event programming that is the cornerstone of our portfolio brands, beginning, for example, with the return of NASCAR in just 11 days. While the bias would have to lean toward near-term pressure on subscriber levels, how all of these factors interact and get reflected in subscriber numbers will become more clear as the year progresses. 
I'll wrap up my comments where I started. Fox is in a strong position to weather this turmoil. Our outsized exposure to news, a genre that should be less impacted than others, and the timing of the sports that we broadcast has curbed the immediate impact on us so far. We entered this crisis in a position of financial strength, and we remain well capitalized and highly liquid. Our steadfastly conservative financial management and our strong free cash flow profile underpin the company's balance sheet, even with the uncertainty around the shape and pace of the economic recovery in the United States. As we emerge, Fox's focused collection of brands skewed heavily towards live and event programming will be even more in demand by advertisers and audiences alike. 
I am confident that we'll come out of this crisis as a stronger, more efficient and more agile company positioned for the future toward our continued goal of maximizing long-term shareholder value. And now I'll turn the call over to Steve."
546623668,664859456,1999074,"Fox Corporation, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, May 06, 2020",2020-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Fox Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. Let me start with a brief summary of our third quarter results before going on to discuss current trading conditions. As Lachlan mentioned earlier, Q3 was a clear demonstration of Fox's financial strength. The compan",1741,"Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. Let me start with a brief summary of our third quarter results before going on to discuss current trading conditions. 
As Lachlan mentioned earlier, Q3 was a clear demonstration of Fox's financial strength. The company reported total revenues of $3.44 billion, up 25% over the comparative period in fiscal 2019, reflecting revenue growth across all operating segments. Total company advertising revenues increased 44%, led by the broadcast of Super Bowl 54, while total company affiliate revenues increased 10%, demonstrating the strength of our brands and our focused portfolio of channels. We achieved double-digit affiliate revenue growth despite the rate of net subscriber declines of just over 5%. 
Quarterly EBITDA was $920 million, and notwithstanding the comparison to carve out financials in the prior year period, still represented growth of 20%, led by increases of the television and cable network programming segment, partially offset by the impact of corporate expenses at the other segment. The increase in these expenses reflects the full costs of Fox operating as a stand-alone public company in the current year versus the presentation of carve-out financial statement in the prior year quarter. 
From a bottom-line perspective, net income attributable to stockholders of $78 million or $0.13 a share was lower than the $529 million or $0.85 per share in the prior year quarter. This decline was primarily due to the change in fair value of the company's investments recognized in other net. Most notably, the book loss incurred following the sale of our stake in Roku in March. 
From an economic perspective, the Roku sale, which equated to 9x our initial investment, delivered a posttax gain relative to initial cash investment of approximately $300 million and strategically allowed us to convert a minority shareholding into the full ownership of leading AVOD player Tubi. 
Excluding this impact and other noncore items, adjusted EPS of $0.93 was up significantly compared to last year's $0.76 per share, reflecting the growth in EBITDA, partially offset by higher net interest expense, which as we have flagged in the past, primarily reflects interest on the stand-alone debt structure of Fox versus the carve-out presentation in the prior year quarter. 
So now turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter, where cable EBITDA of $792 million was up 7% on revenue growth of 6%. As expected, we saw growth in cable affiliate revenues accelerate to 4% as the impact of new distribution agreements and higher average rates across essentially all of our brands was partially offset by the net decrease in pay television subscribers. This growth also reflects the launch of FOX News and Fox Business on Sling late last year. Cable advertising revenues increased 10%, led by results at FOX News Media, including the impact of higher ratings and continued strength in our digital sales, partially offset by high preemptions associated with breaking news coverage. 
Segment advertising growth was also impacted by fewer live NASCAR events at Fox Sports 1 due to the postponement of early season races as a result of COVID-19. Other cable revenues grew by $18 million, driven by contractual sports sublicensing revenues, primarily associated with college basketball content in the quarter. EBITDA at our cable segment increased 7% over the prior year, reflecting these higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses. Fox News Media costs were up in the quarter due to coverage of the presidential primaries and continued digital investment in FOX Nation, which were partially offset in the segment by lower programming rights amortization of Fox Sports 1 from fewer live NASCAR events. The quarter also included onetime costs at FOX Sports and FOX News Media related to the production of shoulder programming leading up to the broadcast of Super Bowl 54. 
The Television segment reported EBITDA of $224 million, an increase of $125 million over the prior year quarter on revenue growth of 41%. The revenue growth was led by a 56% increase in television advertising revenues, including the impact across our network and stations from Super Bowl Sunday. Excluding the impact of the Super Bowl and the impact of one less NFL divisional playoff game compared to the prior year, advertising revenues would have been up 1%, primarily due to strong CPM growth for FOX Network and higher political advertising revenues at the Fox Television Stations. These were partially offset by the impact of COVID-19 on our local stations during the closing weeks of the quarter. 
Television affiliate revenues increased 22% in the period, reflecting double-digit increases for both our programming fees from nonowned station affiliates and direct retransmission revenues at our owned and operated stations. EBITDA at our Television segment increased $125 million over the prior year, reflecting these higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses. The increase in expenses was driven by programming rights amortization and production and costs associated with the broadcast of Super Bowl 54, partially offset by the impact of the rotating NFL divisional playoff game and prior year programming write-downs. 
Similar to our second quarter, we continued to make investments in programming, which included our first year of WWE content, the expansion of original entertainment programming and our participation in coproduction arrangements with third-party studios. Finally, from a P&L perspective, the net EBITDA loss in our other segment amounted to $96 million, which reflects the full quarter of stand-alone cost as opposed to the carve-out basis of presentation in the corresponding quarter of the prior year. We still expect the net EBITDA loss in our other segment to be in the mid-to-high $300 million range for the full fiscal year. 
Turning now to cash flow. As expected, our free cash flow generation in the quarter of more than $1.5 billion was strong, supported by the collection of advertising revenues from our fall programming and the fact that our sports rights payments were concentrated in prior quarters. As a reminder, we calculate free cash flow as net cash used in operating activity plus cash invested in property, plant and equipment. 
As part of our balanced approach to capital allocation, in March, we closed on the previously announced Nexstar Television stations transaction at a net purchase price of approximately $300 million. We also generated net proceeds of approximately $340 million from the sale of our stake in Roku, which was earmarked from the acquisition of Tubi for approximately $445 million in net cash consideration at closing last month. 
During the quarter, we purchased 3.9 million Class A and 2.9 million Class B shares for $173 million. Against our buyback authorization of $2 billion, we have now cumulatively repurchased $600 million, representing nearly 3% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in November. Given the current uncertain economic conditions, we have not bought back shares since the onset of the crisis. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $3.2 billion in cash and $6.8 billion in debt. Since then, out of an abundance of caution, we took the opportunity to add to our already strong liquidity position by raising $1.2 billion of 5-year and 10-year notes in April, which was significantly oversubscribed. The weighted average cost of this new issuance was approximately 3.3%, thereby making it attractive from a cost perspective to essentially prefund our $750 million maturity due in January '22. 
So with the combined benefits of strong free cash flow and liquidity, moderate leverage and the absence of any debt maturity for almost 2 years, we face the challenges of COVID-19 from a position of financial strength. As Lachlan mentioned, while we are very proud of the operational and the financial results that we have achieved, we're acutely aware of the impact of COVID-19 and the challenges it presents to all of our businesses and all of our stakeholders. We note that there are a number of moving variables, among them the outlook for the gradual reopening of the economy, the timing in the return of sporting events and the evolution of the upfront advertising cycle that make it difficult to forecast our business beyond the very short term. 
As such, our commentary today will focus only on our fiscal fourth quarter and only on advertising revenues, which is where we are seeing the most significant impact to our business. The most immediate impact has been on advertising revenue at our local television stations, where inventory is sold essentially on a spot basis and many of our advertising partners operate in sectors most displaced by COVID-19. If pacing continues at current levels, we would expect our local advertising to be down by approximately 50% as against prior year. 
Meanwhile, our News and Entertainment businesses are expected to be more insulated in the immediate term. News is being supported by strong ratings, the growth of its digital properties, the category mix of its core advertisers, along with the new advertising clients it is attracting that help partially offset decline from the legacy advertising base. At Entertainment, we are already substantially through the broadcast season with our advertising revenues well supported by inventory that was sold during last year's upfront and, until recently, a strong scatter market. So before we get to our Sports business, the collective Q4 impact of weaker advertising demand at our local TV stations, national news and entertainment businesses is anticipated to be around $200 million to $240 million or 25% to 30% compared to prior year. Across these businesses, we do not anticipate COVID-19 having a meaningful impact on Q4 costs. 
Now turning to our Sports business, where uncertainty around schedule makes it impossible to forecast top line impact. However, it is worth pointing out that we typically amortize the associated rights fees and production expenses on our P&L when the games or events actually air on our networks. So from a bottom line perspective, foregone advertising revenues from events being postponed is often offset by the P&L expense benefit of not having the rights cost. 
Although these uncertainties make it challenging for us to estimate the future performance of our businesses, as Lachlan mentioned in his our financial results to illustrate, the company entered this crisis in a position of operating and financial strength. We will continue to manage our business and balance sheet in a disciplined and conservative manner so that we emerge as well positioned as possible to take advantage of opportunities during the recovery. 
And with that, I'd now like to turn the call back to Joe."

There are variations of one, but I'll answer them both, and I appreciate them both. So in terms of efficiencies, I think what we have -- because we are in such a strong position, we haven't looked at how we drive efficiencies in terms of a specific COVID-19 impact. Our employees are fully engaged in running each of their businesses. Our businesses are all fully operational. And as you know, when we separated from Disney, we went through a process at that time of really creating what we felt was a very efficient platform from which to go forward. 
Having said that, we've looked at how we produce sports, how we produce news, how we operate as a team, many of our corporate functions. And we've learned the lessons from telecommuting, working in more flexible and more innovative ways. And we think, absolutely, going forward, there are significant ways we can be more efficient and more agile as a company, as I mentioned in my earlier comments. So there is a process we're working through. It's a process we're working through before COVID-19. And we certainly see that there's opportunities there. 
From a sports perspective, look, we're very pleased, obviously, with the return of NASCAR on May 17. We've seen a very strong demand from our clients to be associated with and to market within that race and within future races. So we're very pleased with what we see from an advertiser demand. We have worked, I should say, with our clients over the last 6 weeks incredibly closely, engaged through -- not physically closely, but digitally closely, engaged in literally hundreds of teleconferences. We're taking them through the marketplace, having us understand the impact of COVID-19 on their businesses and how we can help them as we come out of this health crisis going forward. That process is now evolving where we can now have much more specific conversations with them, particularly about the fall. 
We're pleased that the NFL will be releasing their schedule 8:00 tomorrow night Eastern Time. That obviously gives us a trigger to be much more specific in our conversations with our clients. But we are seeing tremendous pent-up demand for sports programming and live event programming. As for the WWE, I have to give a shout out to the WWE. They have done a tremendous job delivering us live content, week in, week out, under very difficult circumstances. And we're very appreciative of them for it. So thank you, Jessica."

And we've talked before about our direct-to-consumer strategy. We were very pleased with both our kind of authenticated strategy through FOX NOW. It's obviously an authenticated platform for our product but also with the strength and the growth in FOX Nation. I should say FOX Nation has had -- I think April was the second strongest month for FOX Nation, and it continues, which is interesting as it gets bigger, to achieve an over-80% conversion rate from free trialists into paying subscribers. So the consumers of FOX Nation are absolutely enjoying and paying for that product as it grows. So -- and we've talked before about Fox Bet and Credible as a part of our direct-to-consumer strategy. 
But as far as Tubi goes, we feel that we are not getting back into the entertainment production -- original production business through Tubi. We see our existing slate of brands as being very important to the growth of Tubi. What we can do both through the entertainment network and its content, you can see today. The #1 television show on Tubi is The Marked Singer and is driving a lot of important viewership and advertising impressions. And what we can do with sports and news and our local stations in the future, we think, is very exciting. So Tubi has a great business. It's grown 150% year-on-year in terms of in terms of video hours viewed, but we can make it an even greater business. And we're getting to know the team, and we like them a lot. We think they're going to do great things. So -- but it is important that it's our brands, and Tubi's distribution, I think, is going to really be very exciting. 
On the NFL, obviously, COVID-19, we haven't been able to sit down across the table with the NFL to discuss their future plans and the renewal of our deals. We have been in contact with the NFL every day about a whole range of other things. So we remain very close to them. There's nothing that we see in the marketplace today that makes us feel any differently about the value of our partnership with the NFL. They've been a tremendous partner of ours for over 25 years.

So as I mentioned before, I think with Jessica's question, we've been fully engaged with our clients and ad agencies over the last 6 weeks. We don't see that changing. We don't see a virtual singular upfront as the right thing to do today because all of our clients are affected by COVID-19 in different ways. And they will all emerge from their COVID-19 impacts in different ways. So for example, our retail clients or our auto clients will emerge from COVID-19 in a very different way from, say, our financial services or insurance clients. Entertainment will be very different from telecom or professional services. 
And so it's important for us as we've engaged with them to understand what their needs are and to tailor our partnership with them in very unique and specific ways, and that will continue. Obviously, there are triggers to those conversations, such as the NFL schedule being released, such as NASCAR being back on air and on the track. And those are exciting milestones. But we'll continue to work closely with each of our clients and work to their specific needs to work them into our schedule. 
I think one of the key things to remember, Alexia, is, aside from the sports schedule, which is starting to take shape, our entertainment schedule in the fall looks incredibly stable, really thanks to a large amount of our programming already being filmed and edited and in entertainment phrase ""in the can.""
The only open question in our fall entertainment schedule is whether we get Masked Singer back into production in time for a fall schedule or for a mid-season schedule. The rest of our schedule -- and by the way, I should mention, I think I did in my earlier comments, the fact that animation is virtually -- the production schedule of our animation is virtually untouched, knock on wood, by COVID-19 has been a great boon to us. So we are very confident and pleased that we have a strong entertainment schedule in the fall. 
Now this, of course, the elephant in the room is the tremendous ratings of news. Our news ratings are the strongest they've ever been. The demographics within those ratings within that viewership is younger and as attractive as it's ever been, and we're very pleased with that. So it's not just about sports, sports coming back, but it's about news and entertainment that we are very confident, and we'll have a strong quarter."

So for example, if I look at Tubi and I think of the digital video impressions that they garner us, we can both strengthen Tubi from a content point of view, and we can strengthen them from an ad sales point of view. They benefit tremendously from the association with us. We think it's a tremendous acquisition that really plays to Fox strengths. But it's doing what we do today. It's putting with new technologies and advertising video-on-demand basis, puts our content in front of new markets with greater reach and gives more opportunity for our advertisers. So it's perhaps a simple strategy, but we think one that's really very exciting for us. 
So one bucket is the businesses that are in our wheelhouse. They're expanding what we already do in an exciting way. The other, which you can put Credible and Fox Bet into those categories is how do we look at businesses that -- where we can monetize our existing audiences in different ways. So not -- so when you look at our revenues today, our revenue is equally split roughly between advertising and affiliate revenue to grow new revenue streams, less reliant on those 2 is an important goal of ours. Credible, we're incredibly excited. It's doubled in size over last year, doubled its loan volumes and doubled its revenue. And Fox Bet had an incredible Super Bowl. Obviously, since COVID-19, there's less sports being played, but I should say that part of that acquisition was an equity stake in TSG, which has done rather well with the merger with Flutter, which I should congratulate Peter Jackson for, which closed on Monday. 
So those businesses are really about getting -- those best strategies are really about getting into new businesses based upon our existing audiences and serving our existing audiences in new ways."

I don't want to conflate 2 because they're obviously different. But clearly, when we talk about our projections for a 50% reduction in local advertising, that's a mix of all sorts of different categories, right? The categories that you would expect are being affected significantly worse by COVID-19, they're pacing below -- or say, worse than 50% below. So travel, entertainment, restaurants are all pacing worse than 50%. But that's ameliorated by many categories that are down significantly less than that. Professional services, insurance and some categories, frankly, that are up, like pharmaceutical. So it's a real mix. 
Again, as we said before, we can't really say from a local perspective, how local markets are going to recover. It will be state by state as various states and municipalities lift their shelter-at-home orders. But we are beginning to see positive signs in the pacing going forward. Over the last 2 weeks -- now, I'm not talking including national, over the last couple weeks, we have seen a severe lessening of requests for flexibility with advertising. I think people -- advertisers and marketers are starting to look forward into the first quarter of next fiscal year and are beginning to think about how they market and get their products and their brands in front of our consumers again. So we're just -- it's early days, but we're just beginning to see that positive shift. 
As to political advertising, despite the impact of COVID-19 in the last couple weeks of the third quarter, the third quarter still was a record political year for us -- sorry, quarter for us -- the third quarter for us. Fourth quarter always is a trough as the advertising start -- political advertising starts to pick up again in the first fiscal quarter of the next fiscal year. So we expect that trend to continue. We expect the political advertising to ramp up in the first quarter of the next fiscal year. And we believe we are still on track for a record political season. The reason we say that is, if you look at our markets, obviously, it's going to be a hard-fought election. We have 9 of our 18 markets or about half our markets are battleground states, including Arizona, Florida, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, to some extent also Georgia, Michigan and Minnesota. Ten of our markets have U.S. Senate races. I won't list them all. And 2 of our markets have gubernatorial races. Of course, the House has contests in every market. 
So we think our markets are -- I wouldn't say fortuitously, but are certainly positioned well to capture a lion's share of the political revenue really in the first quarter of the next fiscal year."

Good afternoon, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today.
We are living through extraordinary times. Since we last all spoke together, who would have imagined our lives could have all been turned so upside down. The impact of COVID-19 has impacted our economy, our businesses, our colleagues and ourselves. We owe deep gratitude to the nurses, doctors, police, teachers, aged care workers, volunteers and countless other front-line workers for their incredible and brave sacrifices. At Fox, we thank every one of them. Their work humbles ours.
We have spent these last few months protecting the health of our employees; providing essential news, information and entertainment to our communities; all while bolstering the strength of our company in order to best tackle the challenges ahead. At the outset, let me say that, if there is anything you take away from my remarks today, it should be that Fox is in a strong position to deal with the impact of this pandemic. Our strength was clearly demonstrated in the quarter, which was only partially impacted by the pandemic and is illustrative of the outstanding results Fox delivers in unaffected cycles. The strength of Fox has also been on display in the weeks since the end of the quarter as we navigate these unprecedented times to continue to provide our services to communities across the country.
Starting with a review of our third quarter, you will have seen that we delivered exceptional financial results, achieving revenue and EBITDA growth of 25% and 20%, respectively, adjusted earnings per share growth of 22%, and generating over $1.5 billion of free cash flow. Our revenue growth was multipronged. It feels like a lifetime ago, but as a reminder, the quarter began with our record-breaking broadcast of Super Bowl 54, where we generated around $600 million of gross revenue across the company. But the strength in the quarter extended well beyond the Super Bowl. Local advertising at the FOX Television stations grew by over 20% as Super Bowl revenues were supplemented with over $35 million of gross political ad revenues in the quarter.
At FOX News, advertising revenues grew by 15%, led by a 45% increase in digital ad revenues. And we had another strong affiliate quarter with total company affiliate revenues growing by 10%, despite a touch over 5% reduction in pay-TV subscribers. Steve will cover the details of our financial results shortly.
Operationally, the quarter saw FOX News and FOX Business deliver their largest audiences in each network's history with FOX News ratings up approximately 40% year-on-year. The success of FOX News Media's brands extended beyond their linear properties. FOX News Digital achieved its highest quarter ever across all KPIs, including over 11 billion digital page views. Company-wide digital reach grew 42%, while digital engagement nearly doubled year-on-year.
Elsewhere on screens, the quarter brought us another successful season of The Masked Singer and the #1 new broadcast reality series, the family-friendly hit, Lego Masters, 2 shows that we hope will shape the Fox Network lineup for years to come. While still early days, our strategy to leverage the cross-promotional power of our platform to support shows we have an ownership interest in is showing encouraging results. Bless The Harts was the #1 new comedy and adds another leg to our Sunday Animation Block, while Prodigal Son was the second highest-rated new scripted drama on television.
Locally, the FOX television stations continued the expansion of their news coverage, adding an additional 5 hours per week across Atlanta and Los Angeles. The stations' unified programming strategy drove ratings growth in essentially every day part, including daytime and late news.
Corporately, during the past quarter, we completed important transactions to support the ongoing growth and momentum of FOX. Among them were the closing of our agreement with Nexstar, in which we expanded our local market footprint through the acquisition of key stations in Seattle and Milwaukee, and the transfer of our Charlotte stations to them; the early renewal of our distribution agreement with one of our largest partners, Comcast, and our full portfolio of channels; and the announcement and subsequent closing of our acquisition of Tubi, which immediately expands our direct-to-consumer capabilities and provides our advertisers with even more opportunities to reach audiences at great scale.
Coupled with combined power of Fox's existing networks, Tubi provides a substantial base from which we will drive long-term growth in the direct-to-consumer market. As an example of the scale, in April, Tubi generated total viewing time of over 200 million hours, which is up more than 150% versus prior year. This was also the first full quarter reflecting the results of Credible, our digital loan marketplace business. And while we are only just at the beginning of exploring the marketing synergies between Fox and Credible, the business has had a great quarter, doubling its closed loan volume and revenue year-on-year. Overall, the financial and operating results through the first 9 months of the year confirms just how sturdy our business is and demonstrates the power and importance of our live sports, news and event programming to our partners and our audiences.
Of course, our achievements have been rightly overshadowed by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and by the challenges it has presented to all of the company's stakeholders, including our colleagues, the communities we serve, our business partners and our shareholders. We understand our responsibility to each stakeholder and are mindful of them in the balanced actions we are taking to address the crisis.
As I mentioned earlier, our main priority remains the health, safety and well-being of our more than 8,000 colleagues. We continue to follow federal, state and local guidelines when it comes to our workforce in our locations across the U.S. Those whose job functions allow it have been working remotely since mid-March. And we have over 70% of our employees offsite at the moment. We are grateful to those essential employees whose jobs remain -- require them to work onsite for their commitment and for their resolve. We have taken actions to protect and ensure the well-being of these employees, particularly for those that are out in the community informing the country of every aspect of the pandemic at a national and local level.
While taking steps to keep our colleagues safe, we also continue to provide our viewers with the information they seek to better understand this pandemic on a national and local basis. In this spirit, we swiftly launched coronavirusnow.com, a free-to-use website featuring the latest news about the pandemic. Drawing on our news-gathering and digital capabilities across the country, bolstered by third-party content from government and health organizations, such as the Center for Disease Control, we've created the site to provide our employees, viewers and communities with reliable up-to-date information about this public health issue.
Over 1.3 million Americans have accessed these specific resources. It's a wonderful example of the breadth of Fox coming together to provide a public service to our audiences at a critical time and in a new and distinctive way. Further, working with our distribution partners to ensure that all Americans could receive the latest national and local news regarding coronavirus, we offered free access to the FOX News channel and FOX Television stations starting in mid-March and continuing for over a month. We are doing impactful work across our platforms to inform our viewers and to give back to our audiences.
Fox raised over $13 million for Feeding America and the First Responders Children's Foundation, through our broadcast of Fox Presents the iHeart Living Room Concert for America, which paid tribute to the brave medical professionals and local heroes who are working on so many aspects of the pandemic. In early April, Fox News and Facebook cohosted a coronavirus town hall, featuring medical and business experts, including members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. Fox News and Facebook jointly donated $1 million to Feeding America's COVID-19 Response fund. In partnership with NASCAR and with the NFL, FOX Sports donated to Feed The Children, the American Red Cross and Feeding America. FOX Sports and FOX News talent have taped special service -- public service announcements, encouraging viewers to stay home and to seek the latest guidance from the CDC. To-date, we have broadcast nearly 30,000 COVID-19-related PSAs.
Our FOX Television stations have spearheaded charitable initiatives to assist their local communities from benefiting food banks and presenting on-air school lessons for students with limited access to technology. And an initiative I am particularly proud of is the preparation and delivery of 2,000 meals a day for the disabled community in Los Angeles by our Fox Studios foodservice staff. This gives us the dual benefit of keeping our amazing staff in work while providing much needed support to the people of LA.
We'll continue with many of these and other initiatives where we can be helpful. And I've asked each of our 8,000-plus employees to look for ways they can contribute to their community while working from home.
At the same time, we're keeping a close eye on the evolving impact of the crisis on our business, adjusting the way we operate in the near term, communicating with our partners and evaluating our longer-term models to ensure that we maintain the strength of Fox for the future. Clearly, we are not immune to the impact of COVID-19, and we acknowledge the continuing pandemic will influence our future financial results. The uncertain nature of the situation, however, makes it challenging for us to estimate the future performance of our business, particularly over the near to medium term.
So what has been the impact on our business to-date? At a macro level, sports events have been deferred and the production of certain entertainment content slated for the fall has been suspended. However, our activities around news have grown and intensified.
Our local and national news ratings have been strong with FOX News ending the third quarter with its largest audience in history. We have seen this momentum accelerate into the current quarter with audience levels rising further, most notably in the younger-skewing demos. This quarter so far has seen the network's adults 25 to 54 audience nearly double from prior year levels. This growth has not gone unnoticed by advertisers with new business coming to FOX News from clients looking to reach these younger demos or to transition dormant sports dollars to news or to present different marketing messages in light of the virus, thereby mitigating most of the pullback in the categories that you would expect, such as auto, entertainment and retail.
Categories that have moved spending into FOX News to reach our expanded and engaged audiences include insurance, fast-service restaurants, telecom, streaming and tech. Where the impact of the pandemic is most apparent in our business is at our local stations across the country, where, despite viewership gains for our local news programming, fiscal fourth quarter advertising revenues are pacing down around 50% from year ago levels. The local auto, local retail, local travel, and local entertainment categories are leading this decline for us and the rest of the TV market -- local TV market. We'll only see the pattern of how these categories will return after states and municipalities open back up for business.
On our last earnings call, I indicated that all signs pointed to a robust political ad cycle for our local markets. As a result of the contraction of the field of presidential candidates and the postponement of many state primaries due to the pandemic, we have seen a slowdown in the active political advertising spend that we saw in the third quarter. However, traditionally, the political campaign significantly ramped up spending in our first fiscal quarter, and we expect, with election day still 6 months away, that this category will intensify again as we approach November.
Turning to sports, which accounts for over 40% of our total annual advertising revenue. Very little of this revenue has been affected so far by the shutdowns. Our sports revenue is concentrated in the fall when baseball's postseason and the college and NFL football seasons are most active. We're in close contact with all of our sports partners and know that they are being thoughtful around their scheduling decisions by prioritizing the health and safety of all of the personnel associated with their sport, their fans and their production partners like us. We'll look to them for their conclusions around when they will commence play. Whenever they are ready to start, we'll be ready to produce and to broadcast. Like the rest of America, we can't wait for the first pitch thrown, the first ball hiked and the roar of engines starting again.
On the entertainment side, COVID-19 has caused the temporary cessation of nearly all program production in the industry. Regardless, Fox will enter the next broadcast year with a great deal of stability. This is partially because animation production has been less affected than live action, and we expect to return in the fall with all new seasons of The Simpsons, Bless The Harts, Bob's Burgers and Family Guy. Also slated for the fall, we have already completed new seasons of our Gordon Ramsay franchises, Hell's Kitchen, and MasterChef Junior, and have all new series finished and ready to go to air, including the psychological thriller NeXt and the Southern gothic soap opera, Filthy Rich.
At this time, should the conditions allow for it, we are planning for production in early August of Season 4 of The Masked Singer, which will target for a fall debut. We have also begun preparing new seasons of 9-1-1, 9-1-1: Lone Star, Prodigal Son and Lego Masters for mid-season launch dates. Given the uncertainty that our advertisers are facing in their own businesses, along with the potential variability in our programming schedule, you'll have noted the cancellation of our advertising upfront, which would otherwise have taken place next Monday. Although we will not be hosting this traditional event this year, we remain in constant dialogue with our advertising partners to ensure that we provide them with the flexibility needed to navigate these unprecedented times.
Fox executives have been front and center with our clients, hosting video conferences to speak about the marketplace and the impact on their businesses. While the flexibility that we provide our partners will certainly be reflected in reduced advertising revenues in the current quarter, it is our priority to preserve these long-term relationships and do what we can to ensure the health and sustainability of their businesses and brands.
Finally, as for distribution, we are pleased with increased viewing that we're delivering for our partners' video offerings and for our FOX-affiliated stations across the country. As it relates to pay-TV subscribers, it's unclear so far if the impact of COVID-19 will materially alter recent trends. We know that a few major distributors have publicly expressed a bearish outlook for their video subs. And there will no doubt be recessionary economic pressures across a significant number of pay-TV households in the near term.
These factors alone would likely exacerbate the recent trends in subscriber declines. But we also know from Nielsen Ratings that more people are consuming TV right now, particularly in the news category. And we know there is strong pent-up demand for live and event programming that is the cornerstone of our portfolio brands, beginning, for example, with the return of NASCAR in just 11 days. While the bias would have to lean toward near-term pressure on subscriber levels, how all of these factors interact and get reflected in subscriber numbers will become more clear as the year progresses.
I'll wrap up my comments where I started. Fox is in a strong position to weather this turmoil. Our outsized exposure to news, a genre that should be less impacted than others, and the timing of the sports that we broadcast has curbed the immediate impact on us so far. We entered this crisis in a position of financial strength, and we remain well capitalized and highly liquid. Our steadfastly conservative financial management and our strong free cash flow profile underpin the company's balance sheet, even with the uncertainty around the shape and pace of the economic recovery in the United States. As we emerge, Fox's focused collection of brands skewed heavily towards live and event programming will be even more in demand by advertisers and audiences alike.
I am confident that we'll come out of this crisis as a stronger, more efficient and more agile company positioned for the future toward our continued goal of maximizing long-term shareholder value. And now I'll turn the call over to Steve."
546623668,664859456,2006774,"Fox Corporation, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, May 06, 2020",2020-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Fox Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. Let me start with a brief summary of our third quarter results before going on to discuss current trading conditions.As Lachlan mentioned earlier, Q3 was a clear demonstration of Fox's financial strength. The company",1742,"Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. Let me start with a brief summary of our third quarter results before going on to discuss current trading conditions.
As Lachlan mentioned earlier, Q3 was a clear demonstration of Fox's financial strength. The company reported total revenues of $3.44 billion, up 25% over the comparative period in fiscal 2019, reflecting revenue growth across all operating segments. Total company advertising revenues increased 44%, led by the broadcast of Super Bowl 54, while total company affiliate revenues increased 10%, demonstrating the strength of our brands and our focused portfolio of channels. We achieved double-digit affiliate revenue growth despite the rate of net subscriber declines of just over 5%.
Quarterly EBITDA was $920 million, and notwithstanding the comparison to carve out financials in the prior year period, still represented growth of 20%, led by increases of the television and cable network programming segment, partially offset by the impact of corporate expenses at the other segment. The increase in these expenses reflects the full costs of Fox operating as a stand-alone public company in the current year versus the presentation of carve-out financial statement in the prior year quarter.
From a bottom line perspective, net income attributable to stockholders of $78 million or $0.13 a share was lower than the $529 million or $0.85 per share in the prior year quarter. This decline was primarily due to the change in fair value of the company's investments recognized in other net. Most notably, the book loss incurred following the sale of our stake in Roku in March.
From an economic perspective, the Roku sale, which equated to 9x our initial investment, delivered a posttax gain relative to initial cash investment of approximately $300 million and strategically allowed us to convert a minority shareholding into the full ownership of leading AVOD player Tubi.
Excluding this impact and other noncore items, adjusted EPS of $0.93 was up significantly compared to last year's $0.76 per share, reflecting the growth in EBITDA, partially offset by higher net interest expense, which as we have flagged in the past, primarily reflects interest on the stand-alone debt structure of Fox versus the carve-out presentation in the prior year quarter.
So now turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter, where cable EBITDA of $792 million was up 7% on revenue growth of 6%. As expected, we saw growth in cable affiliate revenues accelerate to 4% as the impact of new distribution agreements and higher average rates across essentially all of our brands was partially offset by the net decrease in pay television subscribers. This growth also reflects the launch of FOX News and Fox Business on Sling late last year. Cable advertising revenues increased 10%, led by results at FOX News Media, including the impact of higher ratings and continued strength in our digital sales, partially offset by high preemptions associated with breaking news coverage.
Segment advertising growth was also impacted by fewer live NASCAR events at Fox Sports 1 due to the postponement of early season races as a result of COVID-19. Other cable revenues grew by $18 million, driven by contractual sports sublicensing revenues, primarily associated with college basketball content in the quarter. EBITDA at our cable segment increased 7% over the prior year, reflecting these higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses. Fox News Media costs were up in the quarter due to coverage of the presidential primaries and continued digital investment in FOX Nation, which were partially offset in the segment by lower programming rights amortization of Fox Sports 1 from fewer live NASCAR events. The quarter also included onetime costs at FOX Sports and FOX News Media related to the production of shoulder programming leading up to the broadcast of Super Bowl 54.
The Television segment reported EBITDA of $224 million, an increase of $125 million over the prior year quarter on revenue growth of 41%. The revenue growth was led by a 56% increase in television advertising revenues, including the impact across our network and stations from Super Bowl Sunday. Excluding the impact of the Super Bowl and the impact of one less NFL divisional playoff game compared to the prior year, advertising revenues would have been up 1%, primarily due to strong CPM growth for FOX Network and higher political advertising revenues at the Fox Television Stations. These were partially offset by the impact of COVID-19 on our local stations during the closing weeks of the quarter.
Television affiliate revenues increased 22% in the period, reflecting double-digit increases for both our programming fees from nonowned station affiliates and direct retransmission revenues at our owned and operated stations. EBITDA at our Television segment increased $125 million over the prior year, reflecting these higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses. The increase in expenses was driven by programming rights amortization and production and costs associated with the broadcast of Super Bowl 54, partially offset by the impact of the rotating NFL divisional playoff game and prior year programming write-downs.
Similar to our second quarter, we continued to make investments in programming, which included our first year of WWE content, the expansion of original entertainment programming and our participation in coproduction arrangements with third-party studios. Finally, from a P&L perspective, the net EBITDA loss in our other segment amounted to $96 million, which reflects the full quarter of stand-alone cost as opposed to the carve-out basis of presentation in the corresponding quarter of the prior year. We still expect the net EBITDA loss in our other segment to be in the mid-to-high $300 million range for the full fiscal year.
Turning now to cash flow. As expected, our free cash flow generation in the quarter of more than $1.5 billion was strong, supported by the collection of advertising revenues from our fall programming and the fact that our sports rights payments were concentrated in prior quarters. As a reminder, we calculate free cash flow as net cash used in operating activity plus cash invested in property, plant and equipment.
As part of our balanced approach to capital allocation, in March, we closed on the previously announced Nexstar Television stations transaction at a net purchase price of approximately $300 million. We also generated net proceeds of approximately $340 million from the sale of our stake in Roku, which was earmarked from the acquisition of Tubi for approximately $445 million in net cash consideration at closing last month.
During the quarter, we purchased 3.9 million Class A and 2.9 million Class B shares for $173 million. Against our buyback authorization of $2 billion, we have now cumulatively repurchased $600 million, representing nearly 3% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in November. Given the current uncertain economic conditions, we have not bought back shares since the onset of the crisis.
From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $3.2 billion in cash and $6.8 billion in debt. Since then, out of an abundance of caution, we took the opportunity to add to our already strong liquidity position by raising $1.2 billion of 5-year and 10-year notes in April, which was significantly oversubscribed. The weighted average cost of this new issuance was approximately 3.3%, thereby making it attractive from a cost perspective to essentially prefund our $750 million maturity due in January '22.
So with the combined benefits of strong free cash flow and liquidity, moderate leverage and the absence of any debt maturity for almost 2 years, we face the challenges of COVID-19 from a position of financial strength. As Lachlan mentioned, while we are very proud of the operational and the financial results that we have achieved, we're acutely aware of the impact of COVID-19 and the challenges it presents to all of our businesses and all of our stakeholders. We note that there are a number of moving variables, among them the outlook for the gradual reopening of the economy, the timing in the return of sporting events and the evolution of the upfront advertising cycle that make it difficult to forecast our business beyond the very short term.
As such, our commentary today will focus only on our fiscal fourth quarter and only on advertising revenues, which is where we are seeing the most significant impact to our business. The most immediate impact has been on advertising revenue at our local television stations, where inventory is sold essentially on a spot basis and many of our advertising partners operate in sectors most displaced by COVID-19. If pacing continues at current levels, we would expect our local advertising to be down by approximately 50% as against prior year.
Meanwhile, our News and Entertainment businesses are expected to be more insulated in the immediate term. News is being supported by strong ratings, the growth of its digital properties, the category mix of its core advertisers, along with the new advertising clients it is attracting that help partially offset decline from the legacy advertising base. At Entertainment, we are already substantially through the broadcast season with our advertising revenues well supported by inventory that was sold during last year's upfront and, until recently, a strong scatter market. So before we get to our Sports business, the collective Q4 impact of weaker advertising demand at our local TV stations, national news and entertainment businesses is anticipated to be around $200 million to $240 million or 25% to 30% compared to prior year. Across these businesses, we do not anticipate COVID-19 having a meaningful impact on Q4 costs.
Now turning to our Sports business, where uncertainty around schedule makes it impossible to forecast top line impact. However, it is worth pointing out that we typically amortize the associated rights fees and production expenses on our P&L when the games or events actually air on our networks. So from a bottom line perspective, foregone advertising revenues from events being postponed is often offset by the P&L expense benefit of not having the rights cost.
Although these uncertainties make it challenging for us to estimate the future performance of our businesses, as Lachlan mentioned in his our financial results to illustrate, the company entered this crisis in a position of operating and financial strength. We will continue to manage our business and balance sheet in a disciplined and conservative manner so that we emerge as well positioned as possible to take advantage of opportunities during the recovery.
And with that, I'd now like to turn the call back to Joe."

I've always said you're a super nimble company, very entrepreneurial. And out of all of this, maybe there's some opportunity. I'm just wondering if you're thinking about longer-term changes in your business where you can find more efficiencies.
And then more immediately, what can you say in terms of sports? Well, I mean, WWE is still on. Can you talk about what the ratings have been and what the advertising has been? I'm just wondering sports without fans, does it change the demand in advertising? NFL is supposed to announce their schedule tomorrow. Do you think that will impact the advertising demand?"

There are variations of one, but I'll answer them both, and I appreciate them both. So in terms of efficiencies, I think what we have -- because we are in such a strong position, we haven't looked at how we drive efficiencies in terms of a specific COVID-19 impact. Our employees are fully engaged in running each of their businesses. Our businesses are all fully operational. And as you know, when we separated from Disney, we went through a process at that time of really creating what we felt was a very efficient platform from which to go forward.
Having said that, we've looked at how we produce sports, how we produce news, how we operate as a team, many of our corporate functions. And we've learned the lessons from telecommuting, working in more flexible and more innovative ways. And we think, absolutely, going forward, there are significant ways we can be more efficient and more agile as a company, as I mentioned in my earlier comments. So there is a process we're working through. It's a process we're working through before COVID-19. And we certainly see that there's opportunities there.
From a sports perspective, look, we're very pleased, obviously, with the return of NASCAR on May 17. We've seen a very strong demand from our clients to be associated with and to market within that race and within future races. So we're very pleased with what we see from an advertiser demand. We have worked, I should say, with our clients over the last 6 weeks incredibly closely, engaged through -- not physically closely, but digitally closely, engaged in literally hundreds of teleconferences. We're taking them through the marketplace, having us understand the impact of COVID-19 on their businesses and how we can help them as we come out of this health crisis going forward. That process is now evolving where we can now have much more specific conversations with them, particularly about the fall.
We're pleased that the NFL will be releasing their schedule 8:00 tomorrow night Eastern Time. That obviously gives us a trigger to be much more specific in our conversations with our clients. But we are seeing tremendous pent-up demand for sports programming and live event programming. As for the WWE, I have to give a shoutout to the WWE. They have done a tremendous job delivering us live content, week in, week out, under very difficult circumstances. And we're very appreciative of them for it. So thank you, Jessica."

And I was curious, just given how much the ecosystem has evolved since then, if you continue to be confident you can deliver on those expectations, realizing that the world has changed quite a bit.
And then secondly, I can't remember, John, how you phrased it, but something to the effect of, we're going to be cautious with buybacks and conservative with our balance sheet sort of for a rainy day or for a change in the cycle and be opportunistic. And we've certainly arrived at that point, I think you would agree.

And we've talked before about our direct-to-consumer strategy. We were very pleased with both our kind of authenticated strategy through FOX NOW. It's obviously an authenticated platform for our product but also with the strength and the growth in FOX Nation. I should say FOX Nation has had -- I think April was the second strongest month for FOX Nation, and it continues, which is interesting as it gets bigger, to achieve an over-80% conversion rate from free trialists into paying subscribers. So the consumers of FOX Nation are absolutely enjoying and paying for that product as it grows. So -- and we've talked before about Fox Bet and Credible as a part of our direct-to-consumer strategy.
But as far as Tubi goes, we feel that we are not getting back into the entertainment production -- original production business through Tubi. We see our existing slate of brands as being very important to the growth of Tubi. What we can do both through the entertainment network and its content, you can see today. The #1 television show on Tubi is The Marked Singer and is driving a lot of important viewership and advertising impressions. And what we can do with sports and news and our local stations in the future, we think, is very exciting. So Tubi has a great business. It's grown 150% year-on-year in terms of in terms of video hours viewed, but we can make it an even greater business. And we're getting to know the team, and we like them a lot. We think they're going to do great things. So -- but it is important that it's our brands, and Tubi's distribution, I think, is going to really be very exciting.
On the NFL, obviously, COVID-19, we haven't been able to sit down across the table with the NFL to discuss their future plans and the renewal of our deals. We have been in contact with the NFL every day about a whole range of other things. So we remain very close to them. There's nothing that we see in the marketplace today that makes us feel any differently about the value of our partnership with the NFL. They've been a tremendous partner of ours for over 25 years. And we've built our business as they've built theirs, and we look forward to that continuing for many years to come."

I understand the process is very different this year, and there's a tremendous amount of flexibility.

So as I mentioned before, I think with Jessica's question, we've been fully engaged with our clients and ad agencies over the last 6 weeks. We don't see that changing. We don't see a virtual singular upfront as the right thing to do today because all of our clients are affected by COVID-19 in different ways. And they will all emerge from their COVID-19 impacts in different ways. So for example, our retail clients or our auto clients will emerge from COVID-19 in a very different way from, say, our financial services or insurance clients. Entertainment will be very different from telecom or professional services.
And so it's important for us as we've engaged with them to understand what their needs are and to tailor our partnership with them in very unique and specific ways, and that will continue. Obviously, there are triggers to those conversations, such as the NFL schedule being released, such as NASCAR being back on air and on the track. And those are exciting milestones. But we'll continue to work closely with each of our clients and work to their specific needs to work them into our schedule.
I think one of the key things to remember, Alexia, is, aside from the sports schedule, which is starting to take shape, our entertainment schedule in the fall looks incredibly stable, really thanks to a large amount of our programming already being filmed and edited and in entertainment phrase ""in the can.""
The only open question in our fall entertainment schedule is whether we get Masked Singer back into production in time for a fall schedule or for a mid-season schedule. The rest of our schedule -- and by the way, I should mention, I think I did in my earlier comments, the fact that animation is virtually -- the production schedule of our animation is virtually untouched, knock on wood, by COVID-19 has been a great boon to us. So we are very confident and pleased that we have a strong entertainment schedule in the fall.
Now this, of course, the elephant in the room is the tremendous ratings of news. Our news ratings are the strongest they've ever been. The demographics within those ratings within that viewership is younger and as attractive as it's ever been, and we're very pleased with that. So it's not just about sports, sports coming back, but it's about news and entertainment that we are very confident, and we'll have a strong quarter."

And the second question, Lachlan, I was going to ask, it seems like you have an idiosyncratic mix of acquisitions to-date, and what should we expect next in terms of M&A?

One is expanding our existing strength on our existing base. So for example, if I look at Tubi and I think of the digital video impressions that they garner us, we can both strengthen Tubi from a content point of view, and we can strengthen them from an ad sales point of view. They benefit tremendously from the association with us. We think it's a tremendous acquisition that really plays to Fox strengths. But it's doing what we do today. It's putting with new technologies and advertising video-on-demand basis, puts our content in front of new markets with greater reach and gives more opportunity for our advertisers. So it's perhaps a simple strategy, but we think one that's really very exciting for us.
So one bucket is the businesses that are in our wheelhouse. They're expanding what we already do in an exciting way. The other, which you can put Credible and Fox Bet into those categories is how do we look at businesses that -- where we can monetize our existing audiences in different ways. So not -- so when you look at our revenues today, our revenue is equally split roughly between advertising and affiliate revenue to grow new revenue streams, less reliant on those 2 is an important goal of ours. Credible, we're incredibly excited. It's doubled in size over last year, doubled its loan volumes and doubled its revenue. And Fox Bet had an incredible Super Bowl. Obviously, since COVID-19, there's less sports being played, but I should say that part of that acquisition was an equity stake in TSG, which has done rather well with the merger with Flutter, which I should congratulate Peter Jackson for, which closed on Monday.
So those businesses are really about getting -- those best strategies are really about getting into new businesses based upon our existing audiences and serving our existing audiences in new ways."

I don't want to conflate the 2 because they're obviously different. But clearly, when we talk about our projections for a 50% reduction in local advertising, that's a mix of all sorts of different categories, right? The categories that you would expect are being affected significantly worse by COVID-19, they're pacing below -- or say, worse than 50% below. So travel, entertainment, restaurants are all pacing worse than 50%. But that's ameliorated by many categories that are down significantly less than that. Professional services, insurance and some categories, frankly, that are up, like pharmaceutical. So it's a real mix.
Again, as we said before, we can't really say from a local perspective, how local markets are going to recover. It will be state by state as various states and municipalities lift their shelter-at-home orders. But we are beginning to see positive signs in the pacing going forward. Over the last 2 weeks -- now, I'm not talking including national, over the last couple weeks, we have seen a severe lessening of requests for flexibility with advertising. I think people -- advertisers and marketers are starting to look forward into the first quarter of next fiscal year and are beginning to think about how they market and get their products and their brands in front of our consumers again. So we're just -- it's early days, but we're just beginning to see that positive shift.
As to political advertising, despite the impact of COVID-19 in the last couple weeks of the third quarter, the third quarter still was a record political year for us -- sorry, quarter for us -- the third quarter for us. Fourth quarter always is a trough as the advertising start -- political advertising starts to pick up again in the first fiscal quarter of the next fiscal year. So we expect that trend to continue. We expect the political advertising to ramp up in the first quarter of the next fiscal year. And we believe we are still on track for a record political season. The reason we say that is, if you look at our markets, obviously, it's going to be a hard-fought election. We have 9 of our 18 markets or about half our markets are battleground states, including Arizona, Florida, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, to some extent also Georgia, Michigan and Minnesota. Ten of our markets have U.S. Senate races. I won't list them all. And 2 of our markets have gubernatorial races. Of course, the House has contests in every market.
So we think our markets are -- I wouldn't say fortuitously, but are certainly positioned well to capture a lion's share of the political revenue really in the first quarter of the next fiscal year."

Good afternoon, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter results and to reflect on our first full fiscal year as new Fox. I know a lot of you on the phone have had a long day and have just come from another earnings call, so we will try to keep this as tight and as brief as possible. 
I doubt any of us consider 2020 a great calendar year. It's been extraordinarily difficult on our businesses, on our health and on our families. I'm sure it's a year we would all like to be through and done with, and we will be soon. 
But looking back on Fox's 2020 fiscal year is another story. Our fiscal year has been extraordinary, not because of COVID-19, but in spite of it, our 2020 fiscal year has shown off the strengths of Fox, the logic of our strategy and the resilience of our business model and of our teams. To that last point, I would like to acknowledge the outstanding work and dedication of my Fox colleagues across the country. They, too, are extraordinary. Without them, there would be no sport, no news and no entertainment on our platforms and stations. 
What together we achieved last year was remarkable. I'd like to first give FOX Sports a shout out for an incredible year, which saw the brilliant broadcast of both the historic 7-game World Series and an exciting Super Bowl 54 watched by over 100 million people. Of course, not long after the Super Bowl in Miami, sport was shut down. But the team at FOX Sports never stopped working to bring NASCAR, baseball and eventually football back into America's living rooms. 
On our last earnings call, I said, like the rest of America, we can't wait for the first pitch thrown, the first ball hike and the sound of engines starting again. Thankfully, the wait was not long. Our FOX Sports production team lost no time preparing to produce America's biggest events in ways we didn't think possible just a few months before. The sports team has invented new technologies to not only produce but enhance the games being played today. 
NASCAR was the first major American sport to return from its pandemic hiatus, and America's pent-up demand for sports was palpable. Working closely with NASCAR, FOX Sports design and production had involves minimum crews, minimum travel and maximum health protocols to ensure a safe and enduring race season. We brought NASCAR back using only 1/3 of the people we would normally have [ tracks on. ] Our director and camera operators and audio were on site, while graphics, replays, producers and talent were spread out between Charlotte and Los Angeles. With very few or no fans on the track, it allowed us to break new ground with miniature drones flying overhead to get never before seen aerial footage. As the season progressed, even our in-car audio production and feature editing were produced live in technicians' homes. 
We then turned our attention to baseball when, on July 23, the Fox baseball season opened with a triple header highlighted by 2.8 million viewers for the Yankees/Nationals game. The opening was up almost 20% over Fox's prime time Major League Baseball average last year and was sold out due to heavy advertising demand. We produced 4 baseball games on our first weekend, and none of the 7 talent were in the same place as we connected 10 different facilities in real time with our producers and directors in Los Angeles. In addition to our enhanced crowd audio, we have now introduced computer-generated virtual fans to the stadium. This innovation was created by mixing our first down line technology and real-time theatrical visual effects. 
And now we can't wait until the start of football. 
We love sports for the adrenaline, it provides us, for the passion it inspires in us and for the narrative and drama of watching the classic underdog win from behind. Team U.S.A., beating the Soviet ice hockey team at the 1980 Winter Olympics or Buster Douglas knocking out Tyson or the FOX Entertainment network finishing the broadcast season in first place from fourth the year prior. The network staged a dramatic comeback this past year and leapfrogged our competitors to regain the #1 broadcast network title for the first time in 8 years. Fox was the only network to deliver year-over-year ratings gains among adults 18 to 49 and total viewers. We outperformed the #2 network by 31% in the demo, driven by The Masked Singer, Lego Masters and 9-1-1 Lone Star, the season's #1 new scripted show. 
And the network will also have a robust and stable entertainment lineup in the fall. We will debut 2 new series that were shot and ready to air before the pandemic, the psychological thriller, Next; and the Southern soap opera, Filthy Rich. We remain hopeful that The Masked Singer's fourth season will also be on air for the [ fall. ] Of course, animation has always been a strength of Fox, and earlier in the fiscal year, FOX Entertainment brought the Bento Box animation studio into the Fox family. Bento Box was a natural addition to enhance the capabilities of FOX Entertainment and has already proven to be an impactful investment. It's important to note that animation production has not been significantly impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. Not only did we renew Bento Box's [indiscernible] show, Bob's Burgers for an 11th season on Fox, BentoBox is also producing 11 new animated shows, including for third-party customers such as Netflix and HBO Max. These new shows follow the May launch of Central Park Bento Box's Apple TV+ Comedy Series. 
More recently, in April, we completed our acquisition of the advertising video-on-demand platform, Tubi. Tubi has seen phenomenal growth since it joined Fox. In June, it surpassed 200 million hours streamed per month, representing more than 100% growth year-over-year. During the fourth quarter, several Fox hit shows were added to Tubi, with The Masked Singer quickly becoming Tubi's #1 streamed series. Tubi's young and diverse audience gives it a unique appeal with advertisers seeking to connect with consumers that are traditionally more challenging to reach. Tubi complements Fox portfolio and underscores our long-term strategic initiative to broaden and enhance direct-to-consumer digital reach and engagement while providing advertising partners with more opportunities to engage audiences at scale. During this year's [ upfront ] season, we have begun selling Tubi advertising alongside broadcast, significantly expanding our clients' reach. According to [indiscernible] research company, 87% of the Tubi audience cannot be reached by cable television. They are young and diverse with a median age of only 34. It's a great business and a great fit with Fox. 
Another business that's had an extraordinary year is FOX News, which ended fiscal year 2020 with a record-breaking viewership. In June 2020, FOX News was the leading prime time network in all of television among total viewers, making it the first cable network to ever lead all broadcast networks in ratings for an entire month. For the fiscal year, we were again the #1 talent in all of cable for total viewers across prime and total day. Now I could say that's another extraordinary achievement, but the etymologist in me won't allow it. That's because FOX News has been the #1 channel in all cable for 4 years running and the #1 channel in cable news for 18 years. We have a long track record of succeeding through multiple economic and political cycles and during administrations of both political parties. We are pacing calendar 2020 to have our highest-rated prime time year in network history with total viewers up 39% over 2019. Our content programs are now routinely notching around 4 million viewers a night. Though not a head-to-head comparison, the FOX News channel is eclipsing broadcast new star works like Today, Good Morning America, CBS This Morning and Meet the Press in viewership. 
And viewers are coming to us not just for news and opinion, but increasingly for documentary and lifestyle programming on platforms such as FOX Nation and FoxNews.com. In fact, FOX Nation more than doubled its subscriber base this fiscal year, sustaining a trial to pay conversion rate of over 80% and a monthly churn rate of under 10%. Momentum built as the year progressed, with content starts up over 120% and hours watched up over 170% in the second half of the fiscal year compared to the first half. 
Within FOX News, we have also organically cultivated one of the most impactful digital platforms in country. FOX News Media targeted its highest digital traffic in fiscal year 2020, with record total digital page views and a record time spent. Users viewed over 40 billion pages and spent 98 billion minutes on our FOX News digital platforms. We expect this trend to accelerate as we head into election season in November. The fall will be busy for our news organizations at FOX News and at our stations. Later this month, FOX News will bring viewers coverage to the Democratic and Republican national conventions and what reform they take. And as we close in on November, we expect to continue to achieve a record amount of political revenue across both our national channels and local stations. 
It's important to note that according to a study by Nielsen MRI Fusion, FOX News has more than doubled the number of independent viewers than CNN, 119% more to be exact. And we have 62% more independent viewers than MSNBC. This points clearly through our highly trusted, balanced news reporting and is a key differentiator between us and our competitors for political advertising. In the political cycle today, inclusive of the impact of COVID-19, our political advertising revenue is pacing more than 50% ahead of the equivalent period 4 years ago. We are encouraged by recent trends in our local markets and expect healthy political demand up and down the ballot in the coming quarters. 9 of our 18 stations are in presidential battleground space. These are led by Arizona, Florida, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, but also include Georgia, Michigan and Minnesota. We have senate races in 10 markets and lower house races in all, a number of which are expected to be close and highly contested. 
[indiscernible] political revenue has already offset some of the impact from COVID-19 in local markets. While our top 7 markets where businesses have not yet fully reopened, we are now pacing overall down 29% at the start of Q1. Our next 11 markets are together pacing down just 4%. That's a tremendous recovery from what we were seeing just a couple of months ago. And 3 of our markets are now pacing well ahead of last year. These are Atlanta, Tampa and Phoenix. Not coincidentally, these are all strong political markets. 
The fourth quarter saw affiliate revenues grow by 8%, where healthy rate increases were offset by a decline in subscriber volumes of around 6.5%. For the full fiscal year, our total company affiliate revenues increased 7%, an important illustration of our brand's prominence and strength with audiences and distribution partners alike. This past year, we have completed significant distribution agreements, including an early renewal with Comcast as well as new deals with Verizon, Cox, Charter and YouTube TV, among others, each with rate increases that underscore the importance of our channels. 
As we articulated more than a year ago during our Investor Day and as we've demonstrated with our disciplined and intentional acquisitions to date, we are taking a deliberate and selective approach to M&A and strong businesses fit within our vision, are well-executed and properly integrated with the rest of the company. We continually assess opportunities to deepen our strengths by expanding logic business and the types of operations at which we excel. Our goal remains to expand the ways our audiences interact with and connect to our brands while simultaneously diversify each brand's sources of revenue. 
But before turning things over to Steve, let me reinforce one key point as we mark the end of our first fiscal year. The assets and businesses of Fox were deliberately composed for efficient growth and success in the current media environment. The stability and trajectory of the company are underscored by the revenue structure and unrivaled viewer engagement. Fox demonstrated consistent clarity of vision by assembling the portfolio we have and by evolving to embrace opportunities in order to meet the challenges of our time. We entered the COVID-19 crisis on firm footing financially, strategically and operationally. Our innovative thinking in combination with the tailwinds of the upcoming fall sports and entertainment seasons and ongoing need for live news, analysis and opinion will see Fox emerge from this pandemic [indiscernible] year more competitive, more focused and even more strongly positioned to deliver for our viewers, our partners and our shareholders. 
And now Steve will take us through the detail. Thank you."

Despite the broader macroeconomic factors affecting our businesses, as Lachlan just highlighted, our first fiscal year as a stand-alone public company demonstrates that we are delivering on the strategies that we outlined at the time of the spin and that truly differentiate Fox. Let me now take you through our financial results for the fiscal year as well as the fourth quarter. I'll also take a few minutes to review the key investments we've made since the spin before concluding with some financial markets for the months ahead. 
Our full year results saw total revenues increased 8% to $12.3 billion. This revenue growth was broad-based and led by affiliate revenue growth of 7% on the back of retransmission revenue increases at the television segment. We delivered this industry-leading affiliate revenue growth, [ provide ] an uptick in the rate of net subscriber declines. Using fiscal '19 as a base, we renewed 70% of total affiliate revenue in fiscal '20. Looking forward, a renewal profile in the immediate future is significantly lighter, with around 5% of total fiscal '20 affiliate revenue due for renewal in each of fiscal '21 and 22. 
Full year advertising revenues increased 5%, led by our broadcast of Super Bowl 54. Partially offsetting this growth was the impact of COVID-19 in recent months. As we foreshadowed in May, the impact was more pronounced at our local television stations as well as FOX Sports due to the postponement of live events and at FOX Entertainment as new scripted programs were held back for our full schedule. We also increased other revenues nearly 30%, primarily through the consolidation of Bento Box at the television segment beginning in August and the consolidation of Credible in our other segment beginning in October. 
Total full year adjusted EBITDA was $2.8 billion, an increase of 4% over the prior year. This growth was delivered despite the negative comparison to the accounting benefit from certain shared services and overhead costs being presented on a carve-out basis in the first 3 quarters of the prior year. Full year net income attributable to stockholders was $1 billion or $1.62 a share while adjusted EPS was $2.48 versus $2.63 last year. Again, the year-on-year comparison is impacted by the treatment of certain shared services and overhead costs in the prior year in accordance with SEC guidelines. 
Turning to the fourth quarter. Total company revenues were $2.4 billion, down 4% versus last year as COVID-19 related declines in our advertising revenues overwhelmingly influenced by declines in our local television stations, and to a lesser extent, of the FOX Network, more than offset affiliate revenue growth of 8%. We indicated on our May call that we expected the COVID-related advertising headwinds across our business in the June quarter, excluding sports, to be in the $200 million to $240 million range with the local market being down approximately 50%. We ended the quarter ahead of these expectations with our advertising revenue down approximately $160 million across these businesses, with the local market down closer to 35% and FOX News advertising revenues actually posting a year-on-year gain. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $742 million, a 5% increase over the $709 million generated last year, led by higher contributions from the cable segment. This growth was partially offset in our Television segment due to the COVID-19 related advertising weakness. From a bottom line perspective, net income attributable to stockholders of $122 million or $0.20 per share was lower than the $0.73 per share in the prior year quarter, most notably due to the higher impairment and restructuring charges, including the negotiated settlement to exit our rights agreement with the USGA. Controlling for this and other noncore items in both years, adjusted EPS of $0.62 was consistent with the prior year quarter. 
Now turning to the operating performance of our segments for the fourth quarter, with cable networks EBITDA of $674 million, was up 12% despite revenue being down 2%. The lower cable segment revenues were most notably due to a $22 million or 8% decline in our advertising revenues, including the impact of the postponement of live events at our sports networks and the absence of the FIFA Women's World Cup compared to the fourth quarter last year. Meanwhile, higher ratings and pricing helped to grow advertising revenues at Fox News Media in the quarter. Cable affiliate revenues increased 1%, supported by higher average rates, partially offset by a net decrease in pay television subscribers. Other revenues were down 31%, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 on our sports business, partially offset by higher Fox Nation and radio revenues at Fox News media. EBITDA at our cable segment increased 12% over the prior period, most notably reflecting lower sports programming rights amortization and production costs due to the postponement, the life events and the absence of the FIFA Women's World Cup compared to the fourth quarter of last year. 
Our Television segment reported EBITDA of $169 million, down from the $214 million reported in the prior year quarter as revenue declines of 6% were partially offset by expenses that decreased nearly 3%. Television affiliate revenues grew 22%, consistent with the overall trajectory we outlined at our Investor Day in May of 2019. Television advertising revenues declined 29%, primarily from the impact of the pandemic on the local advertising market at the FOX Television Station and the postponement of live events at FOX Sports. 
Furthermore, in response to COVID-19, we deferred the planned spring premiers of certain scripted programs at FOX Entertainment into our full schedule. These COVID-led declines more than offset the growth in affiliate revenues along with revenue growth from our new businesses, Tubi and Bento Box. The decrease in expenses primarily reflects lower programming amortization across FOX Sports and FOX Entertainment from not airing sports events or first run program, partially offset by the consolidation of Tubi and Bento Box. We expect the majority of the amortization-related savings to be timing related with costs expected to shift into our fiscal '21 financials, but more on that in a moment. In aggregate, we estimated that COVID-19 created an EBITDA headwind of approximately $15 million in the quarter across our entire business. 
Finally, from a P&L perspective, the net EBITDA loss in our other segment amounted to $101 million, a slight improvement from the comparable quarter in the prior year. Meanwhile, our P&L tax rate ended the year at 27%. The strong overall P&L results generated free cash flow, which we calculate as net cash provided by operating activities, less cash invested in property, plant and equipment of over $850 million in the quarter and $2 billion for the year. This equates to over 70% EBITDA to free cash flow conversion in the year, demonstrating the robust free cash flow profile we outlined at our Investor Day. And from an overall balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with over $4.6 billion in cash and just under $8 billion in debt, which includes the $1.2 billion in 5- and 10-year senior notes that we raised this past quarter. 
In the 16 months since the spin, we've invested approximately $1.25 billion into our businesses through organic investments in our core operations, including the recent relaunch of our FOX Sports digital properties, and through strategic M&A. This latter group and our minority investments in acquisitions are worth highlighting given their inherent value to Fox that is not reflected in simple EBITDA multiple based valuations. 
At our 2019 Investor Day, we announced a strategic partnership with The Stars Group. At the time, we invested approximately $240 million in the publicly traded TSG and licensed our brand to the Fox Bet suite of pay-to-play and free-to-play games. As part of the partnership, we have an option over 50 -- of up to 50% of the equity in TSG's U.S. businesses. Subsequent to TSG's merger with Flutter and our incremental equity investment of approximately $100 million, we now own roughly 3% of parent company, Flutter, at a current market valuation of more than $600 million. We retain our up to 50% call option over TSG's U.S. businesses, but in addition, have also secured the right to buy an approximately 18.5% equity stake in Sanju with an exercise period of 10 years. 
Last October, we completed the acquisition of a 67% stake in Credible Labs, an emerging fintech marketplace, which was a key part of the Fox business brand refresh and is now in the early stages of integrating alongside our national and local news assets. Since announcement, Credible -- since announcement, Credible's trailing 12-month revenue has grown from approximately $40 million that are reported as a stand-alone public company to approximately $70 million through the June quarter, with this momentum supporting our confidence to continue to invest cross promotional resources in growing the platform. 
In April, we closed on the acquisition of Tubi, which we now report in our Television segment. Notwithstanding the challenges from COVID-19, we expect the boom in usage Lachlan outlined earlier, along with more effective monetization, to make Tubi a key source of revenue growth for many years to come. These recently acquired businesses, coupled with the renowned production capabilities in real estate of the Fox Studio lot and our tax asset collectively represents significant pools of below-the-line value, hiding in plain sight at Fox Corporation. 
Before we open the call up to Q&A, let me provide a few markets to help you navigate the financial suites across our businesses in fiscal 2021. Beginning with a reminder of the events [ that create ] comparability issues between FY '20 and FY '21, where fiscal 2020 included the Super Bowl, 7-Game World Series, the culmination of the FIFA Women's World Cup, along with Fox's Emmy Awards rotation. While fiscal 2021 will include what shapes to be a strong political year, the alternating NFC divisional playoff game and a full year consolidating our recent investments, including Tubi and Credible. 
Looking specifically at Q1, the combined effect of comparability in COVID is expected to reduce advertising revenue by roughly $250 million as compared to Q1 in fiscal 2020. While we will enjoy the benefits from political advertising, a greater volume of MLB regular season games and NASCAR races, along with the acquisition of Tubi, these will be more than offset by lower base advertising at our local stations, a reduced slate of fresh entertainment programming, fewer NFL and college football games in our Q1 schedule and the absence of the World Cup and the MLB All-Star game. 
You will recall that we amortize the cost of our live sports programming when the games actually air on our networks. As such, the postponement of the sports calendar in the June quarter creates a shift of amortization, primarily across MLB and NASCAR rights, into the first quarter of our fiscal '21. We anticipate that this will increase our total sports operating expenses in the September quarter by approximately $70 million in the cable segment, broadly offsetting other savings. This all, of course, assumes that the COVID-driven disruptions to major sports are behind us and that we enjoy a full season of NFL, a conference-only, 10-game college football season and the MLB season completes. These assumptions remain valid today, and we have no intention of using this call to run through the list of what is. We're in constant dialogue with our sports partners, and if circumstances change, we will take appropriate steps for the business. 
The same underlying fundamentals hold for FOX Entertainment, where we amortize the costs of our programming as the content is on our broadcast network. What we are now looking at is a 2021 broadcast season that includes a number of titles originally intended for our spring 2020 schedule shifted into the fall. Furthermore, we are optimistic that our key returning titles, including The Masked Singer, can be made available for mid-season returns. If this outlook holds, we could end up seeing a relatively full broadcast season, however, our programming amortization may not follow its normal cadence across quarters. Rather from an amortization standpoint, our fiscal Q1 and Q2 are likely to be lighter than a normal year, with a heavier concentration of costs being absorbed in Q4, again, pending the timing of a return to production. 
From a cash flow perspective, we are planning for a high level of capital expenditure in fiscal '21 and supporting the final phase of the build-out of our technical broadcast facility in Arizona and the upgrade of some of our station facilities. We will also have higher entertainments related to our debt [ raise ] this past quarter. Underscoring our financial strength and confidence from a capital allocation perspective, we today declare a semiannual $0.23 a share dividend payable on October 7, right in line with the pre-COVID dividend we declared in February. 
While the continued uncertainties make it challenging for us to estimate the future performance of our business, the company entered this crisis in a position of operating and financial strength. We will continue to manage our business and our balance sheet in a disciplined and conservative manner so that we emerge as well positioned as possible to take advantage of the opportunities during the recovery. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call back to Joe."

I think we feel today very well positioned both in having the joint venture in Fox Bet, which we -- as Steve mentioned, we have the option to go to 50% ownership of, depending on licensing. But we also have the [ $0.185 ] option to buy into the FanDuel. So we effectively have 2 dogs in the race, and we think that puts us in a great position. Moving forward, obviously, we have to see how the states open up from a regulatory point of view and as we move into each market. It's not necessarily the case that you'll have FanDuel and FOX Bet in all the markets. For example, we found in FOX Bet the best markets for us, and we've just -- we've just opened in Colorado, a market that have both sports betting but also gaming licenses. When you think about the funnel sort of monetize the customer, the consumer, we start with FOX Bet Super 6 as a free-to-play game. Those people, some of them will move through the funnel into our sports betting, the FOX Bet app or the FanDuel experience. And then a subset of those will actually go into our gaming environment when there's no sports betting being played. So look, we think the opportunity is huge and is something we'll continue to spend time on to drive to promote to FOX Sports and to invest in."

I think the thing -- well, the first thing I'd like to say is that the sales is very active at the moment, but it's a different sort of upfront this year for anyone, right, than in past years. I would call it sort of a rolling upfront. It's not a process that has a beginning, a middle and an end. We are working, as I think I said in the last call, with all of the agency group and each of our clients as they reengage with their -- with consumers and customers across our platforms, and so some have been much more heavily impacted by COVID-19 than others. Obviously, the categories that are affected, retail, theatrical entertainment, fast food restaurants. Obviously, travel are all highly impacted by COVID-19. So each of those clients, we're engaged with and sort of negotiating with as we go forward. I think what you'll see is we pose and as we have closed upfront negotiations, you'll see that going right up until really through to the beginning of the football season. And we are incredibly heartened by the strength of scatter in the market. I think some of the scatter across the board is in the mid- to high teens, and I think that shows the demand for marketers to get back on air in a mass market in a broad way. We are selling it across all of our platforms. news, sports, entertainment and Tubi. Tubi is now integrated in most, if not all, of our upfront conversations. When we add Tubi to a sale, it increases reached by over 20% for the client and also obviously makes the demographic younger and more diverse. 
And Jessica, to your question on FOX News, FOX News ratings have been astronomical. We are monetizing them very well. One of the benefits of COVID-19 has been with a larger news audience. The audience has also gotten younger, and that's brought actually new advertisers that hadn't advertised on FOX News advertisers onto the platform. So it's a very strong positive story for FOX News."

You've got to break it down, I suppose, for us, by vertical. There is a -- the news ratings are so far above last year's. And as I mentioned, we have new clients and new categories of clients on FOX News. So news demand is really driven by the audience and by the ratings there, so we're seeing tremendous demand in news. Obviously, it's going to be a continue to be an incredibly strong new cycle, I think, certainly through to the end of the year. There's no let up there. And I think advertisers are flocking to the certainty of those ratings in that audience. 
I think sports, there's a great pent-up demand for sport. We saw that in the sellout in Major League Baseball. We saw that when we brought back NASCAR, the advertiser interest in NASCAR, and we expect to see it with football going forward as well as we go through our upfront process. We have visibility in terms of what the clients are telling us that they expect to spend. And certainly, in news and sport, we're seeing healthy budgets there. I think entertainment is a different kettle of fish as people are waiting to see what happened in the fall season. As we explained earlier on the call, we have a relatively fresh scripted season with 2 shows that we had in the can that we had there. And we do hope to have massing -- or not for mid season, but for the fall, if possible. And that would be -- that will absolutely drive ratings and revenue there as well. 
When we look to the stations, the -- we're hardening to see how quickly local advertising is coming back, particularly in those smaller markets. So the bottom half of our -- I don't want to say bottom half, but the smaller half of our station group, where they have perhaps less sort of population, density less shutdowns due to COVID-19, and those markets are coming back well. And as I mentioned before, the markets that are really buoyed are the ones where this political revenue has started to pour in. So and then the overlay of all of that is obviously scatter being very strong, which I think just goes anecdotally to the demand by advertisers and clients to get back and sort of mass marketing."

Good afternoon, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter results and to reflect on our first full fiscal year as new Fox.  I know a lot of you on the phone have had a long day and have just come from another",2155,"Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter results and to reflect on our first full fiscal year as new Fox.  
I know a lot of you on the phone have had a long day and have just come from another earnings call, so we will try to keep this as tight and as brief as possible.  
I doubt any of us consider 2020 a great calendar year. It's been extraordinarily difficult on our businesses, on our health and on our families. I'm sure it's a year we would all like to be through and done with, and we will be soon.
But looking back on Fox's 2020 fiscal year is another story. Our fiscal year has been extraordinary, not because of COVID-19, but in spite of it, our 2020 fiscal year has shown off the strength of Fox, the logic of our strategy and the resilience of our business model and of our teams. 
To that last point, I would like to acknowledge the outstanding work and dedication of my Fox colleagues across the country. They too are extraordinary. Without them, there would be no sport, no news and no entertainment on our platforms and stations. 
What together we achieved last year was remarkable. I'd like to first give FOX Sports a shout out for an incredible year, which saw the brilliant broadcast of both the historic 7-game World Series and an exciting Super Bowl LIV, watched by over 100 million people. Of course, not long after the Super Bowl in Miami, sport was shut down. But the team at FOX Sports never stopped working to bring NASCAR, baseball and eventually football back into America's living rooms.  
On our last earnings call, I said, like the rest of America, we can't wait for the first pitch thrown, the first ball hike and the sound of engines starting again. Thankfully, the wait was not long. Our FOX Sports production team lost no time preparing to produce America's biggest events in ways we didn't think possible just a few months before. The sports team has invented new technologies to not only produce, but enhance the games being played today.  
NASCAR was the first major American sport to return from its pandemic hiatus, and America's pent-up demand for sports was palpable. Working closely with NASCAR, FOX Sports designed a production that involved minimum crews, minimum travel and maximum health protocols to ensure a safe and enduring race season. 
We brought NASCAR back using only 1/3 of the people we would normally have trackside. Our director and camera operators and audio were on site, while graphics, replays, producers and talent were spread out between Charlotte and Los Angeles. With very few or no fans on the track, it allowed us to break new ground with miniature drones flying overhead to get never before seen aerial footage. As the season progressed, even our in-car audio production and feature editing were produced live in technicians' homes.  
We then turned our attention to baseball, when, on July 23, the Fox baseball season opened, with a triple header highlighted by 2.8 million viewers for the Yankees/Nationals game. The opening was up almost 20% over Fox's prime time Major League Baseball average last year and was sold out due to heavy advertising demand. 
We produced 4 baseball games on our first weekend, and none of the 7 talent were in the same place as we connected 10 different facilities in real time with our producers and directors in Los Angeles. In addition to our enhanced crowd audio, we have now introduced computer-generated virtual fans to the stadium. This innovation was created by mixing our first down line technology and real-time theatrical visual effects. And now we can't wait until the start of football.  
We love sports for the adrenaline, it provides us, for the passion it inspires in us and for the narrative and drama of watching the classic underdog win from behind. Team U.S.A., beating the Soviet ice hockey team at the 1980 Winter Olympics or Buster Douglas knocking out Tyson or the FOX Entertainment network finishing the broadcast season in first place from fourth the year prior. 
The network staged a dramatic comeback this past year and leapfrogged our competitors to regain the #1 broadcast network title for the first time in 8 years. Fox was the only network to deliver year-over-year ratings gains among adults 18 to 49 and total viewers. We outperformed the #2 network by 31% in the demo, driven by The Masked Singer, LEGO Masters and 9-1-1: Lone Star, the season's #1 new scripted show. 
And the network will also have a robust and stable entertainment lineup in the fall. We will debut 2 new series that were shot and ready to air before the pandemic, the psychological thriller, NEXT; and the Southern soap opera, Filthy Rich. We remain hopeful that The Masked Singer's fourth season will also be on air for the fall. 
Of course, animation has always been a strength of Fox, and earlier in the fiscal year, FOX Entertainment brought the Bento Box animation studio into the Fox family. Bento Box was a natural addition to enhance the capabilities of FOX Entertainment and has already proven to be an impactful investment. It's important to note that animation production has not been significantly impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. 
Not only did we renew Bento Box's Emmy-winning show, Bob's Burgers for an 11th season on FOX, Bento Box is also producing 11 new animated shows, including for third-party customers such as Netflix and HBO Max. These new shows follow the May launch of Central Park, Bento Box's Apple TV+ Comedy Series.  
More recently, in April, we completed our acquisition of the advertising video-on-demand platform, Tubi. Tubi has seen phenomenal growth since it joined Fox. In June, it surpassed 200 million hours streamed per month, representing more than 100% growth year-over-year. During the fourth quarter, several Fox hit shows were added to Tubi, with The Masked Singer quickly becoming Tubi's #1 streamed series. 
Tubi's young and diverse audience gives it a unique appeal with advertisers seeking to connect with consumers that are traditionally more challenging to reach. Tubi complements Fox portfolio and underscores our long-term strategic initiative to broaden and enhance direct-to-consumer digital reach and engagement, while providing advertising partners with more opportunities to engage audiences at scale.  
During this year's upfront season, we have begun selling Tubi advertising alongside broadcast, significantly expanding our clients' reach. According to one research company, 87% of the Tubi audience cannot be reached by cable television. They are young and diverse with a median age of only 34. It's a great business and a great fit with Fox.
Another business that's had an extraordinary year is FOX News, which ended fiscal year 2020 with record-breaking viewership. In June 2020, FOX News was the leading prime time network in all of television among total viewers, making it the first cable network to ever lead all broadcast networks in ratings for an entire month. 
For the fiscal year, we were again the #1 channel in all of cable for total viewers across prime and total day. Now I could say that's another extraordinary achievement, but the etymologist in me won't allow it. That's because FOX News has been the #1 channel in all cable for 4 years running and the #1 channel in cable news for 18 years. 
We have a long track record of succeeding through multiple economic and political cycles and during administrations of both political parties. We are pacing calendar 2020 to have our highest-rated prime time year in network history, with total viewers up 39% over 2019. Our content programs are now routinely notching around 4 million viewers a night. Though not a head-to-head comparison, the FOX News channel is eclipsing broadcast news stalwarts like TODAY, Good Morning America, CBS This Morning and Meet the Press in viewership.  
And viewers are coming to us not just for news and opinion, but increasingly for documentary and lifestyle programming on platforms such as FOX Nation and FoxNews.com. In fact, FOX Nation more than doubled its subscriber base this fiscal year, sustaining a trial to pay conversion rate of over 80% and a monthly churn rate of under 10%. Momentum built as the year progressed, with content starts up over 120% and hours watched up over 170% in the second half of fiscal year compared to the first half.  
Within FOX News, we have also organically cultivated one of the most impactful digital platforms in the country. FOX News Media charted its highest digital traffic in fiscal year 2020, with record total digital page views and a record time spent. Users viewed over 40 billion pages and spent 98 billion minutes on our FOX News digital platforms. We expect this trend to accelerate as we head into election season in November. 
The fall will be busy for our news organizations at FOX News and at our stations. Later this month, FOX News will bring viewers coverage of the Democratic and Republican national conventions, in whatever form they take. And as we close in on November, we expect to continue to achieve a record amount of political revenue across both our national channels and local stations.  
It's important to note that according to a study by Nielsen MRI Fusion, FOX News has more than doubled the number of independent viewers than CNN, 119% more to be exact. And we have 62% more independent viewers than MSNBC. This points clearly to our highly trusted, balanced news reporting and is a key differentiator between us and our competitors for political advertising. 
In the political cycle today, inclusive of the impact of COVID-19, our political advertising revenue is pacing more than 50% ahead of the equivalent period 4 years ago. We are encouraged by recent trends in our local markets and expect healthy political demand up and down the ballot in the coming quarters. Nine of our 18 stations are a presidential battleground space. These are led by Arizona, Florida, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, but also include Georgia, Michigan and Minnesota. We have center races in 10 markets and lower house races in all, a number of which are expected to be close and hotly contested. 
Record political revenue has already offset some of the impact from COVID-19 in local markets. While our top 7 markets where businesses have not yet fully reopened, we are now pacing, overall, down 29% at the start of Q1. Our next 11 markets are together pacing down just 4%. That's a tremendous recovery from what we were seeing just a couple of months ago. And 3 of our markets are now pacing well ahead of last year. These are Atlanta, Tampa and Phoenix. Not coincidentally, these are all strong political markets. 
The fourth quarter saw affiliate revenues grow by 8%, where healthy rate increases were offset by a decline in subscriber volumes of around 6.5%. For the full fiscal year, our total company affiliate revenues increased 7%, an important illustration of our brand's prominence and strength with audiences and distribution partners alike. 
This past year, we have completed significant distribution agreements, including an early renewal with Comcast as well as new deals with Verizon, Cox, Charter and YouTube TV, among others, each with rate increases that underscore the importance of our channels.  
As we articulated more than a year ago during our Investor Day and as we've demonstrated with our disciplined and intentional acquisitions to date, we are taking a deliberate and selective approach to M&A and strong businesses fit within our vision, are well-executed and properly integrated with the rest of the company. We continually assess opportunities to deepen our strengths by expanding lines of business and the types of operations at which we excel. Our goal remains to expand the ways our audiences interact with and connect to our brands, while simultaneously diversifying each brand's sources of revenue.  
But before turning things over to Steve, let me reinforce one key point as we mark the end of our first fiscal year. The assets and businesses of Fox were deliberately composed for efficient growth and success in the current media environment. The stability and trajectory of the company are underscored by the revenue structure and unrivaled viewer engagement. Fox has demonstrated consistent clarity of vision by assembling the portfolio we have and by evolving to embrace opportunities in order to meet the challenges of our time.
We entered the COVID-19 crisis on firm footing financially, strategically and operationally. Our innovative thinking in combination with the tailwinds of the upcoming fall sports and entertainment seasons and ongoing need for live news, analysis and opinion will see Fox emerge from this pandemic-cost year more competitive, more focused and even more strongly positioned to deliver for our viewers, our partners and our shareholders.  
And now Steve will take us through a bit detailed. Thank you."

Despite the broader macroeconomic factors affecting our businesses, as Lachlan just highlighted, our first fiscal year as a stand-alone public company demonstrates that we are delivering on the strategies that we outlined at the time of the spin and that truly differentiate Fox. 
Let me now take you through our financial results for the fiscal year as well as the fourth quarter. I'll also take a few minutes to review the key investments we've made since the spin, before concluding with some financial markets for the months ahead.  
Our full year results saw total revenues increased 8% to $12.3 billion. This revenue growth was broad-based and led by affiliate revenue growth of 7% on the back of retransmission revenue increases at the television segment. We delivered this industry-leading affiliate revenue growth, despite an uptick in the rate of net subscriber declines. Using fiscal '19 as a base, we renewed 70% of total affiliate revenue in fiscal '20. Looking forward, the renewal profile in the immediate future is significantly lighter, with around 5% of total fiscal '20 affiliate revenue due for renewal in each of fiscal '21 and '22.
Full year advertising revenues increased 5%, led by our broadcast of Super Bowl LIV. Partially offsetting this growth was the impact of COVID-19 in recent months. As we foreshadowed in May, the impact was most pronounced at our local television stations as well as FOX Sports due to the postponement of live events and at FOX Entertainment as new scripted programs were held back for our fall schedule.  
We also increased other revenues nearly 30%, primarily through the consolidation of Bento Box at the television segment beginning in August and the consolidation of Credible in our other segment beginning in October.  
Total full year adjusted EBITDA was $2.8 billion, an increase of 4% over the prior year. This growth was delivered despite the negative comparison to the accounting benefit from certain shared services and overhead costs being presented on a carve-out basis in the first 3 quarters of the prior year. Full year net income attributable to stockholders was $1 billion or $1.62 a share, while adjusted EPS was $2.48 versus $2.63 last year. Again, year-on-year comparison is impacted by the treatment of certain shared services and overhead costs in the prior year in accordance with SEC guidelines.
Turning to the fourth quarter. Total company revenues were $2.4 billion, down 4% versus last year as COVID-19 related declines in our advertising revenues, overwhelmingly influenced by declines at our local television stations, and to a lesser extent, at the FOX Network, more than offset affiliate revenue growth of 8%. 
We indicated on our May call that we expected the COVID-related advertising headwinds across our business in the June quarter, excluding sports, to be in the $200 million to $240 million range, with the local market being down approximately 50%. We ended the quarter ahead of these expectations, with our advertising revenue down approximately $160 million across these businesses, with the local market down closer to 35% and FOX News advertising revenues actually posting a year-on-year gain.  
Adjusted EBITDA was $742 million, a 5% increase over the $709 million generated last year, led by higher contributions from the cable segment. This growth was partially offset in our Television segment due to the COVID-19-related advertising weakness. 
From a bottom line perspective, net income attributable to stockholders of $122 million or $0.20 per share was lower than the $0.73 per share in the prior year quarter, most notably due to the higher impairment and restructuring charges, including the negotiated settlement to exit our rights agreement with the USGA. Controlling for this and other noncore items in both years, adjusted EPS of $0.62 was consistent with the prior year quarter. 
Now turning to the operating performance of our segments for the fourth quarter, with Cable Networks' EBITDA of $674 million, was up 12% despite revenue being down 2%. The lower cable segment revenues were most notably due to a $22 million or 8% decline in our advertising revenues, including the impact of the postponement of live events at our sports networks and the absence of the FIFA Women's World Cup compared to the fourth quarter last year.
Meanwhile, higher ratings and pricing helped to grow advertising revenues at Fox News Media in the quarter. Cable affiliate revenues increased 1%, supported by higher average rates, partially offset by a net decrease in pay television subscribers. Other revenues were down 31%, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 on our sports business, partially offset by higher FOX Nation and radio revenues at FOX News Media. 
EBITDA at our cable segment increased 12% over the prior period, most notably reflecting lower sports programming rights amortization and production costs due to the postponement of live events and the absence of the FIFA Women's World Cup compared to the fourth quarter of last year. 
Our television segment reported EBITDA of $169 million, down from the $214 million reported in the prior year quarter. As revenue declines of 6% were partially offset by expenses that decreased nearly 3%. Television affiliate revenues grew 22%, consistent with the overall trajectory we outlined at our Investor Day in May of 2019. Television advertising revenues declined 29%, primarily from the impact of the pandemic on the local advertising market at the FOX Television Station and the postponement of live events at FOX Sports. 
Furthermore, in response to COVID-19, we deferred the planned spring premiers of certain scripted programs at FOX Entertainment into our fall schedule. These COVID-led declines more than offset the growth in affiliate revenues along with revenue growth from our new businesses, Tubi and Bento Box. The decrease in expenses primarily reflects lower programming amortization across FOX Sports and FOX Entertainment. From not airing sports events or first run programming, partially offset by the consolidation of Tubi and Bento Box. 
We expect the majority of the amortization-related savings to be timing related, with costs expected to shift into our fiscal '21 financials, but more on that in a moment. In aggregate, we estimated that COVID-19 created an EBITDA headwind of approximately $15 million in the quarter across our entire business. 
Finally, from a P&L perspective, the net EBITDA loss in our other segment amounted to $101 million, a slight improvement from the comparable quarter in the prior year. Meanwhile, our P&L tax rate ended the year at 27%. The strong overall P&L results generated free cash flow, which we calculate as net cash provided by operating activities, less cash invested in property, plant and equipment of over $850 million in the quarter and $2 billion for the year. This equates to over 70% EBITDA to free cash flow conversion in the year, demonstrating the robust free cash flow profile we outlined at our Investor Day. 
And from an overall balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with over $4.6 billion in cash and just under $8 billion in debt, which includes the $1.2 billion in 5- and 10-year senior notes that we raised this past quarter.
In the 16 months since the spin, we've invested approximately $1.25 billion into our businesses through organic investments in our core operations, including the recent relaunch of our FOX Sports digital properties, and through strategic M&A. This latter group and our minority investments in acquisitions are worth highlighting given their inherent value to Fox that is not reflected in simple EBITDA multiple-based valuations.
At our 2019 Investor Day, we announced a strategic partnership with The Stars Group. At the time, we invested approximately $240 million in the publicly-traded TSG and licensed our brand to the Fox Bet suite of pay-to-play and free-to-play games. As part of the partnership, we have an option over 50 -- of up to 50% of the equity in TSG's U.S. businesses. 
Subsequent to TSG's merger with Flutter and our incremental equity investment of approximately $100 million, we now own roughly 3% of parent company, Flutter, at a current market valuation of more than $600 million. We retain our up to 50% call option over TSG's U.S. businesses, but in addition, have also secured the right to buy an approximately 18.5% equity stake in FanDuel with an exercise period of 10 years.  
Last October, we completed the acquisition of a 67% stake in Credible Labs, an emerging fintech marketplace, which was a key part of the Fox business brand refresh and is now in the early stages of integrating alongside our national and local news assets. Since announcement, Credible -- since announcement, Credible's trailing 12-month revenue has grown from the approximately $40 million that it reported as a stand-alone public company to approximately $70 million through the June quarter, with this momentum supporting our confidence to continue to invest cross promotional resources in growing the platform.  
In April, we closed on the acquisition of Tubi, which we now report in our Television segment. Notwithstanding the challenges from COVID-19, we expect the boom in usage Lachlan outlined earlier, along with more effective monetization, to make Tubi a key source of revenue growth for many years to come. These recently acquired businesses, coupled with the renowned production capabilities in real estate of the Fox Studio lot and our tax asset, collectively represents significant pools of below-the-line value, hiding in plain sight at Fox Corporation.  
Before we open the call up to Q&A, let me provide a few markers to help you navigate the financial swings across our businesses in fiscal 2021. 
Beginning with a reminder of the events that create comparability issues between FY '20 and FY '21, where fiscal 2020 included the Super Bowl, 7-game World Series, the culmination of the FIFA Women's World Cup, along with Fox's Emmy Awards rotation. While fiscal 2021 will include what shapes to be a strong political year, the alternating NFC divisional playoff game and a full year consolidating our recent investments, including Tubi and Credible. 
Looking specifically at Q1, the combined effect of comparability in COVID is expected to reduce advertising revenue by roughly $250 million as compared to Q1 in fiscal 2020. While we will enjoy the benefits from political advertising, a greater volume of MLB regular season games and NASCAR races, along with the acquisition of Tubi, these will be more than offset by lower base advertising at our local stations, a reduced slate of fresh entertainment programming, fewer NFL and college football games in our Q1 schedule and the absence of the World Cup, Emmys and the MLB All-Star game.  
You will recall that we amortize the costs of our live sports programming when the games actually air on our networks. As such, the postponement of the sports calendar in the June quarter creates a shift of amortization, primarily across MLB and NASCAR rights, into the first quarter of our fiscal '21. We anticipate that this will increase our total sports operating expenses in the September quarter by approximately $70 million in the cable segment, broadly offsetting other savings. 
This all, of course, assumes that the COVID-driven disruptions to major sports are behind us and that we enjoy a full season of NFL, a conference-only 10-game college football season and the MLB season completes. These assumptions remain valid today, and we have no intention of using this call to run through the list of what is. We're in constant dialogue with our sports partners, and if circumstances change, we will take appropriate steps for the business.  
The same underlying fundamentals hold for FOX Entertainment, where we amortize the costs of our programming as the content is on our broadcast network. What we are now looking at is a 2021 broadcast season that includes a number of titles originally intended for our spring 2020 schedule shifted into the fall. 
Furthermore, we are optimistic that our key returning titles, including The Masked Singer, can be made available for mid-season returns. If this outlook holds, we could end up seeing a relatively full broadcast season. However, our programming amortization may not follow its normal cadence across quarters. Rather, from an amortization standpoint, our fiscal Q1 and Q2 are likely to be lighter than a normal year, with a heavier concentration of costs being absorbed in Q4. Again, pending the timing of a return to production.  
From a cash flow perspective, we are planning for a high level of capital expenditure in fiscal '21, supporting the final phases of the build-out of our technical broadcast facility in Arizona and the upgrade of some of our station facilities. We will also have higher interest payments related to our debt raised this past quarter. 
Underscoring our financial strength and confidence from a capital allocation perspective, we have today declare a semiannual $0.23 a share dividend payable on October 7, right in line with the pre-COVID dividend we declared in February.  
While the continued uncertainties make it challenging for us to estimate the future performance of our business, the company entered this crisis in a position of operating and financial strength. We will continue to manage our business and our balance sheet in a disciplined and conservative manner so that we emerge as well-positioned as possible to take advantage of the opportunities during the recovery.  
And with that, I'd like to turn the call back to Joe."

You've obviously talked about The Stars Group investment, and we followed that, and that's been a very successful one. But this appears to be a market that's really booming in the states, even with COVID, and the prospects are quite optimistic. 
So I'm just wondering how you think about taking advantage of that opportunity even more than you already have? Are there things you're doing strategically with your partners or even on the FOX Network to sort of really lean in to sports betting to make it a bigger part of the business and a part of the story?"

So look, we -- I think we agree with you, from what it sounds like, and that we are big fans of the sports betting opportunity. Every projection is that it will be a several billion-dollar industry in the medium to long term. And everything we've seen to date not only reinforces that, but I think makes us believe it could be even larger than that. 
I think we feel today very well positioned both in having the joint venture in Fox Bet, which we -- as Steve mentioned, we have the option to go to 50% ownership of, depending on licensing. But we also have the 18.5% option to buy into the FanDuel. So we effectively have 2 dogs in the race, and we think that puts us in a great position. 
Moving forward, obviously, we have to see how the states open up from a regulatory point of view and as we move into each market. It's not necessarily the case that you'll have FanDuel and FOX Bet in all the same markets. For example, we found in FOX Bet the best markets for us, and we've just opened in Colorado, a market that have both sports betting but also gaming licenses. 
When you think about the funnel sort of monetize the customer -- the consumer, we'd start with a FOX Bet Super 6 as a free-to-play game. Those people, some of them will move through the funnel into our sports betting, the FOX Bet app or the FanDuel experience. And then a subset of those will actually go into our gaming environment, when there's no sports betting being played. 
So look, we think the opportunity is huge and is something that we'll continue to spend time on to drive -- to promote to FOX Sports and to invest in."

I know there's been a lot of talk about the upfront and some discussion about it on other calls. I think the thing -- well, the first thing I'd like to say is that the sales is very active at the moment, but it's a different sort of upfront this year for everyone, right, than in past years. I would call it sort of a rolling upfront. It's not a process that has a beginning, a middle and an end. We are working, as I think I said in the last call, with all of the agency groups and each of our clients as they reengage with their -- with consumers and customers across our platforms. 
And so some have been much more heavily impacted by COVID-19 than others. Obviously, the categories that are affected, retail, theatrical entertainment, fast food restaurants. Obviously, travel are all highly impacted by COVID-19. So each of those clients, we're engaged with and sort of negotiating with as we go forward. 
I think what you'll see is as we close -- and as we have closed upfront negotiations, you'll see that going right up until really through to the beginning of the football season. And we are incredibly heartened by the strength of scatter in the market. I think scatter, across the board, is in the mid- to high teens. I think that shows the demand for marketers to get back on air in a mass market and broad way. 
We are selling it across all of our platforms, news, sports, entertainment and Tubi. Tubi is now integrated in most, if not all, of our upfront conversations. When we add Tubi to a sale, it increases reach by over 20% for the client and also obviously makes the demographic younger and more diverse.  
And Jessica, to your question on FOX News, FOX News ratings have been astronomical. We are monetizing them very well. One of the benefits of COVID-19 has been with a larger news audience. The audience has also gotten younger, and that's brought actually new advertisers that hadn't advertised on FOX News, new advertisers on to the platform. 
So it's a very strong positive story for FOX News."

So news demand is really driven by the audience and by the ratings there, so we're seeing tremendous demand in news. Obviously, it's going to be a -- continue to be an incredibly strong news cycle, I think -- and certainly through to the end of the year. There's no let up there. And I think advertisers are flocking to the certainty of those ratings and that audience.  
I think sports, there's a great pent-up demand for sport. We saw that in the sellouts in Major League Baseball. We saw that when we brought back NASCAR, the advertiser interest in NASCAR, and we expect to see it with football going forward as well. 
As we go through our upfront process, we have visibility in terms of what the clients are telling us that they expect to spend. And certainly, in news and sport, we're seeing healthy budgets there. I think entertainment is a different kettle of fish as people are waiting to see what happens in the fall season. 
As we explained earlier on the call, we have a relatively fresh scripted season with 2 shows that we had in the can that we hadn't aired. And we do hope to have The Masked Singer, not for mid season, but for the fall, if possible. And that would be -- that will absolutely drive ratings and revenue there as well.  
When we look to the stations, the -- we're heartened to see how quickly local advertising is coming back, particularly in those smaller markets. So the bottom half of our -- I don't want to say bottom half, but the smaller half of our station group, where they have, perhaps, less sort of population density, less shutdowns due to COVID-19, and those markets are coming back well. And as I mentioned before, the markets that are really buoyed are the ones where this political revenue has started to pour in. 
So -- and then the overlay of all of that is obviously scatter being very strong, which I think just goes anecdotally to the demand by advertisers and clients to get back and sort of mass marketing."

Good afternoon, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter results and to reflect on our first full fiscal year as new Fox.  
I know a lot of you on the phone have had a long day and have just come from another earnings call, so we will try to keep this as tight and as brief as possible.  
I doubt any of us consider 2020 a great calendar year. It's been extraordinarily difficult on our businesses, on our health and on our families. I'm sure it's a year we would all like to be through and done with, and we will be soon.
But looking back on Fox's 2020 fiscal year is another story. Our fiscal year has been extraordinary, not because of COVID-19, but in spite of it, our 2020 fiscal year has shown off the strength of Fox, the logic of our strategy and the resilience of our business model and of our teams. 
To that last point, I would like to acknowledge the outstanding work and dedication of my Fox colleagues across the country. They too are extraordinary. Without them, there would be no sport, no news and no entertainment on our platforms and stations. 
What together we achieved last year was remarkable. I'd like to first give FOX Sports a shout out for an incredible year, which saw the brilliant broadcast of both the historic 7-game World Series and an exciting Super Bowl LIV, watched by over 100 million people. Of course, not long after the Super Bowl in Miami, sport was shut down. But the team at FOX Sports never stopped working to bring NASCAR, baseball and eventually football back into America's living rooms.  
On our last earnings call, I said, like the rest of America, we can't wait for the first pitch thrown, the first ball hike and the sound of engines starting again. Thankfully, the wait was not long. Our FOX Sports production team lost no time preparing to produce America's biggest events in ways we didn't think possible just a few months before. The sports team has invented new technologies to not only produce, but enhance the games being played today.  
NASCAR was the first major American sport to return from its pandemic hiatus, and America's pent-up demand for sports was palpable. Working closely with NASCAR, FOX Sports designed a production that involved minimum crews, minimum travel and maximum health protocols to ensure a safe and enduring race season. 
We brought NASCAR back using only 1/3 of the people we would normally have trackside. Our director and camera operators and audio were on site, while graphics, replays, producers and talent were spread out between Charlotte and Los Angeles. With very few or no fans on the track, it allowed us to break new ground with miniature drones flying overhead to get never before seen aerial footage. As the season progressed, even our in-car audio production and feature editing were produced live in technicians' homes.  
We then turned our attention to baseball, when, on July 23, the Fox baseball season opened, with a triple-header highlighted by 2.8 million viewers for the Yankees/Nationals game. The opening was up almost 20% over Fox's prime time Major League Baseball average last year and was sold out due to heavy advertising demand. 
We produced 4 baseball games on our first weekend, and none of the 7 talent were in the same place as we connected 10 different facilities in real time with our producers and directors in Los Angeles. In addition to our enhanced crowd audio, we have now introduced computer-generated virtual fans to the stadium. This innovation was created by mixing our first down line technology and real-time theatrical visual effects. And now we can't wait until the start of football.  
We love sports for the adrenaline, it provides us, for the passion it inspires in us and for the narrative and drama of watching the classic underdog win from behind. Team U.S.A., beating the Soviet ice hockey team at the 1980 Winter Olympics or Buster Douglas knocking out Tyson or the FOX Entertainment network finishing the broadcast season in first place from fourth the year prior. 
The network staged a dramatic comeback this past year and leapfrogged our competitors to regain the #1 broadcast network title for the first time in 8 years. Fox was the only network to deliver year-over-year ratings gains among adults 18 to 49 and total viewers. We outperformed the #2 network by 31% in the demo, driven by The Masked Singer, LEGO Masters and 9-1-1: Lone Star, the season's #1 new scripted show. 
And the network will also have a robust and stable entertainment lineup in the fall. We will debut 2 new series that were shot and ready to air before the pandemic, the psychological thriller, NEXT; and the Southern soap opera, Filthy Rich. We remain hopeful that The Masked Singer's fourth season will also be on air for the fall. 
Of course, animation has always been a strength of Fox, and earlier in the fiscal year, FOX Entertainment brought the Bento Box animation studio into the Fox family. Bento Box was a natural addition to enhance the capabilities of FOX Entertainment and has already proven to be an impactful investment. It's important to note that animation production has not been significantly impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. 
Not only did we renew Bento Box's Emmy-winning show, Bob's Burgers for an 11th season on FOX, Bento Box is also producing 11 new animated shows, including for third-party customers such as Netflix and HBO Max. These new shows follow the May launch of Central Park, Bento Box's Apple TV+ Comedy Series.  
More recently, in April, we completed our acquisition of the advertising video-on-demand platform, Tubi. Tubi has seen phenomenal growth since it joined Fox. In June, it surpassed 200 million hours streamed per month, representing more than 100% growth year-over-year. During the fourth quarter, several Fox hit shows were added to Tubi, with The Masked Singer quickly becoming Tubi's #1 streamed series. 
Tubi's young and diverse audience gives it a unique appeal with advertisers seeking to connect with consumers that are traditionally more challenging to reach. Tubi complements Fox portfolio and underscores our long-term strategic initiative to broaden and enhance direct-to-consumer digital reach and engagement while providing advertising partners with more opportunities to engage audiences at scale.  
During this year's upfront season, we have begun selling Tubi advertising alongside broadcast, significantly expanding our clients' reach. According to one research company, 87% of the Tubi audience cannot be reached by cable television. They are young and diverse with a median age of only 34. It's a great business and a great fit with Fox.
Another business that's had an extraordinary year is FOX News, which ended fiscal year 2020 with record-breaking viewership. In June 2020, FOX News was the leading prime time network in all of television among total viewers, making it the first cable network to ever lead all broadcast networks in ratings for an entire month. 
For the fiscal year, we were again the #1 channel in all of cable for total viewers across prime and total day. Now I could say that's another extraordinary achievement, but the etymologist in me won't allow it. That's because FOX News has been the #1 channel in all cable for 4 years running and the #1 channel in cable news for 18 years. 
We have a long track record of succeeding through multiple economic and political cycles and during administrations of both political parties. We are pacing calendar 2020 to have our highest-rated prime time year in network history, with total viewers up 39% over 2019. Our content programs are now routinely notching around 4 million viewers a night. Though not a head-to-head comparison, the FOX News channel is eclipsing broadcast news stalwarts like TODAY, Good Morning America, CBS This Morning and Meet the Press in viewership.  
And viewers are coming to us not just for news and opinion, but increasingly for documentary and lifestyle programming on platforms such as FOX Nation and FoxNews.com. In fact, FOX Nation more than doubled its subscriber base this fiscal year, sustaining a trial to pay conversion rate of over 80% and a monthly churn rate of under 10%. Momentum built as the year progressed, with content starts up over 120% and hours watched up over 170% in the second half of fiscal year compared to the first half.  
Within FOX News, we have also organically cultivated one of the most impactful digital platforms in the country. FOX News Media charted its highest digital traffic in fiscal year 2020, with record total digital page views and a record time spent. Users viewed over 40 billion pages and spent 98 billion minutes on our FOX News digital platforms. We expect this trend to accelerate as we head into election season in November. 
The fall will be busy for our news organizations at FOX News and at our stations. Later this month, FOX News will bring viewers coverage of the Democratic and Republican national conventions, in whatever form they take. And as we close in on November, we expect to continue to achieve a record amount of political revenue across both our national channels and local stations.  
It's important to note that according to a study by Nielsen MRI Fusion, FOX News has more than doubled the number of independent viewers than CNN, 119% more to be exact. And we have 62% more independent viewers than MSNBC. This points clearly to our highly trusted, balanced news reporting and is a key differentiator between us and our competitors for political advertising. 
In the political cycle today, inclusive of the impact of COVID-19, our political advertising revenue is pacing more than 50% ahead of the equivalent period 4 years ago. We are encouraged by recent trends in our local markets and expect healthy political demand up and down the ballot in the coming quarters. Nine of our 18 stations are a presidential battleground space. These are led by Arizona, Florida, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, but also include Georgia, Michigan and Minnesota. We have center races in 10 markets and lower house races in all, a number of which are expected to be close and hotly contested. 
Record political revenue has already offset some of the impact from COVID-19 in local markets. While our top 7 markets where businesses have not yet fully reopened, we are now pacing, overall, down 29% at the start of Q1. Our next 11 markets are together pacing down just 4%. That's a tremendous recovery from what we were seeing just a couple of months ago. And 3 of our markets are now pacing well ahead of last year. These are Atlanta, Tampa and Phoenix. Not coincidentally, these are all strong political markets. 
The fourth quarter saw affiliate revenues grow by 8%, where healthy rate increases were offset by a decline in subscriber volumes of around 6.5%. For the full fiscal year, our total company affiliate revenues increased 7%, an important illustration of our brand's prominence and strength with audiences and distribution partners alike. 
This past year, we have completed significant distribution agreements, including an early renewal with Comcast as well as new deals with Verizon, Cox, Charter and YouTube TV, among others, each with rate increases that underscore the importance of our channels.  
As we articulated more than a year ago during our Investor Day and as we've demonstrated with our disciplined and intentional acquisitions to date, we are taking a deliberate and selective approach to M&A and strong businesses fit within our vision, are well-executed and properly integrated with the rest of the company. We continually assess opportunities to deepen our strengths by expanding lines of business and the types of operations at which we excel. Our goal remains to expand the ways our audiences interact with and connect to our brands, while simultaneously diversifying each brand's sources of revenue.  
But before turning things over to Steve, let me reinforce one key point as we mark the end of our first fiscal year. The assets and businesses of Fox were deliberately composed for efficient growth and success in the current media environment. The stability and trajectory of the company are underscored by the revenue structure and unrivaled viewer engagement. Fox has demonstrated consistent clarity of vision by assembling the portfolio we have and by evolving to embrace opportunities in order to meet the challenges of our time.
We entered the COVID-19 crisis on firm footing financially, strategically and operationally. Our innovative thinking in combination with the tailwinds of the upcoming fall sports and entertainment seasons and ongoing need for live news, analysis and opinion will see Fox emerge from this pandemic-cost year more competitive, more focused and even more strongly positioned to deliver for our viewers, our partners and our shareholders.  
And now Steve will take us through a bit detailed. Thank you."
546623668,677865983,2086387,"Fox Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2020",2020-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Fox Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. Despite the broader macroeconomic factors affecting our businesses, as Lachlan just highlighted, our first fiscal year as a stand-alone public company demonstrates that we are delivering on the strategies that we outli",2206,"Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. Despite the broader macroeconomic factors affecting our businesses, as Lachlan just highlighted, our first fiscal year as a stand-alone public company demonstrates that we are delivering on the strategies that we outlined at the time of the spin and that truly differentiate Fox. 
Let me now take you through our financial results for the fiscal year as well as the fourth quarter. I'll also take a few minutes to review the key investments we've made since the spin, before concluding with some financial markets for the months ahead.  
Our full year results saw total revenues increased 8% to $12.3 billion. This revenue growth was broad-based and led by affiliate revenue growth of 7% on the back of retransmission revenue increases at the television segment. We delivered this industry-leading affiliate revenue growth, despite an uptick in the rate of net subscriber declines. Using fiscal '19 as a base, we renewed 70% of total affiliate revenue in fiscal '20. Looking forward, the renewal profile in the immediate future is significantly lighter, with around 5% of total fiscal '20 affiliate revenue due for renewal in each of fiscal '21 and '22.
Full year advertising revenues increased 5%, led by our broadcast of Super Bowl LIV. Partially offsetting this growth was the impact of COVID-19 in recent months. As we foreshadowed in May, the impact was most pronounced at our local television stations as well as FOX Sports due to the postponement of live events and at FOX Entertainment as new scripted programs were held back for our fall schedule.  
We also increased other revenues nearly 30%, primarily through the consolidation of Bento Box at the television segment beginning in August and the consolidation of Credible in our other segment beginning in October.  
Total full year adjusted EBITDA was $2.8 billion, an increase of 4% over the prior year. This growth was delivered despite the negative comparison to the accounting benefit from certain shared services and overhead costs being presented on a carve-out basis in the first 3 quarters of the prior year. Full year net income attributable to stockholders was $1 billion or $1.62 a share, while adjusted EPS was $2.48 versus $2.63 last year. Again, year-on-year comparison is impacted by the treatment of certain shared services and overhead costs in the prior year in accordance with SEC guidelines.
Turning to the fourth quarter. Total company revenues were $2.4 billion, down 4% versus last year as COVID-19 related declines in our advertising revenues, overwhelmingly influenced by declines at our local television stations, and to a lesser extent, at the FOX Network, more than offset affiliate revenue growth of 8%. 
We indicated on our May call that we expected the COVID-related advertising headwinds across our business in the June quarter, excluding sports, to be in the $200 million to $240 million range, with the local market being down approximately 50%. We ended the quarter ahead of these expectations, with our advertising revenue down approximately $160 million across these businesses, with the local market down closer to 35% and FOX News advertising revenues actually posting a year-on-year gain.  
Adjusted EBITDA was $742 million, a 5% increase over the $709 million generated last year, led by higher contributions from the cable segment. This growth was partially offset in our Television segment due to the COVID-19-related advertising weakness. 
From a bottom line perspective, net income attributable to stockholders of $122 million or $0.20 per share was lower than the $0.73 per share in the prior year quarter, most notably due to the higher impairment and restructuring charges, including the negotiated settlement to exit our rights agreement with the USGA. Controlling for this and other noncore items in both years, adjusted EPS of $0.62 was consistent with the prior year quarter. 
Now turning to the operating performance of our segments for the fourth quarter, with Cable Networks' EBITDA of $674 million, was up 12% despite revenue being down 2%. The lower cable segment revenues were most notably due to a $22 million or 8% decline in our advertising revenues, including the impact of the postponement of live events at our sports networks and the absence of the FIFA Women's World Cup compared to the fourth quarter last year.
Meanwhile, higher ratings and pricing helped to grow advertising revenues at Fox News Media in the quarter. Cable affiliate revenues increased 1%, supported by higher average rates, partially offset by a net decrease in pay television subscribers. Other revenues were down 31%, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 on our sports business, partially offset by higher FOX Nation and radio revenues at FOX News Media. 
EBITDA at our cable segment increased 12% over the prior period, most notably reflecting lower sports programming rights amortization and production costs due to the postponement of live events and the absence of the FIFA Women's World Cup compared to the fourth quarter of last year. 
Our television segment reported EBITDA of $169 million, down from the $214 million reported in the prior year quarter. As revenue declines of 6% were partially offset by expenses that decreased nearly 3%. Television affiliate revenues grew 22%, consistent with the overall trajectory we outlined at our Investor Day in May of 2019. Television advertising revenues declined 29%, primarily from the impact of the pandemic on the local advertising market at the FOX Television Station and the postponement of live events at FOX Sports. 
Furthermore, in response to COVID-19, we deferred the planned spring premiers of certain scripted programs at FOX Entertainment into our fall schedule. These COVID-led declines more than offset the growth in affiliate revenues along with revenue growth from our new businesses, Tubi and Bento Box. The decrease in expenses primarily reflects lower programming amortization across FOX Sports and FOX Entertainment. From not airing sports events or first-run programming, partially offset by the consolidation of Tubi and Bento Box. 
We expect the majority of the amortization-related savings to be timing related, with costs expected to shift into our fiscal '21 financials, but more on that in a moment. In aggregate, we estimated that COVID-19 created an EBITDA headwind of approximately $15 million in the quarter across our entire business. 
Finally, from a P&L perspective, the net EBITDA loss in our other segment amounted to $101 million, a slight improvement from the comparable quarter in the prior year. Meanwhile, our P&L tax rate ended the year at 27%. The strong overall P&L results generated free cash flow, which we calculate as net cash provided by operating activities, less cash invested in property, plant and equipment of over $850 million in the quarter and $2 billion for the year. This equates to over 70% EBITDA to free cash flow conversion in the year, demonstrating the robust free cash flow profile we outlined at our Investor Day. 
And from an overall balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with over $4.6 billion in cash and just under $8 billion in debt, which includes the $1.2 billion in 5- and 10-year senior notes that we raised this past quarter.
In the 16 months since the spin, we've invested approximately $1.25 billion into our businesses through organic investments in our core operations, including the recent relaunch of our FOX Sports digital properties, and through strategic M&A. This latter group and our minority investments in acquisitions are worth highlighting given their inherent value to Fox that is not reflected in simple EBITDA multiple-based valuations.
At our 2019 Investor Day, we announced a strategic partnership with The Stars Group. At the time, we invested approximately $240 million in the publicly-traded TSG and licensed our brand to the Fox Bet suite of pay-to-play and free-to-play games. As part of the partnership, we have an option over 50 -- of up to 50% of the equity in TSG's U.S. businesses. 
Subsequent to TSG's merger with Flutter and our incremental equity investment of approximately $100 million, we now own roughly 3% of parent company, Flutter, at a current market valuation of more than $600 million. We retain our up to 50% call option over TSG's U.S. businesses, but in addition, have also secured the right to buy an approximately 18.5% equity stake in FanDuel with an exercise period of 10 years.  
Last October, we completed the acquisition of a 67% stake in Credible Labs, an emerging fintech marketplace, which was a key part of the Fox business brand refresh and is now in the early stages of integrating alongside our national and local news assets. Since announcement, Credible -- since announcement, Credible's trailing 12-month revenue has grown from the approximately $40 million that it reported as a stand-alone public company to approximately $70 million through the June quarter, with this momentum supporting our confidence to continue to invest cross-promotional resources in growing the platform.  
In April, we closed on the acquisition of Tubi, which we now report in our Television segment. Notwithstanding the challenges from COVID-19, we expect the boom in usage Lachlan outlined earlier, along with more effective monetization, to make Tubi a key source of revenue growth for many years to come. These recently acquired businesses, coupled with the renowned production capabilities in real estate of the Fox Studio lot and our tax asset, collectively represents significant pools of below-the-line value, hiding in plain sight at Fox Corporation.  
Before we open the call up to Q&A, let me provide a few markers to help you navigate the financial swings across our businesses in fiscal 2021. 
Beginning with a reminder of the events that create comparability issues between FY '20 and FY '21, where fiscal 2020 included the Super Bowl, 7-game World Series, the culmination of the FIFA Women's World Cup, along with Fox's Emmy Awards rotation. While fiscal 2021 will include what shapes to be a strong political year, the alternating NFC divisional playoff game and a full year consolidating our recent investments, including Tubi and Credible. 
Looking specifically at Q1, the combined effect of comparability in COVID is expected to reduce advertising revenue by roughly $250 million as compared to Q1 in fiscal 2020. While we will enjoy the benefits from political advertising, a greater volume of MLB regular-season games and NASCAR races, along with the acquisition of Tubi, these will be more than offset by lower base advertising at our local stations, a reduced slate of fresh entertainment programming, fewer NFL and college football games in our Q1 schedule and the absence of the World Cup, Emmys and the MLB All-Star game.  
You will recall that we amortize the costs of our live sports programming when the games actually air on our networks. As such, the postponement of the sports calendar in the June quarter creates a shift of amortization, primarily across MLB and NASCAR rights, into the first quarter of our fiscal '21. We anticipate that this will increase our total sports operating expenses in the September quarter by approximately $70 million in the cable segment, broadly offsetting other savings. 
This all, of course, assumes that the COVID-driven disruptions to major sports are behind us and that we enjoy a full season of NFL, a conference-only 10-game college football season and the MLB season completes. These assumptions remain valid today, and we have no intention of using this call to run through the list of what is. We're in constant dialogue with our sports partners, and if circumstances change, we will take appropriate steps for the business.  
The same underlying fundamentals hold for FOX Entertainment, where we amortize the costs of our programming as the content is on our broadcast network. What we are now looking at is a 2021 broadcast season that includes a number of titles originally intended for our spring 2020 schedule shifted into the fall. 
Furthermore, we are optimistic that our key returning titles, including The Masked Singer, can be made available for mid-season returns. If this outlook holds, we could end up seeing a relatively full broadcast season. However, our programming amortization may not follow its normal cadence across quarters. Rather, from an amortization standpoint, our fiscal Q1 and Q2 are likely to be lighter than a normal year, with a heavier concentration of costs being absorbed in Q4. Again, pending the timing of a return to production.  
From a cash flow perspective, we are planning for a high level of capital expenditure in fiscal '21, supporting the final phases of the build-out of our technical broadcast facility in Arizona and the upgrade of some of our station facilities. We will also have higher interest payments related to our debt raised this past quarter. 
Underscoring our financial strength and confidence from a capital allocation perspective, we have today declare a semiannual $0.23 a share dividend payable on October 7, right in line with the pre-COVID dividend we declared in February.  
While the continued uncertainties make it challenging for us to estimate the future performance of our business, the company entered this crisis in a position of operating and financial strength. We will continue to manage our business and our balance sheet in a disciplined and conservative manner so that we emerge as well-positioned as possible to take advantage of the opportunities during the recovery.  
And with that, I'd like to turn the call back to Joe."

You've obviously talked about The Stars Group investment, and we followed that, and that's been a very successful one. But this appears to be a market that's really booming in the states, even with COVID, and the prospects are quite optimistic. 
So I'm just wondering how you think about taking advantage of that opportunity even more than you already have? Are there things you're doing strategically with your partners or even on the FOX Network to sort of really lean in to sports betting to make it a bigger part of the business and a part of the story?"

So look, we -- I think we agree with you, from what it sounds like, and that we are big fans of the sports betting opportunity. Every projection is that it will be a several billion-dollar industry in the medium to long term. And everything we've seen to date not only reinforces that, but I think makes us believe it could be even larger than that. 
I think we feel today very well positioned both in having the joint venture in Fox Bet, which we -- as Steve mentioned, we have the option to go to 50% ownership of, depending on licensing. But we also have the 18.5% option to buy into the FanDuel. So we effectively have 2 dogs in the race, and we think that puts us in a great position. 
Moving forward, obviously, we have to see how the states open up from a regulatory point of view and as we move into each market. It's not necessarily the case that you'll have FanDuel and FOX Bet in all the same markets. For example, we found in FOX Bet the best markets for us, and we've just opened in Colorado, a market that have both sports betting but also gaming licenses. 
When you think about the funnel sort of monetize the customer -- the consumer, we'd start with a FOX Bet Super 6 as a free-to-play game. Those people, some of them will move through the funnel into our sports betting, the FOX Bet app or the FanDuel experience. And then a subset of those will actually go into our gaming environment, when there's no sports betting being played. 
So look, we think the opportunity is huge and is something that we'll continue to spend time on to drive -- to promote to FOX Sports and to invest in."

I think the thing -- well, the first thing I'd like to say is that the sales is very active at the moment, but it's a different sort of upfront this year for everyone, right, than in past years. I would call it sort of a rolling upfront. It's not a process that has a beginning, a middle and an end. We are working, as I think I said in the last call, with all of the agency groups and each of our clients as they reengage with their -- with consumers and customers across our platforms. 
And so some have been much more heavily impacted by COVID-19 than others. Obviously, the categories that are affected, retail, theatrical entertainment, fast food restaurants. Obviously, travel are all highly impacted by COVID-19. So each of those clients, we're engaged with and sort of negotiating with as we go forward. 
I think what you'll see is as we close -- and as we have closed upfront negotiations, you'll see that going right up until really through to the beginning of the football season. And we are incredibly heartened by the strength of scatter in the market. I think scatter, across the board, is in the mid- to high teens. I think that shows the demand for marketers to get back on air in a mass market and broad way. 
We are selling it across all of our platforms, news, sports, entertainment and Tubi. Tubi is now integrated in most, if not all, of our upfront conversations. When we add Tubi to a sale, it increases reach by over 20% for the client and also obviously makes the demographic younger and more diverse.  
And Jessica, to your question on FOX News, FOX News ratings have been astronomical. We are monetizing them very well. One of the benefits of COVID-19 has been with a larger news audience. The audience has also gotten younger, and that's brought actually new advertisers that hadn't advertised on FOX News, new advertisers on to the platform. 
So it's a very strong positive story for FOX News."

There's a -- the news ratings are so far above last year's. And as I mentioned, we have new clients and new categories of clients on FOX News. 
So news demand is really driven by the audience and by the ratings there, so we're seeing tremendous demand in news. Obviously, it's going to be a -- continue to be an incredibly strong news cycle, I think -- and certainly through to the end of the year. There's no let-up there. And I think advertisers are flocking to the certainty of those ratings and that audience.  
I think sports, there's a great pent-up demand for sport. We saw that in the sellouts in Major League Baseball. We saw that when we brought back NASCAR, the advertiser interest in NASCAR, and we expect to see it with football going forward as well. 
As we go through our upfront process, we have visibility in terms of what the clients are telling us that they expect to spend. And certainly, in news and sport, we're seeing healthy budgets there. I think entertainment is a different kettle of fish as people are waiting to see what happens in the fall season. 
As we explained earlier on the call, we have a relatively fresh scripted season with 2 shows that we had in the can that we hadn't aired. And we do hope to have The Masked Singer, not for mid-season but for the fall, if possible. And that would be -- that will absolutely drive ratings and revenue there as well.  
When we look to the stations, the -- we're heartened to see how quickly local advertising is coming back, particularly in those smaller markets. So the bottom half of our -- I don't want to say bottom half, but the smaller half of our station group, where they have, perhaps, less sort of population density, less shutdowns due to COVID-19, and those markets are coming back well. And as I mentioned before, the markets that are really buoyed are the ones where this political revenue has started to pour in. 
So -- and then the overlay of all of that is obviously scatter being very strong, which I think just goes anecdotally to the demand by advertisers and clients to get back and sort of mass marketing."

Good afternoon, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter results and to reflect on our first full fiscal year as new Fox.  I know a lot of you on the phone have had a long day and have just come from another",2154,"Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter results and to reflect on our first full fiscal year as new Fox.  
I know a lot of you on the phone have had a long day and have just come from another earnings call, so we will try to keep this as tight and as brief as possible.  
I doubt any of us consider 2020 a great calendar year. It's been extraordinarily difficult on our businesses, on our health and on our families. I'm sure it's a year we would all like to be through and done with, and we will be soon.
But looking back on Fox's 2020 fiscal year is another story. Our fiscal year has been extraordinary, not because of COVID-19, but in spite of it, our 2020 fiscal year has shown off the strength of Fox, the logic of our strategy and the resilience of our business model and of our teams. 
To that last point, I would like to acknowledge the outstanding work and dedication of my Fox colleagues across the country. They too are extraordinary. Without them, there would be no sport, no news and no entertainment on our platforms and stations. 
What together we achieved last year was remarkable. I'd like to first give FOX Sports a shout out for an incredible year, which saw the brilliant broadcast of both the historic 7-game World Series and an exciting Super Bowl LIV, watched by over 100 million people. Of course, not long after the Super Bowl in Miami, sport was shut down. But the team at FOX Sports never stopped working to bring NASCAR, baseball and eventually football back into America's living rooms.  
On our last earnings call, I said, like the rest of America, we can't wait for the first pitch thrown, the first ball hike and the sound of engines starting again. Thankfully, the wait was not long. Our FOX Sports production team lost no time preparing to produce America's biggest events in ways we didn't think possible just a few months before. The sports team has invented new technologies to not only produce, but enhance the games being played today.  
NASCAR was the first major American sport to return from its pandemic hiatus, and America's pent-up demand for sports was palpable. Working closely with NASCAR, FOX Sports designed a production that involved minimum crews, minimum travel and maximum health protocols to ensure a safe and enduring race season. 
We brought NASCAR back using only 1/3 of the people we would normally have trackside. Our director and camera operators and audio were on site, while graphics, replays, producers and talent were spread out between Charlotte and Los Angeles. With very few or no fans on the track, it allowed us to break new ground with miniature drones flying overhead to get never before seen aerial footage. As the season progressed, even our in-car audio production and feature editing were produced live in technicians' homes.  
We then turned our attention to baseball, when, on July 23, the Fox baseball season opened, with a triple-header highlighted by 2.8 million viewers for the Yankees/Nationals game. The opening was up almost 20% over Fox's prime time Major League Baseball average last year and was sold out due to heavy advertising demand. 
We produced 4 baseball games on our first weekend, and none of the 7 talent were in the same place as we connected 10 different facilities in real time with our producers and directors in Los Angeles. In addition to our enhanced crowd audio, we have now introduced computer-generated virtual fans to the stadium. This innovation was created by mixing our first down line technology and real-time theatrical visual effects. And now we can't wait until the start of football.  
We love sports for the adrenaline, it provides us, for the passion it inspires in us and for the narrative and drama of watching the classic underdog win from behind. Team U.S.A., beating the Soviet ice hockey team at the 1980 Winter Olympics or Buster Douglas knocking out Tyson or the FOX Entertainment network finishing the broadcast season in first place from fourth the year prior. 
The network staged a dramatic comeback this past year and leapfrogged our competitors to regain the #1 broadcast network title for the first time in 8 years. Fox was the only network to deliver year-over-year ratings gains among adults 18 to 49 and total viewers. We outperformed the #2 network by 31% in the demo, driven by The Masked Singer, LEGO Masters and 9-1-1: Lone Star, the season's #1 new scripted show. 
And the network will also have a robust and stable entertainment lineup in the fall. We will debut 2 new series that were shot and ready to air before the pandemic, the psychological thriller, NEXT; and the Southern soap opera, Filthy Rich. We remain hopeful that The Masked Singer's fourth season will also be on air for the fall. 
Of course, animation has always been a strength of Fox, and earlier in the fiscal year, FOX Entertainment brought the Bento Box animation studio into the Fox family. Bento Box was a natural addition to enhance the capabilities of FOX Entertainment and has already proven to be an impactful investment. It's important to note that animation production has not been significantly impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. 
Not only did we renew Bento Box's Emmy-winning show, Bob's Burgers for an 11th season on FOX, Bento Box is also producing 11 new animated shows, including for third-party customers such as Netflix and HBO Max. These new shows follow the May launch of Central Park, Bento Box's Apple TV+ Comedy Series.  
More recently, in April, we completed our acquisition of the advertising video-on-demand platform, Tubi. Tubi has seen phenomenal growth since it joined Fox. In June, it surpassed 200 million hours streamed per month, representing more than 100% growth year-over-year. During the fourth quarter, several Fox hit shows were added to Tubi, with The Masked Singer quickly becoming Tubi's #1 streamed series. 
Tubi's young and diverse audience gives it a unique appeal with advertisers seeking to connect with consumers that are traditionally more challenging to reach. Tubi complements Fox portfolio and underscores our long-term strategic initiative to broaden and enhance direct-to-consumer digital reach and engagement while providing advertising partners with more opportunities to engage audiences at scale.  
During this year's upfront season, we have begun selling Tubi advertising alongside broadcast, significantly expanding our clients' reach. According to one research company, 87% of the Tubi audience cannot be reached by cable television. They are young and diverse with a median age of only 34. It's a great business and a great fit with Fox.
Another business that's had an extraordinary year is FOX News, which ended fiscal year 2020 with record-breaking viewership. In June 2020, FOX News was the leading prime time network in all of television among total viewers, making it the first cable network to ever lead all broadcast networks in ratings for an entire month. 
For the fiscal year, we were again the #1 channel in all of cable for total viewers across prime and total day. Now I could say that's another extraordinary achievement, but the etymologist in me won't allow it. That's because FOX News has been the #1 channel in all cable for 4 years running and the #1 channel in cable news for 18 years. 
We have a long track record of succeeding through multiple economic and political cycles and during administrations of both political parties. We are pacing calendar 2020 to have our highest-rated prime time year in network history, with total viewers up 39% over 2019. Our content programs are now routinely notching around 4 million viewers a night. Though not a head-to-head comparison, the FOX News channel is eclipsing broadcast news stalwarts like TODAY, Good Morning America, CBS This Morning and Meet the Press in viewership.  
And viewers are coming to us not just for news and opinion, but increasingly for documentary and lifestyle programming on platforms such as FOX Nation and FoxNews.com. In fact, FOX Nation more than doubled its subscriber base this fiscal year, sustaining a trial to pay conversion rate of over 80% and a monthly churn rate of under 10%. Momentum built as the year progressed, with content starts up over 120% and hours watched up over 170% in the second half of fiscal year compared to the first half.  
Within FOX News, we have also organically cultivated one of the most impactful digital platforms in the country. FOX News Media charted its highest digital traffic in fiscal year 2020, with record total digital page views and a record time spent. Users viewed over 40 billion pages and spent 98 billion minutes on our FOX News digital platforms. We expect this trend to accelerate as we head into election season in November. 
The fall will be busy for our news organizations at FOX News and at our stations. Later this month, FOX News will bring viewers coverage of the Democratic and Republican national conventions, in whatever form they take. And as we close in on November, we expect to continue to achieve a record amount of political revenue across both our national channels and local stations.  
It's important to note that according to a study by Nielsen MRI Fusion, FOX News has more than doubled the number of independent viewers than CNN, 119% more to be exact. And we have 62% more independent viewers than MSNBC. This points clearly to our highly trusted, balanced news reporting and is a key differentiator between us and our competitors for political advertising. 
In the political cycle today, inclusive of the impact of COVID-19, our political advertising revenue is pacing more than 50% ahead of the equivalent period 4 years ago. We are encouraged by recent trends in our local markets and expect healthy political demand up and down the ballot in the coming quarters. Nine of our 18 stations are a presidential battleground space. These are led by Arizona, Florida, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, but also include Georgia, Michigan and Minnesota. We have center races in 10 markets and lower house races in all, a number of which are expected to be close and hotly contested. 
Record political revenue has already offset some of the impact from COVID-19 in local markets. While our top 7 markets where businesses have not yet fully reopened, we are now pacing, overall, down 29% at the start of Q1. Our next 11 markets are together pacing down just 4%. That's a tremendous recovery from what we were seeing just a couple of months ago. And 3 of our markets are now pacing well ahead of last year. These are Atlanta, Tampa and Phoenix. Not coincidentally, these are all strong political markets. 
The fourth quarter saw affiliate revenues grow by 8%, where healthy rate increases were offset by a decline in subscriber volumes of around 6.5%. For the full fiscal year, our total company affiliate revenues increased 7%, an important illustration of our brand's prominence and strength with audiences and distribution partners alike. 
This past year, we have completed significant distribution agreements, including an early renewal with Comcast as well as new deals with Verizon, Cox, Charter and YouTube TV, among others, each with rate increases that underscore the importance of our channels.  
As we articulated more than a year ago during our Investor Day and as we've demonstrated with our disciplined and intentional acquisitions to date, we are taking a deliberate and selective approach to M&A and strong businesses fit within our vision, are well-executed and properly integrated with the rest of the company. We continually assess opportunities to deepen our strengths by expanding lines of business and the types of operations at which we excel. Our goal remains to expand the ways our audiences interact with and connect to our brands, while simultaneously diversifying each brand's sources of revenue.  
But before turning things over to Steve, let me reinforce one key point as we mark the end of our first fiscal year. The assets and businesses of Fox were deliberately composed for efficient growth and success in the current media environment. The stability and trajectory of the company are underscored by the revenue structure and unrivaled viewer engagement. Fox has demonstrated consistent clarity of vision by assembling the portfolio we have and by evolving to embrace opportunities in order to meet the challenges of our time.
We entered the COVID-19 crisis on firm footing financially, strategically and operationally. Our innovative thinking in combination with the tailwinds of the upcoming fall sports and entertainment seasons and ongoing need for live news, analysis and opinion will see Fox emerge from this pandemic-cost year more competitive, more focused and even more strongly positioned to deliver for our viewers, our partners and our shareholders.  
And now Steve will take us through a bit detailed. Thank you."

Despite the broader macroeconomic factors affecting our businesses, as Lachlan just highlighted, our first fiscal year as a stand-alone public company demonstrates that we are delivering on the strategies that we outlined at the time of the spin and that truly differentiate Fox. 
Let me now take you through our financial results for the fiscal year as well as the fourth quarter. I'll also take a few minutes to review the key investments we've made since the spin, before concluding with some financial markets for the months ahead.  
Our full year results saw total revenues increased 8% to $12.3 billion. This revenue growth was broad-based and led by affiliate revenue growth of 7% on the back of retransmission revenue increases at the television segment. We delivered this industry-leading affiliate revenue growth, despite an uptick in the rate of net subscriber declines. Using fiscal '19 as a base, we renewed 70% of total affiliate revenue in fiscal '20. Looking forward, the renewal profile in the immediate future is significantly lighter, with around 5% of total fiscal '20 affiliate revenue due for renewal in each of fiscal '21 and '22.
Full year advertising revenues increased 5%, led by our broadcast of Super Bowl LIV. Partially offsetting this growth was the impact of COVID-19 in recent months. As we foreshadowed in May, the impact was most pronounced at our local television stations as well as FOX Sports due to the postponement of live events and at FOX Entertainment as new scripted programs were held back for our fall schedule.  
We also increased other revenues nearly 30%, primarily through the consolidation of Bento Box at the television segment beginning in August and the consolidation of Credible in our other segment beginning in October.  
Total full year adjusted EBITDA was $2.8 billion, an increase of 4% over the prior year. This growth was delivered despite the negative comparison to the accounting benefit from certain shared services and overhead costs being presented on a carve-out basis in the first 3 quarters of the prior year. Full year net income attributable to stockholders was $1 billion or $1.62 a share, while adjusted EPS was $2.48 versus $2.63 last year. Again, year-on-year comparison is impacted by the treatment of certain shared services and overhead costs in the prior year in accordance with SEC guidelines.
Turning to the fourth quarter. Total company revenues were $2.4 billion, down 4% versus last year as COVID-19 related declines in our advertising revenues, overwhelmingly influenced by declines at our local television stations, and to a lesser extent, at the FOX Network, more than offset affiliate revenue growth of 8%. 
We indicated on our May call that we expected the COVID-related advertising headwinds across our business in the June quarter, excluding sports, to be in the $200 million to $240 million range, with the local market being down approximately 50%. We ended the quarter ahead of these expectations, with our advertising revenue down approximately $160 million across these businesses, with the local market down closer to 35% and FOX News advertising revenues actually posting a year-on-year gain.  
Adjusted EBITDA was $742 million, a 5% increase over the $709 million generated last year, led by higher contributions from the cable segment. This growth was partially offset in our Television segment due to the COVID-19-related advertising weakness. 
From a bottom line perspective, net income attributable to stockholders of $122 million or $0.20 per share was lower than the $0.73 per share in the prior year quarter, most notably due to the higher impairment and restructuring charges, including the negotiated settlement to exit our rights agreement with the USGA. Controlling for this and other noncore items in both years, adjusted EPS of $0.62 was consistent with the prior year quarter. 
Now turning to the operating performance of our segments for the fourth quarter, with Cable Networks' EBITDA of $674 million, was up 12% despite revenue being down 2%. The lower cable segment revenues were most notably due to a $22 million or 8% decline in our advertising revenues, including the impact of the postponement of live events at our sports networks and the absence of the FIFA Women's World Cup compared to the fourth quarter last year.
Meanwhile, higher ratings and pricing helped to grow advertising revenues at Fox News Media in the quarter. Cable affiliate revenues increased 1%, supported by higher average rates, partially offset by a net decrease in pay television subscribers. Other revenues were down 31%, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 on our sports business, partially offset by higher FOX Nation and radio revenues at FOX News Media. 
EBITDA at our cable segment increased 12% over the prior period, most notably reflecting lower sports programming rights amortization and production costs due to the postponement of live events and the absence of the FIFA Women's World Cup compared to the fourth quarter of last year. 
Our television segment reported EBITDA of $169 million, down from the $214 million reported in the prior year quarter. As revenue declines of 6% were partially offset by expenses that decreased nearly 3%. Television affiliate revenues grew 22%, consistent with the overall trajectory we outlined at our Investor Day in May of 2019. Television advertising revenues declined 29%, primarily from the impact of the pandemic on the local advertising market at the FOX Television Station and the postponement of live events at FOX Sports. 
Furthermore, in response to COVID-19, we deferred the planned spring premiers of certain scripted programs at FOX Entertainment into our fall schedule. These COVID-led declines more than offset the growth in affiliate revenues along with revenue growth from our new businesses, Tubi and Bento Box. The decrease in expenses primarily reflects lower programming amortization across FOX Sports and FOX Entertainment. From not airing sports events or first-run programming, partially offset by the consolidation of Tubi and Bento Box. 
We expect the majority of the amortization-related savings to be timing related, with costs expected to shift into our fiscal '21 financials, but more on that in a moment. In aggregate, we estimated that COVID-19 created an EBITDA headwind of approximately $15 million in the quarter across our entire business. 
Finally, from a P&L perspective, the net EBITDA loss in our other segment amounted to $101 million, a slight improvement from the comparable quarter in the prior year. Meanwhile, our P&L tax rate ended the year at 27%. The strong overall P&L results generated free cash flow, which we calculate as net cash provided by operating activities, less cash invested in property, plant and equipment of over $850 million in the quarter and $2 billion for the year. This equates to over 70% EBITDA to free cash flow conversion in the year, demonstrating the robust free cash flow profile we outlined at our Investor Day. 
And from an overall balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with over $4.6 billion in cash and just under $8 billion in debt, which includes the $1.2 billion in 5- and 10-year senior notes that we raised this past quarter.
In the 16 months since the spin, we've invested approximately $1.25 billion into our businesses through organic investments in our core operations, including the recent relaunch of our FOX Sports digital properties, and through strategic M&A. This latter group and our minority investments in acquisitions are worth highlighting given their inherent value to Fox that is not reflected in simple EBITDA multiple-based valuations.
At our 2019 Investor Day, we announced a strategic partnership with The Stars Group. At the time, we invested approximately $240 million in the publicly-traded TSG and licensed our brand to the Fox Bet suite of pay-to-play and free-to-play games. As part of the partnership, we have an option over 50 -- of up to 50% of the equity in TSG's U.S. businesses. 
Subsequent to TSG's merger with Flutter and our incremental equity investment of approximately $100 million, we now own roughly 3% of parent company, Flutter, at a current market valuation of more than $600 million. We retain our up to 50% call option over TSG's U.S. businesses, but in addition, have also secured the right to buy an approximately 18.5% equity stake in FanDuel with an exercise period of 10 years.  
Last October, we completed the acquisition of a 67% stake in Credible Labs, an emerging fintech marketplace, which was a key part of the Fox business brand refresh and is now in the early stages of integrating alongside our national and local news assets. Since announcement, Credible -- since announcement, Credible's trailing 12-month revenue has grown from the approximately $40 million that it reported as a stand-alone public company to approximately $70 million through the June quarter, with this momentum supporting our confidence to continue to invest cross-promotional resources in growing the platform.  
In April, we closed on the acquisition of Tubi, which we now report in our Television segment. Notwithstanding the challenges from COVID-19, we expect the boom in usage Lachlan outlined earlier, along with more effective monetization, to make Tubi a key source of revenue growth for many years to come. These recently acquired businesses, coupled with the renowned production capabilities in real estate of the Fox Studio lot and our tax asset, collectively represents significant pools of below-the-line value, hiding in plain sight at Fox Corporation.  
Before we open the call up to Q&A, let me provide a few markers to help you navigate the financial swings across our businesses in fiscal 2021. 
Beginning with a reminder of the events that create comparability issues between FY '20 and FY '21, where fiscal 2020 included the Super Bowl, 7-game World Series, the culmination of the FIFA Women's World Cup, along with Fox's Emmy Awards rotation. While fiscal 2021 will include what shapes to be a strong political year, the alternating NFC divisional playoff game and a full year consolidating our recent investments, including Tubi and Credible. 
Looking specifically at Q1, the combined effect of comparability in COVID is expected to reduce advertising revenue by roughly $250 million as compared to Q1 in fiscal 2020. While we will enjoy the benefits from political advertising, a greater volume of MLB regular-season games and NASCAR races, along with the acquisition of Tubi, these will be more than offset by lower base advertising at our local stations, a reduced slate of fresh entertainment programming, fewer NFL and college football games in our Q1 schedule and the absence of the World Cup, Emmys and the MLB All-Star game.  
You will recall that we amortize the costs of our live sports programming when the games actually air on our networks. As such, the postponement of the sports calendar in the June quarter creates a shift of amortization, primarily across MLB and NASCAR rights, into the first quarter of our fiscal '21. We anticipate that this will increase our total sports operating expenses in the September quarter by approximately $70 million in the cable segment, broadly offsetting other savings. 
This all, of course, assumes that the COVID-driven disruptions to major sports are behind us and that we enjoy a full season of NFL, a conference-only 10-game college football season and the MLB season completes. These assumptions remain valid today, and we have no intention of using this call to run through the list of what is. We're in constant dialogue with our sports partners, and if circumstances change, we will take appropriate steps for the business.  
The same underlying fundamentals hold for FOX Entertainment, where we amortize the costs of our programming as the content is on our broadcast network. What we are now looking at is a 2021 broadcast season that includes a number of titles originally intended for our spring 2020 schedule shifted into the fall. 
Furthermore, we are optimistic that our key returning titles, including The Masked Singer, can be made available for mid-season returns. If this outlook holds, we could end up seeing a relatively full broadcast season. However, our programming amortization may not follow its normal cadence across quarters. Rather, from an amortization standpoint, our fiscal Q1 and Q2 are likely to be lighter than a normal year, with a heavier concentration of costs being absorbed in Q4. Again, pending the timing of a return to production.  
From a cash flow perspective, we are planning for a high level of capital expenditure in fiscal '21, supporting the final phases of the build-out of our technical broadcast facility in Arizona and the upgrade of some of our station facilities. We will also have higher interest payments related to our debt raised this past quarter. 
Underscoring our financial strength and confidence from a capital allocation perspective, we have today declare a semiannual $0.23 a share dividend payable on October 7, right in line with the pre-COVID dividend we declared in February.  
While the continued uncertainties make it challenging for us to estimate the future performance of our business, the company entered this crisis in a position of operating and financial strength. We will continue to manage our business and our balance sheet in a disciplined and conservative manner so that we emerge as well-positioned as possible to take advantage of the opportunities during the recovery.  
And with that, I'd like to turn the call back to Joe."

You've obviously talked about The Stars Group investment, and we followed that, and that's been a very successful one. But this appears to be a market that's really booming in the states, even with COVID, and the prospects are quite optimistic. 
So I'm just wondering how you think about taking advantage of that opportunity even more than you already have? Are there things you're doing strategically with your partners or even on the FOX Network to sort of really lean in to sports betting to make it a bigger part of the business and a part of the story?"

So look, we -- I think we agree with you, from what it sounds like, and that we are big fans of the sports betting opportunity. Every projection is that it will be a several billion-dollar industry in the medium to long term. And everything we've seen to date not only reinforces that, but I think makes us believe it could be even larger than that. 
I think we feel today very well positioned both in having the joint venture in Fox Bet, which we -- as Steve mentioned, we have the option to go to 50% ownership of, depending on licensing. But we also have the 18.5% option to buy into the FanDuel. So we effectively have 2 dogs in the race, and we think that puts us in a great position. 
Moving forward, obviously, we have to see how the states open up from a regulatory point of view and as we move into each market. It's not necessarily the case that you'll have FanDuel and FOX Bet in all the same markets. For example, we found in FOX Bet the best markets for us, and we've just opened in Colorado, a market that have both sports betting but also gaming licenses. 
When you think about the funnel sort of monetize the customer -- the consumer, we'd start with a FOX Bet Super 6 as a free-to-play game. Those people, some of them will move through the funnel into our sports betting, the FOX Bet app or the FanDuel experience. And then a subset of those will actually go into our gaming environment, when there's no sports betting being played. 
So look, we think the opportunity is huge and is something that we'll continue to spend time on to drive -- to promote to FOX Sports and to invest in."

I know there's been a lot of talk about the upfront and some discussion about it on other calls. I think the thing -- well, the first thing I'd like to say is that the sales is very active at the moment, but it's a different sort of upfront this year for everyone, right, than in past years. I would call it sort of a rolling upfront. It's not a process that has a beginning, a middle and an end. We are working, as I think I said in the last call, with all of the agency groups and each of our clients as they reengage with their -- with consumers and customers across our platforms. 
And so some have been much more heavily impacted by COVID-19 than others. Obviously, the categories that are affected, retail, theatrical entertainment, fast food restaurants. Obviously, travel are all highly impacted by COVID-19. So each of those clients, we're engaged with and sort of negotiating with as we go forward. 
I think what you'll see is as we close -- and as we have closed upfront negotiations, you'll see that going right up until really through to the beginning of the football season. And we are incredibly heartened by the strength of scatter in the market. I think scatter, across the board, is in the mid- to high teens. I think that shows the demand for marketers to get back on air in a mass market and broad way. 
We are selling it across all of our platforms, news, sports, entertainment and Tubi. Tubi is now integrated in most, if not all, of our upfront conversations. When we add Tubi to a sale, it increases reach by over 20% for the client and also obviously makes the demographic younger and more diverse.  
And Jessica, to your question on FOX News, FOX News ratings have been astronomical. We are monetizing them very well. One of the benefits of COVID-19 has been with a larger news audience. The audience has also gotten younger, and that's brought actually new advertisers that hadn't advertised on FOX News, new advertisers on to the platform. 
So it's a very strong positive story for FOX News."

There's a -- the news ratings are so far above last year's. And as I mentioned, we have new clients and new categories of clients on FOX News. 
So news demand is really driven by the audience and by the ratings there, so we're seeing tremendous demand in news. Obviously, it's going to be a -- continue to be an incredibly strong news cycle, I think -- and certainly through to the end of the year. There's no let-up there. And I think advertisers are flocking to the certainty of those ratings and that audience.  
I think sports, there's a great pent-up demand for sport. We saw that in the sellouts in Major League Baseball. We saw that when we brought back NASCAR, the advertiser interest in NASCAR, and we expect to see it with football going forward as well. 
As we go through our upfront process, we have visibility in terms of what the clients are telling us that they expect to spend. And certainly, in news and sport, we're seeing healthy budgets there. I think entertainment is a different kettle of fish as people are waiting to see what happens in the fall season. 
As we explained earlier on the call, we have a relatively fresh scripted season with 2 shows that we had in the can that we hadn't aired. And we do hope to have The Masked Singer, not for mid-season but for the fall, if possible. And that would be -- that will absolutely drive ratings and revenue there as well.  
When we look to the stations, the -- we're heartened to see how quickly local advertising is coming back, particularly in those smaller markets. So the bottom half of our -- I don't want to say bottom half, but the smaller half of our station group, where they have, perhaps, less sort of population density, less shutdowns due to COVID-19, and those markets are coming back well. And as I mentioned before, the markets that are really buoyed are the ones where this political revenue has started to pour in. 
So -- and then the overlay of all of that is obviously scatter being very strong, which I think just goes anecdotally to the demand by advertisers and clients to get back and sort of mass marketing."

Good morning, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our first quarter results. 
Today is a big day for Fox, and not just because we get to brag about our strong financial performance, continued operating momentum and burdening digital assets such as Fox Bet and Tubi. But because every 4 years, we have the privilege and the responsibility of reporting on a U.S. presidential election. This very moment, as we speak, our viewers are starting their election day, turning on their TV sets to where they left them last night, the FOX News channel or opening their web browsers to foxnews.com or checking the FOX News app for the latest reporting. Throughout the day, tens of millions of Americans around the country will turn to Fox to follow our coverage of the Presidential election. As well as Senate, state and local races. They do this because they trust us and our legion of hard-working and diligent news professionals. 
Hours ago, our studios across the country were list for today's coverage and anchors, producers, camera operators, engineers, news editors, reporters and more all got ready for a long day and night ahead. But the real preparation for today began years ago. In fact, it is over 12 months since we launched our democracy 2020 campaign. This intentional careful planning has served us well. The energy and excitement are palpable in the newest rooms of our local FOX television stations and at FOX News where Brett Bayer and Martha McCallen will be live from studios in just a few hours. The news teams at the FOX television stations and FOX News have done a superb job throughout this election season. And viewers from across the political spectrum have been turning to us in record numbers as a result. 
FOX News finished September as the first cable network to lead all broadcast networks in weekday Prime, with total viewers for the full quarter. In fact, FOX News has been the most watched network in all of television from Memorial Day through election day. We achieved ratings growth in total day and prime time throughout the first quarter. FOX News total day ratings were up 28% in total viewers and 31% among adults 25 to 54 years old. Prime time ratings increased even more substantially, up 43% in total viewers and up 54% among adults 25 to 54 years old. This demo is sought out by advertisers. Making these gains particularly impactful. Already in the second quarter, the rate of growth in both total viewers and in the 25 to 54 demo has accelerated from last quarter. 
Just one recent example, last Tuesday, October 27, Tucker Carlson Tonight on the FOX News channel, had more total viewers than the seasoned premier of NBCS, this is us, that same night. And while our linear platform is remarkably strong, our audience is also increasingly accessing our digital products to connect with us. FOX News digital ended the first quarter with record engagement. More than 11.5 billion total video views. Total minutes watched clocked in at 14.2 billion, and unique visitors jumped to 115 million per month. FOX News not only draws the largest audiences nationally but also draws a more politically diverse audience in more strategically important states than any other cable news network. 
According to Nielsen, FOX News dominate share of viewing in swing states and key blue states. FOX News accounts for 50% of total prime time viewership in swing states compared to MSNBC with 28% and CNN with 23%. 
This is only possible because we speak to the broadest point of anyone in our competitive set. Our audience includes the greatest number of registered independence and likely voters of any cable news network. FOX News is relied on by 38% of registered independents. This speaks directly to the quality of our journalism and the balance of our reporting. People have noticed, this year, both presidential candidates and the pack supporting them have turned to FOX News to reach our large, engaged and diverse audience. In fact, 28 different political candidates or group's advertised in FOX News during the month of October. Additionally, we have shattered the record for political advertising at our local stations, surpassing the previous high set during the 2018 midterms. The geographical mix of our stations includes both the largest DMAs and locations that are long-standing and newly emerging swing states. This allows us to capture a significant share of local political ad spend. Since I spoke to you in August, we've gained increased visibility into local advertising pacing. Last quarter, our local stations were experiencing a year-over-year decrease in our base ad market of approximately 40%. Compare that to this first quarter, where our core stations were down approximately 20%. Including the benefit of political and station acquisitions, we are now pacing ahead over the same time last year. Looking at it slightly differently. At the beginning of COVID, our stations were pacing down nearly 50% compared to the prior year. Today, they are pacing ahead. This is a tremendous return to strength in a remarkably short period of time. All of our stations also play an important role in connecting audiences in key sports markets with football, baseball and other FOX Sports programming. We have stations in nearing all NFC markets, including our recent additions in Seattle and Milwaukee. While overall NFL viewership has been -- has seen year-to-year declines across all of its partners, Fox's America's Game of the Week is well on its way to our 12th consecutive season as TV's most walk show. America's Game of the Week is averaging over 24 million viewers, up slightly over last year. We used this our 27th season of NFL and FOX to accelerate awareness and use of the free-to-play Fox bet Super 6 app. By week 5 of the NFL, we signed up more than 1.3 million new users, meaningfully surpassing our estimates and increasing total installed users to over 2.9 million. More than 1.2 million people played in our November 1 NFL Super 6 scan. By promoting the Fox Bet Super 6 app across our entire portfolio, we have greatly expanded its user base. Expect more sports and non sports games and promotions across our platforms, given the results we are seeing. One week ago, Sunday, the Super 6 app was #6 in the entire iOS app store, only behind apps like Facebook and Snapchat. And Super 6 is consistently at or near the top of the sports category in iOS and Android downloads. Drafting off the success of Super 6, FOX Bet, our sports betting app is also energizing users. The app, which is currently available in Colorado, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, has been the third most downloaded sportsbook app for the past 2 consecutive weeks. That will only increase as we launch in new states. We anticipate our next launch will be in Michigan early next year. 
All of our FOX businesses are committed to our partnership with Flutter and propelling this growth of the Super 6 and Fox Bet platforms. Each week, we are driving over 100 million media impressions across our portfolio of owned and operated box assets. 
Another important digital expansion for the company our ad-supported streaming platform Tubi is thriving. Let me start with the astronomical growth we've seen this quarter. In August, Tubi reported 33 million monthly active users, representing a 65% year-over-year jump. More importantly, since acquisition, Tubi has averaged approximately 100% increase year-over-year in total view time, the most meaningful metric when measuring the performance of any AVOD service. This is due in part to the more than 41 Fox titles currently available on Tubi, including The Mask Singer; Gordon Ramsey's, 24 Hours to Hell and Back; and Lego Masters. When Tubi began streaming The Mask Singer, the show quickly became Tubi's #1 television series overall. We used the show to introduce viewers to Tubi. And we are also driving them to the platform through marketing across our networks, including the FOX Network and FOX News. 
Most recently, to be sponsored the post game show during the Major League playoffs and the world series on Fox. Using these internal to marketing opportunities will increase consumer awareness of Tubi, which will drive exploration and viewing. We are also using our television stations to promote and differentiate Tubi. As part of Tubi's News on Tubi launched on Roku and Amazon Fire in October, viewers now have access to live feeds from 18 Fox owned and operated stations in top markets, including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Dallas. The News on Tubi offering also includes content from third parties, including Liver TV and NC News now. News on Tubi serves several important objectives. It provides viewers with the best in local news and further leverages the assets of FOX while also expanding consumers, understanding of what Tubi offers. With News on Tubi, the platform is, for the first time, providing live viewing opportunities. And we are now monetizing this new content and our impressive viewership gains. We are including Tubi in all of our ad sales discussions. The power of the Fox and Tubi partnership is evident. Since September 1, Tubi has achieved 45 of the top 50 revenue days in its history. With a median age of 34, Tubi's audience is young, diverse and in-demand for many brands. The leading top entertainment programs that feed to be are an important synergy that we will continue to capitalize on with new and returning shows. 
All of FOX Entertainment's returning shows including the 911 franchise, Prodigal Son, The Resident and Last Man Standing, are back in production with scheduled return dates in early January. As in previous years, Fox will launch a robust and strong slate of shows mid season, utilizing the end of the NFL season and NFC championship as a spring board. Despite pandemic-related production halts in the summer that impacted its fall lineup, FOX Entertainment had a successful premier week this television season. For premier week, which is the week of September 21, FOX was the #1 network for entertainment programming. Fox also kicked off the 2020, 2021 fall television season with the #1 new series, the #1 comedy and the #1 drama. And Fox has continued that leadership position, ranking as the #1 network for the week of October 19. Each of our core brands is a powerhouse. Distinctly positioned to differentiate itself from competitors and appeal to viewers. The power of our total portfolio, though, is even greater than the sum of its parts. 
Look at the share of voice recently achieved by the FOX Network and the FOX News channel on Thursday, October 29. Together, these networks made up 65% of TV total viewer share compared to the rest of broadcast. The reliable primetime strength of FOX News in combination with NFL on Fox captured nearly 2/3 of all viewers watching broadcast television that evening. On several October evenings, our leadership brands accounted for at least half of all viewers watching broadcast television. And that occurs when we have sports on the network and also when we air one of our entertainment hits. The power of our brands is not only recognized by our audiences and advertisers, it is also valued by our distribution partners. In the first quarter, we saw affiliate revenues grow by 10%, driven by healthy rate increases. While we did continue to see a decline in subscriber volume, that trend is improving. This past quarter, we saw industry subscribers decline around 6%, which is an approximately 50 basis point improvement from what we experienced last quarter. And our recent agreements, coupled with updates we heard during the recent earnings calls in October, from AT&T, Comcast and Charter, give us an encouraging look into the December quarter. Our networks and content continue to be essential to the services offered by traditional and virtual MVPDs. 
We are sustaining our momentum and building on our strengths. With increased visibility to the market and a resumption of sports and entertainment production, we are optimistic about and excited for the remainder of the fiscal year. And now Steve will take us through the details of the quarter."

It's a busy day, so let's get straight to our results. The company delivered total revenues of $2.72 billion, up 2% over the comparative period in fiscal 2020, led by affiliate revenues that grew 10%, once again demonstrating the strength of our brands and our focused portfolio of channels. From an advertising revenue perspective, we continue to see strong growth at FOX News Media and record political revenues saw us return to growth at our FOX Television Stations. This underlying and sustained strength was offset by COVID-19 related supply side factors that saw the postponement of live sports events and key scripted entertainment content at the FOX Network. Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $1.17 billion, up $310 million over the comparative period in fiscal '20 due to the top line revenue increases in revenue, and the timing of programming expenses as a result of COVID-19. This improvement in EBITDA flowed through to the bottom line, where net income attributable to stockholders of $1.11 billion or $1.83 per share was higher than the $499 million or $0.80 per share in the prior year quarter. This increase included a onetime gain recognized in other net associated with the reimbursement of a cash tax prepayment from Disney, following the disposition of certain 21st Century Fox assets. 
Excluding the impact of the Disney reimbursement and other noncore items, adjusted EPS of $1.18 was up 42% compared to last year's $0.83 per share, primarily reflecting revenue and EBITDA growth. 
Turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter, with cable networks EBITDA of $781 million was up 14% on revenue growth of 3%. Cable affiliate revenues increased 4%, supported by higher average rates partially offset by a net decrease in pay television subscribers of 6%. Cable advertising revenues increased 18%, led by another quarter of impressive linear and digital growth at FOX News Media, partially offset by the postponement of live sporting events, namely Big 10 and PAC 12 Football at our Cable Sportsnet. 
Cable other revenues decreased by $39 million, due to the absence of sports sublicensing revenues, which in turn are broadly offset by a commensurate reduction in rights costs. EBITDA at our cable segment increased $97 million over the prior year period. This reflects the revenue growth that I just noted as well as lower sports programming rights amortization and production costs, principally due to the postponement of live events as a result of COVID-19. Partially offsetting these lower costs of FOX Sports were increased expenses of FOX News Media due to the coverage of breaking news, including the presidential election and continued investment in our digital news initiatives. 
The television segment reported EBITDA of $457 million, an increase of $206 million, while revenues were essentially in line with the prior year quarter. Television affiliate revenues increased 23% in the period, reflecting double-digit increases for both our programming fees from nonowned station affiliates and direct retransmission revenues at our owned and operated stations. From a television advertising perspective, our local TV stations generated record political advertising revenues in the quarter, reversing the COVID-driven trend of the June quarter to be up versus prior year. This, coupled with the addition of revenues from the fast-growing Tubi, was more than offset in the segment by covert related postponements of college football and key scripted entertainment program, along with comparability items, most notably 2 fewer NFL regular season broadcast windows and our broadcast of the Emmy Awards in the prior period. 
EBITDA at our television segment increased $206 million over the prior year period on the back of lower operating expenses. The decrease in expenses was driven by lower programming rights amortization and production costs at FOX Sports, including fewer NFL broadcast windows. Additionally, there were far fewer college football games in the quarter. 
FOX Entertainment also saw lower programming rights amortization due to delayed productions of key scripted titles as a result of COVID in the current year quarter and the broadcast of the Emmy Awards in the prior year quarter. 
Turning now to free cash flow, which we calculate as net cash provided by operating activities, less cash invested in property, plant and equipment. In the quarter, we generated $150 million of free cash flow, which is entirely consistent with the seasonality of working capital in our business, reflecting both our confidence in the business, and our balanced approach to capital allocation. So far this fiscal year, we have deployed $305 million of capital to repurchase approximately 8 million Class A shares and 3 million Class B shares. Against our buyback authorization of $2 billion, we have now cumulatively repurchased just over $900 million, representing approximately 4.5% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in November. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $5.1 billion in cash and $7.9 billion in debt. Looking through to the second quarter, the strong advertising momentum at News, our local television stations and Tubi have all carried forward into the first month of this current quarter. We anticipate that these factors, coupled with the heavy schedule of sports events, will translate into a return to growth in overall advertising revenue in the fiscal second quarter, notwithstanding what remains a mid-season focused entertainment slate with the return of our key scripted shows in the new calendar year. 
Meanwhile, from a cost perspective, we anticipate that the timing benefits seen in our first quarter content costs from sports events and entertainment slate postponements will begin to unwind in the second quarter through the remainder of the fiscal year. In terms of cash flow, we continue to anticipate relatively low working capital usage over the course of the full fiscal year with our normal work -- with our normal working capital patterns for the first half deficit that largely reverses in the second half. As we have foreshadowed in the past, we continue to expect a higher level of capital expenditure in fiscal '21 to support the final phases of the build-out of our technical broadcast facility in Arizona and the upgrade of some of our station facilities. All of this, of course, assumes that the COVID-driven disruptions to major sports and the production delays to our key entertainment properties are behind us. 
As our first quarter results demonstrate, we have seen a meaningful recovery in our underlying business. This operating momentum combined with the benefits of strong free cash flow and liquidity, moderate leverage and the absence of any debt maturity until early 2022 position us particularly well for the future. And with that, I'll now turn the call back to Joe."

And I think we are looking forward, and as I sort of alluded to in my prepared comments, we are now coming through a period of uncertainty for all businesses. Either a period, we are seeing greatly improved visibility going forward. So I think what that means is that we have a good idea of what our future capital needs are. We're deeply confident in our underlying business and cash generation. So as we look at our cash on the balance sheet, we really think about balancing how we deploy that towards acquisitions, organic investments in our business and capital returns to our shareholders. We don't have a formula in terms of how we would allocate between those categories. But we have, to date, bought back $900 million worth of our stock. Which leaves us with $1.1 billion of capacity under our buyback authorization, which we fully intend to complete.

Obviously, we're not going to get into the detail of our NFL negotiation. But as I've previously mentioned, the NFL and on earlier earnings calls as well, the NFL, along with, obviously, Major League baseball, remains amongst our very top priorities and are really our #1 programming partner. It's been a partnership that's gone back 27 years. We look forward to continuing that partnership. And you can see it in our ratings. While NFL ratings have been soft this year because of a number of factors, which we believe are unique to this  particular year with sports -- premium sports moving all to the fall, creating a more crowded marketplace for sports fans. And also with, frankly, the new cycle where we've seen news viewing. You have to remember that the news audience and the sports audience, particularly the NFL audience, has a tremendous overlap cable news view, and I think is up 46% during this NFL season. 
So we think some of the softness in the ratings is unique to this season. And because of that, we're confident in the partnership in our partnership with the NFL going forward. In terms of Tubi, as you see fragmentation in the linear television market, particularly in linear entertainment. Tubi is the beneficiary of that. Tubi sits on the other side of that ledger, which is gaining audience and users from linear television market. So we think Tubi has a lot of tailwinds behind it, and we're excited to report on its milestones as we achieve them going forward."

We see as we -- and by the way, that's driven ratings. It's driven revenue, I think FOX News revenue -- advertising revenue is up  36%, which is a tremendous result. But as you look at our audience and you look at our ratings, you have to look at -- and this is true for the whole news ecosystem, you have to look in 2 different ways. One is the total news audience and then the appetite for news. And the second is share. But first, the appetite for news and the new cycle, the new stories that are out are sort of out of our control. And I would expect, as we enter a more normal new cycle, which has to happen eventually. That appetite for news will shift back to appetite for great American pass times of watching football and watching baseball and watching The Masked Singer or I Can See Your Voice. And we look forward to that shift. Having said that, what we can control within the news ecosystem, what we aim to control is share. And I strongly believe, and we've seen this through, I think now 18 years, off top of my head of different administrations and different political cycles, we've maintained our #1 position through all of that. So  I think that answers the first part of your question, I will give you some insight on how we're thinking about the first part of your question. So the new cycle will moderate. We fully expect to be #1 and maintain share through that. 
I think the second part of your question, Michael, was around new entrants and competition into the news environment. We love competition. We have always thrived with competition. And we have strong competition now. I would say the only difference today versus some years ago as our audience has grown and our reach has grown, we see our competition as no longer only cable news providers, but also as the traditional broadcast networks. And as you know, FOX News has been the #1 network, including broadcast networks now, as I mentioned, through from Labor Day through to election day."

So when we think of both the key metrics of time spent viewing, total users and as importantly or maybe most importantly, revenue, Tubi consistently and continually is exceeding every expectation in our acquisition case."

I'm just wondering, as you guys think about the NFL landscape is that a package that could be interesting to Fox, maybe over a Tubi-like platform? Or are you concerned that, that may go wider than the satellite distribution model we've seen in the past, impacting potentially the local broadcast ratings. Just curious if you have a perspective on that, on the outcome there?"

And then when we look at it across the first half, so July 1 through to today, without wanting to steal the thunder of the next earnings call, we'll push close to $300 million of ad revenue, political ad revenue for the full 6 months.

In prior years, political advertising has been almost entirely local. And the growth in national political advertising, particularly on FOX News, but also, importantly, in sports has been a new and I think very positive development. And it goes, obviously, also to the quality of our audience. That also, by the way, has the impact. Usually, I think us, Jessica asks a question about the advertising market, but there are more important things to discuss. But what the political -- the robustness of the political market has really done is really drive our scatter pricing up as advertisers have scrambled to find time set our advertising across local stations, across sports, across news and across entertainment is up strongly. And we took the strategic decision to hold back a little bit more time than we normally would in our upfront negotiations, about roughly 5% more time. We held back for scatter. And that  bet is paying off handsomely. 
As we move on to Sunday ticket, look, it's -- Sunday ticket is tremendous consumer offering. It doesn't work, I think, without a subscription under anything other than a subscription model. So it's not really something that we would  consider or have the business model to monetize. But thank you for the question, Ben."

Good morning, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our first quarter results.  
Today is a big day for Fox, and not just because we get to brag about our strong financial performance, continued operating momentum and burgeoning digital assets such as FOX Bet and Tubi, but because every 4 years, we have the privilege and the responsibility of reporting on a U.S. presidential election. 
This very moment, as we speak, our viewers are starting their election day, turning on their TV sets to where they left them last night, the FOX News channel, or opening their web browsers to FoxNews.com or checking the FOX News app for the latest reporting. Throughout the day, tens of millions of Americans around the country will turn to Fox to follow our coverage of the Presidential election as well as Senate, state and local races. They do this because they trust us and our legion of hard-working and diligent news professionals.  
Hours ago, our studios across the country were lit for today's coverage and anchors, producers, camera operators, engineers, news editors, reporters and more all got ready for a long day and night ahead. 
But the real preparation for today began years ago. In fact, it is over 12 months since we launched our Democracy 2020 campaign. This intentional, careful planning has served us well. The energy and excitement are palpable in the newest rooms of our local FOX Television stations and at FOX News where Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum will be live from studio F in just a few hours. 
The news teams at the FOX Television stations and FOX News have done a superb job throughout this election season. And viewers from across the political spectrum have been turning to us in record numbers as a result.  
FOX News finished September as the first cable network to lead all broadcast networks in weekday prime with total viewers for the full quarter. In fact, FOX News has been the most watched network in all of television from Memorial Day through election day. We achieved ratings growth in total day and primetime throughout the first quarter. FOX News total day ratings were up 28% in total viewers and 31% among adults 25 to 54 years old. 
Primetime ratings increased even more substantially, up 43% in total viewers and up 54% among adults 25 to 54 years old. This demo is sought out by advertisers, making these gains particularly impactful. Already in the second quarter, the rate of growth in both total viewers and in the 25 to 54 demo has accelerated from last quarter.  
Just one recent example. Last Tuesday, October 27, Tucker Carlson Tonight on the FOX News channel had more total viewers than the seasoned premier of NBCs This Is Us that same night. 
And while our linear platform is remarkably strong, our audience is also increasingly accessing our digital products to connect with us. FOX News Digital ended the first quarter with record engagement, more than 11.5 billion total video views. Total minutes watched clocked in at 14.2 billion, and unique visitors jumped to 115 million per month. FOX News not only draws the largest audiences nationally, but also draws a more politically diverse audience in more strategically important states than any other cable news network.  
According to Nielsen, FOX News is dominant in share of viewing in swing states and key blue states. FOX News accounts for 50% of total primetime viewership in swing states compared to MSNBC with 28% and CNN with 23%.  
This is only possible because we speak to the broadest audience of anyone in our competitive set. Our audience includes the greatest number of registered independents and likely voters of any cable news network. FOX News is relied on by 38% of registered independents. This speaks directly to the quality of our journalism and the balance of our reporting. 
People have noticed. This year, both presidential candidates and the pack supporting them have turned to FOX News to reach our large, engaged and diverse audience. In fact, 28 different political candidates or groups advertised in FOX News during the month of October. 
Additionally, we have shattered the record for political advertising at our local stations, surpassing the previous high set during the 2018 midterms. The geographical mix of our stations includes both the largest DMAs and locations that are long-standing and newly emerging swing states. This allows us to capture a significant share of local political ad spend. 
Since I spoke to you in August, we've gained increased visibility into local advertising pacing. Last quarter, our local stations were experiencing a year-over-year decrease in our base ad market of approximately 40%, compare that to this first quarter where our core stations were down approximately 20%. Including the benefit of political and station acquisitions, we are now pacing ahead over the same time last year. 
Looking at it slightly differently. At the beginning of COVID, our stations were pacing down nearly 50% compared to the prior year. Today, they are pacing ahead. This is a tremendous return to strength in a remarkably short period of time. 
All of our stations also play an important role in connecting audiences in key sports markets with football, baseball and other FOX Sports programming. We have stations in nearly all NFC markets, including our recent additions in Seattle and Milwaukee. While overall NFL viewership has been -- has seen year-to-year declines across all of its partners, Fox's AMERICA'S GAME OF THE WEEK is well on its way to a 12th consecutive season as TV's most watched show. AMERICA'S GAME OF THE WEEK is averaging over 24 million viewers, up slightly over last year. We used this, our 27th season of NFL in FOX, to accelerate awareness and use of the free-to-play FOX Bet Super 6 app. 
By week 5 of the NFL, we signed up more than 1.3 million new users, meaningfully surpassing our estimates and increasing total installed users to over 2.9 million. More than 1.2 million people played in our November 1 NFL Super 6 game. 
By promoting the FOX Bet Super 6 app across our entire portfolio, we have greatly expanded its user base. Expect more sports and nonsports games and promotions across our platforms, given the results we are seeing. One week ago, Sunday, the Super 6 app was #6 in the entire iOS app store, only behind apps like Facebook and Snapchat. And Super 6 is consistently at or near the top of the sports category in iOS and Android downloads. 
Drafting off the success of Super 6, FOX Bet, our sports betting app, is also energizing users. The app, which is currently available in Colorado, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, has been the third most downloaded sportsbook app for the past 2 consecutive weeks. That will only increase as we launch in new states. We anticipate our next launch will be in Michigan early next year.  
All of our FOX businesses are committed to our partnership with Flutter and propelling this growth of the Super 6 and FOX Bet platforms. Each week, we are driving over 100 million media impressions across our portfolio of owned and operated FOX assets.  
Another important digital expansion for the company, our ad-supported streaming platform, Tubi, is thriving. Let me start with the astronomical growth we've seen this quarter. In August, Tubi reported 33 million monthly active users, representing a 65% year-over-year jump. More importantly, since acquisition, Tubi has averaged approximately 100% increase year-over-year in total view time, the most meaningful metric when measuring the performance of any AVOD service. This is due in part to the more than 41 FOX titles currently available on Tubi, including The Masked Singer, Gordon Ramsay's 24 Hours to Hell and Back and LEGO Masters. 
When Tubi began streaming The Masked Singer, the show quickly became Tubi's #1 television series overall. We used the show to introduce viewers to Tubi. And we are also driving them to the platform through marketing across our networks, including the FOX Network and FOX News.  
Most recently, Tubi sponsored the postgame show during the Major League playoffs and the World Series on FOX. Using these internal cross-marketing opportunities will increase consumer awareness of Tubi, which will drive exploration and viewing. 
We are also using our television stations to promote and differentiate Tubi. As part of Tubi's News on Tubi launched on Roku and Amazon Fire in October, viewers now have access to live feeds from 18 FOX-owned and operated stations in top markets, including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Dallas. 
The News on Tubi offering also includes content from third-parties, including Bloomberg TV and NBC News NOW. 
News on Tubi serves several important objectives. It provides viewers with the best in local news and further leverages the assets of FOX while also expanding consumers, understanding of what Tubi offers. With News on Tubi, the platform is, for the first time, providing live viewing opportunities. And we are now monetizing this new content and our impressive viewership gains. We are including Tubi in all of our ad sales discussions. The power of the FOX and Tubi partnership is evident. Since September 1, Tubi has achieved 45 of the top 50 revenue days in its history. With a median age of 34, Tubi's audience is young, diverse and in-demand for many brands. The leading top entertainment programs that feed Tubi are an important synergy that we will continue to capitalize on with new and returning shows.  
All of FOX Entertainment's returning shows including the 9-1-1 franchise, Prodigal Son, The Resident and Last Man Standing are back in production with scheduled return dates in early January. As in previous years, FOX will launch a robust and strong slate of shows midseason, utilizing the end of the NFL season and NFC championship as a springboard. 
Despite pandemic-related production halts in the summer that impacted its fall lineup, FOX Entertainment had a successful premier week this television season. For premier week, which is the week of September 21, FOX was the #1 network for entertainment programming. FOX also kicked off the 2020-2021 fall television season with the #1 new series, the #1 comedy and the #1 drama. And FOX has continued that leadership position, ranking as the #1 network for the week of October 19. 
Each of our core brands is a powerhouse, distinctly positioned to differentiate itself from competitors and appeal to viewers. The power of our total portfolio, though, is even greater than the sum of its parts.  
Look at the share of voice recently achieved by the FOX Network and the FOX News channel on Thursday, October 29. Together, these networks made up 65% of TV total viewer share compared to the rest of broadcast. The reliable primetime strength of FOX News, in combination with NFL on FOX captured nearly 2/3 of all viewers watching broadcast television that evening. On several October evenings, our leadership brands accounted for at least half of all viewers watching broadcast television and that occurs when we have sports on the network and also when we air one of our entertainment hits. 
The power of our brands is not only recognized by our audiences and advertisers, it is also valued by our distribution partners. In the first quarter, we saw affiliate revenues grow by 10%, driven by healthy rate increases. While we did continue to see a decline in subscriber volume, that trend is improving. This past quarter, we saw industry subscribers decline around 6%, which is an approximately 50 basis point improvement from what we experienced last quarter. 
And our recent agreements, coupled with updates we heard during the recent earnings calls in October from AT&T, Comcast and Charter, give us an encouraging look into the December quarter. Our networks and content continue to be essential to the services offered by traditional and virtual MVPDs.  
We are sustaining our momentum and building on our strengths. With increased visibility to the market and a resumption of sports and entertainment production, we are optimistic about and excited for the remainder of the fiscal year. 
And now Steve will take us through the details of the quarter."

It's a busy day, so let's get straight to our results. The company delivered total revenues of $2.72 billion, up 2% over the comparative period in fiscal 2020, led by affiliate revenues that grew 10%, once again demonstrating the strength of our brands and our focused portfolio of channels. 
From an advertising revenue perspective, we continued to see strong growth at FOX News Media and record political revenues saw us return to growth at our FOX Television Stations. This underlying and sustained strength was offset by COVID-19-related supply-side factors that saw the postponement of live sports events and key scripted entertainment content at the FOX Network. 
Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $1.17 billion, up $310 million over the comparative period in fiscal '20 due to the top line revenue increases in revenue and the timing of programming expenses as a result of COVID-19. 
This improvement in EBITDA flowed through to the bottom line where net income attributable to stockholders of $1.11 billion or $1.83 per share was higher than the $499 million or $0.80 per share in the prior year quarter. This increase included a onetime gain recognized in Other, net associated with the reimbursement of a cash tax prepayment from Disney, following the disposition of certain 21st Century Fox assets.  
Excluding the impact of the Disney reimbursement and other noncore items, adjusted EPS of $1.18 was up 42% compared to last year's $0.83 per share, primarily reflecting revenue and EBITDA growth.  
Turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter with Cable Networks EBITDA of $781 million, it was up 14% on revenue growth of 3%. 
Cable affiliate revenues increased 4%, supported by higher average rates partially offset by a net decrease in pay television subscribers of 6%. 
Cable advertising revenues increased 18%, led by another quarter of impressive linear and digital growth at FOX News Media, partially offset by the postponement of live sporting events, namely Big Ten and Pac-12 Football at our cable, Sports Net.  
Cable other revenues decreased by $39 million due to the absence of sports sublicensing revenues, which in turn are broadly offset by a commensurate reduction in rights costs. 
EBITDA at our Cable segment increased $97 million over the prior year period. This reflects the revenue growth that I just noted as well as lower sports programming rights amortization and production costs, principally due to the postponement of live events as a result of COVID-19. Partially offsetting these lower costs at FOX Sports were increased expenses of FOX News Media due to the coverage of breaking news, including the presidential election, and continued investment in our digital news initiatives.  
The Television segment reported EBITDA of $457 million, an increase of $206 million, while revenues were essentially in line with the prior year quarter. Television affiliate revenues increased 23% in the period, reflecting double-digit increases for both our programming fees from nonowned station affiliates and direct retransmission revenues at our owned and operated stations. 
From a Television advertising perspective, our local TV stations generated record political advertising revenues in the quarter, reversing the COVID-driven trend of the June quarter to be up versus prior year. This, coupled with the addition of revenues from the fast-growing Tubi, was more than offset in the segment by COVID-related postponements of college football and key scripted entertainment program, along with comparability items, most notably 2 fewer NFL regular season broadcast windows and our broadcast of the Emmy Awards in the prior period.  
EBITDA at our Television segment increased $206 million over the prior year period on the back of lower operating expenses. The decrease in expenses was driven by lower programming rights amortization and production costs at FOX Sports, including fewer NFL broadcast windows. Additionally, there were far fewer college football games in the quarter.  
FOX Entertainment also saw lower programming rights amortization due to delayed productions of key scripted titles as a result of COVID in the current year quarter and the broadcast of the Emmy Awards in the prior year quarter.  
Turning now to free cash flow, which we calculate as net cash provided by operating activities less cash invested in property, plant and equipment. In the quarter, we generated $150 million of free cash flow, which is entirely consistent with the seasonality of working capital in our business. 
Reflecting both our confidence in the business and our balanced approach to capital allocation, so far this fiscal year, we have deployed $305 million of capital to repurchase approximately 8 million Class A shares and 3 million Class B shares. Against our buyback authorization of $2 billion, we have now cumulatively repurchased just over $900 million, representing approximately 4.5% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in November.  
From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $5.1 billion in cash and $7.9 billion in debt. 
Looking through to the second quarter, the strong advertising momentum at News, our local television stations and Tubi have all carried forward into the first month of this current quarter. We anticipate that these factors, coupled with the heavy schedule of sports events, will translate into a return to growth in overall advertising revenue in the fiscal second quarter notwithstanding what remains a midseason-focused entertainment slate with the return of our key scripted shows in the new calendar year.  
Meanwhile, from a cost perspective, we anticipate that the timing benefits seen in our first quarter content costs from sports events and entertainment slate postponements will begin to unwind in the second quarter through the remainder of the fiscal year. 
In terms of cash flow, we continue to anticipate relatively low working capital usage over the course of the full fiscal year with our normal working capital patterns for the first half deficit that largely reverses in the second half. 
As we have foreshadowed in the past, we continue to expect a higher level of capital expenditure in fiscal '21 to support the final phases of the build-out of our technical broadcast facility in Arizona and the upgrade of some of our station facilities. All of this, of course, assumes that the COVID-driven disruptions to major sports and the production delays to our key entertainment properties are behind us.  
As our first quarter results demonstrate, we have seen a meaningful recovery in our underlying business. This operating momentum, combined with the benefits of strong free cash flow and liquidity, moderate leverage and the absence of any debt maturity until early 2022, position us particularly well for the future. 
And with that, I'll now turn the call back to Joe."

Obviously, we're not going to get into the detail of our NFL negotiation. But as I've previously mentioned, the NFL -- and on earlier earnings calls as well, the NFL, along with, obviously, Major League Baseball, remains amongst our very top priorities and are really our #1 programming partner. It's been a partnership that's gone back 27 years. We look forward to continuing that partnership, and you can see it in our ratings. 
While NFL ratings have been soft this year because of a number of factors, which we believe are unique to this particular year with sports -- premium sports moving all to the fall, creating a more crowded marketplace for sports fans and also with, frankly, the new cycle where we've seen news viewing. You have to remember that the news audience and the sports audience, particularly the NFL audience, has a tremendous overlap. Cable news view, I think, is up 46% during this NFL season. 
So we think some of the softness in the ratings is unique to this season. And because of that, we're confident in the partnership -- in our partnership with the NFL going forward. 
In terms of Tubi, as you see fragmentation in the linear television market, particularly in linear entertainment, Tubi is the beneficiary of that. Tubi sits on the other side of that ledger, which is gaining audience and users from linear television market. So we think Tubi has a lot of tailwinds behind it, and we're excited to report on its milestones as we achieve them going forward."

But if I just look at expenses and really just trying to isolate for things that have been scheduled out of Q1 into Q2, Q3, Q4, I'd say that we benefited from about $270 million, $280 million of the expenses in Q1 that will shift into the back half of the -- or the back 3 quarters of the year. You'll have a reasonable concentration of that in Q2 because it's when you'll have a heavy concentration of both NFL and college football, and then we'll see the entertainment hit largely Q3 into Q4."

As far as the impact on FOX News of the presidential election, of course, it's been, to date, an incredible news cycle throughout the election, but also through the other incredible news stories and massive news stories out of the year, obviously, COVID being the main one. We see as we -- and by the way, that's driven ratings. It's driven revenue, I think FOX News revenue -- advertising revenue is up 36%, which is a tremendous result. 
But as you look at our audience and you look at our ratings, you have to look at -- and this is true for the whole news ecosystem, you have to look in 2 different ways. One is the total news audience and then the appetite for news, and the second is share. The first, the appetite for news and the new cycle, the new stories that are out are sort of out of our control. And I would expect, as we enter a more normal news cycle, which has to happen eventually, that appetite for news will shift back to appetite for great American pastimes of watching football and watching baseball and watching The Masked Singer or I Can See Your Voice, and we look forward to that shift. Having said that, what we can control within the news ecosystem, what we aim to control is share. And I strongly believe, and we've seen this through, I think now 18 years, off top of my head of different administrations and different political cycles, we've maintained our #1 position through all of that. 
So I think that answers the first part of your question or I've given you some insight on how we're thinking about the first part of your question. So the news cycle will moderate. We fully expect to be #1 and maintain share through that. 
I think the second part of your question, Michael, was around new entrants and competition into the news environment. We love competition. We have always thrived with competition. And we have strong competition now. I would say the only difference today versus some years ago, as our audience has grown and our reach has grown, we see our competition as no longer only cable news providers, but also as the traditional broadcast networks. And as you know, FOX News has been the #1 network, including broadcast networks now, as I mentioned, through -- from Labor Day through to election day."

However, Jessica, as you'll remember, the structure of our partnership with Flutter is that they control the FOX Bet business today and they fund the FOX Bet business today as Fox Corporation is not a licensed entity. Having said that, we work with them incredibly closely in terms of the promotion of FOX Bet in order to grow the value within that joint venture. 
The second part of your question on Tubi, we are now, and we have now for several months, selling Tubi, and I should have actually also spoken to this with Alexia's question. We are selling Tubi in every single one of our conversations with our advertising partners. Tubi increases Fox's reach by over 20%. And it's a young and diverse audience, which is unduplicated -- or largely unduplicated part of the Fox audience. And so the -- every time I talk to Farhad, which is very regularly, there's a new daily revenue record that he hits, and -- which is tremendous to see. And look, to be honest, we're only at the beginning.

And the growth in national political advertising, particularly on FOX News, but also, importantly, in sports has been a new and I think very positive development. And it goes, obviously, also to the quality of our audience that also, by the way, has the impact. 
Usually -- I think, usually -- Jessica asked a question about the advertising market, but I suppose there were more important things to discuss. But what the political -- the robustness of the political market has really done is really drive our scatter pricing up as advertisers have scrambled to find time, scatter advertising across local stations, across sports, across news and across entertainment is up strongly. And we took the strategic decision to hold back a little bit more time than we normally would in our upfront negotiations, about roughly 5% more time we held back for scatter. And that bet is paying off handsomely. 
As we move on to Sunday Ticket, look, it's -- Sunday Ticket is a tremendous consumer offering. It doesn't work, I think, without a subscription -- under anything other than a subscription model. So it's not really something that we would consider or have the business model to monetize. But thank you for the question, Ben."

Good morning, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our first quarter results.  
Today is a big day for Fox, and not just because we get to brag about our strong financial performance, continued operating momentum and burgeoning digital assets such as FOX Bet and Tubi, but because every 4 years, we have the privilege and the responsibility of reporting on a U.S. presidential election. 
This very moment, as we speak, our viewers are starting their election day, turning on their TV sets to where they left them last night, the FOX News channel, or opening their web browsers to FoxNews.com or checking the FOX News app for the latest reporting. Throughout the day, tens of millions of Americans around the country will turn to Fox to follow our coverage of the Presidential election as well as Senate, state and local races. They do this because they trust us and our legion of hard-working and diligent news professionals.  
Hours ago, our studios across the country were lit for today's coverage and anchors, producers, camera operators, engineers, news editors, reporters and more all got ready for a long day and night ahead. 
But the real preparation for today began years ago. In fact, it is over 12 months since we launched our Democracy 2020 campaign. This intentional, careful planning has served us well. The energy and excitement are palpable in the newest rooms of our local FOX Television stations and at FOX News where Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum will be live from studio F in just a few hours. 
The news teams at the FOX Television stations and FOX News have done a superb job throughout this election season. And viewers from across the political spectrum have been turning to us in record numbers as a result.  
FOX News finished September as the first cable network to lead all broadcast networks in weekday prime with total viewers for the full quarter. In fact, FOX News has been the most watched network in all of television from Memorial Day through election day. We achieved ratings growth in total day and primetime throughout the first quarter. FOX News total day ratings were up 28% in total viewers and 31% among adults 25 to 54 years old. 
Primetime ratings increased even more substantially, up 43% in total viewers and up 54% among adults 25 to 54 years old. This demo is sought out by advertisers, making these gains particularly impactful. Already in the second quarter, the rate of growth in both total viewers and in the 25 to 54 demo has accelerated from last quarter.  
Just one recent example. Last Tuesday, October 27, Tucker Carlson Tonight on the FOX News channel had more total viewers than the seasoned premier of NBCs This Is Us that same night. 
And while our linear platform is remarkably strong, our audience is also increasingly accessing our digital products to connect with us. FOX News Digital ended the first quarter with record engagement, more than 11.5 billion total video views. Total minutes watched clocked in at 14.2 billion, and unique visitors jumped to 115 million per month. FOX News not only draws the largest audiences nationally, but also draws a more politically diverse audience in more strategically important states than any other cable news network.  
According to Nielsen, FOX News is dominant in share of viewing in swing states and key blue states. FOX News accounts for 50% of total primetime viewership in swing states compared to MSNBC with 28% and CNN with 23%.  
This is only possible because we speak to the broadest audience of anyone in our competitive set. Our audience includes the greatest number of registered independents and likely voters of any cable news network. FOX News is relied on by 38% of registered independents. This speaks directly to the quality of our journalism and the balance of our reporting. 
People have noticed. This year, both presidential candidates and the pack supporting them have turned to FOX News to reach our large, engaged and diverse audience. In fact, 28 different political candidates or groups advertised in FOX News during the month of October. 
Additionally, we have shattered the record for political advertising at our local stations, surpassing the previous high set during the 2018 midterms. The geographical mix of our stations includes both the largest DMAs and locations that are long-standing and newly emerging swing states. This allows us to capture a significant share of local political ad spend. 
Since I spoke to you in August, we've gained increased visibility into local advertising pacing. Last quarter, our local stations were experiencing a year-over-year decrease in our base ad market of approximately 40%, compare that to this first quarter where our core stations were down approximately 20%. Including the benefit of political and station acquisitions, we are now pacing ahead over the same time last year. 
Looking at it slightly differently. At the beginning of COVID, our stations were pacing down nearly 50% compared to the prior year. Today, they are pacing ahead. This is a tremendous return to strength in a remarkably short period of time. 
All of our stations also play an important role in connecting audiences in key sports markets with football, baseball and other FOX Sports programming. We have stations in nearly all NFC markets, including our recent additions in Seattle and Milwaukee. While overall NFL viewership has been -- has seen year-to-year declines across all of its partners, Fox's AMERICA'S GAME OF THE WEEK is well on its way to a 12th consecutive season as TV's most watched show. AMERICA'S GAME OF THE WEEK is averaging over 24 million viewers, up slightly over last year. We used this, our 27th season of NFL in FOX, to accelerate awareness and use of the free-to-play FOX Bet Super 6 app. 
By week 5 of the NFL, we signed up more than 1.3 million new users, meaningfully surpassing our estimates and increasing total installed users to over 2.9 million. More than 1.2 million people played in our November 1 NFL Super 6 game. 
By promoting the FOX Bet Super 6 app across our entire portfolio, we have greatly expanded its user base. Expect more sports and nonsports games and promotions across our platforms, given the results we are seeing. One week ago, Sunday, the Super 6 app was #6 in the entire iOS app store, only behind apps like Facebook and Snapchat. And Super 6 is consistently at or near the top of the sports category in iOS and Android downloads. 
Drafting off the success of Super 6, FOX Bet, our sports betting app, is also energizing users. The app, which is currently available in Colorado, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, has been the third most downloaded sportsbook app for the past 2 consecutive weeks. That will only increase as we launch in new states. We anticipate our next launch will be in Michigan early next year.  
All of our FOX businesses are committed to our partnership with Flutter and propelling this growth of the Super 6 and FOX Bet platforms. Each week, we are driving over 100 million media impressions across our portfolio of owned and operated FOX assets.  
Another important digital expansion for the company, our ad-supported streaming platform, Tubi, is thriving. Let me start with the astronomical growth we've seen this quarter. In August, Tubi reported 33 million monthly active users, representing a 65% year-over-year jump. More importantly, since acquisition, Tubi has averaged approximately 100% increase year-over-year in total view time, the most meaningful metric when measuring the performance of any AVOD service. This is due in part to the more than 41 FOX titles currently available on Tubi, including The Masked Singer, Gordon Ramsay's 24 Hours to Hell and Back and LEGO Masters. 
When Tubi began streaming The Masked Singer, the show quickly became Tubi's #1 television series overall. We used the show to introduce viewers to Tubi. And we are also driving them to the platform through marketing across our networks, including the FOX Network and FOX News.  
Most recently, Tubi sponsored the postgame show during the Major League playoffs and the World Series on FOX. Using these internal Fox marketing opportunities will increase consumer awareness of Tubi, which will drive exploration and viewing. 
We are also using our television stations to promote and differentiate Tubi. As part of Tubi's News on Tubi launched on Roku and Amazon Fire in October, viewers now have access to live feeds from 18 FOX-owned and operated stations in top markets, including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Dallas. 
The News on Tubi offering also includes content from third-parties, including Bloomberg TV and NBC News NOW. 
News on Tubi serves several important objectives. It provides viewers with the best in local news and further leverages the assets of FOX while also expanding consumers, understanding of what Tubi offers. With News on Tubi, the platform is, for the first time, providing live viewing opportunities. And we are now monetizing this new content and our impressive viewership gains. We are including Tubi in all of our ad sales discussions. The power of the FOX and Tubi partnership is evident. Since September 1, Tubi has achieved 45 of the top 50 revenue days in its history. With a median age of 34, Tubi's audience is young, diverse and in-demand for many brands. The leading Fox entertainment programs that feed Tubi are an important synergy that we will continue to capitalize on with new and returning shows.  
All of FOX Entertainment's returning shows including the 9-1-1 franchise, Prodigal Son, The Resident and Last Man Standing are back in production with scheduled return dates in early January. As in previous years, FOX will launch a robust and strong slate of shows midseason, utilizing the end of the NFL season and NFC championship as a springboard. 
Despite pandemic-related production halts in the summer that impacted its fall lineup, FOX Entertainment had a successful premier week this television season. For premier week, which is the week of September 21, FOX was the #1 network for entertainment programming. FOX also kicked off the 2020-2021 fall television season with the #1 new series, the #1 comedy and the #1 drama. And FOX has continued that leadership position, ranking as the #1 network for the week of October 19. 
Each of our core brands is a powerhouse, distinctly positioned to differentiate itself from competitors and appeal to viewers. The power of our total portfolio, though, is even greater than the sum of its parts.  
Look at the share of voice recently achieved by the FOX Network and the FOX News channel on Thursday, October 29. Together, these networks made up 65% of TV total viewer share compared to the rest of broadcast. The reliable primetime strength of FOX News, in combination with NFL on FOX captured nearly 2/3 of all viewers watching broadcast television that evening. On several October evenings, our leadership brands accounted for at least half of all viewers watching broadcast television and that occurs when we have sports on the network and also when we air one of our entertainment hits. 
The power of our brands is not only recognized by our audiences and advertisers, it is also valued by our distribution partners. In the first quarter, we saw affiliate revenues grow by 10%, driven by healthy rate increases. While we did continue to see a decline in subscriber volume, that trend is improving. This past quarter, we saw industry subscribers decline around 6%, which is an approximately 50 basis point improvement from what we experienced last quarter. 
And our recent agreements, coupled with updates we heard during the recent earnings calls in October from AT&T, Comcast and Charter, give us an encouraging look into the December quarter. Our networks and content continue to be essential to the services offered by traditional and virtual MVPDs.  
We are sustaining our momentum and building on our strengths. With increased visibility to the market and a resumption of sports and entertainment production, we are optimistic about and excited for the remainder of the fiscal year. 
And now Steve will take us through the details of the quarter."

It's a busy day, so let's get straight to our results. The company delivered total revenues of $2.72 billion, up 2% over the comparative period in fiscal 2020, led by affiliate revenues that grew 10%, once again demonstrating the strength of our brands and our focused portfolio of channels. 
From an advertising revenue perspective, we continued to see strong growth at FOX News Media and record political revenues saw us return to growth at our FOX Television Stations. This underlying and sustained strength was offset by COVID-19-related supply-side factors that saw the postponement of live sports events and key scripted entertainment content at the FOX Network. 
Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $1.17 billion, up $310 million over the comparative period in fiscal '20 due to the top line revenue increases in revenue and the timing of programming expenses as a result of COVID-19. 
This improvement in EBITDA flowed through to the bottom line where net income attributable to stockholders of $1.11 billion or $1.83 per share was higher than the $499 million or $0.80 per share in the prior year quarter. This increase included a onetime gain recognized in Other, net associated with the reimbursement of a cash tax prepayment from Disney, following the disposition of certain 21st Century Fox assets.  
Excluding the impact of the Disney reimbursement and other noncore items, adjusted EPS of $1.18 was up 42% compared to last year's $0.83 per share, primarily reflecting revenue and EBITDA growth.  
Turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter with Cable Networks EBITDA of $781 million, it was up 14% on revenue growth of 3%. 
Cable affiliate revenues increased 4%, supported by higher average rates partially offset by a net decrease in pay television subscribers of 6%. 
Cable advertising revenues increased 18%, led by another quarter of impressive linear and digital growth at FOX News Media, partially offset by the postponement of live sporting events, namely Big Ten and Pac-12 Football at our cable, Sports Net.  
Cable other revenues decreased by $39 million due to the absence of sports sublicensing revenues, which in turn are broadly offset by a commensurate reduction in rights costs. 
EBITDA at our Cable segment increased $97 million over the prior year period. This reflects the revenue growth that I just noted as well as lower sports programming rights amortization and production costs, principally due to the postponement of live events as a result of COVID-19. Partially offsetting these lower costs at FOX Sports were increased expenses of FOX News Media due to the coverage of breaking news, including the presidential election, and continued investment in our digital news initiatives.  
The Television segment reported EBITDA of $457 million, an increase of $206 million, while revenues were essentially in line with the prior year quarter. Television affiliate revenues increased 23% in the period, reflecting double-digit increases for both our programming fees from nonowned station affiliates and direct retransmission revenues at our owned and operated stations. 
From a Television advertising perspective, our local TV stations generated record political advertising revenues in the quarter, reversing the COVID-driven trend of the June quarter to be up versus prior year. This, coupled with the addition of revenues from the fast-growing Tubi, was more than offset in the segment by COVID-related postponements of college football and key scripted entertainment program, along with comparability items, most notably 2 fewer NFL regular season broadcast windows and our broadcast of the Emmy Awards in the prior period.  
EBITDA at our Television segment increased $206 million over the prior year period on the back of lower operating expenses. The decrease in expenses was driven by lower programming rights amortization and production costs at FOX Sports, including fewer NFL broadcast windows. Additionally, there were far fewer college football games in the quarter.  
FOX Entertainment also saw lower programming rights amortization due to delayed productions of key scripted titles as a result of COVID in the current year quarter and the broadcast of the Emmy Awards in the prior year quarter.  
Turning now to free cash flow, which we calculate as net cash provided by operating activities less cash invested in property, plant and equipment. In the quarter, we generated $150 million of free cash flow, which is entirely consistent with the seasonality of working capital in our business. 
Reflecting both our confidence in the business and our balanced approach to capital allocation, so far this fiscal year, we have deployed $305 million of capital to repurchase approximately 8 million Class A shares and 3 million Class B shares. Against our buyback authorization of $2 billion, we have now cumulatively repurchased just over $900 million, representing approximately 4.5% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in November.  
From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $5.1 billion in cash and $7.9 billion in debt. 
Looking through to the second quarter, the strong advertising momentum at News, our local television stations and Tubi have all carried forward into the first month of this current quarter. We anticipate that these factors, coupled with the heavy schedule of sports events, will translate into a return to growth in overall advertising revenue in the fiscal second quarter notwithstanding what remains a midseason-focused entertainment slate with the return of our key scripted shows in the new calendar year.  
Meanwhile, from a cost perspective, we anticipate that the timing benefits seen in our first quarter content costs from sports events and entertainment slate postponements will begin to unwind in the second quarter through the remainder of the fiscal year. 
In terms of cash flow, we continue to anticipate relatively low working capital usage over the course of the full fiscal year with our normal working capital patterns for the first half deficit that largely reverses in the second half. 
As we have foreshadowed in the past, we continue to expect a higher level of capital expenditure in fiscal '21 to support the final phases of the build-out of our technical broadcast facility in Arizona and the upgrade of some of our station facilities. All of this, of course, assumes that the COVID-driven disruptions to major sports and the production delays to our key entertainment properties are behind us.  
As our first quarter results demonstrate, we have seen a meaningful recovery in our underlying business. This operating momentum, combined with the benefits of strong free cash flow and liquidity, moderate leverage and the absence of any debt maturity until early 2022, position us particularly well for the future. 
And with that, I'll now turn the call back to Joe."

So I think what that means is that we have a good idea of what our future capital needs are. We're deeply confident in our underlying business and cash generation. 
So as we look at our cash on the balance sheet, we really think about balancing how we deploy that towards acquisitions, organic investments in our business and capital returns to our shareholders. We don't have a formula in terms of how we would allocate between those categories.

Obviously, we're not going to get into the detail of our NFL negotiation. But as I've previously mentioned, the NFL -- and on earlier earnings calls as well, the NFL, along with, obviously, Major League Baseball, remains amongst our very top priorities and are really our #1 programming partner. It's been a partnership that's gone back 27 years. We look forward to continuing that partnership, and you can see it in our ratings. 
While NFL ratings have been soft this year because of a number of factors, which we believe are unique to this particular year with sports -- premium sports moving all to the fall, creating a more crowded marketplace for sports fans and also with, frankly, the new cycle where we've seen news viewing. You have to remember that the news audience and the sports audience, particularly the NFL audience, has a tremendous overlap. Cable news view, I think, is up 46% during this NFL season. 
So we think some of the softness in the ratings is unique to this season. And because of that, we're confident in the partnership -- in our partnership with the NFL going forward. 
In terms of Tubi, as you see fragmentation in the linear television market, particularly in linear entertainment, Tubi is the beneficiary of that. Tubi sits on the other side of that ledger, which is gaining audience and users from linear television market. So we think Tubi has a lot of tailwinds behind it, and we're excited to report on its milestones as we achieve them going forward."

As far as the impact on FOX News of the presidential election, of course, it's been, to date, an incredible news cycle throughout the election, but also through the other incredible news stories and massive news stories out of the year, obviously, COVID being the main one. We see as we -- and by the way, that's driven ratings. It's driven revenue, I think FOX News revenue -- advertising revenue is up 36%, which is a tremendous result. 
But as you look at our audience and you look at our ratings, you have to look at -- and this is true for the whole news ecosystem, you have to look in 2 different ways. One is the total news audience and then the appetite for news, and the second is share. The first, the appetite for news and the new cycle, the new stories that are out are sort of out of our control. And I would expect, as we enter a more normal news cycle, which has to happen eventually, that appetite for news will shift back to appetite for great American pastimes of watching football and watching baseball and watching The Masked Singer or I Can See Your Voice, and we look forward to that shift. Having said that, what we can control within the news ecosystem, what we aim to control is share. And I strongly believe, and we've seen this through, I think now 18 years, off top of my head of different administrations and different political cycles, we've maintained our #1 position through all of that. 
So I think that answers the first part of your question or I've given you some insight on how we're thinking about the first part of your question. So the news cycle will moderate. We fully expect to be #1 and maintain share through that. 
I think the second part of your question, Michael, was around new entrants and competition into the news environment. We love competition. We have always thrived with competition. And we have strong competition now. I would say the only difference today versus some years ago, as our audience has grown and our reach has grown, we see our competition as no longer only cable news providers, but also as the traditional broadcast networks. And as you know, FOX News has been the #1 network, including broadcast networks now, as I mentioned, through -- from Labor Day through to election day."

The second part of your question on Tubi, we are now, and we have now for several months, selling Tubi, and I should have actually also spoken to this with Alexia's question. We are selling Tubi in every single one of our conversations with our advertising partners. Tubi increases Fox's reach by over 20%.

And then maybe I'll just ask about Sunday Ticket and the NFL for Lachlan or whoever wants to take it. There were some press reports overnight that the AT&T is probably not going to retain that package. I'm just wondering, as you guys think about the NFL landscape, is that a package that could be interesting to Fox, maybe over a Tubi-like platform? Or are you concerned that, that may go wider than the satellite distribution model we've seen in the past, impacting potentially the local broadcast ratings. Just curious if you have a perspective on that -- on the outcome there?"

So for the quarter where across -- the good thing about it, this cycle has been -- it's not just been a local story. We've been booking significant amounts of national political revenues. So for the quarter, we did a shade under $100 million across the group, of which 70% of that was local. And then when we look at it across the first half, so July 1 through to today, without wanting to steal the thunder of the next earnings call, we'll push close to $300 million of ad revenue -- political ad revenue, for the full 6 months, of which about just north of $200 million will be local. So it's been an enormous quarter and half for us."

In prior years, political advertising has been almost entirely local. And the growth in national political advertising, particularly on FOX News, but also, importantly, in sports has been a new and I think very positive development. And it goes, obviously, also to the quality of our audience that also, by the way, has the impact. 
Usually -- I think, usually -- Jessica asked a question about the advertising market, but I suppose there were more important things to discuss. But what the political -- the robustness of the political market has really done is really drive our scatter pricing up as advertisers have scrambled to find time, scatter advertising across local stations, across sports, across news and across entertainment is up strongly. And we took the strategic decision to hold back a little bit more time than we normally would in our upfront negotiations, about roughly 5% more time we held back for scatter. And that bet is paying off handsomely. 
As we move on to Sunday Ticket, look, it's -- Sunday Ticket is a tremendous consumer offering. It doesn't work, I think, without a subscription -- under anything other than a subscription model. So it's not really something that we would consider or have the business model to monetize. But thank you for the question, Ben."

Good morning, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our first quarter results.  
Today is a big day for Fox, and not just because we get to brag about our strong financial performance, continued operating momentum and burgeoning digital assets such as FOX Bet and Tubi, but because every 4 years, we have the privilege and the responsibility of reporting on a U.S. presidential election. 
This very moment, as we speak, our viewers are starting their election day, turning on their TV sets to where they left them last night, the FOX News channel, or opening their web browsers to FoxNews.com or checking the FOX News app for the latest reporting. Throughout the day, tens of millions of Americans around the country will turn to Fox to follow our coverage of the Presidential election as well as Senate, state and local races. They do this because they trust us and our legion of hard-working and diligent news professionals.  
Hours ago, our studios across the country were lit for today's coverage and anchors, producers, camera operators, engineers, news editors, reporters and more all got ready for a long day and night ahead. 
But the real preparation for today began years ago. In fact, it is over 12 months since we launched our Democracy 2020 campaign. This intentional, careful planning has served us well. The energy and excitement are palpable in the newest rooms of our local FOX Television stations and at FOX News where Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum will be live from studio F in just a few hours. 
The news teams at the FOX Television stations and FOX News have done a superb job throughout this election season. And viewers from across the political spectrum have been turning to us in record numbers as a result.  
FOX News finished September as the first cable network to lead all broadcast networks in weekday prime with total viewers for the full quarter. In fact, FOX News has been the most watched network in all of television from Memorial Day through election day. We achieved ratings growth in total day and primetime throughout the first quarter. FOX News total day ratings were up 28% in total viewers and 31% among adults 25 to 54 years old. 
Primetime ratings increased even more substantially, up 43% in total viewers and up 54% among adults 25 to 54 years old. This demo is sought out by advertisers, making these gains particularly impactful. Already in the second quarter, the rate of growth in both total viewers and in the 25 to 54 demo has accelerated from last quarter.  
Just one recent example. Last Tuesday, October 27, Tucker Carlson Tonight on the FOX News channel had more total viewers than the seasoned premier of NBCs This Is Us that same night. 
And while our linear platform is remarkably strong, our audience is also increasingly accessing our digital products to connect with us. FOX News Digital ended the first quarter with record engagement, more than 11.5 billion total video views. Total minutes watched clocked in at 14.2 billion, and unique visitors jumped to 115 million per month. FOX News not only draws the largest audiences nationally, but also draws a more politically diverse audience in more strategically important states than any other cable news network.  
According to Nielsen, FOX News is dominant in share of viewing in swing states and key blue states. FOX News accounts for 50% of total primetime viewership in swing states compared to MSNBC with 28% and CNN with 23%.  
This is only possible because we speak to the broadest audience of anyone in our competitive set. Our audience includes the greatest number of registered independents and likely voters of any cable news network. FOX News is relied on by 38% of registered independents. This speaks directly to the quality of our journalism and the balance of our reporting. 
People have noticed. This year, both presidential candidates and the pack supporting them have turned to FOX News to reach our large, engaged and diverse audience. In fact, 28 different political candidates or groups advertised in FOX News during the month of October. 
Additionally, we have shattered the record for political advertising at our local stations, surpassing the previous high set during the 2018 midterms. The geographical mix of our stations includes both the largest DMAs and locations that are long-standing and newly emerging swing states. This allows us to capture a significant share of local political ad spend. 
Since I spoke to you in August, we've gained increased visibility into local advertising pacing. Last quarter, our local stations were experiencing a year-over-year decrease in our base ad market of approximately 40%, compare that to this first quarter where our core stations were down approximately 20%. Including the benefit of political and station acquisitions, we are now pacing ahead over the same time last year. 
Looking at it slightly differently. At the beginning of COVID, our stations were pacing down nearly 50% compared to the prior year. Today, they are pacing ahead. This is a tremendous return to strength in a remarkably short period of time. 
All of our stations also play an important role in connecting audiences in key sports markets with football, baseball and other FOX Sports programming. We have stations in nearly all NFC markets, including our recent additions in Seattle and Milwaukee. While overall NFL viewership has been -- has seen year-to-year declines across all of its partners, Fox's AMERICA'S GAME OF THE WEEK is well on its way to a 12th consecutive season as TV's most watched show. AMERICA'S GAME OF THE WEEK is averaging over 24 million viewers, up slightly over last year. We used this, our 27th season of NFL in FOX, to accelerate awareness and use of the free-to-play FOX Bet Super 6 app. 
By week 5 of the NFL, we signed up more than 1.3 million new users, meaningfully surpassing our estimates and increasing total installed users to over 2.9 million. More than 1.2 million people played in our November 1 NFL Super 6 game. 
By promoting the FOX Bet Super 6 app across our entire portfolio, we have greatly expanded its user base. Expect more sports and nonsports games and promotions across our platforms, given the results we are seeing. One week ago, Sunday, the Super 6 app was #6 in the entire iOS app store, only behind apps like Facebook and Snapchat. And Super 6 is consistently at or near the top of the sports category in iOS and Android downloads. 
Drafting off the success of Super 6, FOX Bet, our sports betting app, is also energizing users. The app, which is currently available in Colorado, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, has been the third most downloaded sportsbook app for the past 2 consecutive weeks. That will only increase as we launch in new states. We anticipate our next launch will be in Michigan early next year.  
All of our FOX businesses are committed to our partnership with Flutter and propelling this growth of the Super 6 and FOX Bet platforms. Each week, we are driving over 100 million media impressions across our portfolio of owned and operated FOX assets.  
Another important digital expansion for the company, our ad-supported streaming platform, Tubi, is thriving. Let me start with the astronomical growth we've seen this quarter. In August, Tubi reported 33 million monthly active users, representing a 65% year-over-year jump. More importantly, since acquisition, Tubi has averaged approximately 100% increase year-over-year in total view time, the most meaningful metric when measuring the performance of any AVOD service. This is due in part to the more than 41 FOX titles currently available on Tubi, including The Masked Singer, Gordon Ramsay's 24 Hours to Hell and Back and LEGO Masters. 
When Tubi began streaming The Masked Singer, the show quickly became Tubi's #1 television series overall. We used the show to introduce viewers to Tubi. And we are also driving them to the platform through marketing across our networks, including the FOX Network and FOX News.  
Most recently, Tubi sponsored the postgame show during the Major League playoffs and the World Series on FOX. Using these internal Fox marketing opportunities will increase consumer awareness of Tubi, which will drive exploration and viewing. 
We are also using our television stations to promote and differentiate Tubi. As part of Tubi's News on Tubi launched on Roku and Amazon Fire in October, viewers now have access to live feeds from 18 FOX-owned and operated stations in top markets, including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Dallas. 
The News on Tubi offering also includes content from third-parties, including Bloomberg TV and NBC News NOW. 
News on Tubi serves several important objectives. It provides viewers with the best in local news and further leverages the assets of FOX while also expanding consumers, understanding of what Tubi offers. With News on Tubi, the platform is, for the first time, providing live viewing opportunities. And we are now monetizing this new content and our impressive viewership gains. We are including Tubi in all of our ad sales discussions. The power of the FOX and Tubi partnership is evident. Since September 1, Tubi has achieved 45 of the top 50 revenue days in its history. With a median age of 34, Tubi's audience is young, diverse and in-demand for many brands. The leading Fox entertainment programs that feed Tubi are an important synergy that we will continue to capitalize on with new and returning shows.  
All of FOX Entertainment's returning shows including the 9-1-1 franchise, Prodigal Son, The Resident and Last Man Standing are back in production with scheduled return dates in early January. As in previous years, FOX will launch a robust and strong slate of shows midseason, utilizing the end of the NFL season and NFC championship as a springboard. 
Despite pandemic-related production halts in the summer that impacted its fall lineup, FOX Entertainment had a successful premier week this television season. For premier week, which is the week of September 21, FOX was the #1 network for entertainment programming. FOX also kicked off the 2020-2021 fall television season with the #1 new series, the #1 comedy and the #1 drama. And FOX has continued that leadership position, ranking as the #1 network for the week of October 19. 
Each of our core brands is a powerhouse, distinctly positioned to differentiate itself from competitors and appeal to viewers. The power of our total portfolio, though, is even greater than the sum of its parts.  
Look at the share of voice recently achieved by the FOX Network and the FOX News channel on Thursday, October 29. Together, these networks made up 65% of TV total viewer share compared to the rest of broadcast. The reliable primetime strength of FOX News, in combination with NFL on FOX captured nearly 2/3 of all viewers watching broadcast television that evening. On several October evenings, our leadership brands accounted for at least half of all viewers watching broadcast television and that occurs when we have sports on the network and also when we air one of our entertainment hits. 
The power of our brands is not only recognized by our audiences and advertisers, it is also valued by our distribution partners. In the first quarter, we saw affiliate revenues grow by 10%, driven by healthy rate increases. While we did continue to see a decline in subscriber volume, that trend is improving. This past quarter, we saw industry subscribers decline around 6%, which is an approximately 50 basis point improvement from what we experienced last quarter. 
And our recent agreements, coupled with updates we heard during the recent earnings calls in October from AT&T, Comcast and Charter, give us an encouraging look into the December quarter. Our networks and content continue to be essential to the services offered by traditional and virtual MVPDs.  
We are sustaining our momentum and building on our strengths. With increased visibility to the market and a resumption of sports and entertainment production, we are optimistic about and excited for the remainder of the fiscal year. 
And now Steve will take us through the details of the quarter."

It's a busy day, so let's get straight to our results. The company delivered total revenues of $2.72 billion, up 2% over the comparative period in fiscal 2020, led by affiliate revenues that grew 10%, once again demonstrating the strength of our brands and our focused portfolio of channels. 
From an advertising revenue perspective, we continued to see strong growth at FOX News Media and record political revenues saw us return to growth at our FOX Television Stations. This underlying and sustained strength was offset by COVID-19-related supply-side factors that saw the postponement of live sports events and key scripted entertainment content at the FOX Network. 
Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $1.17 billion, up $310 million over the comparative period in fiscal '20 due to the top line revenue increases in revenue and the timing of programming expenses as a result of COVID-19. 
This improvement in EBITDA flowed through to the bottom line where net income attributable to stockholders of $1.11 billion or $1.83 per share was higher than the $499 million or $0.80 per share in the prior year quarter. This increase included a onetime gain recognized in Other, net associated with the reimbursement of a cash tax prepayment from Disney, following the disposition of certain 21st Century Fox assets.  
Excluding the impact of the Disney reimbursement and other noncore items, adjusted EPS of $1.18 was up 42% compared to last year's $0.83 per share, primarily reflecting revenue and EBITDA growth.  
Turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter with Cable Networks EBITDA of $781 million, it was up 14% on revenue growth of 3%. 
Cable affiliate revenues increased 4%, supported by higher average rates partially offset by a net decrease in pay television subscribers of 6%. 
Cable advertising revenues increased 18%, led by another quarter of impressive linear and digital growth at FOX News Media, partially offset by the postponement of live sporting events, namely Big Ten and Pac-12 Football at our cable, Sports Net.  
Cable other revenues decreased by $39 million due to the absence of sports sublicensing revenues, which in turn are broadly offset by a commensurate reduction in rights costs. 
EBITDA at our Cable segment increased $97 million over the prior year period. This reflects the revenue growth that I just noted as well as lower sports programming rights amortization and production costs, principally due to the postponement of live events as a result of COVID-19. Partially offsetting these lower costs at FOX Sports were increased expenses of FOX News Media due to the coverage of breaking news, including the presidential election, and continued investment in our digital news initiatives.  
The Television segment reported EBITDA of $457 million, an increase of $206 million, while revenues were essentially in line with the prior year quarter. Television affiliate revenues increased 23% in the period, reflecting double-digit increases for both our programming fees from nonowned station affiliates and direct retransmission revenues at our owned and operated stations. 
From a Television advertising perspective, our local TV stations generated record political advertising revenues in the quarter, reversing the COVID-driven trend of the June quarter to be up versus prior year. This, coupled with the addition of revenues from the fast-growing Tubi, was more than offset in the segment by COVID-related postponements of college football and key scripted entertainment program, along with comparability items, most notably 2 fewer NFL regular season broadcast windows and our broadcast of the Emmy Awards in the prior period.  
EBITDA at our Television segment increased $206 million over the prior year period on the back of lower operating expenses. The decrease in expenses was driven by lower programming rights amortization and production costs at FOX Sports, including fewer NFL broadcast windows. Additionally, there were far fewer college football games in the quarter.  
FOX Entertainment also saw lower programming rights amortization due to delayed productions of key scripted titles as a result of COVID in the current year quarter and the broadcast of the Emmy Awards in the prior year quarter.  
Turning now to free cash flow, which we calculate as net cash provided by operating activities less cash invested in property, plant and equipment. In the quarter, we generated $150 million of free cash flow, which is entirely consistent with the seasonality of working capital in our business. 
Reflecting both our confidence in the business and our balanced approach to capital allocation, so far this fiscal year, we have deployed $305 million of capital to repurchase approximately 8 million Class A shares and 3 million Class B shares. Against our buyback authorization of $2 billion, we have now cumulatively repurchased just over $900 million, representing approximately 4.5% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in November.  
From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $5.1 billion in cash and $7.9 billion in debt. 
Looking through to the second quarter, the strong advertising momentum at News, our local television stations and Tubi have all carried forward into the first month of this current quarter. We anticipate that these factors, coupled with the heavy schedule of sports events, will translate into a return to growth in overall advertising revenue in the fiscal second quarter notwithstanding what remains a midseason-focused entertainment slate with the return of our key scripted shows in the new calendar year.  
Meanwhile, from a cost perspective, we anticipate that the timing benefits seen in our first quarter content costs from sports events and entertainment slate postponements will begin to unwind in the second quarter through the remainder of the fiscal year. 
In terms of cash flow, we continue to anticipate relatively low working capital usage over the course of the full fiscal year with our normal working capital patterns for the first half deficit that largely reverses in the second half. 
As we have foreshadowed in the past, we continue to expect a higher level of capital expenditure in fiscal '21 to support the final phases of the build-out of our technical broadcast facility in Arizona and the upgrade of some of our station facilities. All of this, of course, assumes that the COVID-driven disruptions to major sports and the production delays to our key entertainment properties are behind us.  
As our first quarter results demonstrate, we have seen a meaningful recovery in our underlying business. This operating momentum, combined with the benefits of strong free cash flow and liquidity, moderate leverage and the absence of any debt maturity until early 2022, position us particularly well for the future. 
And with that, I'll now turn the call back to Joe."

It's been a partnership that's gone back 27 years. We look forward to continuing that partnership, and you can see it in our ratings. 
While NFL ratings have been soft this year because of a number of factors, which we believe are unique to this particular year with sports -- premium sports moving all to the fall, creating a more crowded marketplace for sports fans and also with, frankly, the new cycle where we've seen news viewing. You have to remember that the news audience and the sports audience, particularly the NFL audience, has a tremendous overlap. Cable news view, I think, is up 46% during this NFL season. 
So we think some of the softness in the ratings is unique to this season. And because of that, we're confident in the partnership -- in our partnership with the NFL going forward. 
In terms of Tubi, as you see fragmentation in the linear television market, particularly in linear entertainment, Tubi is the beneficiary of that. Tubi sits on the other side of that ledger, which is gaining audience and users from linear television market. So we think Tubi has a lot of tailwinds behind it, and we're excited to report on its milestones as we achieve them going forward."

Can you share what expense growth would have looked like, excluding the programming disruptions that we've experienced? I think your operating expense looks like it's down about 14% in the quarter, and Steve, you referenced sort of an unwind of that going forward. So I'm curious how much of that does unwind and whether  these disruptions impacted how you think strategically about that mix of investment in scripted programming versus sports and news? 
And then one other just real quick, if I could. I'm curious if you can share any thoughts on how the outcome of today's presidential election may impact FOX News going forward. Do you think ratings can vary based on an outcome? And also President has, in the past, referenced perhaps starting a news network and how you would think about that competitively?"

But if I just look at expenses and really just trying to isolate for things that have been scheduled out of Q1 into Q2, Q3, Q4, I'd say that we benefited from about $270 million, $280 million of the expenses in Q1 that will shift into the back half of the -- or the back 3 quarters of the year. You'll have a reasonable concentration of that in Q2 because it's when you'll have a heavy concentration of both NFL and college football, and then we'll see the entertainment hit largely Q3 into Q4."

As far as the impact on FOX News of the presidential election, of course, it's been, to date, an incredible news cycle throughout the election, but also through the other incredible news stories and massive news",413,"And then to your second question, Michael. As far as the impact on FOX News of the presidential election, of course, it's been, to date, an incredible news cycle throughout the election, but also through the other incredible news stories and massive news stories out of the year, obviously, COVID being the main one. We see as we -- and by the way, that's driven ratings. It's driven revenue, I think FOX News revenue -- advertising revenue is up 36%, which is a tremendous result. 
But as you look at our audience and you look at our ratings, you have to look at -- and this is true for the whole news ecosystem, you have to look in 2 different ways. One is the total news audience and then the appetite for news, and the second is share. The first, the appetite for news and the new cycle, the new stories that are out are sort of out of our control. And I would expect, as we enter a more normal news cycle, which has to happen eventually, that appetite for news will shift back to appetite for great American pastimes of watching football and watching baseball and watching The Masked Singer or I Can See Your Voice, and we look forward to that shift. Having said that, what we can control within the news ecosystem, what we aim to control is share. And I strongly believe, and we've seen this through, I think now 18 years, off top of my head of different administrations and different political cycles, we've maintained our #1 position through all of that. 
So I think that answers the first part of your question or I've given you some insight on how we're thinking about the first part of your question. So the news cycle will moderate. We fully expect to be #1 and maintain share through that. 
I think the second part of your question, Michael, was around new entrants and competition into the news environment. We love competition. We have always thrived with competition. And we have strong competition now. I would say the only difference today versus some years ago, as our audience has grown and our reach has grown, we see our competition as no longer only cable news providers, but also as the traditional broadcast networks. And as you know, FOX News has been the #1 network, including broadcast networks now, as I mentioned, through -- from Labor Day through to election day."

However, Jessica, as you'll remember, the structure of our partnership with Flutter is that they control the FOX Bet business today and they fund the FOX Bet business today as Fox Corporation is not a licensed entity. Having said that, we work with them incredibly closely in terms of the promotion of FOX Bet in order to grow the value within that joint venture. 
The second part of your question on Tubi, we are now, and we have now for several months, selling Tubi, and I should have actually also spoken to this with Alexia's question. We are selling Tubi in every single one of our conversations with our advertising partners. Tubi increases Fox's reach by over 20%. And it's a young and diverse audience, which is unduplicated -- or largely unduplicated part of the Fox audience. And so the -- every time I talk to Farhad, which is very regularly, there's a new daily revenue record that he hits, and -- which is tremendous to see. And look, to be honest, we're only at the beginning. 
So when we think of both the key metrics of time spent viewing, total users, and as importantly or maybe most importantly, revenue, Tubi consistently and continually is exceeding every expectation in our acquisition case."

And the growth in national political advertising, particularly on FOX News, but also, importantly, in sports has been a new and I think very positive development. And it goes, obviously, also to the quality of our audience that also, by the way, has the impact. 
Usually -- I think, usually -- Jessica asked a question about the advertising market, but I suppose there were more important things to discuss. But what the political -- the robustness of the political market has really done is really drive our scatter pricing up as advertisers have scrambled to find time, scatter advertising across local stations, across sports, across news and across entertainment is up strongly. And we took the strategic decision to hold back a little bit more time than we normally would in our upfront negotiations, about roughly 5% more time we held back for scatter. And that bet is paying off handsomely. 
As we move on to Sunday Ticket, look, it's -- Sunday Ticket is a tremendous consumer offering. It doesn't work, I think, without a subscription -- under anything other than a subscription model. So it's not really something that we would consider or have the business model to monetize. But thank you for the question, Ben."

Good morning, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our first quarter results.  
Today is a big day for Fox, and not just because we get to brag about our strong financial performance, continued operating momentum and burgeoning digital assets such as FOX Bet and Tubi, but because every 4 years, we have the privilege and the responsibility of reporting on a U.S. presidential election. 
This very moment, as we speak, our viewers are starting their election day, turning on their TV sets to where they left them last night, the FOX News channel, or opening their web browsers to FoxNews.com or checking the FOX News app for the latest reporting. Throughout the day, tens of millions of Americans around the country will turn to Fox to follow our coverage of the Presidential election as well as Senate, state and local races. They do this because they trust us and our legion of hard-working and diligent news professionals.  
Hours ago, our studios across the country were lit for today's coverage and anchors, producers, camera operators, engineers, news editors, reporters and more all got ready for a long day and night ahead. 
But the real preparation for today began years ago. In fact, it is over 12 months since we launched our Democracy 2020 campaign. This intentional, careful planning has served us well. The energy and excitement are palpable in the newest rooms of our local FOX Television stations and at FOX News where Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum will be live from studio F in just a few hours. 
The news teams at the FOX Television stations and FOX News have done a superb job throughout this election season. And viewers from across the political spectrum have been turning to us in record numbers as a result.  
FOX News finished September as the first cable network to lead all broadcast networks in weekday prime with total viewers for the full quarter. In fact, FOX News has been the most watched network in all of television from Memorial Day through election day. We achieved ratings growth in total day and primetime throughout the first quarter. FOX News total day ratings were up 28% in total viewers and 31% among adults 25 to 54 years old. 
Primetime ratings increased even more substantially, up 43% in total viewers and up 54% among adults 25 to 54 years old. This demo is sought out by advertisers, making these gains particularly impactful. Already in the second quarter, the rate of growth in both total viewers and in the 25 to 54 demo has accelerated from last quarter.  
Just one recent example. Last Tuesday, October 27, Tucker Carlson Tonight on the FOX News channel had more total viewers than the seasoned premier of NBCs This Is Us that same night. 
And while our linear platform is remarkably strong, our audience is also increasingly accessing our digital products to connect with us. FOX News Digital ended the first quarter with record engagement, more than 11.5 billion total video views. Total minutes watched clocked in at 14.2 billion and unique visitors jumped to 115 million per month. FOX News not only draws the largest audiences nationally, but also draws a more politically diverse audience in more strategically important states than any other cable news network.  
According to Nielsen, FOX News is dominant in share of viewing in swing states and key blue states. FOX News accounts for 50% of total primetime viewership in swing states compared to MSNBC with 28% and CNN with 23%.  
This is only possible because we speak to the broadest audience of anyone in our competitive set. Our audience includes the greatest number of registered independents and likely voters of any cable news network. FOX News is relied on by 38% of registered independents. This speaks directly to the quality of our journalism and the balance of our reporting. 
People have noticed. This year, both presidential candidates and the pack supporting them have turned to FOX News to reach our large, engaged and diverse audience. In fact, 28 different political candidates or groups advertised in FOX News during the month of October. 
Additionally, we have shattered the record for political advertising at our local stations, surpassing the previous high set during the 2018 midterms. The geographical mix of our stations includes both the largest DMAs and locations that are long-standing and newly emerging swing states. This allows us to capture a significant share of local political ad spend. 
Since I spoke to you in August, we've gained increased visibility into local advertising pacing. Last quarter, our local stations were experiencing a year-over-year decrease in our base ad market of approximately 40%, compare that to this first quarter where our core stations were down approximately 20%. Including the benefit of political and station acquisitions, we are now pacing ahead over the same time last year. 
Looking at it slightly differently. At the beginning of COVID, our stations were pacing down nearly 50% compared to the prior year. Today, they are pacing ahead. This is a tremendous return to strength in a remarkably short period of time. 
All of our stations also play an important role in connecting audiences in key sports markets with football, baseball and other FOX Sports programming. We have stations in nearly all NFC markets, including our recent additions in Seattle and Milwaukee. While overall NFL viewership has been -- has seen year-to-year declines across all of its partners, Fox's AMERICA'S GAME OF THE WEEK is well on its way to a 12th consecutive season as TV's most watched show. AMERICA'S GAME OF THE WEEK is averaging over 24 million viewers, up slightly over last year. We used this, our 27th season of NFL in FOX, to accelerate awareness and use of the free-to-play FOX Bet Super 6 app. 
By week 5 of the NFL, we signed up more than 1.3 million new users, meaningfully surpassing our estimates and increasing total installed users to over 2.9 million. More than 1.2 million people played in our November 1 NFL Super 6 game. 
By promoting the FOX Bet Super 6 app across our entire portfolio, we have greatly expanded its user base. Expect more sports and nonsports games and promotions across our platforms, given the results we are seeing. One week ago, Sunday, the Super 6 app was #6 in the entire iOS app store, only behind apps like Facebook and Snapchat. And Super 6 is consistently at or near the top of the sports category in iOS and Android downloads. 
Drafting off the success of Super 6, FOX Bet, our sports betting app, is also energizing users. The app, which is currently available in Colorado, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, has been the third most downloaded sportsbook app for the past 2 consecutive weeks. That will only increase as we launch in new states. We anticipate our next launch will be in Michigan early next year.  
All of our FOX businesses are committed to our partnership with Flutter and propelling this growth of the Super 6 and FOX Bet platforms. Each week, we are driving over 100 million media impressions across our portfolio of owned and operated FOX assets.  
Another important digital expansion for the company, our ad-supported streaming platform, Tubi, is thriving. Let me start with the astronomical growth we've seen this quarter. In August, Tubi reported 33 million monthly active users, representing a 65% year-over-year jump. More importantly, since acquisition, Tubi has averaged approximately 100% increase year-over-year in total view time, the most meaningful metric when measuring the performance of any AVOD service. This is due in part to the more than 41 FOX titles currently available on Tubi, including The Masked Singer, Gordon Ramsay's 24 Hours to Hell and Back and LEGO Masters. 
When Tubi began streaming The Masked Singer, the show quickly became Tubi's #1 television series overall. We used the show to introduce viewers to Tubi. And we are also driving them to the platform through marketing across our networks, including the FOX Network and FOX News.  
Most recently, Tubi sponsored the postgame show during the Major League playoffs and the World Series on FOX. Using these internal Fox marketing opportunities will increase consumer awareness of Tubi, which will drive exploration and viewing. 
We are also using our television stations to promote and differentiate Tubi. As part of Tubi's News on Tubi launched on Roku and Amazon Fire in October, viewers now have access to live feeds from 18 FOX-owned and operated stations in top markets, including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Dallas. 
The News on Tubi offering also includes content from third-parties, including Bloomberg TV and NBC News NOW. 
News on Tubi serves several important objectives. It provides viewers with the best in local news and further leverages the assets of FOX while also expanding consumers, understanding of what Tubi offers. With News on Tubi, the platform is, for the first time, providing live viewing opportunities. And we are now monetizing this new content and our impressive viewership gains. We are including Tubi in all of our ad sales discussions. The power of the FOX and Tubi partnership is evident. Since September 1, Tubi has achieved 45 of the top 50 revenue days in its history. With a median age of 34, Tubi's audience is young, diverse and in-demand for many brands. The leading Fox entertainment programs that feed Tubi are an important synergy that we will continue to capitalize on with new and returning shows.  
All of FOX Entertainment's returning shows including the 9-1-1 franchise, Prodigal Son, The Resident and Last Man Standing are back in production with scheduled return dates in early January. As in previous years, FOX will launch a robust and strong slate of shows midseason, utilizing the end of the NFL season and NFC championship as a springboard. 
Despite pandemic-related production halts in the summer that impacted its fall lineup, FOX Entertainment had a successful premier week this television season. For premier week, which is the week of September 21, FOX was the #1 network for entertainment programming. FOX also kicked off the 2020-2021 fall television season with the #1 new series, the #1 comedy and the #1 drama. And FOX has continued that leadership position, ranking as the #1 network for the week of October 19. 
Each of our core brands is a powerhouse, distinctly positioned to differentiate itself from competitors and appeal to viewers. The power of our total portfolio, though, is even greater than the sum of its parts.  
Look at the share of voice recently achieved by the FOX Network and the FOX News channel on Thursday, October 29. Together, these networks made up 65% of TV total viewer share compared to the rest of broadcast. The reliable primetime strength of FOX News, in combination with NFL on FOX captured nearly 2/3 of all viewers watching broadcast television that evening. On several October evenings, our leadership brands accounted for at least half of all viewers watching broadcast television and that occurs when we have sports on the network and also when we air one of our entertainment hits. 
The power of our brands is not only recognized by our audiences and advertisers, it is also valued by our distribution partners. In the first quarter, we saw affiliate revenues grow by 10%, driven by healthy rate increases. While we did continue to see a decline in subscriber volume, that trend is improving. This past quarter, we saw industry subscribers decline around 6%, which is an approximately 50 basis point improvement from what we experienced last quarter. 
And our recent agreements, coupled with updates we heard during the recent earnings calls in October from AT&T, Comcast and Charter, give us an encouraging look into the December quarter. Our networks and content continue to be essential to the services offered by traditional and virtual MVPDs.  
We are sustaining our momentum and building on our strengths. With increased visibility to the market and a resumption of sports and entertainment production, we are optimistic about and excited for the remainder of the fiscal year. 
And now Steve will take us through the details of the quarter."

It's a busy day, so let's get straight to our results. The company delivered total revenues of $2.72 billion, up 2% over the comparative period in fiscal 2020, led by affiliate revenues that grew 10%, once again demonstrating the strength of our brands and our focused portfolio of channels. 
From an advertising revenue perspective, we continued to see strong growth at FOX News Media and record political revenues saw us return to growth at our FOX Television Stations. This underlying and sustained strength was offset by COVID-19-related supply-side factors that saw the postponement of live sports events and key scripted entertainment content at the FOX Network. 
Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $1.17 billion, up $310 million over the comparative period in fiscal '20 due to the top line revenue increases in revenue and the timing of programming expenses as a result of COVID-19. 
This improvement in EBITDA flowed through to the bottom line where net income attributable to stockholders of $1.11 billion or $1.83 per share was higher than the $499 million or $0.80 per share in the prior year quarter. This increase included a onetime gain recognized in Other, net associated with the reimbursement of a cash tax prepayment from Disney, following the disposition of certain 21st Century Fox assets.  
Excluding the impact of the Disney reimbursement and other noncore items, adjusted EPS of $1.18 was up 42% compared to last year's $0.83 per share, primarily reflecting revenue and EBITDA growth.  
Turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter with Cable Networks EBITDA of $781 million, it was up 14% on revenue growth of 3%. 
Cable affiliate revenues increased 4%, supported by higher average rates partially offset by a net decrease in pay television subscribers of 6%. 
Cable advertising revenues increased 18%, led by another quarter of impressive linear and digital growth at FOX News Media, partially offset by the postponement of live sporting events, namely Big Ten and Pac-12 Football at our cable, Sports Net.  
Cable other revenues decreased by $39 million due to the absence of sports sublicensing revenues, which in turn are broadly offset by a commensurate reduction in rights costs. 
EBITDA at our Cable segment increased $97 million over the prior year period. This reflects the revenue growth that I just noted as well as lower sports programming rights amortization and production costs, principally due to the postponement of live events as a result of COVID-19. Partially offsetting these lower costs at FOX Sports were increased expenses of FOX News Media due to the coverage of breaking news, including the presidential election and continued investment in our digital news initiatives.  
The Television segment reported EBITDA of $457 million, an increase of $206 million, while revenues were essentially in line with the prior year quarter. Television affiliate revenues increased 23% in the period, reflecting double-digit increases for both our programming fees from nonowned station affiliates and direct retransmission revenues at our owned and operated stations. 
From a Television advertising perspective, our local TV stations generated record political advertising revenues in the quarter, reversing the COVID-driven trend of the June quarter to be up versus prior year. This, coupled with the addition of revenues from the fast-growing Tubi, was more than offset in the segment by COVID-related postponements of college football and key scripted entertainment program, along with comparability items, most notably 2 fewer NFL regular season broadcast windows and our broadcast of the Emmy Awards in the prior period.  
EBITDA at our Television segment increased $206 million over the prior year period on the back of lower operating expenses. The decrease in expenses was driven by lower programming rights amortization and production costs at FOX Sports, including fewer NFL broadcast windows. Additionally, there were far fewer college football games in the quarter.  
FOX Entertainment also saw lower programming rights amortization due to delayed productions of key scripted titles as a result of COVID in the current year quarter and the broadcast of the Emmy Awards in the prior year quarter.  
Turning now to free cash flow, which we calculate as net cash provided by operating activities less cash invested in property, plant and equipment. In the quarter, we generated $150 million of free cash flow, which is entirely consistent with the seasonality of working capital in our business. 
Reflecting both our confidence in the business and our balanced approach to capital allocation, so far this fiscal year, we have deployed $305 million of capital to repurchase approximately 8 million Class A shares and 3 million Class B shares. Against our buyback authorization of $2 billion, we have now cumulatively repurchased just over $900 million, representing approximately 4.5% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in November.  
From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $5.1 billion in cash and $7.9 billion in debt. 
Looking through to the second quarter, the strong advertising momentum at News, our local television stations and Tubi have all carried forward into the first month of this current quarter. We anticipate that these factors, coupled with the heavy schedule of sports events, will translate into a return to growth in overall advertising revenue in the fiscal second quarter notwithstanding what remains a midseason-focused entertainment slate with the return of our key scripted shows in the new calendar year.  
Meanwhile, from a cost perspective, we anticipate that the timing benefits seen in our first quarter content costs from sports events and entertainment slate postponements will begin to unwind in the second quarter through the remainder of the fiscal year. 
In terms of cash flow, we continue to anticipate relatively low working capital usage over the course of the full fiscal year with our normal working capital patterns for the first half deficit that largely reverses in the second half. 
As we have foreshadowed in the past, we continue to expect a higher level of capital expenditure in fiscal '21 to support the final phases of the build-out of our technical broadcast facility in Arizona and the upgrade of some of our station facilities. All of this, of course, assumes that the COVID-driven disruptions to major sports and the production delays to our key entertainment properties are behind us.  
As our first quarter results demonstrate, we have seen a meaningful recovery in our underlying business. This operating momentum, combined with the benefits of strong free cash flow and liquidity, moderate leverage and the absence of any debt maturity until early 2022, position us particularly well for the future. 
And with that, I'll now turn the call back to Joe."

So I think what that means is that we have a good idea of what our future capital needs are. We're deeply confident in our underlying business and cash generation. 
So as we look at our cash on the balance sheet, we really think about balancing how we deploy that towards acquisitions, organic investments in our business and capital returns to our shareholders. We don't have a formula in terms of how we would allocate between those categories.

But as I've previously mentioned, the NFL -- and on earlier earnings calls as well, the NFL, along with, obviously, Major League Baseball, remains amongst our very top priorities and are really our #1 programming partner. It's been a partnership that's gone back 27 years. We look forward to continuing that partnership and you can see it in our ratings. 
While NFL ratings have been soft this year because of a number of factors, which we believe are unique to this particular year with sports -- premium sports moving all to the fall, creating a more crowded marketplace for sports fans and also with, frankly, the new cycle where we've seen news viewing. You have to remember that the news audience and the sports audience, particularly the NFL audience, has a tremendous overlap. Cable news view, I think, is up 46% during this NFL season. 
So we think some of the softness in the ratings is unique to this season. And because of that, we're confident in the partnership -- in our partnership with the NFL going forward. 
In terms of Tubi, as you see fragmentation in the linear television market, particularly in linear entertainment, Tubi is the beneficiary of that. Tubi sits on the other side of that ledger, which is gaining audience and users from linear television market. So we think Tubi has a lot of tailwinds behind it, and we're excited to report on its milestones as we achieve them going forward."

As far as the impact on FOX News of the presidential election, of course, it's been, to date, an incredible news cycle throughout the election, but also through the other incredible news stories and massive news stories out of the year, obviously, COVID being the main one. We see as we -- and by the way, that's driven ratings. It's driven revenue, I think FOX News revenue -- advertising revenue is up 36%, which is a tremendous result. 
But as you look at our audience and you look at our ratings, you have to look at -- and this is true for the whole news ecosystem, you have to look in 2 different ways. One is the total news audience and then the appetite for news and the second is share. The first, the appetite for news and the new cycle, the new stories that are out are sort of out of our control. And I would expect, as we enter a more normal news cycle, which has to happen eventually, that appetite for news will shift back to appetite for great American pastimes of watching football and watching baseball and watching The Masked Singer or I Can See Your Voice and we look forward to that shift. Having said that, what we can control within the news ecosystem, what we aim to control is share. And I strongly believe, and we've seen this through, I think now 18 years, off top of my head of different administrations and different political cycles, we've maintained our #1 position through all of that. 
So I think that answers the first part of your question or I've given you some insight on how we're thinking about the first part of your question. So the news cycle will moderate. We fully expect to be #1 and maintain share through that. 
I think the second part of your question, Michael, was around new entrants and competition into the news environment. We love competition. We have always thrived with competition. And we have strong competition now. I would say the only difference today versus some years ago, as our audience has grown and our reach has grown, we see our competition as no longer only cable news providers, but also as the traditional broadcast networks. And as you know, FOX News has been the #1 network, including broadcast networks now, as I mentioned, through -- from Labor Day through to election day."

The second part of your question on Tubi, we are now, and we have now for several months, selling Tubi, and I should have actually also spoken to this with Alexia's question. We are selling Tubi in every single one of our conversations with our advertising partners. Tubi increases Fox's reach by over 20%. And it's a young and diverse audience, which is unduplicated -- or largely unduplicated part of the Fox audience. And so the -- every time I talk to Farhad, which is very regularly, there's a new daily revenue record that he hits, and -- which is tremendous to see.

In prior years, political advertising has been almost entirely local. And the growth in national political advertising, particularly on FOX News, but also, importantly, in sports has been a new and I think very positive development. And it goes, obviously, also to the quality of our audience that also, by the way, has the impact. 
Usually -- I think, usually -- Jessica asked a question about the advertising market, but I suppose there were more important things to discuss. But what the political -- the robustness of the political market has really done is really drive our scatter pricing up as advertisers have scrambled to find time, scatter advertising across local stations, across sports, across news and across entertainment is up strongly. And we took the strategic decision to hold back a little bit more time than we normally would in our upfront negotiations, about roughly 5% more time we held back for scatter. And that bet is paying off handsomely. 
As we move on to Sunday Ticket, look, it's -- Sunday Ticket is a tremendous consumer offering. It doesn't work, I think, without a subscription -- under anything other than a subscription model. So it's not really something that we would consider or have the business model to monetize. But thank you for the question, Ben."
