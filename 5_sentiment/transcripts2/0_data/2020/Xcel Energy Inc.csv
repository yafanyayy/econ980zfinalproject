Let me share a few. We delivered EPS of $2.64 in 2019, which is the 15th consecutive year of meeting or exceeding our earnings guidance. We raised our annual dividend by $0.10 per share, which is the 16th straight year we've increased our dividend. Our stock hit an all-time high of $66.05 in September, and subsequently, hit an all-time new high of $67.69 this week. We achieved a total shareholder return of just over 32%. Our O&M declined almost 1%, even while making incremental investments in our system. The Minnesota Commission approved our purchase of the Longroad wind assets. And finally, we resolved multiple rate cases. 
We also had a strong year operationally. We continued to achieve important milestones in our nation-leading wind expansion program with the completion of our Foxtail, Lake Benton and Hale projects. These 3 projects represent over 700 megawatts and were completed under budget. In addition, we have almost 2,000 megawatts of wind projects under construction, which are expected to be completed in 2020. We're very excited to continue our clean energy transition, which will result in significant customer savings and carbon reductions. 
Our nuclear team continues to make great strides in transforming performance while reducing cost. The fleet achieved a capacity factor of 92.6% in 2019, even with 2 refueling outages. We have one of the top-performing nuclear fleets in the country as rated by the NRC and Info. And in addition to strong performance, we have continued to lower our cost structure, with O&M cost declining a little over 2% in 2019, and this is the fourth straight year of declining O&M in our nuclear operations. I'm extremely proud of the effort and results of our nuclear employees and our leadership in our industry. 
Moving to the wire side of our business. Our advanced grid efforts have progressed well and will enable increased reliability and security, faster storm restoration, better efficiency and new offerings for our customers. In 2019, we implemented foundational software and completed our initial meter deployment in Colorado, as planned, with full-scale implementation to follow. In November, we requested approval to expand our advanced grid program to benefit our Minnesota customers, and we expect a commission decision later this year. 
Beyond our strong financial and operational performance, I'm also very proud of our ESG leadership. In [ 2009 ], we estimate we reduced carbon emissions by more than 40% from 2005 levels, and we remain on track to achieve an 80% carbon reduction by 2030. In recognition of our carbon-free vision, S&P Global gave us their Award of Excellence, and we continue to proactively mitigate the impacts of our clean energy transition on our employees and our communities. We've provided assistance to impacted employees, offering retraining and relocation opportunities, and we're levering natural attrition. As a result, we've managed our transition with no layoffs from coal plant retirements. 
We've also partnered with our communities impacted by the closing of coal plants to build new generation at existing sites, and we've worked hard to attract new businesses to those communities as well. In Minnesota, there is continued progress to build a Google data center and relocate a metal recycling plant next to our closing Sherco coal plant. In Colorado, we've worked to develop a solar solution to retain a steel mill, which is our largest customer and a major employer in [indiscernible], where we are closing 2 coal units. Now these collaborative economic development efforts will help sustain local economies in terms of both jobs and tax base. 
And our results have been recognized by others. We were named as one of Fortune Magazine's Most Admired Companies for the seventh consecutive year, one of Corporate Responsibility Magazine's 100 Best Corporate Citizens and among Newsweek's Most Responsible Companies. We earned another perfect score on the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index, and remain among the best places to work for LGBTQ equality. In addition, various publications continue to recognize our strong leadership as a veteran employer. All of this adds up to an outstanding ESG record, which is becoming increasingly important to investors. 
So I'm really pleased with our accomplishments. And looking forward, I'm excited about the opportunities we have in 2020 and beyond. We will continue executing on our multistate wind investment program, which will provide clean, affordable energy to our customers. Longer term, we'll add more universal solar, storage and firm capacity to our system as part of our plan to reduce carbon emissions by 80% by 2030. We'll deliver on our planned transmission projects while collaborating with others to solve congestion issues over the next decade. This work is critical to maintaining reliability as more renewables are added to the system, and it also creates significant investment opportunities well into the future. Implementation of our advanced grid program will also keep the grid reliable, secure and efficient and allow for the integration of more renewables while enabling new offerings for our customers. We will continue working with our customers, policymakers and other stakeholders to build nation-leading EV programs, which will improve the customer experience and reduce emissions across the transportation sector. 
So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob, who'll provide more detail on our financial results and outlook as well as a regulatory update. Bob?"
527542,650012296,1896479,"Xcel Energy Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2020",2020-01-30,"Earnings Calls","Xcel Energy Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. My comments today will focus on full year 2019 results. For details on our fourth quarter results, please see our earnings release. We achieved another year of strong operational and financial results. We deliver",1261,"Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. My comments today will focus on full year 2019 results. For details on our fourth quarter results, please see our earnings release. 
We achieved another year of strong operational and financial results. We delivered 2019 ongoing earnings of $2.64 per share, which is a 6.9% increase compared with $2.47 per share in 2018. This result represents the top end of our original guidance range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share. Similar to last year, weather was a positive factor, contributing almost $0.07 per share compared to normal. However, we also incurred additional O&M expense, including approximately $0.03 per share due to storms, partially offsetting the weather benefit. 
The most significant earnings drivers for the year include higher electric and natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.37 per share, including rate increases in riders to recover capital investments. Lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.02 per share, and our lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.15 per share. However, the majority of the lower ETR is due to an increase in production tax credits which flow back to customers through electric margin and tax reform impacts, both of which are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation and interest expense, reflecting our capital investment program, which reduced earnings by $0.29 per share. And lower AFUDC due to project timing, decreased earnings by $0.08 per share. 
Turning to sales. Our weather-adjusted electric sales declined by 0.3% in 2019. We saw positive residential sales across almost all of our jurisdictions with continued customer growth, partially offset by lower use per customer. And in the C&I space, we experienced discrete declines in certain large customer usage due to cogeneration and lower frac sand mining sales, which caused sales to be unfavorable. Weather-adjusted natural gas sales increased 2.7% in 2019 as a result of strong customer growth and higher use per customer, partially offset by the declines in the frac sand mining demand in Wisconsin. For 2020, we anticipate electric and natural gas sales growth of approximately 1%, which includes the impact of leap year. 
Turning to expenses. O&M costs were almost 1% lower than last year, driven by continued efficiency gains in our transmission and in our fossil and nuclear generation fleets, partially offset by unexpected storm costs and incremental spending on strategic areas to enhance the customer experience and further reduce risk in our operations. We remain committed to improving operating efficiencies and taking cost out of the business for the benefit of our customers, as we have for the past 5 years. And as a result, our consolidated base O&M forecast is essentially flat. However, we do expect incremental O&M from adding new wind generation in 2020 and 2021, which is largely rider recoverable as well as continuing to invest in strategic areas of cybersecurity, wildfire mitigation and enhancing the customer experience. As a result, we expect total O&M expense will increase approximately 1% to 2% in 2020. 
Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. In December, the Minnesota Commission approved our rate case stay out proposal, including the extension of the sales, capital and property tax true-up mechanisms, along with the deferral of increases in nuclear decommissioning costs. We view this as a constructive outcome as it will allow us to concentrate on other strategic Minnesota activities, including our integrated resource plan, our advanced grid initiative and electric vehicle expansion efforts. In January, the Minnesota Commission approved our affiliate filing for the Mankato natural gas plant and the assumption of the existing PPAs. We closed on the acquisition earlier this month, and believe the Mankato asset will bring substantial value and reliability to the upper Midwest system and to our customers, especially as we retire additional coal plants. As we discussed in the past, we anticipate this asset will generate utility-like returns over its life. However, we expect the nonregulated returns will be slightly lower in the near term and more robust towards the back end of the forecast. We continue to progress -- we continue the progress on our PPA acquisition strategy, and we are working with stakeholders to improve the process to ensure better regulatory alignment. We do not expect to propose future asset acquisitions into the unregulated company. 
Moving to Colorado. The commission held deliberations in our electric rate case in December and verbally approved an ROE of 9.3%, a current test year ended August 2019 and an equity ratio of 55.6%, along with other decisions. We view the support for strong capital structure and progress in improving the more current test year as positives, particularly for the credit support that they provide. But we're disappointed in a low ROE, which does not reflect our outstanding operational performance and leadership on the clean energy transition. We are waiting on a written commission order, which we need to calculate the final revenue impacts, however, we expect to seek reconsideration on certain issues. We expect new rates will be effective in February 2020. 
We also have electric rate cases in New Mexico and Texas. In New Mexico, we recently reached a constructive settlement that reflects a rate increase of approximately $31 million, an ROE of 9.45%, an equity ratio of 54.8% and an acceleration in depreciation in the coal plant to reflect an early retirement. Hearings are scheduled in February with a commission decision to follow. In Texas, we're seeking an increase of $136 million based on a historic test year, an equity ratio of 54.7% and an ROE of 10.35%. The request largely reflects investment for the Hale wind project as well as other capital to support strong regional growth. Intervener testimony will be filed in February, and as in the past, we'll work to see if we can reach a settlement with the various parties. We anticipate a commission decision in the second quarter of 2020. 
We're planning to file several cases next year. In February, we will file a natural gas rate case in Colorado with new rates expected to be effective in November. We'll also consider filing a Colorado electric case in [ the summer ]. We intend to file a Minnesota electric case in November. And finally, we'll likely file rate cases in both Texas and New Mexico to recover the cost for the Sagamore wind project in the first quarter of 2021. 
With a strong year behind us, we are reaffirming our 2020 earnings guidance range of $2.73 to $2.83 per share, which is consistent with the long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%. 
With that, I'll wrap up. In summary, 2019 was another great year for Xcel Energy. We delivered earnings within or above our guidance range for the 15th consecutive year. We increased our dividend for the 16th straight year. We issued $750 million of equity, representing the majority of our equity needs over the next 5 years. Our stock hit an all-time high in September and more recently in January. We achieved a total shareholder return of just over 32%, eclipsing that TSR of the S&P 500 for yet another year. The Minnesota Commission approved our acquisition of the Longroad assets into rate base, and we put in service 3 wind projects, largely on time and under budget. We resolved multiple rate cases, and we continued to demonstrate leadership in environmental, social and governance arenas. We remain well positioned to deliver on our 2020 earnings guidance range and our long-term earnings and dividend growth objectives of 5% to 7%. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take questions."

But as we just talked about, that 60% extension, I think, is going to be helpful. Without that 60% PTC extension, Travis, I would have told you that perhaps we'll see some bump up in wind, and we still might. And which is why I'm really pleased we locked down the 100%. I think that's a no-regret strategy in every sense of the word. But I think the technology is still going to compete head on with fossil alternatives, even in a low natural gas environment. Of course, the key that I think is important to that is that we will put more renewables on the big grid that we're all connected to than anybody else, but we're going to need more than just renewables and battery storage. Renewables will be our biggest source of energy by the mid-'20s. But as you see in our IRP in Minnesota, and we'll address this in Colorado next year, we're also going to need to back up that wind with natural gas. And then ultimately, we're going to need to start developing technologies, carbon-free dispatchable technologies that will allow us to achieve our goal of a 0% carbon system by 2050. So maybe that's a little bit long-winded, but I thought I'd throw that out there for you, Travis. That's the plan. I will also add Travis, our industry is really, really stepping up to the challenge of carbon reduction. I mean we're proud to have been the first to establish the goal. But if you go down the line and add up what utilities are doing, it is really significant, and I'm quite proud of this industry."

It's a challenging question because we're going to need natural gas to achieve that 80% carbon reduction that I mentioned. And early action is pretty darn important in addressing the risk of climate change. So we're going to get pushed back on natural gas. But I think the key is to make sure that people understand, you shouldn't make perfection be the enemy of a great plan. And we're moving away from coal completely here in the upper Midwest. That's the plan. We're going to need gas to back it up. We had a -- this time last year, we were on a polar vortex. Reliability is critical. So I think we've got a really pragmatic plan. Our challenge as an industry, Andy, is going to be making sure that people see that 2050 is a long way away. We're going to need different types of innovation. We'll put as much renewables and battery storage on the grid, but experts tell us that the big grid that we're all connected to does get saturated, depending on where you are in the country, between 50% and 70%. That's amazing. That's the big grid. But that's where we're -- but after that, we're going to need things to back it up and ultimately, new technologies. So as part of the leadership of EI, that's a message I want to get out there. Now as far as the LDC goes and as far as using natural gas, I think our industry needs to be more demanding of upstream methane emissions. I think that's really important, and we can do something about that. We need to double down on energy efficiency on the gas side. And then ultimately, I think we need to look at potentially using renewable gas or hydrogen made out of carbon-free energy and other things and start blending that in the resource mix. I will also tell you that here in the upper Midwest, heat pumps and things like that are pretty tough to make work, at least with today's technology. So -- and we've got of keep customers warm. So it's a challenging issue, but I think with the right messaging and demonstrating we've got a great plan, I think we can persevere."

I think -- I mean, I think that working with the commission here, I thought that was a great example of partnership and moving from must run to economic dispatch, I think that was a positive first step. The commission is very interested in in understanding how a pause in coal dispatch could work as we start to ready for the day when we don't have any coal in the upper Midwest. So I think it's the Midwestern way to kind of be pragmatic about how we approach this going forward. And to your point, Paul, I think there are opportunities across our system to look at how we dispatch our coal plants, particularly when you look at the variable cost of things like steel for fuel and renewable energy. So we are definitely looking at that down in the SPS region. We've got some water issues that we need to address, and that could be solved with some seasonal dispatch, so -- again, with economics in mind. So yes, this look for us to look for more opportunities like we're doing here in the upper Midwest."

Let me share a few. We delivered EPS of $2.64 in 2019, which is the 15th consecutive year of meeting or exceeding our earnings guidance. We raised our annual dividend by $0.10 per share, which is the 16th straight year we've increased our dividend. Our stock hit an all-time high of $66.05 in September, and subsequently, hit an all-time new high of $67.69 this week. We achieved a total shareholder return of just over 32%. Our O&M declined almost 1%, even while making incremental investments in our system. The Minnesota Commission approved our purchase of the Longroad wind assets. And finally, we resolved multiple rate cases.
We also had a strong year operationally. We continued to achieve important milestones in our nation-leading wind expansion program with the completion of our Foxtail, Lake Benton and Hale projects. These 3 projects represent over 700 megawatts and were completed under budget. In addition, we have almost 2,000 megawatts of wind projects under construction, which are expected to be completed in 2020. We're very excited to continue our clean energy transition, which will result in significant customer savings and carbon reductions. 
Our nuclear team continues to make great strides in transforming performance, while reducing cost. The fleet achieved a capacity factor of 92.6% in 2019, even with 2 refueling outages. We have one of the top-performing nuclear fleets in the country as rated by the NRC and INPO. And in addition to strong performance, we have continued to lower our cost structure, with O&M cost declining a little over 2% in 2019, and this is the fourth straight year of declining O&M in our nuclear operations. I'm extremely proud of the effort and results of our nuclear employees and our leadership in our industry.
Moving to the wire side of our business. Our advanced grid efforts have progressed well and will enable increased reliability and security, faster storm restoration, better efficiency and new offerings for our customers. In 2019, we implemented foundational software and completed our initial meter deployment in Colorado, as planned, with full-scale implementation to follow. In November, we requested approval to expand our advanced grid program to benefit our Minnesota customers, and we expect a commission decision later this year.
Beyond our strong financial and operational performance, I'm also very proud of our ESG leadership. In 2009, we estimate we reduced carbon emissions by more than 40% from 2005 levels, and we remain on track to achieve an 80% carbon reduction by 2030. In recognition of our carbon-free vision, S&P Global gave us their Award of Excellence, and we continue to proactively mitigate the impacts of our clean energy transition on our employees and our communities. We've provided assistance to impacted employees, offering retraining and relocation opportunities, and we're levering natural attrition. As a result, we've managed our transition with no layoffs from coal plant retirements.
We've also partnered with our communities impacted by the closing of coal plants to build new generation at existing sites, and we've worked hard to attract new businesses to those communities as well. In Minnesota, there is continued progress to build a Google data center and relocate a metal recycling plant next to our closing Sherco coal plant. In Colorado, we've worked to develop a solar solution to retain a steel mill, which is our largest customer and a major employer in Pueblo, where we are closing 2 coal units. Now these collaborative economic development efforts will help sustain local economies in terms of both jobs and tax base.
And our results have been recognized by others. We were named as one of Fortune Magazine's Most Admired Companies for the seventh consecutive year, one of Corporate Responsibility Magazine's 100 Best Corporate Citizens and among Newsweek's Most Responsible Companies. We earned another perfect score on the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index, and we remain among the best places to work for LGBTQ equality. In addition, various publications continue to recognize our strong leadership as a veteran employer. All of this adds up to an outstanding ESG record, which is becoming increasingly important to investors.
So I'm really pleased with our accomplishments. And looking forward, I'm excited about the opportunities we have in 2020 and beyond. We will continue executing on our multistate wind investment program, which will provide clean, affordable energy to our customers. Longer term, we'll add more universal solar, storage and firm capacity to our system as part of our plan to reduce carbon emissions by 80% by 2030. We'll deliver on our planned transmission projects while collaborating with others to solve congestion issues over the next decade. This work is critical to maintaining reliability as more renewables are added to the system, and it also creates significant investment opportunities well into the future. Implementation of our advanced grid program will also keep the grid reliable, secure and efficient and allow for the integration of more renewables while enabling new offerings for our customers. We will continue working with our customers, policymakers and other stakeholders to build nation-leading EV programs, which will improve the customer experience and reduce emissions across the transportation sector.
So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob, who'll provide more detail on our financial results and outlook as well as a regulatory update. Bob?"

My comments today will focus on full year 2019 results.

We delivere",1259,"Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. My comments today will focus on full year 2019 results. For details on our fourth quarter results, please see our earnings release.
We achieved another year of strong operational and financial results. We delivered 2019 ongoing earnings of $2.64 per share, which is a 6.9% increase compared with $2.47 per share in 2018. This result represents the top end of our original guidance range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share. Similar to last year, weather was a positive factor, contributing almost $0.07 per share compared to normal. However, we also incurred additional O&M expense, including approximately $0.03 per share due to storms, partially offsetting the weather benefit.
The most significant earnings drivers for the year include higher electric and natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.37 per share, including rate increases in riders to recover capital investments. Lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.02 per share, and our lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.15 per share. However, the majority of the lower ETR is due to an increase in production tax credits which flow back to customers through electric margin and tax reform impacts, both of which are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation and interest expense, reflecting our capital investment program, which reduced earnings by $0.29 per share. And lower AFUDC due to project timing, decreased earnings by $0.08 per share.
Turning to sales. Our weather-adjusted electric sales declined by 0.3% in 2019. We saw positive residential sales across almost all of our jurisdictions with continued customer growth, partially offset by lower use per customer. And in the C&I space, we experienced discrete declines in certain large customer usage due to cogeneration and lower frac sand mining sales, which caused sales to be unfavorable. Weather-adjusted natural gas sales increased 2.7% in 2019 as a result of strong customer growth and higher use per customer, partially offset by the declines in the frac sand mining demand in Wisconsin. For 2020, we anticipate electric and natural gas sales growth of approximately 1%, which includes the impact of leap year.
Turning to expenses. O&M costs were almost 1% lower than last year, driven by continued efficiency gains in our transmission and in our fossil and nuclear generation fleets, partially offset by unexpected storm costs and incremental spending on strategic areas to enhance the customer experience and further reduce risk in our operations. We remain committed to improving operating efficiencies and taking cost out of the business for the benefit of our customers, as we have for the past 5 years. And as a result, our consolidated base O&M forecast is essentially flat. However, we do expect incremental O&M from adding new wind generation in 2020 and 2021, which is largely rider recoverable as well as continuing to invest in strategic areas of cybersecurity, wildfire mitigation and enhancing the customer experience. As a result, we expect total O&M expense will increase approximately 1% to 2% in 2020.
Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. In December, the Minnesota Commission approved our rate case stay out proposal, including the extension of the sales, capital and property tax true-up mechanisms, along with the deferral of increases in nuclear decommissioning costs. We view this as a constructive outcome as it will allow us to concentrate on other strategic Minnesota activities, including our integrated resource plan, our advanced grid initiative and electric vehicle expansion efforts. In January, the Minnesota Commission approved our affiliate filing for the Mankato natural gas plant and the assumption of the existing PPAs. We closed on the acquisition earlier this month, and believe the Mankato asset will bring substantial value and reliability to the Upper Midwest system and to our customers, especially as we retire additional coal plants. As we discussed in the past, we anticipate this asset will generate utility-like returns over its life. However, we expect the non-regulatory returns will be slightly lower in the near term and more robust towards the back end of the forecast. We continue to progress -- we continue the progress on our PPA acquisition strategy, and we are working with stakeholders to improve the process to ensure better regulatory alignment. We do not expect to propose future asset acquisitions into the unregulated company.
Moving to Colorado. The commission held deliberations in our electric rate case in December and verbally approved an ROE of 9.3%, a current test year ended August 2019 and an equity ratio of 55.6%, along with other decisions. We view the support for strong capital structure and progress in improving the more current test year as positives, particularly for the credit support that they provide. But we're disappointed in a low ROE, which does not reflect our outstanding operational performance and leadership on the clean energy transition. We are waiting on a written commission order, which we need to calculate the final revenue impacts, however, we expect to seek reconsideration on certain issues. We expect new rates will be effective in February, 2020.
We also have electric rate cases in New Mexico and Texas. In New Mexico, we recently reached a constructive settlement that reflects a rate increase of approximately $31 million, an ROE of 9.45%, an equity ratio of 54.8% and an acceleration in depreciation in the top coal plant to reflect an early retirement. Hearings are scheduled in February with a commission decision to follow. In Texas, we're seeking an increase of $136 million based on a historic test year, an equity ratio of 54.7% and an ROE of 10.35%. The request largely reflects investment for the Hale wind project as well as other capital to support strong regional growth. Intervener testimony will be filed in February, and as in the past, we'll work to see if we can reach a settlement with the various parties. We anticipate a commission decision in the second quarter of 2020. 
We're planning to file several cases next year. In February, we will file a natural gas rate case in Colorado with new rates expected to be effective in November. We'll also consider filing a Colorado electric case in December. We intend to file a Minnesota electric case in November. And finally, we'll likely file rate cases in both Texas and New Mexico to recover the cost for the Sagamore wind project in the first quarter of 2021.
With a strong year behind us, we are reaffirming our 2020 earnings guidance range of $2.73 to $2.83 per share, which is consistent with the long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%.
With that, I'll wrap up. In summary, 2019 was another great year for Xcel Energy. We delivered earnings within or above our guidance range for the 15th consecutive year. We increased our dividend for the 16th straight year. We issued $750 million of equity, representing the majority of our equity needs over the next 5 years. Our stock hit an all-time high in September and more recently, in January. We achieved a total shareholder return of just over 32%, eclipsing that TSR of the S&P 500 for yet another year. The Minnesota Commission approved our acquisition of the Longroad assets into rate base, and we put in service, 3 wind projects, largely on time and under budget. We resolved multiple rate cases, and we continue to demonstrate leadership in environmental, social and governance arenas. We remain well positioned to deliver on our 2020 earnings guidance range and our long-term earnings and dividend growth objectives of 5% to 7%. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take questions."

But as we just talked about, that 60% extension, I think, is going to be helpful. Without that 60% PTC extension, Travis, I would have told you that perhaps we'll see some bump up in wind, and we still might. And which is why I'm really pleased we locked down the 100%. I think that's a no-regret strategy in every sense of the word. But I think the technology is still going to compete head on with fossil alternatives, even in a low natural gas environment. Of course, the key that I think is important to that is that we will put more renewables on the big grid that we're all connected to than anybody else, but we're going to need more than just renewables and battery storage. Renewables will be our biggest source of energy by the mid-'20s. But as you see in our IRP in Minnesota, and we'll address this in Colorado next year, we're also going to need to back up that wind with natural gas. And then ultimately, we're going to need to start developing technologies, carbon-free dispatchable technologies that will allow us to achieve our goal of a 0% carbon system by 2050. So maybe that's a little bit long-winded, but I thought I'd throw that out there for you, Travis. That's the plan. I will also add Travis, our industry is really, really stepping up to the challenge of carbon reduction. I mean we're proud to have been the first to establish the goal. But if you go down the line and add up what utilities are doing, it is really significant, and I'm quite proud of this industry."

It's a challenging question because we're going to need natural gas to achieve that 80% carbon reduction that I mentioned. And early action is pretty darn important in addressing the risk of climate change. So we're going to get pushed back on natural gas. But I think the key is to make sure that people understand, you shouldn't make perfection be the enemy of a great plan. And we're moving away from coal completely here in the Upper Midwest. That's the plan. We're going to need gas to back it up. We had a -- this time last year, we were on a polar vortex. Reliability is critical. So I think we've got a really pragmatic plan. Our challenge as an industry, Andy, is going to be making sure that people see that 2050 is a long way away. We're going to need different types of innovation. We'll put as much renewables and battery storage on the grid, but experts tell us that the big grid that we're all connected to does get saturated, depending on where you are in the country, between 50% and 70%. That's amazing. That's the big grid. But that's where we're -- but after that, we're going to need things to back it up and ultimately, new technologies. So as part of the leadership of EEI, that's a message I want to get out there. Now as far as the LDC goes and as far as using natural gas, I think our industry needs to be more demanding of upstream methane emissions. I think that's really important, and we can do something about that. We need to double down on energy efficiency on the gas side. And then ultimately, I think we need to look at potentially using renewable gas or hydrogen made out of carbon-free energy and other things and start blending that in the resource mix. I will also tell you that here in the Upper Midwest, heat pumps and things like that are pretty tough to make work, at least with today's technology. So -- and we've got of keep customers warm. So it's a challenging issue, but I think with the right messaging and demonstrating we've got a great plan, I think we can persevere."

So I think it's the Midwestern way to kind of be pragmatic about how we approach this going forward. And to your point, Paul, I think there are opportunities across our system to look at how we dispatch our coal plants. Particularly, when you look at the variable cost of things like steel for fuel and renewable energy. So we are definitely looking at that down in the SPS region. We've got some water issues that we need to address, and that could be solved with some seasonal dispatch, so -- again, with economics in mind. So yes, just look for us to look for more opportunities like we're doing here in the Upper Midwest."

Let me share a few. We delivered EPS of $2.64 in 2019, which is the 15th consecutive year of meeting or exceeding our earnings guidance. We raised our annual dividend by $0.10 per share, which is the 16th straight year we've increased our dividend. Our stock hit an all-time high of $66.05 in September, and subsequently, hit an all-time new high of $67.69 this week. We achieved a total shareholder return of just over 32%. Our O&M declined almost 1%, even while making incremental investments in our system. The Minnesota Commission approved our purchase of the Longroad wind assets. And finally, we resolved multiple rate cases.
We also had a strong year operationally. We continued to achieve important milestones in our nation-leading wind expansion program with the completion of our Foxtail, Lake Benton and Hale projects. These 3 projects represent over 700 megawatts and were completed under budget. In addition, we have almost 2,000 megawatts of wind projects under construction, which are expected to be completed in 2020. We're very excited to continue our clean energy transition, which will result in significant customer savings and carbon reductions. 
Our nuclear team continues to make great strides in transforming performance while reducing cost. The fleet achieved a capacity factor of 92.6% in 2019, even with 2 refueling outages. We have one of the top-performing nuclear fleets in the country as rated by the NRC and INPO. And in addition to strong performance, we have continued to lower our cost structure, with O&M cost declining a little over 2% in 2019, and this is the fourth straight year of declining O&M in our nuclear operations. I'm extremely proud of the effort and results of our nuclear employees and our leadership in our industry.
Moving to the wire side of our business. Our advanced grid efforts have progressed well and will enable increased reliability and security, faster storm restoration, better efficiency and new offerings for our customers. In 2019, we implemented foundational software and completed our initial meter deployment in Colorado, as planned, with full-scale implementation to follow. In November, we requested approval to expand our advanced grid program to benefit our Minnesota customers, and we expect a commission decision later this year.
Beyond our strong financial and operational performance, I'm also very proud of our ESG leadership. In 2009, we estimate we reduced carbon emissions by more than 40% from 2005 levels, and we remain on track to achieve an 80% carbon reduction by 2030. In recognition of our carbon-free vision, S&P Global gave us their Award of Excellence, and we continue to proactively mitigate the impacts of our clean energy transition on our employees and our communities. We've provided assistance to impacted employees, offering retraining and relocation opportunities, and we're levering natural attrition. As a result, we've managed our transition with no layoffs from coal plant retirements.
We've also partnered with our communities impacted by the closing of coal plants to build new generation at existing sites, and we worked hard to attract new businesses to those communities as well. In Minnesota, there is continued progress to build a Google data center and relocate a metal recycling plant next to our closing Sherco coal plant. In Colorado, we've worked to develop a solar solution to retain a steel mill, which is our largest customer and a major employer in Pueblo, where we are closing 2 coal units. Now these collaborative economic development efforts will help sustain local economies in terms of both jobs and tax base.
And our results have been recognized by others. We were named as one of Fortune Magazine's Most Admired Companies for the seventh consecutive year, one of Corporate Responsibility Magazine's 100 Best Corporate Citizens and among Newsweek's Most Responsible Companies. We earned another perfect score on the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index, and we remain among the best places to work for LGBTQ equality. In addition, various publications continue to recognize our strong leadership as a veteran employer. All of this adds up to an outstanding ESG record, which is becoming increasingly important to investors.
So I'm really pleased with our accomplishments. And looking forward, I'm excited about the opportunities we have in 2020 and beyond. We will continue executing on our multistate wind investment program, which will provide clean, affordable energy to our customers. Longer term, we'll add more universal solar, storage and firm capacity to our system as part of our plan to reduce carbon emissions by 80% by 2030. We'll deliver on our planned transmission projects while collaborating with others to solve congestion issues over the next decade. This work is critical to maintaining reliability as more renewables are added to the system, and it also creates significant investment opportunities well into the future. 
Implementation of our advanced grid program will also keep the grid reliable, secure and efficient and allow for the integration of more renewables while enabling new offerings for our customers. We will continue working with our customers, policymakers and other stakeholders to build nation-leading EV programs, which will improve the customer experience and reduce emissions across the transportation sector.
So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob, who'll provide more detail on our financial results and outlook as well as a regulatory update. Bob?"

My comments today will focus on full year 2019 results. For details on our fourth quarter results, please see our earnings release.We achieved another year of strong operational and financial results. We delivere",1259,"Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. My comments today will focus on full year 2019 results. For details on our fourth quarter results, please see our earnings release.
We achieved another year of strong operational and financial results. We delivered 2019 ongoing earnings of $2.64 per share, which is a 6.9% increase compared with $2.47 per share in 2018. This result represents the top end of our original guidance range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share. Similar to last year, weather was a positive factor, contributing almost $0.07 per share compared to normal. However, we also incurred additional O&M expense, including approximately $0.03 per share due to storms, partially offsetting the weather benefit.
The most significant earnings drivers for the year include higher electric and natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.37 per share, including rate increases in riders to recover capital investments. Lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.02 per share, and our lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.15 per share. However, the majority of the lower ETR is due to an increase in production tax credits which flow back to customers through electric margin and tax reform impacts, both of which are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation and interest expense, reflecting our capital investment program, which reduced earnings by $0.29 per share. And lower AFUDC due to project timing decreased earnings by $0.08 per share.
Turning to sales. Our weather-adjusted electric sales declined by 0.3% in 2019. We saw positive residential sales across almost all of our jurisdictions with continued customer growth, partially offset by lower use per customer. And in the C&I space, we experienced discrete declines in certain large customer usage due to cogeneration and lower frac sand mining sales, which caused sales to be unfavorable. Weather-adjusted natural gas sales increased 2.7% in 2019 as a result of strong customer growth and higher use per customer, partially offset by the declines in the frac sand mining demand in Wisconsin. For 2020, we anticipate electric and natural gas sales growth of approximately 1%, which includes the impact of leap year.
Turning to expenses. O&M costs were almost 1% lower than last year, driven by continued efficiency gains in our transmission and in our fossil and nuclear generation fleets, partially offset by unexpected storm costs and incremental spending on strategic areas to enhance the customer experience and further reduce risk in our operations. We remain committed to improving operating efficiencies and taking cost out of the business for the benefit of our customers, as we have for the past 5 years. And as a result, our consolidated base O&M forecast is essentially flat. However, we do expect incremental O&M from adding new wind generation in 2020 and 2021, which is largely rider recoverable as well as continuing to invest in strategic areas of cybersecurity, wildfire mitigation and enhancing the customer experience. As a result, we expect total O&M expense will increase approximately 1% to 2% in 2020.
Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. In December, the Minnesota Commission approved our rate case stay out proposal, including the extension of the sales, capital and property tax true-up mechanisms, along with the deferral of increases in nuclear decommissioning costs. We view this as a constructive outcome as it will allow us to concentrate on other strategic Minnesota activities, including our integrated resource plan, our advanced grid initiative and electric vehicle expansion efforts. 
In January, the Minnesota Commission approved our affiliate filing for the Mankato natural gas plant and the assumption of the existing PPAs. We closed on the acquisition earlier this month, and believe the Mankato asset will bring substantial value and reliability to the Upper Midwest system and to our customers, especially as we retire additional coal plants. As we discussed in the past, we anticipate this asset will generate utility-like returns over its life. However, we expect the non-regulatory returns will be slightly lower in the near term and more robust towards the back end of the forecast. 
We continue to progress -- we continue the progress on our PPA acquisition strategy, and we are working with stakeholders to improve the process to ensure better regulatory alignment. We do not expect to propose future asset acquisitions into the unregulated company.
Moving to Colorado. The commission held deliberations in our electric rate case in December and verbally approved an ROE of 9.3%, a current test year ended August 2019 and an equity ratio of 55.6%, along with other decisions. We view the support for strong capital structure and progress in improving the more current test year as positives, particularly for the credit support that they provide. But we're disappointed in a low ROE, which does not reflect our outstanding operational performance and leadership on the clean energy transition. We are waiting on a written commission order, which we need to calculate the final revenue impacts, however, we expect to seek reconsideration on certain issues. We expect new rates will be effective in February, 2020.
We also have electric rate cases in New Mexico and Texas. In New Mexico, we recently reached a constructive settlement that reflects a rate increase of approximately $31 million, an ROE of 9.45%, an equity ratio of 54.8% and an acceleration in depreciation in the top coal plant to reflect an early retirement. Hearings are scheduled in February with a commission decision to follow. 
In Texas, we're seeking an increase of $136 million based on a historic test year, an equity ratio of 54.7% and an ROE of 10.35%. The request largely reflects investment for the Hale wind project as well as other capital to support strong regional growth. Intervener testimony will be filed in February, and as in the past, we'll work to see if we can reach a settlement with the various parties. We anticipate a commission decision in the second quarter of 2020. 
We're planning to file several cases next year. In February, we will file a natural gas rate case in Colorado with new rates expected to be effective in November. We'll also consider filing a Colorado electric case in December. We intend to file a Minnesota electric case in November. And finally, we'll likely file rate cases in both Texas and New Mexico to recover the cost for the Sagamore wind project in the first quarter of 2021.
With a strong year behind us, we are reaffirming our 2020 earnings guidance range of $2.73 to $2.83 per share, which is consistent with the long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%.
With that, I'll wrap up. In summary, 2019 was another great year for Xcel Energy. We delivered earnings within or above our guidance range for the 15th consecutive year. We increased our dividend for the 16th straight year. We issued $750 million of equity, representing the majority of our equity needs over the next 5 years. Our stock hit an all-time high in September and more recently, in January. We achieved a total shareholder return of just over 32%, eclipsing that TSR of the S&P 500 for yet another year. The Minnesota Commission approved our acquisition of the Longroad assets into rate base, and we put in service 3 wind projects, largely on time and under budget. We resolved multiple rate cases, and we continue to demonstrate leadership in environmental, social and governance arenas. We remain well positioned to deliver on our 2020 earnings guidance range and our long-term earnings and dividend growth objectives of 5% to 7%. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take questions."

And that includes substantial cost curve bending as we absorb increases in salaries and bargaining unit increases and increases from suppliers, looking for upticks in our contracts and things like that.

And we recognize the fact that as we close and shut coal plants on a voluntary basis to achieve that 80% carbon reduction that our investors have some opportunities to be rewarded as well. So we'll see where it goes. We're going to move forward. We're filing our IRP plan and that's, as you know, that's -- so we've filed it, rather, and that will be discussed throughout the year.

But as we just talked about, that 60% extension, I think, is going to be helpful. Without that 60% PTC extension, Travis, I would have told you that perhaps we'll see some bump up in wind, and we still might. And which is why I'm really pleased we locked down the 100%. I think that's a no-regret strategy in every sense of the word. But I think the technology is still going to compete head on with fossil alternatives, even in a low natural gas environment. 
Of course, the key that I think is important to that is that we will put more renewables on the big grid that we're all connected to than anybody else, but we're going to need more than just renewables and battery storage. Renewables will be our biggest source of energy by the mid-'20s. But as you see in our IRP in Minnesota, and we'll address this in Colorado next year, we're also going to need to back up that wind with natural gas. And then ultimately, we're going to need to start developing technologies, carbon-free dispatchable technologies that will allow us to achieve our goal of a 0% carbon system by 2050. So maybe that's a little bit long-winded, but I thought I'd throw that out there for you, Travis. That's the plan. 
I will also add Travis, our industry is really, really stepping up to the challenge of carbon reduction. I mean we're proud to have been the first to establish the goal. But if you go down the line and add up what utilities are doing, it is really significant, and I'm quite proud of this industry."

It's a challenging question because we're going to need natural gas to achieve that 80% carbon reduction that I mentioned, and early action is pretty darn important in addressing the risk of climate c",385,"Yes. Well, Andy, I think that is a very good question. It's a challenging question because we're going to need natural gas to achieve that 80% carbon reduction that I mentioned, and early action is pretty darn important in addressing the risk of climate change. So we're going to get pushed back on natural gas. But I think the key is to make sure that people understand, you shouldn't make perfection be the enemy of a great plan. And we're moving away from coal completely here in the Upper Midwest. That's the plan. We're going to need gas to back it up. We had a -- this time last year, we were on a polar vortex. Reliability is critical. So I think we've got a really pragmatic plan. 
Our challenge as an industry, Andy, is going to be making sure that people see that 2050 is a long way away. We're going to need different types of innovation. We'll put as much renewables and battery storage on the grid. But experts tell us that the big grid that we're all connected to does get saturated, depending on where you are in the country, between 50% and 70%. That's amazing. That's the big grid. But that's where we're -- but after that, we're going to need things to back it up and ultimately, new technologies. So as part of the leadership of EEI, that's a message I want to get out there. 
Now as far as the LDC goes and as far as using natural gas, I think our industry needs to be more demanding of upstream methane emissions. I think that's really important, and we can do something about that. We need to double down on energy efficiency on the gas side. And then ultimately, I think we need to look at potentially using renewable gas or hydrogen made out of carbon-free energy and other things and start blending that in the resource mix. 
I will also tell you that here in the Upper Midwest, heat pumps and things like that are pretty tough to make work, at least with today's technology. So -- and we've got to keep customers warm. So it's a challenging issue. But I think with the right messaging and demonstrating we've got a great plan, I think we can persevere."

So I think it's the Midwestern way to kind of be pragmatic about how we approach this going forward. 
And to your point, Paul, I think there are opportunities across our system to look at how we dispatch our coal plants, particularly when you look at the variable cost of things like steel for fuel and renewable energy. So we are definitely looking at that down in the SPS region. We've got some water issues that we need to address, and that could be solved with some seasonal dispatch, so -- again, with economics in mind. So yes, just look for us to look for more opportunities like we're doing here in the Upper Midwest."

Let me share a few. We delivered EPS of $2.64 in 2019, which is the 15th consecutive year of meeting or exceeding our earnings guidance. We raised our annual dividend by $0.10 per share, which is the 16th straight year we've increased our dividend. Our stock hit an all-time high of $66.05 in September, and subsequently, hit an all-time new high of $67.69 this week. We achieved a total shareholder return of just over 32%. Our O&M declined almost 1%, even while making incremental investments in our system. The Minnesota Commission approved our purchase of the Longroad wind assets. And finally, we resolved multiple rate cases.
We also had a strong year operationally. We continued to achieve important milestones in our nation-leading wind expansion program with the completion of our Foxtail, Lake Benton and Hale projects. These 3 projects represent over 700 megawatts and were completed under budget. In addition, we have almost 2,000 megawatts of wind projects under construction, which are expected to be completed in 2020. We're very excited to continue our clean energy transition, which will result in significant customer savings and carbon reductions. 
Our nuclear team continues to make great strides in transforming performance while reducing cost. The fleet achieved a capacity factor of 92.6% in 2019, even with 2 refueling outages. We have one of the top-performing nuclear fleets in the country as rated by the NRC and INPO. And in addition to strong performance, we have continued to lower our cost structure, with O&M cost declining a little over 2% in 2019, and this is the fourth straight year of declining O&M in our nuclear operations. I'm extremely proud of the effort and results of our nuclear employees and our leadership in our industry.
Moving to the wire side of our business. Our advanced grid efforts have progressed well and will enable increased reliability and security, faster storm restoration, better efficiency and new offerings for our customers. In 2019, we implemented foundational software and completed our initial meter deployment in Colorado, as planned, with full-scale implementation to follow. In November, we requested approval to expand our advanced grid program to benefit our Minnesota customers, and we expect a commission decision later this year.
Beyond our strong financial and operational performance, I'm also very proud of our ESG leadership. In 2009, we estimate we reduced carbon emissions by more than 40% from 2005 levels, and we remain on track to achieve an 80% carbon reduction by 2030. In recognition of our carbon-free vision, S&P Global gave us their Award of Excellence, and we continue to proactively mitigate the impacts of our clean energy transition on our employees and our communities. We've provided assistance to impacted employees, offering retraining and relocation opportunities, and we're levering natural attrition. As a result, we've managed our transition with no layoffs from coal plant retirements.
We've also partnered with our communities impacted by the closing of coal plants to build new generation at existing sites, and we worked hard to attract new businesses to those communities as well. In Minnesota, there is continued progress to build a Google data center and relocate a metal recycling plant next to our closing Sherco coal plant. In Colorado, we've worked to develop a solar solution to retain a steel mill, which is our largest customer and a major employer in Pueblo, where we are closing 2 coal units. Now these collaborative economic development efforts will help sustain local economies in terms of both jobs and tax base.
And our results have been recognized by others. We were named as one of Fortune Magazine's Most Admired Companies for the seventh consecutive year, one of Corporate Responsibility Magazine's 100 Best Corporate Citizens and among Newsweek's Most Responsible Companies. We earned another perfect score on the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index, and we remain among the best places to work for LGBTQ equality. In addition, various publications continue to recognize our strong leadership as a veteran employer. All of this adds up to an outstanding ESG record, which is becoming increasingly important to investors.
So I'm really pleased with our accomplishments. And looking forward, I'm excited about the opportunities we have in 2020 and beyond. We will continue executing on our multistate wind investment program, which will provide clean, affordable energy to our customers. Longer term, we'll add more universal solar, storage and firm capacity to our system as part of our plan to reduce carbon emissions by 80% by 2030. We'll deliver on our planned transmission projects while collaborating with others to solve congestion issues over the next decade. This work is critical to maintaining reliability as more renewables are added to the system, and it also creates significant investment opportunities well into the future. 
Implementation of our advanced grid program will also keep the grid reliable, secure and efficient and allow for the integration of more renewables while enabling new offerings for our customers. We will continue working with our customers, policymakers and other stakeholders to build nation-leading EV programs, which will improve the customer experience and reduce emissions across the transportation sector.
So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob, who'll provide more detail on our financial results and outlook as well as a regulatory update. Bob?"

My comments today will focus on full year 2019 results.

We delivere",1259,"Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. My comments today will focus on full year 2019 results. For details on our fourth quarter results, please see our earnings release.
We achieved another year of strong operational and financial results. We delivered 2019 ongoing earnings of $2.64 per share, which is a 6.9% increase compared with $2.47 per share in 2018. This result represents the top end of our original guidance range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share. Similar to last year, weather was a positive factor, contributing almost $0.07 per share compared to normal. However, we also incurred additional O&M expense, including approximately $0.03 per share due to storms, partially offsetting the weather benefit.
The most significant earnings drivers for the year include higher electric and natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.37 per share, including rate increases in riders to recover capital investments. Lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.02 per share, and our lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.15 per share. However, the majority of the lower ETR is due to an increase in production tax credits which flow back to customers through electric margin and tax reform impacts, both of which are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation and interest expense, reflecting our capital investment program, which reduced earnings by $0.29 per share. And lower AFUDC due to project timing decreased earnings by $0.08 per share.
Turning to sales. Our weather-adjusted electric sales declined by 0.3% in 2019. We saw positive residential sales across almost all of our jurisdictions with continued customer growth, partially offset by lower use per customer. And in the C&I space, we experienced discrete declines in certain large customer usage due to cogeneration and lower frac sand mining sales, which caused sales to be unfavorable. Weather-adjusted natural gas sales increased 2.7% in 2019 as a result of strong customer growth and higher use per customer, partially offset by the declines in the frac sand mining demand in Wisconsin. For 2020, we anticipate electric and natural gas sales growth of approximately 1%, which includes the impact of leap year.
Turning to expenses. O&M costs were almost 1% lower than last year, driven by continued efficiency gains in our transmission and in our fossil and nuclear generation fleets, partially offset by unexpected storm costs and incremental spending on strategic areas to enhance the customer experience and further reduce risk in our operations. We remain committed to improving operating efficiencies and taking cost out of the business for the benefit of our customers, as we have for the past 5 years. And as a result, our consolidated base O&M forecast is essentially flat. However, we do expect incremental O&M from adding new wind generation in 2020 and 2021, which is largely rider recoverable as well as continuing to invest in strategic areas of cybersecurity, wildfire mitigation and enhancing the customer experience. As a result, we expect total O&M expense will increase approximately 1% to 2% in 2020.
Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. In December, the Minnesota Commission approved our rate case stay out proposal, including the extension of the sales, capital and property tax true-up mechanisms, along with the deferral of increases in nuclear decommissioning costs. We view this as a constructive outcome as it will allow us to concentrate on other strategic Minnesota activities, including our integrated resource plan, our advanced grid initiative and electric vehicle expansion efforts. 
In January, the Minnesota Commission approved our affiliate filing for the Mankato natural gas plant and the assumption of the existing PPAs. We closed on the acquisition earlier this month, and believe the Mankato asset will bring substantial value and reliability to the Upper Midwest system and to our customers, especially as we retire additional coal plants. As we discussed in the past, we anticipate this asset will generate utility-like returns over its life. However, we expect the non-regulatory returns will be slightly lower in the near term and more robust towards the back end of the forecast. 
We continue to progress -- we continue the progress on our PPA acquisition strategy, and we are working with stakeholders to improve the process to ensure better regulatory alignment. We do not expect to propose future asset acquisitions into the unregulated company.
Moving to Colorado. The commission held deliberations in our electric rate case in December and verbally approved an ROE of 9.3%, a current test year ended August 2019 and an equity ratio of 55.6%, along with other decisions. We view the support for strong capital structure and progress in improving the more current test year as positives, particularly for the credit support that they provide. But we're disappointed in a low ROE, which does not reflect our outstanding operational performance and leadership on the clean energy transition. We are waiting on a written commission order, which we need to calculate the final revenue impacts, however, we expect to seek reconsideration on certain issues. We expect new rates will be effective in February, 2020.
We also have electric rate cases in New Mexico and Texas. In New Mexico, we recently reached a constructive settlement that reflects a rate increase of approximately $31 million, an ROE of 9.45%, an equity ratio of 54.8% and an acceleration in depreciation in the top coal plant to reflect an early retirement. Hearings are scheduled in February with a commission decision to follow. 
In Texas, we're seeking an increase of $136 million based on a historic test year, an equity ratio of 54.7% and an ROE of 10.35%. The request largely reflects investment for the Hale wind project as well as other capital to support strong regional growth. Intervener testimony will be filed in February, and as in the past, we'll work to see if we can reach a settlement with the various parties. We anticipate a commission decision in the second quarter of 2020. 
We're planning to file several cases next year. In February, we will file a natural gas rate case in Colorado with new rates expected to be effective in November. We'll also consider filing a Colorado electric case in December. We intend to file a Minnesota electric case in November. And finally, we'll likely file rate cases in both Texas and New Mexico to recover the cost for the Sagamore wind project in the first quarter of 2021.
With a strong year behind us, we are reaffirming our 2020 earnings guidance range of $2.73 to $2.83 per share, which is consistent with the long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%.
With that, I'll wrap up. In summary, 2019 was another great year for Xcel Energy. We delivered earnings within or above our guidance range for the 15th consecutive year. We increased our dividend for the 16th straight year. We issued $750 million of equity, representing the majority of our equity needs over the next 5 years. Our stock hit an all-time high in September and more recently, in January. We achieved a total shareholder return of just over 32%, eclipsing that TSR of the S&P 500 for yet another year. The Minnesota Commission approved our acquisition of the Longroad assets into rate base, and we put in service 3 wind projects, largely on time and under budget. We resolved multiple rate cases, and we continue to demonstrate leadership in environmental, social and governance arenas. We remain well positioned to deliver on our 2020 earnings guidance range and our long-term earnings and dividend growth objectives of 5% to 7%. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take questions."

As we give guidance, we do expect modest increases in O&M over the next year or 2 as we bring the wind onto the system, and we spend some money in very strategic areas like cyber and wildfire risk mitigations. Over the longer term, we expect to keep O&M flat, probably beyond the '21 period. And that includes substantial cost curve bending as we absorb increases in salaries and bargaining unit increases and increases from suppliers, looking for upticks in our contracts and things like that. So it's a continuous effort, but I think the guidance for us is flat in '22 and beyond to what is '21."

There's been concern about regulatory risk, both lower equity ratios and lower ROEs in that state.

So I think the more relevant case that I look to as I think about how Texas might get resolved, it's actually the settlement we had in New Mexico. As you know, Greg, many of the same interveners in Mexico are going to be the same ones in Texas. So we'll obviously look at those cases, but we're cautiously optimistic that we'll have some opportunities to potentially settle the Texas case in the March time frame of this year."

Without that 60% PTC extension, Travis, I would have told you that perhaps we'll see some bump up in wind, and we still might. And which is why I'm really pleased we locked down the 100%. I think that's a no-regret strategy in every sense of the word. But I think the technology is still going to compete head on with fossil alternatives, even in a low natural gas environment. 
Of course, the key that I think is important to that is that we will put more renewables on the big grid that we're all connected to than anybody else, but we're going to need more than just renewables and battery storage. Renewables will be our biggest source of energy by the mid-'20s. But as you see in our IRP in Minnesota, and we'll address this in Colorado next year, we're also going to need to back up that wind with natural gas. And then ultimately, we're going to need to start developing technologies, carbon-free dispatchable technologies that will allow us to achieve our goal of a 0% carbon system by 2050. So maybe that's a little bit long-winded, but I thought I'd throw that out there for you, Travis. That's the plan. 
I will also add Travis, our industry is really, really stepping up to the challenge of carbon reduction. I mean we're proud to have been the first to establish the goal.

As far as the regulatory environment in Colorado, yes, I mentioned, Bob and I both did, we're disappointed in a 9.3% ROE. We think we're one of the best-performing utilities in the nation, and that ROE, quite frankly, doesn't reflect that. So likely look for reconsideration on that. But longer term, Sophie, I believe that what we're doing -- and what we're doing was codified in the law last legislative session, we're highly aligned with what our customers and our stakeholders want to see in Colorado. And when I think about how you achieve long-term success, that's exactly how you do it, align with stakeholders and then execute on a crisp basis. And that is what Xcel is doing, and I think that bodes well for future success."

Well, Andy, I think that is a very good question. It's a challenging question because we're going to need natural gas to achieve that 80% carbon reduction that I mentioned, and early action is pretty darn important in addressing the risk of climate change. So we're going to get pushed back on natural gas. But I think the key is to make sure that people understand, you shouldn't make perfection be the enemy of a great plan. And we're moving away from coal completely here in the Upper Midwest. That's the plan. We're going to need gas to back it up. We had a -- this time last year, we were on a polar vortex. Reliability is critical. So I think we've got a really pragmatic plan. 
Our challenge as an industry, Andy, is going to be making sure that people see that 2050 is a long way away. We're going to need different types of innovation. We'll put as much renewables and battery storage on the grid. But experts tell us that the big grid that we're all connected to does get saturated, depending on where you are in the country, between 50% and 70%. That's amazing. That's the big grid. But that's where we're -- but after that, we're going to need things to back it up and ultimately, new technologies. So as part of the leadership of EEI, that's a message I want to get out there. 
Now as far as the LDC goes and as far as using natural gas, I think our industry needs to be more demanding of upstream methane emissions. I think that's really important, and we can do something about that. We need to double down on energy efficiency on the gas side. And then ultimately, I think we need to look at potentially using renewable gas or hydrogen made out of carbon-free energy and other things and start blending that in the resource mix. 
I will also tell you that here in the Upper Midwest, heat pumps and things like that are pretty tough to make work, at least with today's technology. So -- and we've got to keep customers warm. So it's a challenging issue. But I think with the right messaging and demonstrating we've got a great plan, I think we can persevere."

So I think it's the Midwestern way to kind of be pragmatic about how we approach this going forward. 
And to your point, Paul, I think there are opportunities across our system to look at how we dispatch our coal plants, particularly when you look at the variable cost of things like steel for fuel and renewable energy. So we are definitely looking at that down in the SPS region. We've got some water issues that we need to address, and that could be solved with some seasonal dispatch, so -- again, with economics in mind. So yes, just look for us to look for more opportunities like we're doing here in the Upper Midwest."

As I report back on the past few months, my heart really goes out to the individuals and families impacted by the coronavirus, the devoted health care professionals so bravely serving our communities and the business communities and local businesses. I'm so pleased with how our employees and industry have responded to unprecedented time, working to keep people safe, delivering reliable service to customers and providing support to those in need as we've done for over 100 years. I also want to thank our employees for their dedication, spirit and creativity in finding ways to support our communities and stimulate local economic growth. 
Now turning to the quarter. We've gotten off to a solid start, booking $0.56 per share for the first quarter of 2020 compared with $0.61 per share last year. We believe we can take actions that will allow us to weather the impact of COVID-19. And as a result, we are reaffirming our 2020 guidance. Brian will discuss the financial results in more detail. 
At Xcel Energy, we're taking significant strides to help our customers and protect our employees, while continuing to deliver critical energy services. Some of our actions include we're committing to not disconnecting residential customer service and arranging payment plans if they're having difficulty paying their bills. In Minnesota, we are proposing to reduce our accrued fuel forecast by $25 million to give immediate relief to our customers. We stepped up our charitable giving and are helping our communities during this time of need, and we are working closely with our regulators and state and local leadership to identifying constructive solutions to support our communities and customers. We're keeping our employees safe by implementing work-from-home policies, providing personal protection equipment and following CDC's social distancing guidelines and enhancing cleaning practices, conducting temperature checks at critical facilities, segregating crews and staggering work times. 
To ensure continued reliability, we've implemented business continuity plans, which allows us to prioritize work and are prepared to sequester critical employees on-site, if necessary. 
From a financial standpoint, we've enhanced our liquidity and developed contingency plans to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. 
Finally, we expect to be part of the solution to help get the economy back on its feet by continuing to invest in our communities through our capital expenditure programs that create jobs and drive demand for equipment and supplies. 
While this is a fluid situation with considerable uncertainty, Xcel Energy has always shown a remarkable dedication to serving our customers during difficult times, and this set of challenges is no exception. 
Moving on to business development. We recently announced the opportunistic sale of the Mankato natural gas plant for $680 million. You recall, we originally proposed this acquisition as a fully regulated asset. However, when the Minnesota Commission rejected this proposal, we acquired Mankato as a nonregulated asset and stepped into the power purchase agreement. While we thought Mankato would provide significant long-term value, especially as we shut down coal assets, we heard from several investors that having a nonregulated asset cloud at the Xcel Energy story. As a result, when several potential buyers expressed interest in acquiring the plant, we decided to sell it and preserve our status as one of the very few fully regulated pure-play utilities. And since the earnings were back-end loaded, we don't expect the sale to materially impact our earnings projections. And while it was not part of the rationale for the sale, the transaction will improve our liquidity in these uncertain times. We will use the proceeds to reduce funding needs and improve our credit metrics. 
In addition, we will book a gain which we will use to fund charitable-giving efforts, including supporting COVID-19 relief efforts throughout our communities. 
Finally, we recently announced some important promotions as part of our succession plan. Bob Frenzel was named President and Chief Operating Officer, and Brian Van Abel was named Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bob has been our CFO for the past 4 years and has extensive experience in the industry prior to joining Xcel Energy, while Brian has had increasing roles in finance, including treasurer, financial planning and analysis and corporate development. Both Bob and Brian are extremely intelligent and talented employees who have been instrumental in developing and executing our strategy and delivering our consistently strong financial results. And while I don't plan to retire anytime soon, these promotions reflect the deep bench strength and thoughtful planning we have at Xcel Energy. 
So with that, let me turn the call over to Brian, who will provide more detail on our financial results and outlook, along with our actions to mitigate coronavirus impacts. Brian?"

We achieved solid results, reporting $0.56 per share for the first quarter of 2020 compared to $0.61 per share last year. Majority of the quarterly deviation is driven by weather. We experienced warmer-than-normal",1470,"Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. We achieved solid results, reporting $0.56 per share for the first quarter of 2020 compared to $0.61 per share last year. Majority of the quarterly deviation is driven by weather. We experienced warmer-than-normal winter weather this year compared with cooler-than-normal weather last year, which results in a $0.04 per share unfavorable comparison. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter include lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.03 per share. Our lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.03 per share. However, majority of the lower ETR is due to an increase in production tax credits which flow back to customers through electric margin and tax reform impacts, both of which are largely earnings neutral. 
Offsetting these positive drivers were lower margins due largely to unfavorable weather, which reduced earnings by $0.03 per share and which offset rises and regulatory outcomes. 
Increased depreciation and interest expense, reflecting our capital investment program, reduced earnings by $0.05 per share, and other items combined decreased earnings by $0.03 per share. 
Next, I want to discuss the potential impact of COVID-19 and the actions we are taking to mitigate a range of outcomes. Starting with sales, our first quarter weather and leap year adjusted electric sales declined by 1.1%, while natural gas sales increased by 0.4%. The coronavirus crisis had a minor impact on first quarter sales. The economic shutdown started in mid-March, so we did not experience the full monthly impact. For March, our total residential sales increased slightly, while C&I sales declined 4%, resulting in a total retail electric sales decline of 3% on a weather-adjusted basis. 
However, a better reference point on the monthly COVID-19 impact is what we saw in our preliminary April numbers in which almost all of our states were under relatively strict shelter-in-place orders. Residential sales increased 3.2%, while C&I sales declined 13.7%, while retail electric sales declined 9.6% on a weather-adjusted basis. And keep in mind, we have a sales true-up mechanism for all electric classes in Minnesota and decoupling for the electric residential and non-demand small C&I classes in Colorado. This covers about 45% of our total retail electric sales. 
And to help us [indiscernible] in the third quarter, this results in a sales decline of approximately 8% compared to 2019. Our base case -- in the case in which we are reaffirming our earnings guidance around assumes a severe impact to the second quarter with a slower U-type shaped recovery with lingering effects for the rest of 2020. This results in a sales decline of approximately 4% on a year-over-year basis. 
And lastly, the severe scenario assumes a severe impact that will last through the third quarter, followed by a [indiscernible] or at least within the band around the sales impact we've outlined that have incorporated the base case into our guidance assumptions. 
There is considerable uncertainty on what will actually occur, particularly the duration of the downturn and the lingering effects

we feel confident in our ability to mitigate what we view as the most likely scenario, and the April sales results came in slightly better than our forecast, giving us greater confidence. 
We're also closely monitoring our bad debt expense and working with our customers on payment plans if they're having difficulty paying their bills. While it is difficult to project where we'll land, bad debt expense increased approximately $20 million in the 2008 to 2009 time period as a reference point. 
Additionally, our commissions in Wisconsin, Texas and Michigan,have issued orders to track and defer pandemic-related expenses. We have also filed for deferred accounting treatment of incremental COVID-19-related expenses, including bad debt in Minnesota, Colorado, New Mexico, North Dakota and South Dakota. 
We are implementing contingency plans to reduce our overall cost structure and mitigate the impact of COVID-19. Some of these actions include cost reductions related to employee expenses, consulting, variable compensation, deferral of certain work activities and the implementation of a hiring freeze. Based on our contingency plans, we now expect annual O&M expenses will decline 4% to 5% in 2020, which would offset the impacts of COVID-19 in the base scenario. 
We also have plans in place to ensure that we can implement additional contingency plans if the negative impact of COVID-19 exceed our base case scenario. However, there are limitations to what we can offset. We will focus on providing strong customer service and reliability, and we will not make short-term decisions that have a negative long-term impact on our customers or shareholders.

disruptions, which will likely result in delays in the completion of 2 of our wind farms into 2021. We are monitoring the situation closely and is striving to complete the projects this year. However, we have fully documented our activities since 2016, and we have maintained continuous efforts since then, so we are confident these wind farms will qualify for 100% PTC benefit, even if they're completed in 2021. 
And the last topic I want to cover on COVID-19 is liquidity. We're in a very strong position after enhancing liquidity in March by entering into a $700 million term loan at attractive terms, and we issued a $600 million 10-year holding company bond. We now have available liquidity of approximately $3.1 billion. 
In addition, the sales proceeds from the Mankato plant will increase liquidity by approximately $650 million. And finally, we issued an equity forward last year, which we expect to settle later this year and will provide another approximately $740 million in cash. In total, this will provide liquidity of nearly $4.5 billion. 
We also plan to issue $1.9 billion of operating company debt throughout the year. As a result of our enhanced liquidity, we have the flexibility on issuance timing to ensure that capital markets are successful at attractive terms. For more detail on liquidity, please see our earnings release. 
Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. We have 3 rate cases pending, and the coronavirus has not resulted in any material delays in regulatory proceedings. In New Mexico, we reached a constructive unanimous settlement that reflects a rate increase of approximately $31 million, an ROE of 9.45%, an equity ratio of 54.8% and acceleration of depreciation on the Tolk coal plant to reflect an earlier retirement. We are awaiting a hearing examiner recommendation and commission decision. 
In Texas, SPS and intervening parties have reached an unopposed constructive settlement agreement in principle. We are working with parties to document and file the settlement, which we expect to occur shortly. We anticipate a commission decision in the third quarter. 
In February 2020, we filed a natural gas case in Colorado, seeking a net rate increase of $127 million based on an ROE of 9.95% and an equity ratio of 55.8%. It is fairly early in the process, so there's not much to report, but the procedural schedule has been set with new rates expected to become effective in November based on statutory requirements. 
In terms of earnings, there is considerable uncertainty around the coronavirus impacts. Therefore, we have implemented contingency plans to manage our cost structure and made regulatory filings that will help to offset the impact of COVID-19. As a result, we still expect to deliver 2020 earnings within our original guidance range of $2.73 to $2.83 per share based on our base case scenario which we think is the most likely scenario. In addition, we can implement additional O&M contingency plans if the COVID-19 impacts exceed the base case. However, there are limitations to what we can offset as we balance the short term and long term for both our customers and investors. Our contingency plans would not offset the severe scenario, which would likely result in earnings below our guidance range, but we feel the severe scenario has a low probability of occurring. 
With that, I will wrap up. We have implemented steps to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. We sold the Mankato facility for a modest gain. We increased our dividend 6.2%. We reached constructive rate case settlements in New Mexico and Texas. We remain committed to delivering on our 2020 guidance and our long-term earnings and dividend growth within our 5% to 7% objective range. We continue to provide reliable energy service to our customers while ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and communities. 
Despite the near-term economic challenges, we are executing our strategy extremely well, and we remain positive about the opportunities in front of us for the benefit of our customers, communities and shareholders. 
And finally, we believe we can help rejuvenate our local economies and work with our regulators and state leadership to help our communities and customers recover from the crisis. We're looking forward to being part of the solution. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions."

I think the element -- the other element, too, Stephen, which makes me bullish is that -- and this is where I think we can partner with our states and our commissions and state administrations to be part of the solution and getting people back to work, and that's potentially accelerating some of our capital opportunities and using that to bring on more renewables at a great price point that actually helps save customers money and employees jobs, good jobs. So not unlike with -- when we had the Great recession, I can tell you many times, we had people [ stopping ] -- people have typically worked in a labor union.

And so that allows you to weather situations like that and potentially come back stronger and a partner with our states as we look to jump-start the economy when we get -- all get through this."

And then in the good days, and as the time of crisis year, we're able to weather it. And we look at -- when we think about the O&M contingency plans we're putting in place, whether it's -- we've implemented the hiring freeze. We're looking at reducing employee expenses, and that will happen over time, reducing consulting spend in our other programs.

We're seeing not just constraints on the OEM side, but we do see logistics constraints around ports and air travel and shipping as well, and so that's caused some of the problems.

As I report back on the past few months, my heart really goes out to the individuals and families impacted by the coronavirus, the devoted health care professionals so bravely serving our communities and the business communities and local businesses. I'm so pleased with how our employees and industry have responded during this unprecedented time, working to keep people safe, delivering reliable service to customers and providing support to those in need as we've done for over 100 years. I also want to thank our employees for their dedication, spirit and creativity in finding ways to support our communities and stimulate local economic growth.
Now turning to the quarter. We've gotten off to a solid start, booking $0.56 per share for the first quarter of 2020 compared with $0.61 per share last year. We believe we can take actions that will allow us to weather the impact of COVID-19. And as a result, we are reaffirming our 2020 guidance. Brian will discuss the financial results in more detail.
At Xcel Energy, we're taking significant strides to help our customers and protect our employees, while continuing to deliver critical energy services. Some of our actions include we're committing to not disconnecting residential customer service and arranging payment plans if they're having difficulty paying their bills. In Minnesota, we are proposing to reduce our accrued fuel forecast by $25 million to give immediate relief to our customers. We stepped up our charitable giving and are helping our communities during this time of need, and we are working closely with our regulators and state and local leadership to identifying constructive solutions to support our communities and customers. We're keeping our employees safe by implementing work-from-home policies, providing personal protection equipment and following CDC's social distancing guidelines and enhancing cleaning practices, conducting temperature checks at critical facilities, segregating crews and staggering work times.
To ensure continued reliability, we've implemented business continuity plans, which allows us to prioritize work and are prepared to sequester critical employees on-site, if necessary.
From a financial standpoint, we've enhanced our liquidity and developed contingency plans to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. Finally, we expect to be part of the solution to help get the economy back on its feet by continuing to invest in our communities through our capital expenditure programs that create jobs and drive demand for equipment and supplies.
While this is a fluid situation with considerable uncertainty, Xcel Energy has always shown a remarkable dedication to serving our customers during difficult times, and this set of challenges is no exception.
Moving on to business developments. We recently announced the opportunistic sale of the Mankato natural gas plant for $680 million. You'll recall, we originally proposed this acquisition as a fully-regulated asset. However, when the Minnesota Commission rejected this proposal, we acquired Mankato as a nonregulated asset and stepped into the power purchase agreement. While we thought Mankato would provide significant long-term value, especially as we shut down coal assets, we heard from several investors that having a nonregulated asset cloud at the Xcel Energy story. As a result, when several potential buyers expressed interest in acquiring the plant, we decided to sell it and preserve our status as one of the very few fully-regulated pure-play utilities. And since the earnings were back-end loaded, we don't expect the sale to materially impact our earnings projections. And while it was not part of the rationale for the sale, the transaction will improve our liquidity in these uncertain times. We will use the proceeds to reduce funding needs and improve our credit metrics.
In addition, we will book a gain which we will use to fund charitable-giving efforts, including supporting COVID-19 relief efforts throughout our communities.
Finally, we recently announced some important promotions as part of our succession plan. Bob Frenzel was named President and Chief Operating Officer, and Brian Van Abel was named Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bob has been our CFO for the past 4 years and has extensive experience in the industry prior to joining Xcel Energy, while Brian has had increasing roles in finance, including treasurer, financial planning and analysis and corporate development. Both Bob and Brian are extremely intelligent and talented employees who have been instrumental in developing and executing our strategy and delivering our consistently strong financial results. And while I don't plan to retire anytime soon, these promotions reflect the deep bench strength and thoughtful planning we have at Xcel Energy.
So with that, let me turn the call over to Brian, who will provide more detail on our financial results and outlook, along with our actions to mitigate coronavirus impacts. Brian?"
527542,662993737,1977602,"Xcel Energy Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 07, 2020",2020-05-07,"Earnings Calls","Xcel Energy Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. We achieved solid results, recording $0.56 per share for the first quarter of 2020 compared to $0.61 per share last year. Majority of the quarterly deviation is driven by weather. We experienced a warmer-than-norma",1572,"Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. We achieved solid results, recording $0.56 per share for the first quarter of 2020 compared to $0.61 per share last year. Majority of the quarterly deviation is driven by weather. We experienced a warmer-than-normal winter weather this year compared with cooler-than-normal weather last year, which results in a $0.04 per share unfavorable comparison. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter include lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.03 per share. Our lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.03 per share. However, majority of the lower ETRs is due to an increase in production tax credits which flow back to customers through electric margin and tax reform impacts, both of which are largely earnings neutral.
Offsetting these positive drivers were lower margins due largely to unfavorable weather, which reduced earnings by $0.03 per share and which offset rises in regulatory outcomes. Increased depreciation and interest expense, reflecting our capital investment program, reduced earnings by $0.05 per share, and the other items combined decreased earnings by $0.03 per share.
Next, I want to discuss the potential impact of COVID-19 and the actions we are taking to mitigate a range of outcomes. Starting with sales, our first quarter weather and leap year adjusted electric sales declined by 1.1%, while natural gas sales increased by 0.4%. The coronavirus crisis had a minor impact on first quarter sales. The economic shutdown started in mid-March, so we did not experience the full monthly impact. For March, our total residential sales increased slightly, while C&I sales declined 4%, resulting in a total retail electric sales decline of 3% on a weather-adjusted basis.
However, a better reference point on the monthly COVID-19 impact is what we saw in our preliminary April numbers in which almost all of our states were under relatively strict shelter-in-place orders. Residential sales increased 3.2%, while C&I sales declined 13.7%, and total retail electric sales declined 9.6% on a weather-adjusted basis. And keep in mind, we have a sales true-up mechanism for all electric classes in Minnesota and decoupling for the electric residential and non-demand small C&I classes in Colorado. This covers about 45% of our total retail electric sales.
And to help us for recovery in the third quarter, this results in a sales decline of approximately 2% compared to 2019. Our base case and the case in which we are reaffirming our earnings guidance around assumes a severe impact to the second quarter with a slower U-type shaped recovery with lingering effects for the rest of 2020. This results in a sales decline of approximately 4% on a year-over-year basis. 
And lastly, the severe scenario assumes a severe impact that will last through the third quarter, followed by a protracted L-type shaped recovery. This is a challenging scenario with a deeper and longer bottom in our base case, resulting in a sales decline of approximately 8% for the year. We use these scenarios as we develop our contingency plans. We view the models in severe case scenarios as having a low probability of occurring. We think the base case scenario is the most-likely outcome. Where we slip in the band around the sales impact we've outlined, we have incorporated the base case into our guidance assumptions.
There is considerable uncertainty on what will actually occur, particularly the duration of the downturn and the lingering effects, which
[Audio Gap] 
we feel confident in our ability to mitigate what we view as the most likely scenario, and the April sales results came in slightly better than our forecast, giving us greater confidence.
We're also closely monitoring our bad debt expense and working with our customers on payment plans if they're having difficulty paying their bills. While it is difficult to project where we'll land, bad debt expense increased to approximately $20 million in the 2008 to 2009 time period as a reference point.
Additionally, our commissions in Wisconsin, Texas and Michigan have issued orders to track and defer pandemic-related expenses. We have also filed for deferred accounting treatment of incremental COVID-19-related expenses, including bad debt in Minnesota, Colorado, New Mexico, North Dakota and South Dakota.
We are implementing contingency plans to reduce our overall cost structure and mitigate the impact of COVID-19. Some of these actions include cost reductions related to employee expenses, consulting, variable compensation, deferral of certain work activities and the implementation of a hiring freeze. Based on our contingency plans, we now expect annual O&M expenses will decline 4% to 5% in 2020, which would offset the impacts of COVID-19 in the base scenario.
We also have plans in place to ensure that we can implement additional contingency plans if the negative impact of COVID-19 exceed our base case scenario. However, there are limitations to what we can offset. We will focus on providing strong customer service and reliability, and we will not make short-term decisions that have a negative long-term impact on our customers or shareholders.
Turning to Supply chain. The situation is fluid, but we have not had any material impacts to our supply chain with the exception of our wind farms. In mid-April, we were informed of supply chain disruptions, which will likely result in delays in the completion of 2 of our wind farms into 2021. We're monitoring the situation closely and is striving to complete the projects this year. However, we have fully documented our activities since 2016, and we have maintained continuous efforts since then, so we are confident these wind farms will qualify for 100% PTC benefit, even if they're completed in 2021.
And the last topic I want to cover on COVID-19 is liquidity. We're in a very strong position after enhancing liquidity in March by entering into a $700 million term loan at attractive terms, and we issued a $600 million 10-year holding company bond. We now have available liquidity of approximately $3.1 billion.
In addition, the sales proceeds from the Mankato plant will increase liquidity by approximately $650 million. And finally, we issued an equity forward last year, which we expect to settle later this year and will provide another approximately $740 million in cash. In total, this will provide liquidity of nearly $4.5 billion.
We also plan to issue $1.9 billion of operating company debt throughout the year. As a result of our enhanced liquidity, we have the flexibility on issuance timing to ensure that capital markets are accessible at attractive terms. For more detail on liquidity, please see our earnings release.
Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. We have 3 rate cases pending, and the coronavirus has not resulted in any material delays in regulatory proceedings. In New Mexico, we reached a constructive unanimous settlement that reflects a rate increase of approximately $31 million, an ROE of 9.45%, an equity ratio of 54.8% and acceleration of depreciation on the Tolk coal plant to reflect an earlier retirement. We are awaiting a hearing examiner recommendation and commission decision. 
In Texas, SPS and intervening parties have reached an unopposed constructive settlement agreement in principle. We are working with parties to document and file the settlement, which we expect to occur shortly. We anticipate a commission decision in the third quarter.
In February 2020, we filed a natural gas case in Colorado, seeking a net rate increase of $127 million based on an ROE of 9.95% and an equity ratio of 55.8%. It is fairly early in the process, so there's not much to report, but the procedural schedule has been set with new rates expected to become effective in November based on statutory requirements.
In terms of earnings, there is considerable uncertainty around the coronavirus impacts. Therefore, we have implemented contingency plans to manage our cost structure and made regulatory filings that will help to offset the impact of COVID-19. As a result, we still expect to deliver 2020 earnings within our original guidance range of $2.73 to $2.83 per share based on our base case scenario, which we think is the most likely scenario. In addition, we can implement additional O&M contingency plans if the COVID-19 impacts exceed the base case. However, there are limitations to what we can offset, as we balance the short term and long term for both our customers and investors. Our contingency plans would not offset the severe scenario, which would likely result in earnings below our guidance range, but we feel the severe scenario has a low probability of occurring.
With that, I will wrap up. We have implemented steps to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. We sold the Mankato facility for a modest gain. We increased our dividend 6.2%. We reached constructive rate case settlements in New Mexico and Texas. We remained committed to delivering on our 2020 guidance and our long-term earnings and dividend growth within our 5% to 7% objective range. We continued to provide reliable energy service to our customers, while ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and communities.
Despite the near-term economic challenges, we are executing our strategy extremely well, and we remain positive about the opportunities in front of us for the benefit of our customers, communities and shareholders. 
And finally, we believe we can help rejuvenate our local economies and work with our regulators and state leadership to help our communities and customers recover from the crisis. We're looking forward to being part of the solution.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions."

And obviously, there could be potential here as you see what's happening. And if any of them have an interest of selling, we're certainly in regular  contact. We have our proceeding of the Mower acquisition in front of the commission, and we hopefully see a decision on that in Q2 -- Q2 or Q3. But then we're also looking at how we use the ERP in our IRP processes to help jump-start some of that, too. Some of the discussions around our acquisitions in Minnesota is how can we better improve the process with our -- with the department, our stakeholders to ensure that we're bringing it forward and have a comprehensive discussion. So we're certainly active on that stage. And we've talked about it before, continues to be part of our plan, but we don't include any of that in our base capital plan."

And just maybe at a high level in terms of resource planning, how do you think about the opportunity for further acceleration of renewables? I guess on the positive side, renewable cost keep dropping. We may -- there's always a potential for tax credits to get extended. The wind credit got extended again last year. On the negative side, I guess, we have demand uncertainty from COVID. In Texas, we had uncertainty around the status of the energy sector overall. But how do you think about the potential for additional sort of renewables growth, additional shutdowns of some of your coal assets? Do you feel about the same as you felt before? Are there reasons to be more bullish or more cautious? How would you think about that?"

And so our steel-for-fuel strategy continues to be, I think, obviously, economically attractive. And I think the test of that was the ability to  get our renewables approved in Texas and New Mexico and basically on economic terms.
I think the element -- the other element, too, Stephen, which makes me bullish is that -- and this is where I think we can partner with our states and our commissions and state administrations to be part of the solution and getting people back to work, and that's potentially accelerating some of our capital opportunities and using that to bring on more renewables at a great price point that actually helps save customers money and employees' jobs, good jobs. So not unlike with -- when we had the Great Recession, I can tell you many times that we had people [ starting ] -- people have typically worked in a labor union, and actually thank myself and really the company for continuing to go forward with projects because that was the only job in town.

We think that's an industry-wide phenomena. I think that, as Brian mentioned, we've been exceptionally diligent in tracking our costs. We are really comfortable with our ability to meet the safe harbor provisions for achieving 100% PTC. These are projects that were originally scheduled to be later in this year anyway. And so while we're trying actively to get them completed in 2020, there's some potential they do slip into '21. But I do think it's stuff we're seeing around the industry. And also, not only is it our vendors, but there's a logistics and a supply chain issue with ports and parts transport that we're seeing. It's not -- I wouldn't say it's catastrophic by any stretch. It's just mild. We just happen to have these for a later-dated projects for us."

We're seeing not just constraints on the OEM side, but we do see logistics constraints around ports and air travel and shipping as well, and so that's caused some of the problems.

As I report back on the past few months, my heart really goes out to the individuals and families impacted by the coronavirus, the devoted health care professionals so bravely serving our communities and the business communities and local businesses. I'm so pleased with how our employees and industry have responded during this unprecedented time, working to keep people safe, delivering reliable service to customers and providing support to those in need as we've done for over 100 years. I also want to thank our employees for their dedication, spirit and creativity in finding ways to support our communities and stimulate local economic growth.
Now turning to the quarter. We've gotten off to a solid start, booking $0.56 per share for the first quarter of 2020 compared with $0.61 per share last year. We believe we can take actions that will allow us to weather the impact of COVID-19. And as a result, we are reaffirming our 2020 guidance. Brian will discuss the financial results in more detail.
At Xcel Energy, we're taking significant strides to help our customers and protect our employees, while continuing to deliver critical energy services. Some of our actions include we're committing to not disconnecting residential customer service and arranging payment plans if they're having difficulty paying their bills. In Minnesota, we are proposing to reduce our accrued fuel forecast by $25 million to give immediate relief to our customers. We stepped up our charitable giving and are helping our communities during this time of need, and we are working closely with our regulators and state and local leadership to identifying constructive solutions to support our communities and customers. We're keeping our employees safe by implementing work-from-home policies, providing personal protection equipment and following CDC's social distancing guidelines and enhancing cleaning practices, conducting temperature checks at critical facilities, segregating crews and staggering work times.
To ensure continued reliability, we've implemented business continuity plans, which allows us to prioritize work and are prepared to sequester critical employees on-site, if necessary.
From a financial standpoint, we've enhanced our liquidity and developed contingency plans to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. Finally, we expect to be part of the solution to help get the economy back on its feet by continuing to invest in our communities through our capital expenditure programs that create jobs and drive demand for equipment and supplies.
While this is a fluid situation with considerable uncertainty, Xcel Energy has always shown a remarkable dedication to serving our customers during difficult times, and this set of challenges is no exception.
Moving on to business developments. We recently announced the opportunistic sale of the Mankato natural gas plant for $680 million. You'll recall, we originally proposed this acquisition as a fully-regulated asset. However, when the Minnesota Commission rejected this proposal, we acquired Mankato as a nonregulated asset and stepped into the power purchase agreement. While we thought Mankato would provide significant long-term value, especially as we shut down coal assets, we heard from several investors that having a nonregulated asset cloud at the Xcel Energy story. As a result, when several potential buyers expressed interest in acquiring the plant, we decided to sell it and preserve our status as one of the very few fully-regulated pure-play utilities. And since the earnings were back-end loaded, we don't expect the sale to materially impact our earnings projections. And while it was not part of the rationale for the sale, the transaction will improve our liquidity in these uncertain times. We will use the proceeds to reduce funding needs and improve our credit metrics.
In addition, we will book a gain which we will use to fund charitable-giving efforts, including supporting COVID-19 relief efforts throughout our communities.
Finally, we recently announced some important promotions as part of our succession plan. Bob Frenzel was named President and Chief Operating Officer, and Brian Van Abel was named Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bob has been our CFO for the past 4 years and has extensive experience in the industry prior to joining Xcel Energy, while Brian has had increasing roles in finance, including treasurer, financial planning and analysis and corporate development. Both Bob and Brian are extremely intelligent and talented employees who have been instrumental in developing and executing our strategy and delivering our consistently strong financial results. And while I don't plan to retire anytime soon, these promotions reflect the deep bench strength and thoughtful planning we have at Xcel Energy.
So with that, let me turn the call over to Brian, who will provide more detail on our financial results and outlook, along with our actions to mitigate coronavirus impacts. Brian?"
527542,662993737,1998646,"Xcel Energy Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 07, 2020",2020-05-07,"Earnings Calls","Xcel Energy Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. We achieved solid results, recording $0.56 per share for the first quarter of 2020 compared to $0.61 per share last year. Majority of the quarterly deviation is driven by weather. We experienced a warmer-than-norma",1572,"Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. We achieved solid results, recording $0.56 per share for the first quarter of 2020 compared to $0.61 per share last year. Majority of the quarterly deviation is driven by weather. We experienced a warmer-than-normal winter weather this year compared with cooler-than-normal weather last year, which results in a $0.04 per share unfavorable comparison. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter include lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.03 per share. Our lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.03 per share. However, majority of the lower ETRs is due to an increase in production tax credits which flow back to customers through electric margin and tax reform impacts, both of which are largely earnings neutral.
Offsetting these positive drivers were lower margins due largely to unfavorable weather, which reduced earnings by $0.03 per share and which offset rises in regulatory outcomes. Increased depreciation and interest expense, reflecting our capital investment program, reduced earnings by $0.05 per share, and the other items combined decreased earnings by $0.03 per share.
Next, I want to discuss the potential impact of COVID-19 and the actions we are taking to mitigate a range of outcomes. Starting with sales, our first quarter weather and leap year adjusted electric sales declined by 1.1%, while natural gas sales increased by 0.4%. The coronavirus crisis had a minor impact on first quarter sales. The economic shutdown started in mid-March, so we did not experience the full monthly impact. For March, our total residential sales increased slightly, while C&I sales declined 4%, resulting in a total retail electric sales decline of 3% on a weather-adjusted basis.
However, a better reference point on the monthly COVID-19 impact is what we saw in our preliminary April numbers in which almost all of our states were under relatively strict shelter-in-place orders. Residential sales increased 3.2%, while C&I sales declined 13.7%, and total retail electric sales declined 9.6% on a weather-adjusted basis. And keep in mind, we have a sales true-up mechanism for all electric classes in Minnesota and decoupling for the electric residential and non-demand small C&I classes in Colorado. This covers about 45% of our total retail electric sales.
And to help us for recovery in the third quarter, this results in a sales decline of approximately 2% compared to 2019. Our base case and the case in which we are reaffirming our earnings guidance around assumes a severe impact to the second quarter with a slower U-type shaped recovery with lingering effects for the rest of 2020. This results in a sales decline of approximately 4% on a year-over-year basis. 
And lastly, the severe scenario assumes a severe impact that will last through the third quarter, followed by a protracted L-type shaped recovery. This is a challenging scenario with a deeper and longer bottom in our base case, resulting in a sales decline of approximately 8% for the year. We use these scenarios as we develop our contingency plans. We view the models in severe case scenarios as having a low probability of occurring. We think the base case scenario is the most-likely outcome. Where we slip in the band around the sales impact we've outlined, we have incorporated the base case into our guidance assumptions.
There is considerable uncertainty on what will actually occur, particularly the duration of the downturn and the lingering effects, which
[Audio Gap] 
we feel confident in our ability to mitigate what we view as the most likely scenario, and the April sales results came in slightly better than our forecast, giving us greater confidence.
We're also closely monitoring our bad debt expense and working with our customers on payment plans if they're having difficulty paying their bills. While it is difficult to project where we'll land, bad debt expense increased to approximately $20 million in the 2008 to 2009 time period as a reference point.
Additionally, our commissions in Wisconsin, Texas and Michigan have issued orders to track and defer pandemic-related expenses. We have also filed for deferred accounting treatment of incremental COVID-19-related expenses, including bad debt in Minnesota, Colorado, New Mexico, North Dakota and South Dakota.
We are implementing contingency plans to reduce our overall cost structure and mitigate the impact of COVID-19. Some of these actions include cost reductions related to employee expenses, consulting, variable compensation, deferral of certain work activities and the implementation of a hiring freeze. Based on our contingency plans, we now expect annual O&M expenses will decline 4% to 5% in 2020, which would offset the impacts of COVID-19 in the base scenario.
We also have plans in place to ensure that we can implement additional contingency plans if the negative impact of COVID-19 exceed our base case scenario. However, there are limitations to what we can offset. We will focus on providing strong customer service and reliability, and we will not make short-term decisions that have a negative long-term impact on our customers or shareholders.
Turning to Supply chain. The situation is fluid, but we have not had any material impacts to our supply chain with the exception of our wind farms. In mid-April, we were informed of supply chain disruptions, which will likely result in delays in the completion of 2 of our wind farms into 2021. We're monitoring the situation closely and is striving to complete the projects this year. However, we have fully documented our activities since 2016, and we have maintained continuous efforts since then, so we are confident these wind farms will qualify for 100% PTC benefit, even if they're completed in 2021.
And the last topic I want to cover on COVID-19 is liquidity. We're in a very strong position after enhancing liquidity in March by entering into a $700 million term loan at attractive terms, and we issued a $600 million 10-year holding company bond. We now have available liquidity of approximately $3.1 billion.
In addition, the sales proceeds from the Mankato plant will increase liquidity by approximately $650 million. And finally, we issued an equity forward last year, which we expect to settle later this year and will provide another approximately $740 million in cash. In total, this will provide liquidity of nearly $4.5 billion.
We also plan to issue $1.9 billion of operating company debt throughout the year. As a result of our enhanced liquidity, we have the flexibility on issuance timing to ensure that capital markets are accessible at attractive terms. For more detail on liquidity, please see our earnings release.
Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. We have 3 rate cases pending, and the coronavirus has not resulted in any material delays in regulatory proceedings. In New Mexico, we reached a constructive unanimous settlement that reflects a rate increase of approximately $31 million, an ROE of 9.45%, an equity ratio of 54.8% and acceleration of depreciation on the Tolk coal plant to reflect an earlier retirement. We are awaiting a hearing examiner recommendation and commission decision. 
In Texas, SPS and intervening parties have reached an unopposed constructive settlement agreement in principle. We are working with parties to document and file the settlement, which we expect to occur shortly. We anticipate a commission decision in the third quarter.
In February 2020, we filed a natural gas case in Colorado, seeking a net rate increase of $127 million based on an ROE of 9.95% and an equity ratio of 55.8%. It is fairly early in the process, so there's not much to report, but the procedural schedule has been set with new rates expected to become effective in November based on statutory requirements.
In terms of earnings, there is considerable uncertainty around the coronavirus impacts. Therefore, we have implemented contingency plans to manage our cost structure and made regulatory filings that will help to offset the impact of COVID-19. As a result, we still expect to deliver 2020 earnings within our original guidance range of $2.73 to $2.83 per share based on our base case scenario, which we think is the most likely scenario. In addition, we can implement additional O&M contingency plans if the COVID-19 impacts exceed the base case. However, there are limitations to what we can offset, as we balance the short term and long term for both our customers and investors. Our contingency plans would not offset the severe scenario, which would likely result in earnings below our guidance range, but we feel the severe scenario has a low probability of occurring.
With that, I will wrap up. We have implemented steps to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. We sold the Mankato facility for a modest gain. We increased our dividend 6.2%. We reached constructive rate case settlements in New Mexico and Texas. We remained committed to delivering on our 2020 guidance and our long-term earnings and dividend growth within our 5% to 7% objective range. We continued to provide reliable energy service to our customers, while ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and communities.
Despite the near-term economic challenges, we are executing our strategy extremely well, and we remain positive about the opportunities in front of us for the benefit of our customers, communities and shareholders. 
And finally, we believe we can help rejuvenate our local economies and work with our regulators and state leadership to help our communities and customers recover from the crisis. We're looking forward to being part of the solution.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions."

And so depending on the progress of the pandemic and which country it's hit and which factories has caused 2-, 3-, 4-week delays in various places, which compounded equals maybe a 6- or 7- or 8-week delay on our projects, and that was enough to push them across -- potentially push them across the goal line. We're seeing not just constraints on the OEM side, but we do see logistics constraints around ports and air travel and shipping as well, and so that's caused some of the problems. I can't say that we've seen any other disruptions on any of our other components, we just haven't. But those discrete items are stuff we're watching closely. As Ben and Brian has said, we feel very confident in our ability to qualify for the PTCs at 100% and working diligently with our vendors and our transportation providers to get all the components here and get them constructed by the end of the year."

As I report back on the past few months, my heart really goes out to the individuals and families impacted by the coronavirus, the devoted health care professionals so bravely serving our communities and the business communities and local businesses. I'm so pleased with how our employees and industry have responded during this unprecedented time, working to keep people safe, delivering reliable service to customers and providing support to those in need as we've done for over 100 years. I also want to thank our employees for their dedication, spirit and creativity in finding ways to support our communities and stimulate local economic growth.
Now turning to the quarter. We've gotten off to a solid start, booking $0.56 per share for the first quarter of 2020 compared with $0.61 per share last year. We believe we can take actions that will allow us to weather the impact of COVID-19. And as a result, we are reaffirming our 2020 guidance. Brian will discuss the financial results in more detail.
At Xcel Energy, we're taking significant strides to help our customers and protect our employees, while continuing to deliver critical energy services. Some of our actions include we're committing to not disconnecting residential customer service and arranging payment plans if they're having difficulty paying their bills. In Minnesota, we are proposing to reduce our accrued fuel forecast by $25 million to give immediate relief to our customers. We stepped up our charitable giving and are helping our communities during this time of need, and we are working closely with our regulators and state and local leadership to identifying constructive solutions to support our communities and customers. We're keeping our employees safe by implementing work-from-home policies, providing personal protection equipment and following CDC's social distancing guidelines and enhancing cleaning practices, conducting temperature checks at critical facilities, segregating crews and staggering work times.
To ensure continued reliability, we've implemented business continuity plans, which allows us to prioritize work and are prepared to sequester critical employees on-site, if necessary.
From a financial standpoint, we've enhanced our liquidity and developed contingency plans to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. Finally, we expect to be part of the solution to help get the economy back on its feet by continuing to invest in our communities through our capital expenditure programs that create jobs and drive demand for equipment and supplies.
While this is a fluid situation with considerable uncertainty, Xcel Energy has always shown a remarkable dedication to serving our customers during difficult times, and this set of challenges is no exception.
Moving on to business developments. We recently announced the opportunistic sale of the Mankato natural gas plant for $680 million. You'll recall, we originally proposed this acquisition as a fully-regulated asset. However, when the Minnesota Commission rejected this proposal, we acquired Mankato as a nonregulated asset and stepped into the power purchase agreement. While we thought Mankato would provide significant long-term value, especially as we shut down coal assets, we heard from several investors that having a nonregulated asset cloud at the Xcel Energy story. As a result, when several potential buyers expressed interest in acquiring the plant, we decided to sell it and preserve our status as one of the very few fully-regulated pure-play utilities. And since the earnings were back-end loaded, we don't expect the sale to materially impact our earnings projections. And while it was not part of the rationale for the sale, the transaction will improve our liquidity in these uncertain times. We will use the proceeds to reduce funding needs and improve our credit metrics.
In addition, we will book a gain which we will use to fund charitable-giving efforts, including supporting COVID-19 relief efforts throughout our communities.
Finally, we recently announced some important promotions as part of our succession plan. Bob Frenzel was named President and Chief Operating Officer, and Brian Van Abel was named Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bob has been our CFO for the past 4 years and has extensive experience in the industry prior to joining Xcel Energy, while Brian has had increasing roles in finance, including treasurer, financial planning and analysis and corporate development. Both Bob and Brian are extremely intelligent and talented employees who have been instrumental in developing and executing our strategy and delivering our consistently strong financial results. And while I don't plan to retire anytime soon, these promotions reflect the deep bench strength and thoughtful planning we have at Xcel Energy.
So with that, let me turn the call over to Brian, who will provide more detail on our financial results and outlook, along with our actions to mitigate coronavirus impacts. Brian?"

We achieved solid results, recording $0.56 per share for the first quarter of 2020 compared to $0.61 per share last year. Majority of the quarterly deviation is driven by weather. We experienced a warmer-than-norma",1572,"Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. We achieved solid results, recording $0.56 per share for the first quarter of 2020 compared to $0.61 per share last year. Majority of the quarterly deviation is driven by weather. We experienced a warmer-than-normal winter weather this year compared with cooler-than-normal weather last year, which results in a $0.04 per share unfavorable comparison. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter include lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.03 per share. Our lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.03 per share. However, majority of the lower ETRs is due to an increase in production tax credits which flow back to customers through electric margin and tax reform impacts, both of which are largely earnings neutral.
Offsetting these positive drivers were lower margins due largely to unfavorable weather, which reduced earnings by $0.03 per share and which offset rises in regulatory outcomes. Increased depreciation and interest expense, reflecting our capital investment program, reduced earnings by $0.05 per share, and the other items combined decreased earnings by $0.03 per share.
Next, I want to discuss the potential impact of COVID-19 and the actions we are taking to mitigate a range of outcomes. Starting with sales, our first quarter weather and leap year adjusted electric sales declined by 1.1%, while natural gas sales increased by 0.4%. The coronavirus crisis had a minor impact on first quarter sales. The economic shutdown started in mid-March, so we did not experience the full monthly impact. For March, our total residential sales increased slightly, while C&I sales declined 4%, resulting in a total retail electric sales decline of 3% on a weather-adjusted basis.
However, a better reference point on the monthly COVID-19 impact is what we saw in our preliminary April numbers in which almost all of our states were under relatively strict shelter-in-place orders. Residential sales increased 3.2%, while C&I sales declined 13.7%, and total retail electric sales declined 9.6% on a weather-adjusted basis. And keep in mind, we have a sales true-up mechanism for all electric classes in Minnesota and decoupling for the electric residential and non-demand small C&I classes in Colorado. This covers about 45% of our total retail electric sales.
And to help us for recovery in the third quarter, this results in a sales decline of approximately 2% compared to 2019. Our base case and the case in which we are reaffirming our earnings guidance around assumes a severe impact to the second quarter with a slower U-type shaped recovery with lingering effects for the rest of 2020. This results in a sales decline of approximately 4% on a year-over-year basis. 
And lastly, the severe scenario assumes a severe impact that will last through the third quarter, followed by a protracted L-type shaped recovery. This is a challenging scenario with a deeper and longer bottom in our base case, resulting in a sales decline of approximately 8% for the year. We use these scenarios as we develop our contingency plans. We view the models in severe case scenarios as having a low probability of occurring. We think the base case scenario is the most-likely outcome. Where we slip in the band around the sales impact we've outlined, we have incorporated the base case into our guidance assumptions.
There is considerable uncertainty on what will actually occur, particularly the duration of the downturn and the lingering effects, which
[Audio Gap] 
we feel confident in our ability to mitigate what we view as the most likely scenario, and the April sales results came in slightly better than our forecast, giving us greater confidence.
We're also closely monitoring our bad debt expense and working with our customers on payment plans if they're having difficulty paying their bills. While it is difficult to project where we'll land, bad debt expense increased to approximately $20 million in the 2008 to 2009 time period as a reference point.
Additionally, our commissions in Wisconsin, Texas and Michigan have issued orders to track and defer pandemic-related expenses. We have also filed for deferred accounting treatment of incremental COVID-19-related expenses, including bad debt in Minnesota, Colorado, New Mexico, North Dakota and South Dakota.
We are implementing contingency plans to reduce our overall cost structure and mitigate the impact of COVID-19. Some of these actions include cost reductions related to employee expenses, consulting, variable compensation, deferral of certain work activities and the implementation of a hiring freeze. Based on our contingency plans, we now expect annual O&M expenses will decline 4% to 5% in 2020, which would offset the impacts of COVID-19 in the base scenario.
We also have plans in place to ensure that we can implement additional contingency plans if the negative impact of COVID-19 exceed our base case scenario. However, there are limitations to what we can offset. We will focus on providing strong customer service and reliability, and we will not make short-term decisions that have a negative long-term impact on our customers or shareholders.
Turning to Supply chain. The situation is fluid, but we have not had any material impacts to our supply chain with the exception of our wind farms. In mid-April, we were informed of supply chain disruptions, which will likely result in delays in the completion of 2 of our wind farms into 2021. We're monitoring the situation closely and is striving to complete the projects this year. However, we have fully documented our activities since 2016, and we have maintained continuous efforts since then, so we are confident these wind farms will qualify for 100% PTC benefit, even if they're completed in 2021.
And the last topic I want to cover on COVID-19 is liquidity. We're in a very strong position after enhancing liquidity in March by entering into a $700 million term loan at attractive terms, and we issued a $600 million 10-year holding company bond. We now have available liquidity of approximately $3.1 billion.
In addition, the sales proceeds from the Mankato plant will increase liquidity by approximately $650 million. And finally, we issued an equity forward last year, which we expect to settle later this year and will provide another approximately $740 million in cash. In total, this will provide liquidity of nearly $4.5 billion.
We also plan to issue $1.9 billion of operating company debt throughout the year. As a result of our enhanced liquidity, we have the flexibility on issuance timing to ensure that capital markets are accessible at attractive terms. For more detail on liquidity, please see our earnings release.
Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. We have 3 rate cases pending, and the coronavirus has not resulted in any material delays in regulatory proceedings. In New Mexico, we reached a constructive unanimous settlement that reflects a rate increase of approximately $31 million, an ROE of 9.45%, an equity ratio of 54.8% and acceleration of depreciation on the Tolk coal plant to reflect an earlier retirement. We are awaiting a hearing examiner recommendation and commission decision. 
In Texas, SPS and intervening parties have reached an unopposed constructive settlement agreement in principle. We are working with parties to document and file the settlement, which we expect to occur shortly. We anticipate a commission decision in the third quarter.
In February 2020, we filed a natural gas case in Colorado, seeking a net rate increase of $127 million based on an ROE of 9.95% and an equity ratio of 55.8%. It is fairly early in the process, so there's not much to report, but the procedural schedule has been set with new rates expected to become effective in November based on statutory requirements.
In terms of earnings, there is considerable uncertainty around the coronavirus impacts. Therefore, we have implemented contingency plans to manage our cost structure and made regulatory filings that will help to offset the impact of COVID-19. As a result, we still expect to deliver 2020 earnings within our original guidance range of $2.73 to $2.83 per share based on our base case scenario, which we think is the most likely scenario. In addition, we can implement additional O&M contingency plans if the COVID-19 impacts exceed the base case. However, there are limitations to what we can offset, as we balance the short term and long term for both our customers and investors. Our contingency plans would not offset the severe scenario, which would likely result in earnings below our guidance range, but we feel the severe scenario has a low probability of occurring.
With that, I will wrap up. We have implemented steps to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. We sold the Mankato facility for a modest gain. We increased our dividend 6.2%. We reached constructive rate case settlements in New Mexico and Texas. We remained committed to delivering on our 2020 guidance and our long-term earnings and dividend growth within our 5% to 7% objective range. We continued to provide reliable energy service to our customers, while ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and communities.
Despite the near-term economic challenges, we are executing our strategy extremely well, and we remain positive about the opportunities in front of us for the benefit of our customers, communities and shareholders. 
And finally, we believe we can help rejuvenate our local economies and work with our regulators and state leadership to help our communities and customers recover from the crisis. We're looking forward to being part of the solution.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions."

On the negative side, I guess, we have demand uncertainty from COVID. In Texas, we had uncertainty around the status of the energy sector overall.

I think the element -- the other element, too, Stephen, which makes me bullish is that -- and this is where I think we can partner with our states and our commissions and state administrations to be part of the solution and getting people back to work, and that's potentially accelerating some of our capital opportunities and using that to bring on more renewables at a great price point that actually helps save customers money and employees' jobs, good jobs.

All the Mankato does is really it's an infusion of cash of $650 million and provide some additional headroom on capital investment, if we have an opportunity to potentially accelerate investments and really help our communities and customers and the regulators accelerate some of this rebound from this crisis. So I think it gives us just some additional capital headroom.
As we think about longer term, we think about our 5-year plans, we'll reevaluate that and overall financing plans as we get to Q3 and lay out a new 5-year capital plan."

We had a strong quarter, booking earnings of $0.54 per share for the second quarter of 2020 compared with $0.46 per share last year. Our year-to-date earnings are on track with our financial plan, and we are mitigating the impact of COVID-19. As a result, we are reaffirming our 2020 guidance. 
We continue to help our customers and protect our employees during the pandemic. We're stepping up our charitable giving to help our communities. Our business continuity plans have been executed extremely well. We're keeping employees safe while providing reliable service to our customers, and we're helping to restart the economy through our capital investment programs that create jobs in our communities. 
Earlier this year, the Minnesota Commission opened a Relief and Recovery Docket and inviting utilities in the state to submit potential projects that would create jobs and help jump-start the economy. In June, we filed a plan that proposes $3 billion of capital investment. This includes approximately $1.8 billion of incremental CapEx for wind repowering, a 460-megawatt solar facility, band at EV infrastructure and about $1.2 billion of accelerated transmission, distribution and natural gas investments. 
We recently announced a solicitation for repowering of wind projects that are either owned by Xcel Energy or under PPAs. We estimate 800 to 1,000 megawatts of potential repowering projects and expect to make a commission recommendation by year-end. 
We're also proposing options to mitigate customer bills. Overall, feedback has been very positive, and we look forward to working through the process with the commission. 
Now as you might have heard, the U.S. Treasury recently announced a 1-year extension of the safe harbor for renewable projects. Wind projects that began construction in 2016 now have until the end of 2021 to complete construction and receive PTCs at the 100% level. While we were confident that our projects would qualify for 100% PTC level regardless of this change, the extension assures benefit for our customers should any projects slip into 2021. 
Importantly, this change also presents the opportunity to move to quota range from the originally planned 80% PTC level to 100% PTC level. While this will not impact earnings, it will significantly reduce costs, which is a great outcome for our customers. 
Advancing our strategic priority of leading the clean energy transition, we and our co-owners recently announced the early retirement of the second coal unit at Craig. While we only have a small ownership stake in Craig, we are to help drive the early retirement of another coal unit. 
We're also making significant strides to improve ESG transparency and disclosure. We recently issued our TCFD report and risk assessment, which describes the resilience of our climate strategy using different scenarios. The addition of this report enhance our disclosures and results in a full TCFD compliance for Xcel Energy. 
Another strategic priority is to keep our customer bills low. As a result, it was very satisfying to see that SBS' electric rates in Texas and New Mexico were the lowest in the country for 2019, as recently reported by S&P Global, providing strong customer service and reliability at an attractive price is a hallmark of Xcel Energy. And we're very proud of this recognition. 
We're also excited that after 10 years, we've reached a settlement agreement with Boulder, that will result in a new franchise agreement and also a partnership to explore grid side options to meet our carbon goals. The approval process for this settlement will include a vote by City Council in August, a ballot referendum and vote by the people of Boulder in November. If approved, the franchise will go into effect in January of 2021. 
Finally, I was recently elected Chairman of EEI. It will be an honor to lead the industry in such an important and challenging time, and I tend to focus on 3 areas. My first priority is the industry's ongoing COVID-19 response related to the workforce, customers and recovery from the pandemic. Second, I intend to focus on clean energy innovation. I'm asking EEI to develop federal and state policy proposals that will bring dispatchable 0 carbon technologies into the marketplace to enable the industry to meet our long-term carbon goals. Finally, I've asked EEI to focus on what our industry can do to promote racial justice and increasing our commitment to advance diversity and inclusion. 
Like our country, our entire industry has been shaken by the death of George Floyd. Mr. Floyd died only a few miles from our corporate headquarters, and Minneapolis was the first city to experience widespread protest and rioting. I think as society, we have a lot of work to do. We need to look hard at ourselves, our unconscious biases and our business practices. They have some hard questions about how we can improve our diversity. I'm confident that Xcel Energy can play a leadership role in driving positive change for our country and our communities. 
So with that, let me turn the call over to Brian, who will provide more detail on our financial results and our outlook. Brian?"

We had a strong quarter, booking $0.54 per share for the second quarter of 2020 compared with $0.46 per share last year. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter include the following: lower O&M expe",1059,"Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong quarter, booking $0.54 per share for the second quarter of 2020 compared with $0.46 per share last year. 
The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter include the following: lower O&M expenses, primarily driven by our cost management efforts, increased earnings by $0.05 per share; higher electric margins increased earnings by $0.02 per share, which reflects rises and rate increases that offset the negative $0.07 per share impact from declining sales largely due to COVID-19; higher APDC equity increased earnings by $0.03 per share; and finally, our lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.07 per share. 
However, the majority of the lower ETR is due to an increase in production tax credits, which flow back to customers through electric margin and is largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation and interest expense, reflecting our capital investment program and other items, which combined rose earnings by $0.09 per share. 
Next, I want to discuss the status of COVID-19 impacts our mitigation efforts. As expected, COVID-19 had a major impact on second quarter sales. Our second quarter weather-adjusted electric sales declined by 7.1%. However, these impacts are better than projected in our base case scenario, which is embedded in our guidance assumptions. 
On a weather-adjusted basis, April retail electric sales declined 9.6%. May showed improvements as retail electric sales declined 6.7%, and June showed further improvement as retail electric sales declined 4.7%. This monthly trend reflects the economic shutdown that started in mid-March and the gradual opening up of the economy in May and June. 
As a reminder, we have a sales true-up mechanism for all electric classes in Minnesota and decoupling for the electric residential and non-demand small C&I classes in Colorado. This covers about 45% of our total retail electric sales. 
In second quarter, sales came in better than projected in our base case scenario. We have additional cushion should an economic relapse occur the recovery falter. Conversely, if sales continue to come in better than expected, we'll adjust our contingency plans accordingly. 
We're also closely monitoring bad debt expense and working with customers on payment plans. While it is difficult to project where we'll end, bad debt expense increased approximately $25 million in the 2008-2009 time period as a reference point. Our commissions in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Texas, New Mexico and Michigan, have issued orders to differ pandemic-related expenses. We also reached a settlement in Colorado with the staff and OCC that would allow us to defer COVID-19 related bad debt expense pending a commission decision.  Finally, our filings in North Dakota and South Dakota remain under commission review. 
We've also made strong progress in our efforts to reduce O&M costs to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19. Based on our contingency plans, we expect annual O&M expenses will decline 4% to 5% in 2020, which would offset COVID-19 impacts in the base case scenario. We're also prepared to implement additional contingency plans, if the impact exceed our base case scenario. But as we've discussed in the first quarter, there are limitations to what we can offset. We remain focused on providing strong customer service and reliability and will not make short-term decisions that have a negative long-term impact on our customers or shareholders. 
The last COVID-19 topic I want cover is liquidity. We finished our planned debt issuances for the year, and we were able to access the capital markets on strong terms and issue bonds at record local bonds. We also closed on the sale of the Mankato Energy Center, which provided approximately $650 million of cash proceeds after carving out the gain for charitable contributions. As a result, we now have available liquidity of approximately $4.5 billion. And finally, we issued an equity forward last year, which we expect to settle later this year, bringing our total liquidity to approximately $5.2 billion. 
Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. In New Mexico, the commission approved our constructive settlement that reflects a rate increase of $31 million, a ROE of 9.45%, an equity ratio of 54.8% and accelerated depreciation of the coal plant to reflect an earlier retirements. 
In Texas, we reached a constructive unopposed black box settlement, which reflects a grade increase of $88 million, ROE of 9.45% and an equity ratio of 54.6% for AFUDC purposes, an acceleration of the depreciation life of the coal time. We anticipate a commission decision in the third quarter.  
And in July, we also reached a constructive settlement in our Colorado natural gas rate case, which reflects a net rate increase of $77 million, a ROE of 9.2%, an equity ratio of 55.6% and  the historic test year was an adjustment for the tungsten the black project. We anticipate a commission decision later this year. 
On our last call, we discussed our preference to avoid rate cases impossible, especially in light of COVID-19. So we recently filed for rider recovery of our wildfire and advanced grid investments in Colorado instead of filing a comprehensive rate case. The riders will cover 2021 through 2025 and provide regulatory flexibility. 
And as part of our Minnesota release and recovery filing, we expressed our interest in seeking an alternative path to avoid a rate case filing this year. We think this will be a constructive outcome for all parties, who had initial discussions and we'll keep you posted. 
With that, I'll wrap up. We are effectively mitigating COVID-19 impacts. We continue to provide reliable energy service to our customers while ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and communities. We reached constructive settlements in our Texas and Colorado rate cases. We avoided an electric rate case in Colorado by filing the wildfire and advanced riders. We filed our relief and recovery proposal in Minnesota, which will create jobs, help rejuvenate our local economies and result in significant customer benefits. We announced the early retirement of another coal plant and achieved TCFD full compliance. We reached a settlement with that should end their municipalization efforts. We are reaffirming our 2020 guidance range of $2.73 to $2.83 per share based on our solid year-to-date results and progress and contingency plans. And finally, we remain committed to delivering long-term earnings and dividend growth within our 5% to 7% objective range. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions."

If you look at results down there then kind of bottom out in May, and we've seen improvements relative, still below about 5% from what it was pre-COVID levels, but good to see the C&I improvement there. We're also watching Colorado C&I. If you look at our earnings release in our presentation, you can see that the C&I sales from May to June, didn't improve as much as they did from April to May. So that's something we're focusing on in Q3, but we are seeing positive trend there. In the residential, I think we're still continuing to see the strength that we saw in Q2. So overall positive trends going into Q3. But if you look at our base scenario, we did have significant improvement from the depths in Q2 to Q3. So some are watching closely."

You were a little broke up there, but let me try and address the question, which I think is, how do you think strategically about rate cases and in the context of the pandemic and longer term? Is this sort of my takeaway? And we have a lot of rider mechanisms in our various states, and we're making billions of dollars of investments on behalf of our customers and infrastructure around clean energy transition and grid modernization. And we also have to keep the utility financially healthy. So that's the backdrop that we work with. We are obviously working with our regulators right now on mechanisms by which we wouldn't need to file rate cases, and we're actively engaged in conversations with stakeholders in Minnesota. In Colorado, I think, you saw us settle our gas case and then file a couple of riders, which we think would allow us to stay out of our electric case in Colorado. And that's a bit of the strategy is to continue to invest in areas that have real-time and rider recovery. You've seen us execute on decoupling and sales through mechanisms in our businesses, and that's helpful as well. And so strategically, I think you're in the right place is we're always going to look for mechanisms by which we can mitigate our cost structure, keep our bills low for our customers while we keep continuing to invest in the infrastructure that we need to. So we'll continue to be creative there and partner with our commissions. And the goal would be to not go into rate cases, if we could avoid them, but we have to keep the utility financially healthy. And so we balance all of that."

Booking earnings of $0.54 per share for the second quarter of 2020 compared with $0.46 per share last year. Our year-to-date earnings are on track with our financial plan, and we are mitigating the impact of COVID-19. As a result, we are reaffirming our 2020 guidance. We continue to help our customers and protect our employees during the pandemic. We're stepping up our charitable giving to help our communities. Our business continuity plans have been executed extremely well. We're keeping employees safe while providing reliable service to our customers, and we're helping to restart the economy through our capital investment programs that create jobs in our communities.
Earlier this year, the Minnesota Commission opened a relief and recovery docket and inviting utilities in the state to submit potential projects that would create jobs and help jump-start the economy. In June, we filed a plan that proposes $3 billion of capital investment. This includes approximately $1.8 billion of incremental CapEx for wind repowering, a 460-megawatt solar facility, [ band ] 540 at EV infrastructure and about $1.2 billion of accelerated transmission, distribution and natural gas investments. We recently announced a solicitation for repowering of wind projects that are either owned by Xcel Energy or under PPAs. We estimate 800 to 1,000 megawatts of potential repowering projects and expect to make a commission recommendation by year-end. We're also proposing options to mitigate customer bills. Overall, feedback has been very positive, and we look forward to working through the process with the commission. Now as you might have heard, the U.S. Treasury recently announced a 1-year extension of the safe harbor for renewable projects. Wind projects that began construction in 2016 now have until the end of 2021 to complete construction and receive PTCs at the 100% level. While we were confident that our projects would qualify for 100% PTC level regardless of this change, the extension assures us benefit for our customers should any projects slip into 2021. Importantly, this change also presents the opportunity to move to quota range from the originally planned 80% PTC level to 100% PTC level. While this will not impact earnings, it will significantly reduce costs, which is a great outcome for our customers.
Advancing our strategic priority of leading the clean energy transition, we and our co-owners recently announced the early retirement of the second coal unit at Craig. While we only have a small ownership stake in Craig, we are proud to help drive the early retirement of another coal unit. We're also making significant strides to improve ESG transparency and disclosure, we recently issued our TCFD report and risk assessment, which describes the resilience of our climate strategy using different scenarios. The addition of this report enhance our disclosures and results in a full TCFD compliance for Xcel Energy.
Another strategic priority is to keep our customer bills low. As a result, it was very satisfying to see that SPS' electric rates in Texas and New Mexico were the lowest in the country for 2019, as recently reported by S&P Global. Providing strong customer service and reliability at an attractive price is a hallmark of Xcel Energy and we're very proud of this recognition. We're also excited that after 10 years, we've reached a settlement agreement with Boulder, that will result in a new franchise agreement and also a partnership to explore grid side options to meet our carbon goals. The approval process for this settlement will include a vote by City Council in August, a ballot referendum and vote by the people of Boulder in November. If approved, the franchise will go into effect in January of 2021.
Finally, I was recently elected Chairman of EEI. It'll be an honor to lead the industry in such an important and challenging time, and I tend to focus on 3 areas. My first priority is the industry's ongoing COVID-19 response related to the workforce, customers and recovery from the pandemic. Second, I intend to focus on clean energy innovation. I'm asking EEI to develop federal and state policy proposals that will bring dispatchable 0 carbon technologies into the marketplace to enable the industry to meet our long-term carbon goals. Finally, I've asked EEI to focus on what our industry can do to promote racial justice and increasing our commitment to advance diversity and inclusion. Like our country, our entire industry has been shaken by the death of George Floyd. Mr. Floyd died only a few miles from our corporate headquarters, and Minneapolis was the first city to experience widespread protest and rioting. I think as society, we have a lot of work to do. We need to look hard at ourselves, our unconscious biases and our business practices. They have some hard questions about how we can improve our diversity. I'm confident that Xcel Energy can play a leadership role in driving positive change for our country and our communities.
So with that, let me turn the call over to Brian, who will provide more detail on our financial results and our outlook. Brian?"

We had a strong quarter, booking $0.54 per share for the second quarter of 2020 compared with $0.46 per share last year. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter include the following: lower O&M expens",1068,"Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong quarter, booking $0.54 per share for the second quarter of 2020 compared with $0.46 per share last year. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter include the following: lower O&M expenses, primarily driven by our cost management efforts, increased earnings by $0.05 per share; higher electric margins increased earnings by $0.02 per share, which reflects rises in rate increases that offset the negative $0.07 per share impact from declining sales largely due to COVID-19; higher AFUDC equity increased earnings by $0.03 per share; and finally, our lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.07 per share. However, the majority of the lower ETR is due to an increase in production tax credits, which flow back to customers through electric margin and is largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation and interest expense, reflecting our capital investment program and other items, which combined reduced earnings by $0.09 per share.
Next, I want to discuss the status of COVID-19 impacts and our mitigation efforts. As expected, COVID-19 had a major impact on second quarter sales. Our second quarter weather-adjusted electric sales declined by 7.1%. However, these impacts are better than projected in our base case scenario, which is embedded in our guidance assumptions. On a weather-adjusted basis, April retail electric sales declined 9.6%. May showed improvements as retail electric sales declined 6.7%. And June showed further improvement as retail electric sales declined 4.7%. This monthly trend reflects the economic shutdown that started in mid-March and the gradual opening up of the economy in May and June. As a reminder, we have a sales true-up mechanism for all electric classes in Minnesota and decoupling for the electric residential and non-demand small C&I classes in Colorado. This covers about 45% of our total retail electric sales. In second quarter, sales came in better than projected in our base case scenario. We have additional cushion should an economic relapse occur or the recovery falter. Conversely, if sales continue to come in better than expected, we'll adjust our contingency plans accordingly.
We're also closely monitoring bad debt expense and working with customers on payment plans. While it is difficult to project where we'll end, bad debt expense increased approximately $25 million in the 2008-2009 time period as a reference point. Our commissions in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Texas, New Mexico and Michigan have issued orders to differ pandemic-related expenses. We also reached a settlement in Colorado with the staff and OCC that would allow us to defer COVID-19 related bad debt expense pending a commission decision. Finally, our filings in North Dakota and South Dakota remain under commission review. We've also made strong progress in our efforts to reduce O&M costs to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19. Based on our contingency plans, we expect annual O&M expenses will decline 4% to 5% in 2020, which would offset COVID-19 impacts in the base case scenario. We're also prepared to implement additional contingency plans if the impact exceed our base case scenario. But as we've discussed in the first quarter, there are limitations to what we can offset. We remain focused on providing strong customer service and reliability and will not make short-term decisions that have a negative long-term impact on our customers or shareholders. The last COVID-19 topic I want cover is liquidity. We finished our planned debt issuances for the year, and we were able to access the capital markets on strong terms and issue bonds at record local bonds. We also closed on the sale of the Mankato energy center, which provided approximately $650 million of cash proceeds after carving out the gain for charitable contributions. As a result, we now have available liquidity of approximately $4.5 billion. And finally, we issued an equity forward last year, which we expect to settle later this year, bringing our total liquidity to approximately $5.2 billion.
Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. In New Mexico, the commission approved our constructive settlement that reflects a rate increase of $31 million, a ROE of 9.45%, an equity ratio of 54.8% and accelerated depreciation of the coal plant to reflect an earlier retirement. In Texas, we reached a constructive unopposed black box settlement, which reflects an electric rate increase of $88 million, a ROE of 9.45% and an equity ratio of 54.6% for AFUDC purposes, an acceleration of the depreciation life of the Tolk coal plant. We anticipate a commission decision in the third quarter. And in July, we also reached a constructive settlement in our Colorado natural gas rate case, which reflects a net rate increase of $77 million, a ROE of 9.2%, an equity ratio of 55.6% and a historic test year of an adjustment for the Tungsten to Black Hawk project. We anticipate a commission decision later this year. On our last call, we discussed our preference to avoid rate case is impossible, especially in light of COVID-19. So we recently filed for rider recovery of our wildfire and advanced grid investments in Colorado instead of filing a comprehensive rate case. The riders will cover 2021 through 2025 and provide regulatory flexibility. And as part of our Minnesota release and recovery filing, we expressed our interest in seeking an alternative path to avoid a rate case filing this year. We think this will be a constructive outcome for all parties, we've had initial discussions and we'll keep you posted.
With that, I'll wrap up. We are effectively mitigating COVID-19 impacts. We continue to provide reliable energy service to our customers while ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and communities. We reached constructive settlements in our Texas and Colorado rate cases. We avoided an electric rate case in Colorado by filing for wildfire and advanced grid riders. We filed our relief and recovery proposal in Minnesota, which will create jobs, help rejuvenate our local economies and result in significant customer benefits. We announced the early retirement of another coal plant and achieved TCFD full compliance. We reached a settlement with Boulder that should end their municipalization efforts. We are reaffirming our 2020 guidance range of $2.73 to $2.83 per share based on our solid year-to-date results and progress and contingency plans. And finally, we remain committed to delivering long-term earnings and dividend growth within our 5% to 7% objective range.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions."

If you look at results down, they kind of bottom out in May, and we've seen improvements relative, still below, about 5% from where it was pre-COVID levels, but good to see the C&I improvement there. We're also watching Colorado C&I. If you look at our earnings release in our presentation, you can see that the C&I sales from May to June didn't improve as much as they did from April to May.

As far as relief and recovery goes, what we've done in Minnesota, we believe, has been relatively unique for the country. But we're certainly open to the ideas and trying to partner in other jurisdictions. I'll give a lot of credit to the administration and the commission and the department in Minnesota for their leadership and their partnership with us on the R&R plan and getting utilities in the state to step up and try and help our communities and our customers. And if we could find that kind of partnership, we are absolutely looking and willing to do that. If the pandemic continues or if we see some resurgence, there may be more opportunities down the road for us on something similar in other jurisdictions. I wouldn't rule it out."

Good to hear your voice. You were a little broke up there, but let me try and address the question, which I think is, how do you think strategically about rate cases in the context of the pandemic and longer term, is sort of my takeaway. And we have a lot of rider mechanisms in our various states and we're making billions of dollars of investments on behalf of our customers and infrastructure around clean energy transition and grid modernization. And we also have to keep the utility financially healthy. So that's the backdrop that we work with. We are obviously working with our regulators right now on mechanisms by which we wouldn't need to file rate cases, and we're actively engaged in conversations with stakeholders in Minnesota. In Colorado, I think, you saw us settle our gas case and then file a couple of riders, which we think would allow us to stay out of our electric case in Colorado. And that's a bit of the strategy is to continue to invest in areas that have real-time and rider recovery. You've seen us execute on decoupling in sales true-up mechanisms in our businesses, and that's helpful as well. And so strategically, I think you're in the right place as we're always going to look for mechanisms by which we can mitigate our cost structure, keep our bills low for our customers, that's why we keep -- continue to invest in the infrastructure that we need to. So we'll continue to be creative there and partner with our commissions. And the goal would be to not go into rate cases, if we could avoid them, but we have to keep the utility financially healthy.

Booking earnings of $0.54 per share for the second quarter of 2020 compared with $0.46 per share last year. Our year-to-date earnings are on track with our financial plan, and we are mitigating the impact of COVID-19. As a result, we are reaffirming our 2020 guidance. We continue to help our customers and protect our employees during the pandemic. We're stepping up our charitable giving to help our communities. Our business continuity plans have been executed extremely well. We're keeping employees safe while providing reliable service to our customers, and we're helping to restart the economy through our capital investment programs that create jobs in our communities.
Earlier this year, the Minnesota Commission opened a relief and recovery docket and inviting utilities in the state to submit potential projects that would create jobs and help jump-start the economy. In June, we filed a plan that proposes $3 billion of capital investment. This includes approximately $1.8 billion of incremental CapEx for wind repowering, a 460-megawatt solar facility, [ band ] 540 at EV infrastructure and about $1.2 billion of accelerated transmission, distribution and natural gas investments. We recently announced a solicitation for repowering of wind projects that are either owned by Xcel Energy or under PPAs. We estimate 800 to 1,000 megawatts of potential repowering projects and expect to make a commission recommendation by year-end. We're also proposing options to mitigate customer bills. Overall, feedback has been very positive, and we look forward to working through the process with the commission. Now as you might have heard, the U.S. Treasury recently announced a 1-year extension of the safe harbor for renewable projects. Wind projects that began construction in 2016 now have until the end of 2021 to complete construction and receive PTCs at the 100% level. While we were confident that our projects would qualify for 100% PTC level regardless of this change, the extension assures us benefit for our customers should any projects slip into 2021. Importantly, this change also presents the opportunity to move to quota range from the originally planned 80% PTC level to 100% PTC level. While this will not impact earnings, it will significantly reduce costs, which is a great outcome for our customers.
Advancing our strategic priority of leading the clean energy transition, we and our co-owners recently announced the early retirement of the second coal unit at Craig. While we only have a small ownership stake in Craig, we are proud to help drive the early retirement of another coal unit. We're also making significant strides to improve ESG transparency and disclosure, we recently issued our TCFD report and risk assessment, which describes the resilience of our climate strategy using different scenarios. The addition of this report enhance our disclosures and results in a full TCFD compliance for Xcel Energy.
Another strategic priority is to keep our customer bills low. As a result, it was very satisfying to see that SPS' electric rates in Texas and New Mexico were the lowest in the country for 2019, as recently reported by S&P Global. Providing strong customer service and reliability at an attractive price is a hallmark of Xcel Energy and we're very proud of this recognition. We're also excited that after 10 years, we've reached a settlement agreement with Boulder, that will result in a new franchise agreement and also a partnership to explore grid side options to meet our carbon goals. The approval process for this settlement will include a vote by City Council in August, a ballot referendum and vote by the people of Boulder in November. If approved, the franchise will go into effect in January of 2021.
Finally, I was recently elected Chairman of EEI. It'll be an honor to lead the industry in such an important and challenging time, and I tend to focus on 3 areas. My first priority is the industry's ongoing COVID-19 response related to the workforce, customers and recovery from the pandemic. Second, I intend to focus on clean energy innovation. I'm asking EEI to develop federal and state policy proposals that will bring dispatchable 0 carbon technologies into the marketplace to enable the industry to meet our long-term carbon goals. Finally, I've asked EEI to focus on what our industry can do to promote racial justice and increasing our commitment to advance diversity and inclusion. Like our country, our entire industry has been shaken by the death of George Floyd. Mr. Floyd died only a few miles from our corporate headquarters, and Minneapolis was the first city to experience widespread protest and rioting. I think as society, we have a lot of work to do. We need to look hard at ourselves, our unconscious biases and our business practices. They have some hard questions about how we can improve our diversity. I'm confident that Xcel Energy can play a leadership role in driving positive change for our country and our communities.
So with that, let me turn the call over to Brian, who will provide more detail on our financial results and our outlook. Brian?"

The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter include the following: lower O&M expens",1068,"Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong quarter, booking $0.54 per share for the second quarter of 2020 compared with $0.46 per share last year. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter include the following: lower O&M expenses, primarily driven by our cost management efforts, increased earnings by $0.05 per share; higher electric margins increased earnings by $0.02 per share, which reflects rises in rate increases that offset the negative $0.07 per share impact from declining sales largely due to COVID-19; higher AFUDC equity increased earnings by $0.03 per share; and finally, our lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.07 per share. However, the majority of the lower ETR is due to an increase in production tax credits, which flow back to customers through electric margin and is largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation and interest expense, reflecting our capital investment program and other items, which combined reduced earnings by $0.09 per share.
Next, I want to discuss the status of COVID-19 impacts and our mitigation efforts. As expected, COVID-19 had a major impact on second quarter sales. Our second quarter weather-adjusted electric sales declined by 7.1%. However, these impacts are better than projected in our base case scenario, which is embedded in our guidance assumptions. On a weather-adjusted basis, April retail electric sales declined 9.6%. May showed improvements as retail electric sales declined 6.7%. And June showed further improvement as retail electric sales declined 4.7%. This monthly trend reflects the economic shutdown that started in mid-March and the gradual opening up of the economy in May and June. As a reminder, we have a sales true-up mechanism for all electric classes in Minnesota and decoupling for the electric residential and non-demand small C&I classes in Colorado. This covers about 45% of our total retail electric sales. In second quarter, sales came in better than projected in our base case scenario. We have additional cushion should an economic relapse occur or the recovery falter. Conversely, if sales continue to come in better than expected, we'll adjust our contingency plans accordingly.
We're also closely monitoring bad debt expense and working with customers on payment plans. While it is difficult to project where we'll end, bad debt expense increased approximately $25 million in the 2008-2009 time period as a reference point. Our commissions in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Texas, New Mexico and Michigan have issued orders to differ pandemic-related expenses. We also reached a settlement in Colorado with the staff and OCC that would allow us to defer COVID-19 related bad debt expense pending a commission decision. Finally, our filings in North Dakota and South Dakota remain under commission review. We've also made strong progress in our efforts to reduce O&M costs to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19. Based on our contingency plans, we expect annual O&M expenses will decline 4% to 5% in 2020, which would offset COVID-19 impacts in the base case scenario. We're also prepared to implement additional contingency plans if the impact exceed our base case scenario. But as we've discussed in the first quarter, there are limitations to what we can offset. We remain focused on providing strong customer service and reliability and will not make short-term decisions that have a negative long-term impact on our customers or shareholders. The last COVID-19 topic I want cover is liquidity. We finished our planned debt issuances for the year, and we were able to access the capital markets on strong terms and issue bonds at record local bonds. We also closed on the sale of the Mankato energy center, which provided approximately $650 million of cash proceeds after carving out the gain for charitable contributions. As a result, we now have available liquidity of approximately $4.5 billion. And finally, we issued an equity forward last year, which we expect to settle later this year, bringing our total liquidity to approximately $5.2 billion.
Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. In New Mexico, the commission approved our constructive settlement that reflects a rate increase of $31 million, a ROE of 9.45%, an equity ratio of 54.8% and accelerated depreciation of the coal plant to reflect an earlier retirement. In Texas, we reached a constructive unopposed black box settlement, which reflects an electric rate increase of $88 million, a ROE of 9.45% and an equity ratio of 54.6% for AFUDC purposes, an acceleration of the depreciation life of the Tolk coal plant. We anticipate a commission decision in the third quarter. And in July, we also reached a constructive settlement in our Colorado natural gas rate case, which reflects a net rate increase of $77 million, a ROE of 9.2%, an equity ratio of 55.6% and a historic test year of an adjustment for the Tungsten to Black Hawk project. We anticipate a commission decision later this year. On our last call, we discussed our preference to avoid rate case is impossible, especially in light of COVID-19. So we recently filed for rider recovery of our wildfire and advanced grid investments in Colorado instead of filing a comprehensive rate case. The riders will cover 2021 through 2025 and provide regulatory flexibility. And as part of our Minnesota release and recovery filing, we expressed our interest in seeking an alternative path to avoid a rate case filing this year. We think this will be a constructive outcome for all parties, we've had initial discussions and we'll keep you posted.
With that, I'll wrap up. We are effectively mitigating COVID-19 impacts. We continue to provide reliable energy service to our customers while ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and communities. We reached constructive settlements in our Texas and Colorado rate cases. We avoided an electric rate case in Colorado by filing for wildfire and advanced grid riders. We filed our relief and recovery proposal in Minnesota, which will create jobs, help rejuvenate our local economies and result in significant customer benefits. We announced the early retirement of another coal plant and achieved TCFD full compliance. We reached a settlement with Boulder that should end their municipalization efforts. We are reaffirming our 2020 guidance range of $2.73 to $2.83 per share based on our solid year-to-date results and progress and contingency plans. And finally, we remain committed to delivering long-term earnings and dividend growth within our 5% to 7% objective range.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions."

We're also watching Colorado C&I. If you look at our earnings release in our presentation, you can see that the C&I sales from May to June didn't improve as much as they did from April to May.

So executing, obviously, slightly ahead of plan when we look at what our plans were for Q2. So that puts us in a good position for the balance of the year. Obviously, if sales come in a little bit better, we can adjust those contingency plans for the year. And Ben said it well, the team has done a great job of developing and executing those plans for this year, and we've really turned our attention to what is sustainable in 2021 and beyond. But I think you got -- when you talk about regulatory flexibility and rate case sales, through also -- the other side of equation is we're -- everything we've learned over the past few months from the impact of COVID-19 is we're incorporating into our sales forecast for 2021 -- and incorporating revenue to our sales forecast for 2021.

Good to hear your voice. You were a little broke up there, but let me try and address the question, which I think is, how do you think strategically about rate cases in the context of the pandemic and longer term, is sort of my takeaway. And we have a lot of rider mechanisms in our various states and we're making billions of dollars of investments on behalf of our customers and infrastructure around clean energy transition and grid modernization. And we also have to keep the utility financially healthy. So that's the backdrop that we work with. We are obviously working with our regulators right now on mechanisms by which we wouldn't need to file rate cases, and we're actively engaged in conversations with stakeholders in Minnesota. In Colorado, I think, you saw us settle our gas case and then file a couple of riders, which we think would allow us to stay out of our electric case in Colorado. And that's a bit of the strategy is to continue to invest in areas that have real-time and rider recovery. You've seen us execute on decoupling in sales true-up mechanisms in our businesses, and that's helpful as well. And so strategically, I think you're in the right place as we're always going to look for mechanisms by which we can mitigate our cost structure, keep our bills low for our customers, that's why we keep -- continue to invest in the infrastructure that we need to. So we'll continue to be creative there and partner with our commissions. And the goal would be to not go into rate cases, if we could avoid them, but we have to keep the utility financially healthy. And so we balance all of that."

Booking earnings of $0.54 per share for the second quarter of 2020 compared with $0.46 per share last year. Our year-to-date earnings are on track with our financial plan, and we are mitigating the impact of COVID-19. As a result, we are reaffirming our 2020 guidance. We continue to help our customers and protect our employees during the pandemic. We're stepping up our charitable giving to help our communities. Our business continuity plans have been executed extremely well. We're keeping employees safe while providing reliable service to our customers, and we're helping to restart the economy through our capital investment programs that create jobs in our communities.
Earlier this year, the Minnesota Commission opened a relief and recovery docket and inviting utilities in the state to submit potential projects that would create jobs and help jump-start the economy. In June, we filed a plan that proposes $3 billion of capital investment. This includes approximately $1.8 billion of incremental CapEx for wind repowering, a 460-megawatt solar facility, [ band ] 540 at EV infrastructure and about $1.2 billion of accelerated transmission, distribution and natural gas investments. We recently announced a solicitation for repowering of wind projects that are either owned by Xcel Energy or under PPAs. We estimate 800 to 1,000 megawatts of potential repowering projects and expect to make a commission recommendation by year-end. We're also proposing options to mitigate customer bills. Overall, feedback has been very positive, and we look forward to working through the process with the commission. Now as you might have heard, the U.S. Treasury recently announced a 1-year extension of the safe harbor for renewable projects. Wind projects that began construction in 2016 now have until the end of 2021 to complete construction and receive PTCs at the 100% level. While we were confident that our projects would qualify for 100% PTC level regardless of this change, the extension assures us benefit for our customers should any projects slip into 2021. Importantly, this change also presents the opportunity to move to quota range from the originally planned 80% PTC level to 100% PTC level. While this will not impact earnings, it will significantly reduce costs, which is a great outcome for our customers.
Advancing our strategic priority of leading the clean energy transition, we and our co-owners recently announced the early retirement of the second coal unit at Craig. While we only have a small ownership stake in Craig, we are proud to help drive the early retirement of another coal unit. We're also making significant strides to improve ESG transparency and disclosure, we recently issued our TCFD report and risk assessment, which describes the resilience of our climate strategy using different scenarios. The addition of this report enhance our disclosures and results in a full TCFD compliance for Xcel Energy.
Another strategic priority is to keep our customer bills low. As a result, it was very satisfying to see that SPS' electric rates in Texas and New Mexico were the lowest in the country for 2019, as recently reported by S&P Global. Providing strong customer service and reliability at an attractive price is a hallmark of Xcel Energy and we're very proud of this recognition. We're also excited that after 10 years, we've reached a settlement agreement with Boulder, that will result in a new franchise agreement and also a partnership to explore grid side options to meet our carbon goals. The approval process for this settlement will include a vote by City Council in August, a ballot referendum and vote by the people of Boulder in November. If approved, the franchise will go into effect in January of 2021.
Finally, I was recently elected Chairman of EEI. It'll be an honor to lead the industry in such an important and challenging time, and I tend to focus on 3 areas. My first priority is the industry's ongoing COVID-19 response related to the workforce, customers and recovery from the pandemic. Second, I intend to focus on clean energy innovation. I'm asking EEI to develop federal and state policy proposals that will bring dispatchable 0 carbon technologies into the marketplace to enable the industry to meet our long-term carbon goals. Finally, I've asked EEI to focus on what our industry can do to promote racial justice and increasing our commitment to advance diversity and inclusion. Like our country, our entire industry has been shaken by the death of George Floyd. Mr. Floyd died only a few miles from our corporate headquarters, and Minneapolis was the first city to experience widespread protest and rioting. I think as society, we have a lot of work to do. We need to look hard at ourselves, our unconscious biases and our business practices. They have some hard questions about how we can improve our diversity. I'm confident that Xcel Energy can play a leadership role in driving positive change for our country and our communities.
So with that, let me turn the call over to Brian, who will provide more detail on our financial results and our outlook. Brian?"

We had a strong quarter, booking $0.54 per share for the second quarter of 2020 compared with $0.46 per share last year. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter include the following: lower O&M expenses, primarily driven by our cost management efforts, increased earnings by $0.05 per share; higher electric margins increased earnings by $0.02 per share, which reflects rises in rate increases that offset the negative $0.07 per share impact from declining sales largely due to COVID-19; higher AFUDC equity increased earnings by $0.03 per share; and finally, our lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.07 per share. However, the majority of the lower ETR is due to an increase in production tax credits, which flow back to customers through electric margin and is largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation and interest expense, reflecting our capital investment program and other items, which combined reduced earnings by $0.09 per share.
Next, I want to discuss the status of COVID-19 impacts and our mitigation efforts. As expected, COVID-19 had a major impact on second quarter sales. Our second quarter weather-adjusted electric sales declined by 7.1%. However, these impacts are better than projected in our base case scenario, which is embedded in our guidance assumptions. On a weather-adjusted basis, April retail electric sales declined 9.6%. May showed improvements as retail electric sales declined 6.7%. And June showed further improvement as retail electric sales declined 4.7%. This monthly trend reflects the economic shutdown that started in mid-March and the gradual opening up of the economy in May and June. As a reminder, we have a sales true-up mechanism for all electric classes in Minnesota and decoupling for the electric residential and non-demand small C&I classes in Colorado. This covers about 45% of our total retail electric sales. In second quarter, sales came in better than projected in our base case scenario. We have additional cushion should an economic relapse occur or the recovery falter. Conversely, if sales continue to come in better than expected, we'll adjust our contingency plans accordingly.
We're also closely monitoring bad debt expense and working with customers on payment plans. While it is difficult to project where we'll end, bad debt expense increased approximately $25 million in the 2008-2009 time period as a reference point. Our commissions in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Texas, New Mexico and Michigan have issued orders to differ pandemic-related expenses. We also reached a settlement in Colorado with the staff and OCC that would allow us to defer COVID-19 related bad debt expense pending a commission decision. Finally, our filings in North Dakota and South Dakota remain under commission review. We've also made strong progress in our efforts to reduce O&M costs to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19. Based on our contingency plans, we expect annual O&M expenses will decline 4% to 5% in 2020, which would offset COVID-19 impacts in the base case scenario. We're also prepared to implement additional contingency plans if the impact exceed our base case scenario. But as we've discussed in the first quarter, there are limitations to what we can offset. We remain focused on providing strong customer service and reliability and will not make short-term decisions that have a negative long-term impact on our customers or shareholders. The last COVID-19 topic I want cover is liquidity. We finished our planned debt issuances for the year, and we were able to access the capital markets on strong terms and issue bonds at record local bonds. We also closed on the sale of the Mankato energy center, which provided approximately $650 million of cash proceeds after carving out the gain for charitable contributions. As a result, we now have available liquidity of approximately $4.5 billion. And finally, we issued an equity forward last year, which we expect to settle later this year, bringing our total liquidity to approximately $5.2 billion.
Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. In New Mexico, the commission approved our constructive settlement that reflects a rate increase of $31 million, a ROE of 9.45%, an equity ratio of 54.8% and accelerated depreciation of the coal plant to reflect an earlier retirement. In Texas, we reached a constructive unopposed black box settlement, which reflects an electric rate increase of $88 million, a ROE of 9.45% and an equity ratio of 54.6% for AFUDC purposes, an acceleration of the depreciation life of the Tolk coal plant. We anticipate a commission decision in the third quarter. And in July, we also reached a constructive settlement in our Colorado natural gas rate case, which reflects a net rate increase of $77 million, a ROE of 9.2%, an equity ratio of 55.6% and a historic test year of an adjustment for the Tungsten to Black Hawk project. We anticipate a commission decision later this year. On our last call, we discussed our preference to avoid rate case is impossible, especially in light of COVID-19. So we recently filed for rider recovery of our wildfire and advanced grid investments in Colorado instead of filing a comprehensive rate case. The riders will cover 2021 through 2025 and provide regulatory flexibility. And as part of our Minnesota release and recovery filing, we expressed our interest in seeking an alternative path to avoid a rate case filing this year. We think this will be a constructive outcome for all parties, we've had initial discussions and we'll keep you posted.
With that, I'll wrap up. We are effectively mitigating COVID-19 impacts. We continue to provide reliable energy service to our customers while ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and communities. We reached constructive settlements in our Texas and Colorado rate cases. We avoided an electric rate case in Colorado by filing for wildfire and advanced grid riders. We filed our relief and recovery proposal in Minnesota, which will create jobs, help rejuvenate our local economies and result in significant customer benefits. We announced the early retirement of another coal plant and achieved TCFD full compliance. We reached a settlement with Boulder that should end their municipalization efforts. We are reaffirming our 2020 guidance range of $2.73 to $2.83 per share based on our solid year-to-date results and progress and contingency plans. And finally, we remain committed to delivering long-term earnings and dividend growth within our 5% to 7% objective range.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions."

We're also watching Colorado C&I. If you look at our earnings release in our presentation, you can see that the C&I sales from May to June didn't improve as much as they did from April to May.

I'm wondering if we think about more, I guess, payout rate since, obviously, your right decision, given the COVID situation. But if this continues to be the case and the COVID is kind of here to stay and it looks the economic consequences will be lingering for a while? Could we see a pivot in your overall strategy where you move away from periodic rate cases and kind of switch on a more permanent basis to alternative mechanisms and just kind of move away from the strategy of being a rate case [ filer to more of a paying outflow on the period for longer? ] So that's my question."

Good to hear your voice. You were a little broke up there, but let me try and address the question, which I think is, how do you think strategically about rate cases in the context of the pandemic and longer term, is sort of my takeaway. And we have a lot of rider mechanisms in our various states and we're making billions of dollars of investments on behalf of our customers and infrastructure around clean energy transition and grid modernization. And we also have to keep the utility financially healthy. So that's the backdrop that we work with. We are obviously working with our regulators right now on mechanisms by which we wouldn't need to file rate cases, and we're actively engaged in conversations with stakeholders in Minnesota. In Colorado, I think, you saw us settle our gas case and then file a couple of riders, which we think would allow us to stay out of our electric case in Colorado. And that's a bit of the strategy is to continue to invest in areas that have real-time and rider recovery. You've seen us execute on decoupling in sales true-up mechanisms in our businesses, and that's helpful as well. And so strategically, I think you're in the right place as we're always going to look for mechanisms by which we can mitigate our cost structure, keep our bills low for our customers, that's why we keep -- continue to invest in the infrastructure that we need to. So we'll continue to be creative there and partner with our commissions. And the goal would be to not go into rate cases, if we could avoid them, but we have to keep the utility financially healthy. And so we balance all of that."

As I report back on the past few months, my heart really goes out to the individuals and families impacted by the coronavirus, the devoted health care professionals so bravely serving our communities and the business communities and local businesses. I'm so pleased with how our employees and industry have responded during this unprecedented time, working to keep people safe, delivering reliable service to customers and providing support to those in need as we've done for over 100 years. I also want to thank our employees for their dedication, spirit and creativity in finding ways to support our communities and stimulate local economic growth.
Now turning to the quarter. We've gotten off to a solid start, booking $0.56 per share for the first quarter of 2020 compared with $0.61 per share last year. We believe we can take actions that will allow us to weather the impact of COVID-19. And as a result, we are reaffirming our 2020 guidance. Brian will discuss the financial results in more detail.
At Xcel Energy, we're taking significant strides to help our customers and protect our employees, while continuing to deliver critical energy services. Some of our actions include we're committing to not disconnecting residential customer service and arranging payment plans if they're having difficulty paying their bills. In Minnesota, we are proposing to reduce our accrued fuel forecast by $25 million to give immediate relief to our customers. We stepped up our charitable giving and are helping our communities during this time of need, and we are working closely with our regulators and state and local leadership to identifying constructive solutions to support our communities and customers. We're keeping our employees safe by implementing work-from-home policies, providing personal protection equipment and following CDC's social distancing guidelines and enhancing cleaning practices, conducting temperature checks at critical facilities, segregating crews and staggering work times.
To ensure continued reliability, we've implemented business continuity plans, which allows us to prioritize work and are prepared to sequester critical employees on-site, if necessary.
From a financial standpoint, we've enhanced our liquidity and developed contingency plans to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. Finally, we expect to be part of the solution to help get the economy back on its feet by continuing to invest in our communities through our capital expenditure programs that create jobs and drive demand for equipment and supplies.
While this is a fluid situation with considerable uncertainty, Xcel Energy has always shown a remarkable dedication to serving our customers during difficult times, and this set of challenges is no exception.
Moving on to business developments. We recently announced the opportunistic sale of the Mankato natural gas plant for $680 million. You'll recall, we originally proposed this acquisition as a fully-regulated asset. However, when the Minnesota Commission rejected this proposal, we acquired Mankato as a nonregulated asset and stepped into the power purchase agreement. While we thought Mankato would provide significant long-term value, especially as we shut down coal assets, we heard from several investors that having a nonregulated asset cloud at the Xcel Energy story. As a result, when several potential buyers expressed interest in acquiring the plant, we decided to sell it and preserve our status as one of the very few fully-regulated pure-play utilities. And since the earnings were back-end loaded, we don't expect the sale to materially impact our earnings projections. And while it was not part of the rationale for the sale, the transaction will improve our liquidity in these uncertain times. We will use the proceeds to reduce funding needs and improve our credit metrics.
In addition, we will book a gain which we will use to fund charitable-giving efforts, including supporting COVID-19 relief efforts throughout our communities.
Finally, we recently announced some important promotions as part of our succession plan. Bob Frenzel was named President and Chief Operating Officer, and Brian Van Abel was named Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bob has been our CFO for the past 4 years and has extensive experience in the industry prior to joining Xcel Energy, while Brian has had increasing roles in finance, including treasurer, financial planning and analysis and corporate development. Both Bob and Brian are extremely intelligent and talented employees who have been instrumental in developing and executing our strategy and delivering our consistently strong financial results. And while I don't plan to retire anytime soon, these promotions reflect the deep bench strength and thoughtful planning we have at Xcel Energy.
So with that, let me turn the call over to Brian, who will provide more detail on our financial results and outlook, along with our actions to mitigate coronavirus impacts. Brian?"
527542,662993737,2109656,"Xcel Energy Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 07, 2020",2020-05-07,"Earnings Calls","Xcel Energy Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. We achieved solid results, recording $0.56 per share for the first quarter of 2020 compared to $0.61 per share last year. Majority of the quarterly deviation is driven by weather. We experienced a warmer-than-norma",1572,"Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. We achieved solid results, recording $0.56 per share for the first quarter of 2020 compared to $0.61 per share last year. Majority of the quarterly deviation is driven by weather. We experienced a warmer-than-normal winter weather this year compared with cooler-than-normal weather last year, which results in a $0.04 per share unfavorable comparison. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter include lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.03 per share. Our lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.03 per share. However, majority of the lower ETRs is due to an increase in production tax credits which flow back to customers through electric margin and tax reform impacts, both of which are largely earnings neutral.
Offsetting these positive drivers were lower margins due largely to unfavorable weather, which reduced earnings by $0.03 per share and which offset rises in regulatory outcomes. Increased depreciation and interest expense, reflecting our capital investment program, reduced earnings by $0.05 per share, and the other items combined decreased earnings by $0.03 per share.
Next, I want to discuss the potential impact of COVID-19 and the actions we are taking to mitigate a range of outcomes. Starting with sales, our first quarter weather and leap year adjusted electric sales declined by 1.1%, while natural gas sales increased by 0.4%. The coronavirus crisis had a minor impact on first quarter sales. The economic shutdown started in mid-March, so we did not experience the full monthly impact. For March, our total residential sales increased slightly, while C&I sales declined 4%, resulting in a total retail electric sales decline of 3% on a weather-adjusted basis.
However, a better reference point on the monthly COVID-19 impact is what we saw in our preliminary April numbers in which almost all of our states were under relatively strict shelter-in-place orders. Residential sales increased 3.2%, while C&I sales declined 13.7%, and total retail electric sales declined 9.6% on a weather-adjusted basis. And keep in mind, we have a sales true-up mechanism for all electric classes in Minnesota and decoupling for the electric residential and non-demand small C&I classes in Colorado. This covers about 45% of our total retail electric sales.
And to help us for recovery in the third quarter, this results in a sales decline of approximately 2% compared to 2019. Our base case and the case in which we are reaffirming our earnings guidance around assumes a severe impact to the second quarter with a slower U-type shaped recovery with lingering effects for the rest of 2020. This results in a sales decline of approximately 4% on a year-over-year basis. 
And lastly, the severe scenario assumes a severe impact that will last through the third quarter, followed by a protracted L-type shaped recovery. This is a challenging scenario with a deeper and longer bottom in our base case, resulting in a sales decline of approximately 8% for the year. We use these scenarios as we develop our contingency plans. We view the models in severe case scenarios as having a low probability of occurring. We think the base case scenario is the most-likely outcome. Where we slip in the band around the sales impact we've outlined, we have incorporated the base case into our guidance assumptions.
There is considerable uncertainty on what will actually occur, particularly the duration of the downturn and the lingering effects, which
[Audio Gap] 
we feel confident in our ability to mitigate what we view as the most likely scenario, and the April sales results came in slightly better than our forecast, giving us greater confidence.
We're also closely monitoring our bad debt expense and working with our customers on payment plans if they're having difficulty paying their bills. While it is difficult to project where we'll land, bad debt expense increased to approximately $20 million in the 2008 to 2009 time period as a reference point.
Additionally, our commissions in Wisconsin, Texas and Michigan have issued orders to track and defer pandemic-related expenses. We have also filed for deferred accounting treatment of incremental COVID-19-related expenses, including bad debt in Minnesota, Colorado, New Mexico, North Dakota and South Dakota.
We are implementing contingency plans to reduce our overall cost structure and mitigate the impact of COVID-19. Some of these actions include cost reductions related to employee expenses, consulting, variable compensation, deferral of certain work activities and the implementation of a hiring freeze. Based on our contingency plans, we now expect annual O&M expenses will decline 4% to 5% in 2020, which would offset the impacts of COVID-19 in the base scenario.
We also have plans in place to ensure that we can implement additional contingency plans if the negative impact of COVID-19 exceed our base case scenario. However, there are limitations to what we can offset. We will focus on providing strong customer service and reliability, and we will not make short-term decisions that have a negative long-term impact on our customers or shareholders.
Turning to Supply chain. The situation is fluid, but we have not had any material impacts to our supply chain with the exception of our wind farms. In mid-April, we were informed of supply chain disruptions, which will likely result in delays in the completion of 2 of our wind farms into 2021. We're monitoring the situation closely and is striving to complete the projects this year. However, we have fully documented our activities since 2016, and we have maintained continuous efforts since then, so we are confident these wind farms will qualify for 100% PTC benefit, even if they're completed in 2021.
And the last topic I want to cover on COVID-19 is liquidity. We're in a very strong position after enhancing liquidity in March by entering into a $700 million term loan at attractive terms, and we issued a $600 million 10-year holding company bond. We now have available liquidity of approximately $3.1 billion.
In addition, the sales proceeds from the Mankato plant will increase liquidity by approximately $650 million. And finally, we issued an equity forward last year, which we expect to settle later this year and will provide another approximately $740 million in cash. In total, this will provide liquidity of nearly $4.5 billion.
We also plan to issue $1.9 billion of operating company debt throughout the year. As a result of our enhanced liquidity, we have the flexibility on issuance timing to ensure that capital markets are accessible at attractive terms. For more detail on liquidity, please see our earnings release.
Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. We have 3 rate cases pending, and the coronavirus has not resulted in any material delays in regulatory proceedings. In New Mexico, we reached a constructive unanimous settlement that reflects a rate increase of approximately $31 million, an ROE of 9.45%, an equity ratio of 54.8% and acceleration of depreciation on the Tolk coal plant to reflect an earlier retirement. We are awaiting a hearing examiner recommendation and commission decision. 
In Texas, SPS and intervening parties have reached an unopposed constructive settlement agreement in principle. We are working with parties to document and file the settlement, which we expect to occur shortly. We anticipate a commission decision in the third quarter.
In February 2020, we filed a natural gas case in Colorado, seeking a net rate increase of $127 million based on an ROE of 9.95% and an equity ratio of 55.8%. It is fairly early in the process, so there's not much to report, but the procedural schedule has been set with new rates expected to become effective in November based on statutory requirements.
In terms of earnings, there is considerable uncertainty around the coronavirus impacts. Therefore, we have implemented contingency plans to manage our cost structure and made regulatory filings that will help to offset the impact of COVID-19. As a result, we still expect to deliver 2020 earnings within our original guidance range of $2.73 to $2.83 per share based on our base case scenario, which we think is the most likely scenario. In addition, we can implement additional O&M contingency plans if the COVID-19 impacts exceed the base case. However, there are limitations to what we can offset, as we balance the short term and long term for both our customers and investors. Our contingency plans would not offset the severe scenario, which would likely result in earnings below our guidance range, but we feel the severe scenario has a low probability of occurring.
With that, I will wrap up. We have implemented steps to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. We sold the Mankato facility for a modest gain. We increased our dividend 6.2%. We reached constructive rate case settlements in New Mexico and Texas. We remained committed to delivering on our 2020 guidance and our long-term earnings and dividend growth within our 5% to 7% objective range. We continued to provide reliable energy service to our customers, while ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and communities.
Despite the near-term economic challenges, we are executing our strategy extremely well, and we remain positive about the opportunities in front of us for the benefit of our customers, communities and shareholders. 
And finally, we believe we can help rejuvenate our local economies and work with our regulators and state leadership to help our communities and customers recover from the crisis. We're looking forward to being part of the solution.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions."

On the negative side, I guess, we have demand uncertainty from COVID. In Texas, we had uncertainty around the status of the energy sector overall.

And I think the test of that was the ability to  get our renewables approved in Texas and New Mexico and basically on economic terms.
I think the element -- the other element, too, Stephen, which makes me bullish is that -- and this is where I think we can partner with our states and our commissions and state administrations to be part of the solution and getting people back to work, and that's potentially accelerating some of our capital opportunities and using that to bring on more renewables at a great price point that actually helps save customers money and employees' jobs, good jobs. So not unlike with -- when we had the Great Recession, I can tell you many times that we had people [ stopping ] -- people have typically worked in a labor union, and actually thank myself and really the company for continuing to go forward with projects because that was the only job in town.

We had another strong quarter, booking earnings of $1.14 per share for the third quarter of 2020 compared with $1.01 per share last year. Our year-to-date earnings are on track with our financial plan, an",1000,"Well, thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. We had another strong quarter, booking earnings of $1.14 per share for the third quarter of 2020 compared with $1.01 per share last year. Our year-to-date earnings are on track with our financial plan, and we are mitigating the impact of COVID-19. 
As a result, we are narrowing our 2020 guidance range to $2.75 to $2.81 per share. Now consistent with our third quarter tradition, we have provided our updated base investment plan which reflects $22.6 billion of capital expenditures over the next 5 years. This represents rate base growth of 6.3% off a 2020 base year. And this represents our base capital forecast. 
In addition, we've identified potential incremental CapEx of $1.4 billion associated with the Minnesota relief and recovery proposal, which, if approved, will drive rate base growth of 6.9%. We're also initiating 2021 guidance of $2.90 to $3 per share, which is consistent with our 5% to 7% long-term EPS growth objective. 
We're very excited about our plan, which provides significant customer value, keeps bills low and delivers attractive returns for our investors. We also continue to help our customers and protect our employees during this pandemic. 
We've stepped up charitable giving to help our communities, including donating the gain from the sale of our Mankato facility. For more details, see our slides. 
Our business continuity plans have been executed extremely well, including the completing of a refueling outage at our Prairie Island nuclear facility. We're keeping employees safe while providing customer service. And we're helping to restart the economy through our capital investment programs, which create jobs in our communities. 
Earlier this year, The Minnesota Commission opened a relief and recovery docket and inviting utilities to submit potential projects that will create jobs and jump-start the economy. 
In September, we fought a repowering proposal that includes 4 Xcel Energy wind farms of approximately 650 megawatts with $750 million of capital investment. In addition, the proposal includes 67 megawatts of repowered PPA extensions. 
The portfolio is projected to provide customer savings of over $160 million over the life of the assets. We've requested a commission decision on the wind proposal by year-end. We're also proposing 460 megawatts of solar facilities near our retiring Sherco coal plant to take advantage of the existing transmission. 
The project represents an estimated investment of $650 million. We plan to file our solar proposal in early 2021 and anticipated decision in mid-'21. 
We are confident the commission will see the customer benefits of these projects. We've continue to make progress on our PPA buyout strategy. In August, the Minnesota Commission approved our request to acquire the 99-megawatt wind farm after repowered. Maur is currently a PPA. 
In addition, we filed to buy out the Capco solar facility in Colorado. And while the $41 million investment is relatively small, the PPA is out of the money and the buyout will save our customers $38 million over the 11 years. 
I think this is another example of our keeping bills low priority. We continue to make strong progress on our wind development initiatives. In August, our 500-megawatt Cheyenne Ridge wind farm went into operation. Cheyenne Ridge was completed ahead of schedule and under budget. Since we began operations, we set a record with 70% of hourly load coming from wind generation in Colorado. 
We also reached an agreement to acquire a 74-megawatt solar facility in Wisconsin for approximately $100 million. We expect a commission decision later in 2021, and this will be our first universal scale solar rate base investment. I'm also excited to announce that Xcel Energy was recently awarded a $10 million DOE grant for an innovation pilot to produce carbon-free hydrogen at one of our nuclear power plants. 
We're partnering with the Idaho National Lab and others to use excess electricity and steam to separate the hydrogen and oxygen molecules in water using a high-temperature electrolysis process, which is 30% more efficient and -- in a sustainable way to produce hydrogen. And while it's not currently economical, we think hydrogen has long-term potential to be a carbon-free form of dispatchable generation, which will allow the country to achieve its carbon goals while maintaining reliability. 
I want to wrap up with a couple of comments on electric vehicles. We recently announced our vision to enable 1.5 million EVs in our service territory by 2030. We spent the last few years working with our commission on programs that will enable EVs in our service territory and help turn this vision into reality. Electrification of the transport system will reduce carbon and save our customers' money. I'm also proud of the recent award we received from Fort Nightly, which declared our EV program, the smartest transportation electrification project as part of its smartest utility projects in 2020. 
We've developed an EV subscription that makes it easier for customers to have charging stations installed at their homes and to be charged a monthly rate for off-peak usage, which can save customers' money and makes more efficient use of the electric grid. So before I do turn it over to Brian for more detail on financial results and outlook, I just want to say that, as you probably know, the Southeast is wrestling with Hurricane and its widespread outages, and the Southwest is working around the clock restoring our customers from the damages due to
Our customers over the past 3 days have restored 2/3 of 145 customers in SPS that have been out as a result of this ice storm. I know there are hundreds of thousands out there in other parts of the Southwest that are out. I'm just so proud of our team for focusing on our customers in these adverse conditions, and I'm proud of the industry. We have a history of mutual aid, and it's been never more evident in storm recovery in these last 2 events and quite frankly, the entire year. 
So with that, I will turn it over to Brian."

We had another strong quarter, booking $1.14 per share for the third quarter of 2020 compared with $1.01 per share last year. Most significant earnings drivers for the quarter include the following: higher electric margins increased earnings by $0.20 per share, primarily driven by rises in rate outcomes. O&M expenses were flat for the quarter, primarily driven by our cost management efforts. The lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.07 per share. 
As a reminder, production tax credits lowered the ETR. However, PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin and are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation and interest expense, which reduced earnings by $0.12 per share, reflecting our capital investment program. And in addition, other items combined to reduce earnings by $0.02 per share. 
Next, I want to discuss the status of COVID-19 impacts and our mitigation efforts. As expected, COVID-19 had an adverse impact as third quarter weather-adjusted electric sales declined by 2.4%. However, these impacts were better than projected in our guidance assumptions We now assume annual electric sales will decline approximately 3% for 2020. 
As a reminder, we have a sales true-up mechanism for all electric classes in Minnesota and decoupling for the electric residential and nondemand small C&I classes in Colorado. This covers about 45% of our total retail electric sales. This sales have come in better than projected and weather has been favorable, we've adjusted our O&M contingency plans accordingly. 
We continue to closely monitor bad debt expense and work with customers on payment plans. At this point, we expect bad debt expense to increase approximately $25 million over normal levels, which remains in line with previous forecasts. We have received approval there are certain pandemic-related expenses in all states except for North Dakota, where our request remains under commission review. 
We've also made strong progress on reducing O&M expenses to mitigate COVID-19 impacts. Based on our year-to-date results and updated sales projections, We now expect annual O&M expenses will decline 1% to 2% in 2020 compared to our initial guidance of a 2% increase. 
Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. In Texas, The commission approved our rate case settlement that reflects an electric rate increase of $88 million, a ROE of 9.45%, an equity ratio of 54.6% for AFUDC purposes and acceleration of the depreciation life of the plant. 
In October, the Colorado Commission accepted the ALJ's recommended decision to approve our natural gas rate case settlement without modification, reflecting a net rate increase of $77 million, a ROE of 9.2%, an equity ratio of 55.6%, and the historic test year an adjustment for the Tungsten to Black Hawk project. 
We view both the Texas and Colorado decisions as constructive regulatory outcomes. Our preference is to avoid rate cases impossible. So in July, we filed for a rider recovery of our wildfire and advanced grid investments in Colorado instead of filing a comprehensive rate case. The riders will cover 2021 through 2025 and provide regulatory flexibility. 
We're still in the early phases of these proceedings. In September, we filed a 2021 sale proposal in Minnesota as an alternative path to the rate case we plan to file in early November. We expect the commission to decide in December whether it will accept the stay out or proceed with a multiyear rate case. 
And as Ben noted, we're initiating our 2021 earnings guidance range of $2.90 to $3 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%. 
Our 2020 EPS guidance is based on several assumptions, which are detailed in our earnings release. I want to highlight several of these items here. We assume constructive regulatory outcomes in all proceedings. We anticipate modest impacts from COVID-19, we project electric sales growth of approximately 1%, which reflects modest recovery over the COVID-depressed sales levels in 2020. 
We expect O&M expenses to increase approximately 1%, which reflects increased costs for new wind projects and lower O&M levels in 2020 due to COVID mitigation. Please note that wind O&M are covered through regulatory mechanisms in most jurisdictions and is offset by fuel savings. 
And finally, we anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately negative 9%, largely driven by increased levels of wind PTCs which are credited to customers and generally have no material impact on earnings. 
In our earnings release, you'll find more detail about our updated $22.6 billion 5-year base capital forecast. The base forecast reflects significant grid investment, including our advanced grid initiative and additional investment in the transmission system to maintain asset health and reliability and enable renewable generation. 
It also includes a modest level of renewables, expenditures to improve the customer experience and a natural gas combined cycle plant at our Sherco facility to ensure reliability as we have proposed to retire all of our Minnesota coal plants by 2030. 
Our base capital plan results in annual rate base growth of approximately 6.3% using 2020 as a base. We also have potential incremental CapEx of approximately $750 million for wind repowering projects and $650 million for a solar facility, which are pending commission approval as part of the Minnesota relief and recovery filing. 
We're confident the commission will see the customer benefit of these projects. If approved, rate base growth would be 6.9%. In addition, we think there's other potential upside CapEx that could materialize in the future. 
Our capital investment plan supports our 5% to 7% long-term earnings growth objective and our goal to deliver EPS and dividend growth in the upper half of the range. 
We've also updated our financing plan, which reflects a combination of internal cash generation and debt issuances to fund the majority of our capital expenditures. In addition, We expect to issue $250 million of equity and $400 million of DRIP in benefits equity, consistent with our previous forecast. 
Importantly, the financing plan maintains our current credit metrics. We anticipate that the incremental capital, if approved by the Minnesota Commission, will be financed with approximately 50% equity and 50% debt. This incremental equity will allow us to fund accretive capital investments, which will benefit our customers while maintaining solid credit ratings and favorable access to the capital markets. 
And with that, I'll wrap up. We're effectively mitigating COVID-19 impacts. We continue to provide reliable service to our customers while ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and communities. The Colorado and Texas commissions approved our constructive rate case settlements. Our relief and recovery proposal in Minnesota will create jobs to rejuvenate our local economies and result with significant customer benefits. 
We narrowed our 2020 guidance range to $2.75 to $2.81 per share based on solid year-to-date results and progress on contingency plans. We announced a robust updated capital investment program that provides strong, transparent rate-based growth and significant customer value. We initiated 2021 earnings guidance of $2.90 to $3 per share, consistent with our long-term objective. 
And finally, we remain confident we can deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within our 5% to 7% objective range. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions."

I think it would probably accelerate EVs and help with our $1.5 million target. I would also welcome the chance as both CEO of Xcel and Chairman of EI to work with the Biden administration and kind of let them know at 2035 and utility time frame for the technologies that will be needed -- is very aggressive.

I'm particularly excited about EVs, if you've heard me speak before, because I don't know if it's steel for fuel, but it's a type of steel for fuel, the variable cost of an EV is significantly below that of gasoline, if you charge off peak some of rates, it's equivalent of $0.60 a gallon. So while EVs are expensive today, we think that cost comes down. 
Biden administration might help that cost come down even more.

And we did set that precedent in all the regulatory proceedings going through the TCJA in terms of through the majority of our jurisdictions, we -- the customers saw timely refund of those savings, and we expect similar treatment if the tax rate goes up. 
On the credit metrics side, certainly an increase in the tax rate would help on the credit metric side. You would probably expect for us to see 100 to 150 basis point increase in our credit metrics. But that also -- that depends on the details. I know there is a talk about AMT related to book income, which would be detrimental in that sense.

I mean one of the things that we'd want to show is, okay, if this leads to more EV penetration, how does that benefit all of our customers? What is -- just exactly how much are we going to socialize? 
And you've heard me talk about incentives and subsidies and things like that, and that's always been okay with them as long as they're transparent. So I would not want something that is kind of hidden where people not -- we're not really sure what is being socialized and what isn't being socialize. And I don't think that would happen with these charging stations, but that's what we'd be advocating for, just a real transparent process. 
Because not everybody, when you say the word socialization, I mean that's it gets people upset sometimes. But a selective amount of seating, I think, is really important. And perhaps we could play a role in that. 
There's kind of 2 areas, I think we're excellent at also making sure that in a world where we are involved, we can make sure that public charging, whether it's on interstates or in neighborhoods, there are areas of town and areas of communities that don't get left behind. 
We want to make sure that there's an equitable investment and making sure that all of our customers can benefit from the opportunity that electric vehicles provide. 
And the second area where I think that we are very valuable in ownership of -- in control of the charging stations is really around the impacts on the grid and making sure that we have appropriate incentives for more off-peak than on-peak charging, recognizing that some on peak will have to happen certainly in those public spaces, but balancing the grid loads and making sure that we're optimizing the distribution investments around electric vehicles is really important. 
And I think our role there is critical. So that leads you to believe that we would be a very good partner or owner of those types of stations as well."

We had another strong quarter, booking earnings of $1.14 per share for the third quarter of 2020 compared with $1.01 per share last year. Our year-to-date earnings are on track with our financial plan, and we are mitigating the impact of COVID-19. 
As a result, we are narrowing our 2020 guidance range to $2.75 to $2.81 per share. Now consistent with our third quarter tradition, we have provided our updated base investment plan which reflects $22.6 billion of capital expenditures over the next 5 years. This represents rate base growth of 6.3% off a 2020 base year. And this represents our base capital forecast. 
In addition, we've identified potential incremental CapEx of $1.4 billion associated with the Minnesota relief and recovery proposal, which, if approved, will drive rate base growth of 6.9%. We're also initiating 2021 guidance of $2.90 to $3 per share, which is consistent with our 5% to 7% long-term EPS growth objective.
We're very excited about our plan, which provides significant customer value, keeps bills low and delivers attractive returns for our investors. We also continue to help our customers and protect our employees during this pandemic.
We've stepped up charitable giving to help our communities, including donating the gain from the sale of our Mankato facility. For more details, see our slides. 
Our business continuity plans have been executed extremely well, including the completing of a refueling outage at our Prairie Island nuclear facility. We're keeping employees safe while providing reliable customer service. And we're helping to restart the economy through our capital investment programs, which create jobs in our communities. 
Earlier this year, The Minnesota Commission opened a relief and recovery docket and inviting utilities to submit potential projects that will create jobs and jump-start the economy. 
In September, we filed a repowering proposal that includes 4 Xcel Energy wind farms of approximately 650 megawatts with $750 million of capital investment. In addition, the proposal includes 67 megawatts of repowered PPA extensions. 
The portfolio is projected to provide customer savings of over $160 million over the life of the assets. We've requested a commission decision on the wind proposal by year-end. We're also proposing 460 megawatts of solar facilities near our retiring Sherco coal plant to take advantage of the existing transmission. 
Project represents an estimated investment of $650 million. We plan to file our solar proposal in early 2021 and anticipated decision in mid-'21. 
We are confident the commission will see the customer benefits of these projects. We continue to make progress on our PPA buyout strategy. In August, the Minnesota Commission approved our request to acquire the 99-megawatt Mower wind farm after it's repowered. Mower is currently a PPA. 
In addition, we filed to buy out the KEPCO solar facility in Colorado. And while the $41 million investment is relatively small, the PPA is out of the money and the buyout will save our customers $38 million over the 11 years. 
I think this is another example of our keeping bills low priority. We continue to make strong progress on our wind development initiatives. In August, our 500-megawatt Cheyenne Ridge wind farm went into operation. Cheyenne Ridge was completed ahead of schedule and under budget. Since we began operations, we set a record with 70% of hourly load coming from wind generation in Colorado. 
We also reached an agreement to acquire a 74-megawatt solar facility in Wisconsin for approximately $100 million. We expect a commission decision later in 2021, and this will be our first universal scale solar rate base investment. I'm also excited to announce that Xcel Energy was recently awarded a $10 million DOE grant for an innovation pilot to produce carbon-free hydrogen at one of our nuclear power plants. 
We're partnering with the Idaho National Lab and others to use excess electricity and steam to separate the hydrogen and oxygen molecules in water using a high-temperature electrolysis process, which is 30% more efficient and in a -- and a sustainable way to produce hydrogen. And while it's not currently economical, we think hydrogen has long-term potential to be a carbon-free form of dispatchable generation, which will allow the country to achieve its carbon goals while maintaining reliability. 
I want to wrap up with a couple of comments on electric vehicles. We recently announced our vision to enable 1.5 million EVs in our service territory by 2030. We spent the last few years working with our commission on programs that will enable EVs in our service territory and help turn this vision into reality. Electrification of the transport system will reduce carbon and save our customers' money. I'm also proud of the recent award we received from Fortnightly, which declared our EV program, the smartest transportation electrification project as part of its smartest utility projects in 2020. 
We've developed an EV subscription that makes it easier for customers to have charging stations installed at their homes and to be charged a monthly rate for off-peak usage, which can save customers' money and makes more efficient use of the electric grid. 
So before I do turn it over to Brian for more detail on financial results and outlook, I just want to say that, as you probably know, the Southeast is wrestling with Hurricane zeta and its widespread outages, and the Southwest is working around the clock restoring our customers from the damages due to winter storm Billy.
Our customers over the past 3 days have restored 2/3 of 145 customers in SPS that have been out as a result of this ice storm. I know there are hundreds of thousands out there in other parts of the Southwest that are out. I'm just so proud of our team for focusing on our customers in these adverse conditions, and I'm proud of the industry. We have a history of mutual aid, and it's been never more evident in storm recovery in these last 2 events and quite frankly, the entire year. 
So with that, I will turn it over to Brian."

We had another strong quarter, booking $1.14 per share for the third quarter of 2020 compared with $1.01 per share last year. Most significant earnings drivers for the quarter include the following: higher electric margins increased earnings by $0.20 per share, primarily driven by rises in rate outcomes. O&M expenses were flat for the quarter, primarily driven by our cost management efforts. The lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.07 per share. 
As a reminder, production tax credits lowered the ETR. However, PTCs have flowed back to customers through lower electric margin and are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation and interest expense, which reduced earnings by $0.12 per share, reflecting our capital investment program. And in addition, other items combined to reduce earnings by $0.02 per share. 
Next, I want to discuss the status of COVID-19 impacts and our mitigation efforts. As expected, COVID-19 had an adverse impact as third quarter weather-adjusted electric sales declined by 2.4%. However, these impacts were better than projected in our guidance assumptions. We now assume annual electric sales will decline approximately 3% for 2020. 
As a reminder, we have a sales true-up mechanism for all electric classes in Minnesota and decoupling for the electric residential and nondemand small C&I classes in Colorado. This covers about 45% of our total retail electric sales. This sales have come in better than projected and weather has been favorable, we've adjusted our O&M contingency plans accordingly. 
We continue to closely monitor bad debt expense and work with customers on payment plans. At this point, we expect bad debt expense to increase approximately $25 million over normal levels, which remains in line with previous forecasts. We have received approval to defer certain pandemic-related expenses in all states, except for North Dakota, where our request remains under commission review. 
We've also made strong progress on reducing O&M expenses to mitigate COVID-19 impacts. Based on our year-to-date results and updated sales projections, We now expect annual O&M expenses will decline 1% to 2% in 2020 compared to our initial guidance of a 2% increase. 
Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. In Texas, the commission approved our rate case settlement that reflects an electric rate increase of $88 million, a ROE of 9.45%, an equity ratio of 54.6% for AFUDC purposes and acceleration of the depreciation life of the coal plant. 
In October, the Colorado Commission accepted the ALJ's recommended decision to approve our natural gas rate case settlement without modification, reflecting a net rate increase of $77 million, a ROE of 9.2%, an equity ratio of 55.6%, and the historic test year of an adjustment for the Tungsten to Black Hawk project. 
We view both the Texas and Colorado decisions as constructive regulatory outcomes. Our preferences to avoid rate case is impossible. So in July, we filed for a rider recovery of our wildfire and advanced grid investments in Colorado instead of filing a comprehensive rate case. The riders will cover 2021 through 2025 and provide regulatory flexibility. 
We're still in the early phases of these proceedings. In September, we filed a 2021 sale proposal in Minnesota as an alternative path to the rate case we plan to file in early November. We expect the commission to decide in December whether it will accept the stay out or proceed with a multiyear rate case. 
And as Ben noted, we're initiating our 2021 earnings guidance range of $2.90 to $3 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%.
Our 2020 EPS guidance is based on several assumptions, which are detailed in our earnings release. I want to highlight several of these items here. We assume constructive regulatory outcomes in all proceedings. We anticipate modest impacts from COVID-19. We project electric sales growth of approximately 1%, which reflects modest recovery over the COVID-depressed sales levels in 2020. 
We expect O&M expenses to increase approximately 1%, which reflects increased costs for new wind projects and lower O&M levels in 2020 due to COVID mitigation. Please note that wind O&Ms are covered through regulatory mechanisms in most jurisdictions and is offset by fuel savings. 
And finally, we anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately negative 9%, largely driven by increased levels of wind PTCs which are credited to customers and generally have no material impact on earnings. 
In our earnings release, you'll find more detail about our updated $22.6 billion 5-year base capital forecast. The base forecast reflects significant grid investment, including our advanced grid initiative and additional investment in the transmission system to maintain asset health and reliability and enable renewable generation.
It also includes a modest level of renewables, expenditures to improve the customer experience and a natural gas combined cycle plant at our Sherco facility to ensure reliability as we have proposed to retire all of our Minnesota coal plants by 2030. 
Our base capital plan results in annual rate base growth of approximately 6.3% using 2020 as a base. We also have potential incremental CapEx of approximately $750 million for wind repowering projects and $650 million for a solar facility, which are pending commission approval as part of the Minnesota relief and recovery filing. 
We're confident the commission will see the customer benefits of these projects. If approved, rate base growth would be 6.9%. In addition, we think there's other potential upside CapEx that could materialize in the future. 
Our capital investment plan supports our 5% to 7% long-term earnings growth objective and our goal to deliver EPS and dividend growth in the upper half of the range.
We've also updated our financing plan, which reflects a combination of internal cash generation and debt issuances to fund the majority of our capital expenditures. In addition, we expect to issue $250 million of equity and $400 million of DRIP and benefits equity, consistent with our previous forecast. 
Importantly, the financing plan maintains our current credit metrics. We anticipate that the incremental capital, if approved by the Minnesota Commission, will be financed with approximately 50% equity and 50% debt. This incremental equity will allow us to fund accretive capital investments, which will benefit our customers while maintaining solid credit ratings and favorable access to the capital markets. 
And with that, I'll wrap up. We're effectively mitigating COVID-19 impacts. We continue to provide reliable service to our customers while ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and communities. The Colorado and Texas Commissions approved our constructive rate case settlements. Our relief and recovery proposal in Minnesota will create jobs, help rejuvenate our local economies and result in significant customer benefits. 
We narrowed our 2020 guidance range to $2.75 to $2.81 per share based on solid year-to-date results and progress on contingency plans. We announced a robust updated capital investment program that provides strong, transparent rate-based growth and significant customer value. We initiated 2021 earnings guidance of $2.90 to $3 per share, consistent with our long-term objective. 
And finally, we remain confident we can deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within our 5% to 7% objective range. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions."

We're, I would say, proactively working with the department and trying to gain their support. We expect to file our [ min ] rate case next week as the alternative to the stay-out proposal. And similar to last year, we would expect the commission to take that up in about 6 to 8 weeks, so call it, early to mid-December time frame where we'd expect them to make a decision. 
And look, we think the R&R plan and the stay out proposed are very much in line with the administration and the commission's goals, and we'd expect a productive outcome in December."

I'm particularly excited about EVs, if you've heard me speak before, because I don't know if it's steel for fuel,  but it's a type of steel for fuel,  the variable cost of an EV is significantly below that of gasoline, if you charge off peak with similar rates, it's equivalent of $0.60 a gallon. So while EVs are expensive today, we think that cost comes down. 
Biden administration might help that cost come down even more. And then we're getting more EVs out there, reducing the carbon footprint, obviously, and creating investment opportunities for us and additional sales load, which all customers benefit from. I'll turn it over to Brian for your tax question."

And we did set that precedent in all the regulatory proceedings going through the TCJA in terms of through the majority of our jurisdictions, we -- the customers saw timely refund of those savings, and we expect similar treatment if the tax rate goes up. 
On the credit metrics side, certainly an increase in the tax rate would help on the credit metric side. You would probably expect for us to see 100 to 150 basis point increase in our credit metrics. But that also -- that depends on the details. I know there is a talk about AMT related to book income, which would be detrimental in that sense.

We've been very successful in working with our stakeholders in mitigating the transition of these legacy plants of ours.
We've taken care of the workforces and the property taxes and the jurisdictions. And so we think this is just part of the overall package, and we've been successful with that in the past, and we would expect to continue in that fashion.

And so with the call to us, we can get the home charger installed at no cost for you, build it into a subscription rate, which encourages you to charge off peak and saves you a significant of money. 
So you don't have to compare KWH and equivalents. It's like, I think it's $44 a month, and it's all you can use off-peak. And we've done the math. We think it works out really well for the EV owner, but just as importantly other customers because it minimizes the impact of the grid. 
Now when you get to like fast-charging stations, I think they're really necessary to address range anxiety.  But to make no bones about it, they're kind of loss leaders.

And I don't think that would happen with these charging stations, but that's what we'd be advocating for, just a real transparent process. 
Because not everybody, when you say the word socialization, I mean that's -- it gets people upset sometimes. But a selective amount of seating, I think, is really important. And perhaps we could play a role in that. 
There's kind of 2 areas, I think we're excellent at also making sure that in a world where we are involved, we can make sure that public charging, whether it's on interstates or in neighborhoods, there are areas of town and areas of communities that don't get left behind. 
We want to make sure that there's an equitable investment and making sure that all of our customers can benefit from the opportunity that electric vehicles provide. 
And the second area where I think that we are very valuable in ownership of -- in control of the charging stations is really around the impacts on the grid and making sure that we have appropriate incentives for more off-peak than on-peak charging, recognizing that some on peak will have to happen certainly in those public spaces, but balancing the grid loads and making sure that we're optimizing the distribution investments around electric vehicles is really important. 
And I think our role there is critical. So that leads you to believe that we would be a very good partner or owner of those types of stations as well."
