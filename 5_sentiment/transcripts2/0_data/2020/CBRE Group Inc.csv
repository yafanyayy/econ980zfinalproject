As you've seen, CBRE ended 2019 with solid growth, highlighting the benefits of our diverse business and resulting in our 10th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth.Our fourth",345,"Thank you, Kristyn, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen, CBRE ended 2019 with solid growth, highlighting the benefits of our diverse business and resulting in our 10th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth.
Our fourth quarter performance was led by very strong property sales, particularly in the U.S., U.K. and Continental Europe. This performance has extended into 2020 as investors continue to believe commercial real estate is attractive relative to other asset classes.
Growth was also very strong in our occupier outsourcing business, global workplace solutions, where our scale and increasingly differentiated capability enable us to capture a growing share of this expanding market. This is particularly true regarding global multiservice opportunities. Leasing declined year-over-year, partially offsetting the gains in sales and outsourcing. However, it is notable that Q4 2019 was the second largest leasing quarter in the history of our company, trailing only 2018's fourth quarter. We remain optimistic on leasing growth in 2020, although we will have challenging comparisons in the year's first half. Our view is informed by a survey of our top leasing clients who indicated they intend to lease slightly more space this year than in 2019.
The contribution from our real estate Investments segment was down due largely to a delay in the timing of certain large asset sales. Several of these assets have already been sold in the first quarter. We expect 2020 to be a solid year for asset sales in this business with our development activity at record levels. We continue to see a backdrop that supports strong business performance while we are closely watching the potential impact of ongoing risks, particularly the coronavirus, we expect global economic growth to be on par with 2019 based on what we know today. With this in mind, we expect that macro conditions and our ability to take market share should drive our 11th consecutive year of solid double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth in 2020. Leah will describe our 2020 outlook in detail after she reviews the quarter's performance and our financial position. Leah?"

Our advisory Services segment grew fee revenue about 3% over the prior year period, while adjusted EBITDA rose over 4%. This positive operating leverage drove our fifth consecutive quarter of margin expansion in our advisory business, with adjusted EBITDA margin on fee revenue increasing 30 basis points to approach 21%. 
Excluding the impact of OMSR gains, which can fluctuate significantly in any given quarter, our advisory margins expanded by nearly 90 basis points. Performance was driven by notable strength in EMEA and to a lesser degree, Asia Pacific.
Revenue growth was led by global property sales, which grew 21%, resulting in new quarterly and annual revenue records for property sales. Strong growth was achieved in most parts of the world, led by the United Kingdom, up 44%; Continental Europe, up 34% and which was driven by double-digit growth in our largest markets in the region, France and Germany; and the United States, which was up over 20%. 
We continue to benefit from market share expansion and for the full year 2019, we gained nearly 120 basis points of share in the U.S., according to Real Capital Analytics.
Our fourth quarter U.S. property sales activity was notably robust for large transactions with sales to over $100 million, up 88% compared to last year. We also saw broad-based growth across property types with office, industrial and hotel transactions, all increasing significantly. 
Commercial mortgage origination revenue declined 15% as a result of slower activity from the government-sponsored enterprises earlier in the year. Prior to the formation of the new caps, which, as expected, impacted transaction revenue in the fourth quarter. Origination with other lending sources, notably private equity debt funds and insurance companies, continue to increase.
At the outset of 2020, debt capital remains plentiful at attractive rates from a variety of capital sources, including government-sponsored enterprises, which have actively returned to the market.
Our loan servicing portfolio ended the year at $230 billion, up over 19% from year-end 2018. As expected, leasing activity decelerated sequentially in Q4, with leasing in our advisory business down nearly 7%, which compares with a record quarter in Q4 2018 when leasing revenue rose over 25%. 
Leasing revenue in our largest market, the U.S. declined by about 10%, driven by a particularly tough prior year comparison, which saw growth of nearly 33% and the lagging impact of a slight macroeconomic deterioration that occurred earlier in 2019. In addition, prior year growth included a benefit of about 6% from M&A activity, and we did not see a similar benefit in the current year's fourth quarter.
Lastly, co-working adversely impacted leasing growth by about 3%, a similar level to that of the third quarter of 2018. 
Turning to Slide 9. Our Global Workplace Solutions segment grew gross and fee revenue by approximately 19% and 13%, respectively. Strong revenue growth, combined with focused cost discipline drove adjusted EBITDA growth of nearly 24% on over 120 basis points of margin expansion. Notably, margins improved on a year-over-year basis across all 3 lines of business, facility management, project management and transaction services.
Occupier demand for multiple services remains robust, with new contracts encompassing our full suite of services accounting for 40% of the new business secured in the fourth quarter, as measured by EBITDA.
In one prominent example, we extended our relationship with  the U.S.-based pharmaceutical company. We have been providing facilities management and project management services in Europe and have now added facilities management in the U.S. and Latin America and expanded into transactions and other real estate services globally.
The GWS new business pipeline also remains strong as we kick-off 2020. This pipeline is dominated by well-known companies with complex worldwide requirements that are well-served by a globally integrated firm like CBRE.
Flipping to Slide 10. Let's now take a look at our real estate investment segment. The $9 million year-over-year decline in this segment's adjusted EBITDA stemmed primarily from certain large asset sales in the Development and Investment Management businesses, shifting from the fourth quarter of 2019 to early 2020. And this shift resulted in about $18 million of adjusted EBITDA, moving from the fourth quarter of 2019 to the first quarter of 2020. Several of these deals have subsequently closed at valuations in line with previous underwriting assumptions.
Investments in the start-up of our flexible Workspace business, Hana, also contributed about $8 million to the adjusted EBITDA decline. We opened our first 3 Hana units in 2019, and we expect 15 to 20 units to be opened by the end of 2020. We are pleased with the reception to Hana and believe we are well suited to operate flexible workspaces for institutional property owners, given our credit worthiness and the secular growth of agile workspaces. 
We are pursuing a variety of deal structures, including traditional leases and see these structures moving towards partnerships, management agreements or other asset-light structures over time.
For the quarter, we had an adjusted EBITDA contribution of about $11 million, consistent with our underwriting assumptions from Telford Homes, the U.K. multifamily development business we acquired in October 2019. Our results also included about $98 million in revenue related to Telford. The integration of this business is proceeding as expected. And we remain excited about the opportunity this acquisition affords us to expand our successful development business into EMEA. This is especially true given the improved sentiment we are seeing in the U.K. with reduced uncertainty now that they have formally withdrawn from the EU.
As expected, the U.S. development business improved in Q4 compared with Q3, despite the impact of some deal slippage into the first quarter of 2020, and we are continuing to transact sales at previously anticipated valuation levels. In addition, underlying market trends remain strong, as evidenced by our in-process portfolio and pipeline, together reaching new record levels at year-end 2019, with our in-process activity increasing by $2.1 billion, while the pipeline increased $2.3 billion, of which more than 65% of the increase was attributable to Telford.
In Investment Management, we raised $13 billion in capital during 2019, while AUM increased by more than $6 billion in the quarter to nearly $113 billion. Both our capital raising and total AUM are new records for the business. Importantly, Investment Management revenue, excluding carried interest, which is largely recurring fee-based revenue, climbed to approximately $395 million for the year. This drove the contribution from recurring adjusted EBITDA within the REI business to over 40% of this segment's full year total adjusted EBITDA.
Turning to our outlook for 2020. On Slide 11, we anticipate another year of solid growth for CBRE, given our current expectation of the continued appeal of commercial real estate relative to other asset classes and our cautiously optimistic view that GDP will expand versus 2019.
We also expect the diversity of our revenue across lines of business, our client base and geographies will be supportive of our growth in 2020. Advisory services fee revenue is expected to increase in the mid single-digit range, driven by growth of a similar range in both leasing and capital markets. This outlook reflects the tough comparisons we will face in the first half of the year and the activity we've seen so far in 2020. It also reflects a subdued set of expectations for the APAC region, primarily China, as a result of the impacts from Coronavirus.
For the Global Workplace Solutions segment, we anticipate fee revenue rising in the low double-digit percentage range. We expect to renew and/or expand around 90% of our expiring contracts, consistent with our historical average. Given the strong growth we've been delivering in this segment and the highly differentiated platform CBRE offers to our outsourcing clients, we expect to be increasingly focused on profitability. As a result, we expect to continue to be selective going forward about the accounts we are willing to service and how we design our commercial approach to them.
Continuing on Slide 12. We expect solid adjusted EBITDA growth from our advisory and GWS segments and project adjusted EBITDA from our REI segment will increase significantly to around $250 million, in part due to the previously discussed shift of certain asset sales into 2020. We expect the contribution from REI to be roughly equally weighted between the first and second half of the year, as compared to 2019, when over 2/3 of this segment's adjusted EBITDA contribution was recorded in the first half of the year. This also includes an expected $20 million contribution from the Telford acquisition, which we anticipate will be roughly offset by our incremental investment in Hana.
As we ramp up Hana, our OpEx investments for 2020 should be approximately $40 million, with almost half attributable to noncash rent expense.
We also expect the quarterly headwind caused by it to abate over the course of the year as occupiers are drawn to our high-quality workspaces, resulting in revenue growth.
In light of all of these factors and our expectations for below the line items, we expect full year 2020 adjusted earnings per share in the range of [ $4.05 ] to $4.25. This indicates anticipated growth of around 12% at the midpoint of our range, which, if attained would be our 11th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth.
I would also note that given the cadence of growth achieved in 2019, we would expect 2020 adjusted EPS growth to be higher in the second half than in the first half, with around 60% of total EPS to be generated in the second half of 2020.
Turning to Slide 13. Our long track record of delivering solid growth across our key financial metrics has been supported by our capital allocation process. During 2019, we deployed nearly $930 million of capital. This includes about $272 million for CapEx, net of tenant concessions, of which about half were discretionary in nature and largely attributable to investments made to enhance the value of the CBRE digital platform through enablement CapEx.
This discretionary amount also includes just over $28 million of CapEx to support the launch of Hana. While we expect the investment per unit to decline in 2020, total CapEx related to Hana should increase to between $60 million to $70 million as we get more units up and running. 
We also spent over $500 million for acquisitions, mostly for Telford as well as for infill M&A. And $145 million for share repurchases, including $51 million in Q4 at an average price of $50.85.
While supporting these investments, we also lowered net leverage by nearly 0.2 turns and ended the year with significant balance sheet capacity. The investments we made during 2019 are part of our long-term commitment to enhance the resiliency of our business while extending our leadership position within the commercial real estate services industry. In fact, since the last cyclical peak, we have reduced our net leverage by 1.3x, while simultaneously increasing the diversification of our revenues and our exposure to less cyclical businesses, primarily through investments in our outsourcing business.
This, combined with our healthy balance sheet should afford us the ample capacity to take advantage of any potential market dislocations that may occur. Our financial position is unrivaled by our peers and will enable us to opportunistically invest in enhancing our capabilities and extending our long-term growth trajectory across all parts of the economic cycle.
Finally, we have added free cash flow to our earnings release disclosures. Internally, we are continually focusing on optimizing our existing business and evaluating new investments on their ability to accelerate growth while expanding our future cash flows. We believe our ability to grow cash flow while pursuing strong top and bottom line growth helps drive returns for shareholders. And given this, we believe it is important to actively report on free cash flow on a regular basis.
With that, I'll ask you to turn to Slide 14. As Bob provides a few closing thoughts."

Before we take your questions, I'd like to briefly comment on CBRE's efforts around environmental sustainability, since this is a subject that we are hearing about increasingly from our shareholders.
CBRE has long been at the forefront of sustainability issues in our sector. With responsibility for managing nearly 7 billion square feet of space around the world, we are very well positioned to have an impact on sustainability, and we've been doing just that for some time. We've registered more than 5,600 U.S. properties in the Energy STAR program and have completed more than 1,000 Lean Certifications on behalf of our clients. In our own workplaces, we pledged in 2016 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by the year 2025. We are well on our way to exceeding this goal with emissions already down 28%.
The strides we are making have resulted in CBRE's inclusion in indexes that benchmark sustainability performance, such as the Dow Jones World Sustainability Index and the FTSE for good index. Most recently, Barron's named us the 13th most sustainable company out of 1,000 major U.S. companies that were evaluated, reflecting our leading performance on a variety of environmental, social and governance metrics. We look forward to updating the market in May when we publish our annual corporate responsibility report. 
With that, operator, we'll open the line for questions."

As you've seen, CBRE ended 2019 with solid growth, highlighting the benefits of our diverse business and resulting in our 10th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth.Our fourth",345,"Thank you, Kristyn, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen, CBRE ended 2019 with solid growth, highlighting the benefits of our diverse business and resulting in our 10th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth.
Our fourth quarter performance was led by very strong property sales, particularly in the U.S., U.K. and Continental Europe. This performance has extended into 2020 as investors continue to believe commercial real estate is attractive relative to other asset classes.
Growth was also very strong in our Occupier Outsourcing business, Global Workplace Solutions, where our scale and increasingly differentiated capability enable us to capture a growing share of this expanding market. This is particularly true regarding global multiservice opportunities. Leasing declined year-over-year, partially offsetting the gains in sales and outsourcing. However, it is notable that Q4 2019 was the second largest leasing quarter in the history of our company, trailing only 2018's fourth quarter. We remain optimistic on leasing growth in 2020, although we will have challenging comparisons in the year's first half. Our view is informed by a survey of our top leasing clients who indicated they intend to lease slightly more space this year than in 2019.
The contribution from our Real Estate Investments segment was down due largely to a delay in the timing of certain large asset sales. Several of these assets have already been sold in the first quarter. We expect 2020 to be a solid year for asset sales in this business with our development activity at record levels. We continue to see a backdrop that supports strong business performance while we are closely watching the potential impact of ongoing risks, particularly the coronavirus, we expect global economic growth to be on par with 2019 based on what we know today. With this in mind, we expect that macro conditions and our ability to take market share should drive our 11th consecutive year of solid double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth in 2020. Leah will describe our 2020 outlook in detail after she reviews the quarter's performance and our financial position. Leah?"

Our Advisory Services segment grew fee revenue about 3% over the prior year period, while adjusted EBITDA rose over 4%. This positive operating leverage drove our fifth consecutive quarter of margin expansion in our advisory business, with adjusted EBITDA margin on fee revenue increasing 30 basis points to approach 21%. 
Excluding the impact of OMSR gains, which can fluctuate significantly in any given quarter, our advisory margins expanded by nearly 90 basis points. Performance was driven by notable strengths in EMEA and to a lesser degree, Asia Pacific.
Revenue growth was led by global property sales, which grew 21%, resulting in new quarterly and annual revenue records for property sales. Strong growth was achieved in most parts of the world, led by the United Kingdom, up 44%; Continental Europe, up 34% and which was driven by double-digit growth in our largest markets in the region, France and Germany; and the United States, which was up over 20%. 
We continue to benefit from market share expansion and for the full year 2019, we gained nearly 120 basis points of share in the U.S., according to Real Capital Analytics.
Our fourth quarter U.S. property sales activity was notably robust for large transactions with sales over $100 million, up 88% compared to last year. We also saw broad-based growth across property types with office, industrial and hotel transactions, all increasing significantly. 
Commercial mortgage origination revenue declined 15% as a result of slower activity from the government-sponsored enterprises earlier in the year. Prior to the formation of the new caps, which, as expected, impacted transaction revenue in the fourth quarter. Origination with other lending sources, notably private equity debt funds and insurance companies, continued to increase.
At the outset of 2020, debt capital remains plentiful at attractive rates from a variety of capital sources, including government-sponsored enterprises, which have actively returned to the market.
Our loan servicing portfolio ended the year at $230 billion, up over 19% from year-end 2018. As expected, leasing activity decelerated sequentially in Q4, with leasing in our advisory business down nearly 7%, which compares with a record quarter in Q4 2018 when leasing revenue rose over 25%. 
Leasing revenue in our largest market, the U.S. declined by about 10%, driven by a particularly tough prior year comparison, which saw growth of nearly 33% and the lagging impact of a slight macroeconomic deterioration that occurred earlier in 2019. In addition, prior year growth included a benefit of about 6% from M&A activity, and we did not see a similar benefit in the current year's fourth quarter.
Lastly, co-working adversely impacted leasing growth by about 3%, a similar level to that of the third quarter of 2019. 
Turning to Slide 9. Our Global Workplace Solutions segment grew growth and fee revenue by approximately 19% and 13%, respectively. Strong revenue growth, combined with focused cost discipline drove adjusted EBITDA growth of nearly 24% on over 120 basis points of margin expansion. Notably, margins improved on a year-over-year basis across all 3 lines of business, facilities management, project management and transaction services.
Occupier demand for multiple services remains robust, with new contracts encompassing our full suite of services accounting for 40% of the new business secured in the fourth quarter, as measured by EBITDA.
In one prominent example, we extended our relationship with Merck, the U.S.-based pharmaceutical company. We have been providing facilities management and project management services in Europe and have now added facilities management in the U.S. and Latin America and expanded into transactions and other real estate services globally.
The GWS new business pipeline also remains strong as we kick-off 2020. This pipeline is dominated by well-known companies with complex worldwide requirements that are well served by a globally integrated firm like CBRE.
Flipping to Slide 10. Let's now take a look at our Real Estate Investment segment. The $9 million year-over-year decline in this segment's adjusted EBITDA stemmed primarily from certain large asset sales in the Development and Investment Management businesses, shifting from the fourth quarter of 2019 to early 2020. This shift resulted in about $18 million of adjusted EBITDA, moving from the fourth quarter of 2019 to the first quarter of 2020. Several of these deals have subsequently closed at valuations in line with previous underwriting assumptions.
Investments in the start-up of our Flexible Workspace business, Hana, also contributed about $8 million to the adjusted EBITDA decline. We opened our first 3 Hana units in 2019, and we expect 15 to 20 units to be opened by the end of 2020. We are pleased with the reception to Hana and believe we are well suited to operate Flexible Workspaces for institutional property owners, given our creditworthiness and the secular growth of agile workspaces. 
We are pursuing a variety of deal structures, including traditional leases and see these structures moving towards partnerships, management agreements or other asset-light structures over time.
For the quarter, we had an adjusted EBITDA contribution of about $11 million, consistent with our underwriting assumptions from Telford Homes, the U.K. multifamily development business we acquired in October 2019. Our results also included about $98 million revenue related to Telford. The integration of this business is proceeding as expected. And we remain excited about the opportunity this acquisition affords us to expand our successful development business into EMEA. This is especially true given the improved sentiment we are seeing in the U.K. with reduced uncertainty now that they have formally withdrawn from the EU.
As expected, the U.S. development business improved in Q4 compared with Q3, despite the impact of some deal slippage into the first quarter of 2020, and we are continuing to transact sales at previously anticipated valuation levels. In addition, underlying market trends remain strong, as evidenced by our in-process portfolio and pipeline, together reaching new record levels at year-end 2019, with our in-process activity increasing by $2.1 billion, while the pipeline increased $2.3 billion, of which more than 65% of the increase was attributable to Telford.
In Investment Management, we raised $13 billion in capital during 2019, while AUM increased by more than $6 billion in the quarter to nearly $113 billion. Both our capital raising and total AUM are new records for the business. Importantly, Investment Management revenue, excluding carried interest, which is largely recurring fee-based revenue, climbed to approximately $395 million for the year. This drove the contribution from recurring adjusted EBITDA within the REI business to over 40% of this segment's full year total adjusted EBITDA.
Turning to our outlook for 2020. On Slide 11, we anticipate another year of solid growth for CBRE, given our current expectation of the continued appeal of commercial real estate relative to other asset classes and our cautiously optimistic view that GDP will expand versus 2019.
We also expect the diversity of our revenue across lines of business, our client base and geographies will be supportive of our growth in 2020. Advisory services fee revenue is expected to increase in the mid-single-digit range, driven by growth of a similar range in both leasing and capital markets. This outlook reflects the tough comparisons we will face in the first half of the year and the activity we've seen so far in 2020. It also reflects a subdued set of expectations for the APAC region, primarily China, as a result of the impacts from coronavirus.
For the Global Workplace Solutions segment, we anticipate fee revenue rising in the low double-digit percentage range. We expect to renew and/or expand around 90% of our expiring contracts, consistent with our historical average. Given the strong growth we've been delivering in this segment and the highly differentiated platform CBRE offers to our outsourcing clients, we expect to be increasingly focused on profitability. As a result, we expect to continue to be selective going forward about the accounts we are willing to service and how we design our commercial approach to them.
Continuing on Slide 12. We expect solid adjusted EBITDA growth from our advisory and GWS segments and project adjusted EBITDA from our REI segment will increase significantly to around $250 million, in part due to the previously discussed shift of certain asset sales into 2020. We expect the contribution from REI to be roughly equally weighted between the first and second half of the year, as compared to 2019, when over 2/3 of this segment's adjusted EBITDA contribution was recorded in the first half of the year. This also includes an expected $20 million contribution from the Telford acquisition, which we anticipate will be roughly offset by our incremental investment in Hana.
As we ramp up Hana, our OpEx investments for 2020 should be approximately $40 million, with almost half attributable to noncash rent expense.
We also expect the quarterly headwind caused by it to abate over the course of the year as occupiers are drawn to our high-quality workspaces, resulting in revenue growth.
In light of all of these factors and our expectations for below the line items, we expect full year 2020 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $4.05 to $4.25. This indicates anticipated growth of around 12% at the midpoint of our range, which, if attained would be our 11th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth.
I would also note that given the cadence of growth achieved in 2019, we would expect 2020 adjusted EPS growth to be higher in the second half than in the first half, with around 60% of total EPS to be generated in the second half of 2020.
Turning to Slide 13. Our long track record of delivering solid growth across our key financial metrics has been supported by our capital allocation process. During 2019, we deployed nearly $930 million of capital. This includes about $272 million for CapEx, net of tenant concessions, of which about half was discretionary in nature and largely attributable to investments made to enhance the value of the CBRE digital platform through enablement CapEx.
This discretionary amount also includes just over $28 million of CapEx to support the launch of Hana. While we expect the investment per unit to decline in 2020, total CapEx related to Hana should increase to between $60 million to $70 million as we get more units up and running. 
We also spent over $500 million for acquisitions, mostly for Telford as well as for infill M&A. And $145 million for share repurchases, including $51 million in Q4 at an average price of $50.85.
While supporting these investments, we also lowered net leverage by nearly 0.2 turns and ended the year with significant balance sheet capacity. The investments we made during 2019 are part of our long-term commitment to enhance the resiliency of our business while extending our leadership position within the commercial real estate services industry. In fact, since the last cyclical peak, we have reduced our net leverage by 1.3x, while simultaneously increasing the diversification of our revenues and our exposure to less cyclical businesses, primarily through investments in our outsourcing business.
This, combined with our healthy balance sheet should afford us the ample capacity to take advantage of any potential market dislocations that may occur. Our financial position is unrivaled by our peers and will enable us to opportunistically invest in enhancing our capabilities and extending our long-term growth trajectory across all parts of the economic cycle.
Finally, we have added free cash flow to our earnings release disclosures. Internally, we are continually focusing on optimizing our existing business and evaluating new investments on their ability to accelerate growth while expanding our future cash flows. We believe our ability to grow cash flow while pursuing strong top and bottom line growth helps drive returns for shareholders. And given this, we believe it is important to actively report on free cash flow on a regular basis.
With that, I'll ask you to turn to Slide 14 as Bob provides a few closing thoughts."

Before we take your questions, I'd like to briefly comment on CBRE's efforts around environmental sustainability, since this is a subject that we are hearing about increasingly from our shareholders.
CBRE has long been at the forefront of sustainability issues in our sector. With responsibility for managing nearly 7 billion square feet of space around the world, we are very well positioned to have an impact on sustainability, and we've been doing just that for some time. We've registered more than 5,600 U.S. properties in the ENERGY STAR program and have completed more than 1,000 Lean certifications on behalf of our clients. In our own workplaces, we pledged in 2016 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by the year 2025. We are well on our way to exceeding this goal with emissions already down 28%.
The strides we are making have resulted in CBRE's inclusion in indexes that benchmark sustainability performance, such as the Dow Jones World Sustainability Index and the FTSE4Good Index. Most recently, Barron's named us the 13th most sustainable company out of 1,000 major U.S. companies that were evaluated, reflecting our leading performance on a variety of environmental, social and governance metrics. We look forward to updating the market in May when we publish our annual corporate responsibility report.

We have a very active program, our leaders around the world and across our lines of business, are always looking for acquisition opportunities that will improve our ability to deliver to our clients. And of course, when we do those acquisitions, they help us with scale. We don't start with scale as the parameter we're after. And every once in a while, we'll do one of these transformational acquisitions if we find the right things. So our strategy around M&A has not changed. And we think our opportunity to potentially grow any part of our business remains intact as it relates to M&A."

As you've seen, CBRE ended 2019 with solid growth, highlighting the benefits of our diverse business and resulting in our 10th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth.
Our fourth quarter performance was led by very strong property sales, particularly in the U.S., U.K. and Continental Europe. This performance has extended into 2020 as investors continue to believe commercial real estate is attractive relative to other asset classes.
Growth was also very strong in our Occupier Outsourcing business, Global Workplace Solutions, where our scale and increasingly differentiated capability enable us to capture a growing share of this expanding market. This is particularly true regarding global multiservice opportunities. Leasing declined year-over-year, partially offsetting the gains in sales and outsourcing. However, it is notable that Q4 2019 was the second largest leasing quarter in the history of our company, trailing only 2018's fourth quarter. We remain optimistic on leasing growth in 2020, although we will have challenging comparisons in the year's first half. Our view is informed by a survey of our top leasing clients who indicated they intend to lease slightly more space this year than in 2019.
The contribution from our Real Estate Investments segment was down due largely to a delay in the timing of certain large asset sales. Several of these assets have already been sold in the first quarter. We expect 2020 to be a solid year for asset sales in this business with our development activity at record levels. We continue to see a backdrop that supports strong business performance. While we are closely watching the potential impact of ongoing risks, particularly the coronavirus, we expect global economic growth to be on par with 2019 based on what we know today. With this in mind, we expect that macro conditions and our ability to take market share should drive our 11th consecutive year of solid double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth in 2020. Leah will describe our 2020 outlook in detail after she reviews the quarter's performance and our financial position. Leah?"

Our Advisory Services segment grew fee revenue about 3% over the prior year period, while adjusted EBITDA rose over 4%. This positive operating leverage drove our fifth consecutive quarter of margin expansion in our advisory business, with adjusted EBITDA margin on fee revenue increasing 30 basis points to approach 21%. 
Excluding the impact of OMSR gains, which can fluctuate significantly in any given quarter, our advisory margins expanded by nearly 90 basis points. Performance was driven by notable strengths in EMEA and to a lesser degree, Asia Pacific.
Revenue growth was led by global property sales, which grew 21%, resulting in new quarterly and annual revenue records for property sales. Strong growth was achieved in most parts of the world, led by the United Kingdom, up 44%; Continental Europe, up 34%, which was driven by double-digit growth in our largest markets in the region, France and Germany; and the United States, which was up over 20%. 
We continue to benefit from market share expansion, and for the full year 2019, we gained nearly 120 basis points of share in the U.S., according to Real Capital Analytics.
Our fourth quarter U.S. property sales activity was notably robust for large transactions with sales over $100 million, up 88% compared to last year. We also saw broad-based growth across property types with office, industrial and hotel transactions, all increasing significantly. 
Commercial mortgage origination revenue declined 15% as a result of slower activity from the government-sponsored enterprises earlier in the year. Prior to the formation of the new caps, which, as expected, impacted transaction revenue in the fourth quarter. Origination with other lending sources, notably private equity debt funds and insurance companies, continued to increase.
At the outset of 2020, debt capital remains plentiful at attractive rates from a variety of capital sources, including government-sponsored enterprises, which have actively returned to the market.
Our loan servicing portfolio ended the year at $230 billion, up over 19% from year-end 2018. As expected, leasing activity decelerated sequentially in Q4, with leasing in our advisory business down nearly 7%, which compares with a record quarter in Q4 2018 when leasing revenue rose over 25%. 
Leasing revenue in our largest market, the U.S. declined by about 10%, driven by a particularly tough prior year comparison, which saw growth of nearly 33% and the lagging impact of a slight macroeconomic deterioration that occurred earlier in 2019. In addition, prior year growth included a benefit of about 6% from M&A activity, and we did not see a similar benefit in the current year's fourth quarter.
Lastly, co-working adversely impacted leasing growth by about 3%, a similar level to that of the third quarter of 2019. 
Turning to Slide 9. Our Global Workplace Solutions segment grew growth and fee revenue by approximately 19% and 13%, respectively. Strong revenue growth, combined with focused cost discipline drove adjusted EBITDA growth of nearly 24% on over 120 basis points of margin expansion. Notably, margins improved on a year-over-year basis across all 3 lines of business, facilities management, project management and transaction services.
Occupier demand for multiple services remains robust, with new contracts encompassing our full suite of services accounting for 40% of the new business secured in the fourth quarter, as measured by EBITDA.
In one prominent example, we extended our relationship with Merck, the U.S.-based pharmaceutical company. We have been providing facilities management and project management services in Europe and have now added facilities management in the U.S. and Latin America and expanded into transactions and other real estate services globally.
The GWS new business pipeline also remains strong as we kick-off 2020. This pipeline is dominated by well-known companies with complex worldwide requirements that are well served by a globally integrated firm like CBRE.
Flipping to Slide 10. Let's now take a look at our Real Estate Investment segment. The $9 million year-over-year decline in this segment's adjusted EBITDA stemmed primarily from certain large asset sales in the Development and Investment Management businesses, shifting from the fourth quarter of 2019 to early 2020. This shift resulted in about $18 million of adjusted EBITDA, moving from the fourth quarter of 2019 to the first quarter of 2020. Several of these deals have subsequently closed at valuations in line with previous underwriting assumptions.
Investments in the start-up of our Flexible Workspace business, Hana, also contributed about $8 million to the adjusted EBITDA decline. We opened our first 3 Hana units in 2019, and we expect 15 to 20 units to be opened by the end of 2020. We are pleased with the reception to Hana and believe we are well suited to operate Flexible Workspaces for institutional property owners, given our creditworthiness and the secular growth of agile workspaces. 
We are pursuing a variety of deal structures, including traditional leases and see these structures moving towards partnerships, management agreements or other asset-light structures over time.
For the quarter, we had an adjusted EBITDA contribution of about $11 million, consistent with our underwriting assumptions from Telford Homes, the U.K. multifamily development business we acquired in October 2019. Our results also included about $98 million revenue related to Telford. The integration of this business is proceeding as expected. And we remain excited about the opportunity this acquisition affords us to expand our successful development business into EMEA. This is especially true given the improved sentiment we are seeing in the U.K. with reduced uncertainty now that they have formally withdrawn from the EU.
As expected, the U.S. development business improved in Q4 compared with Q3, despite the impact of some deal slippage into the first quarter of 2020, and we are continuing to transact sales at previously anticipated valuation levels. In addition, underlying market trends remain strong, as evidenced by our in-process portfolio and pipeline, together reaching new record levels at year-end 2019, with our in-process activity increasing by $2.1 billion, while the pipeline increased $2.3 billion, of which more than 65% of the increase was attributable to Telford.
In Investment Management, we raised $13 billion in capital during 2019, while AUM increased by more than $6 billion in the quarter to nearly $113 billion. Both our capital raising and total AUM are new records for the business. Importantly, Investment Management revenue, excluding carried interest, which is largely recurring fee-based revenue, climbed to approximately $395 million for the year. This drove the contribution from recurring adjusted EBITDA within the REI business to over 40% of this segment's full year total adjusted EBITDA.
Turning to our outlook for 2020. On Slide 11, we anticipate another year of solid growth for CBRE, given our current expectation of the continued appeal of commercial real estate relative to other asset classes and our cautiously optimistic view that GDP will expand versus 2019.
We also expect the diversity of our revenue across lines of business, our client base and geographies will be supportive of our growth in 2020. Advisory Services fee revenue is expected to increase in the mid-single-digit range, driven by growth of a similar range in both leasing and capital markets. This outlook reflects the tough comparisons we will face in the first half of the year and the activity we've seen so far in 2020. It also reflects a subdued set of expectations for the APAC region, primarily China, as a result of the impacts from coronavirus.
For the Global Workplace Solutions segment, we anticipate fee revenue rising in the low double-digit percentage range. We expect to renew and/or expand around 90% of our expiring contracts, consistent with our historical average. Given the strong growth we've been delivering in this segment and the highly differentiated platform CBRE offers to our outsourcing clients, we expect to be increasingly focused on profitability. As a result, we expect to continue to be selective going forward about the accounts we are willing to service and how we design our commercial approach to them.
Continuing on Slide 12. We expect solid adjusted EBITDA growth from our Advisory and GWS segments and project adjusted EBITDA from our REI segment will increase significantly to around $250 million, in part due to the previously discussed shift of certain asset sales into 2020. We expect the contribution from REI to be roughly equally weighted between the first and second half of the year as compared to 2019, when over 2/3 of this segment's adjusted EBITDA contribution was recorded in the first half of the year. This also includes an expected $20 million contribution from the Telford acquisition, which we anticipate will be roughly offset by our incremental investment in Hana.
As we ramp up Hana, our OpEx investments for 2020 should be approximately $40 million, with almost half attributable to noncash rent expense.
We also expect the quarterly headwind caused by to abate over the course of the year as occupiers are drawn to our high-quality workspaces, resulting in revenue growth.
In light of all of these factors and our expectations for below the line items, we expect full year 2020 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $4.05 to $4.25. This indicates anticipated growth of around 12% at the midpoint of our range, which, if attained would be our 11th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth.
I would also note that given the cadence of growth achieved in 2019, we would expect 2020 adjusted EPS growth to be higher in the second half than in the first half, with around 60% of total EPS to be generated in the second half of 2020.
Turning to Slide 13. Our long track record of delivering solid growth across our key financial metrics has been supported by our capital allocation process. During 2019, we deployed nearly $930 million of capital. This includes about $272 million for CapEx, net of tenant concessions, of which about half was discretionary in nature and largely attributable to investments made to enhance the value of the CBRE digital platform through enablement CapEx.
This discretionary amount also includes just over $28 million of CapEx to support the launch of Hana. While we expect the investment per unit to decline in 2020, total CapEx related to Hana should increase to between $60 million to $70 million as we get more units up and running. 
We also spent over $500 million for acquisitions, mostly for Telford as well as for infill M&A. And $145 million for share repurchases, including $51 million in Q4 at an average price of $50.85.
While supporting these investments, we also lowered net leverage by nearly 0.2 turns and ended the year with significant balance sheet capacity. The investments we made during 2019 are part of our long-term commitment to enhance the resiliency of our business while extending our leadership position within the commercial real estate services industry. In fact, since the last cyclical peak, we have reduced our net leverage by 1.3x, while simultaneously increasing the diversification of our revenues and our exposure to less cyclical businesses, primarily through investments in our outsourcing business.
This, combined with our healthy balance sheet should afford us the ample capacity to take advantage of any potential market dislocations that may occur. Our financial position is unrivaled by our peers and will enable us to opportunistically invest in enhancing our capabilities and extending our long-term growth trajectory across all parts of the economic cycle.
Finally, we have added free cash flow to our earnings release disclosures. Internally, we are continually focusing on optimizing our existing business and evaluating new investments on their ability to accelerate growth while expanding our future cash flows. We believe our ability to grow cash flow while pursuing strong top and bottom line growth helps drive returns for shareholders. And given this, we believe it is important to actively report on free cash flow on a regular basis.
With that, I'll ask you to turn to Slide 14 as Bob provides a few closing thoughts."

Before we take your questions, I'd like to briefly comment on CBRE's efforts around environmental sustainability, since this is a subject that we are hearing about increasingly from our shareholders.
CBRE has long been at the forefront of sustainability issues in our sector. With responsibility for managing nearly 7 billion square feet of space around the world, we are very well positioned to have an impact on sustainability, and we've been doing just that for some time. We've registered more than 5,600 U.S. properties in the ENERGY STAR program and have completed more than 1,000 Lean certifications on behalf of our clients. In our own workplaces, we pledged in 2016 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by the year 2025. We are well on our way to exceeding this goal with emissions already down 28%.
The strides we are making have resulted in CBRE's inclusion in indexes that benchmark sustainability performance, such as the Dow Jones World Sustainability Index and the FTSE4Good Index. Most recently, Barron's named us the 13th most sustainable company out of 1,000 major U.S. companies that were evaluated, reflecting our leading performance on a variety of environmental, social and governance metrics. We look forward to updating the market in May when we publish our annual corporate responsibility report.

As you've seen, CBRE ended 2019 with solid growth, highlighting the benefits of our diverse business and resulting in our 10th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth.
Our fourth quarter performance was led by very strong property sales, particularly in the U.S., U.K. and Continental Europe. This performance has extended into 2020 as investors continue to believe commercial real estate is attractive relative to other asset classes.
Growth was also very strong in our Occupier Outsourcing business, Global Workplace Solutions, where our scale and increasingly differentiated capability enable us to capture a growing share of this expanding market. This is particularly true regarding global multiservice opportunities. Leasing declined year-over-year, partially offsetting the gains in sales and outsourcing. However, it is notable that Q4 2019 was the second largest leasing quarter in the history of our company, trailing only 2018's fourth quarter. We remain optimistic on leasing growth in 2020, although we will have challenging comparisons in the year's first half. Our view is informed by a survey of our top leasing clients who indicated they intend to lease slightly more space this year than in 2019.
The contribution from our Real Estate Investments segment was down due largely to a delay in the timing of certain large asset sales. Several of these assets have already been sold in the first quarter. We expect 2020 to be a solid year for asset sales in this business with our development activity at record levels. We continue to see a backdrop that supports strong business performance. While we are closely watching the potential impact of ongoing risks, particularly the coronavirus, we expect global economic growth to be on par with 2019 based on what we know today. With this in mind, we expect that macro conditions and our ability to take market share should drive our 11th consecutive year of solid double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth in 2020. Leah will describe our 2020 outlook in detail after she reviews the quarter's performance and our financial position. Leah?"

Our Advisory Services segment grew fee revenue about 3% over the prior year period, while adjusted EBITDA rose over 4%. This positive operating leverage drove our fifth consecutive quarter of margin expansion in our advisory business, with adjusted EBITDA margin on fee revenue increasing 30 basis points to approach 21%. 
Excluding the impact of OMSR gains, which can fluctuate significantly in any given quarter, our advisory margins expanded by nearly 90 basis points. Performance was driven by notable strengths in EMEA and to a lesser degree, Asia Pacific.
Revenue growth was led by global property sales, which grew 21%, resulting in new quarterly and annual revenue records for property sales. Strong growth was achieved in most parts of the world, led by the United Kingdom, up 44%; Continental Europe, up 34%, which was driven by double-digit growth in our largest markets in the region, France and Germany; and the United States, which was up over 20%. 
We continue to benefit from market share expansion, and for the full year 2019, we gained nearly 120 basis points of share in the U.S., according to Real Capital Analytics.
Our fourth quarter U.S. property sales activity was notably robust for large transactions with sales over $100 million, up 88% compared to last year. We also saw broad-based growth across property types with office, industrial and hotel transactions, all increasing significantly. 
Commercial mortgage origination revenue declined 15% as a result of slower activity from the government-sponsored enterprises earlier in the year. Prior to the formation of the new caps, which, as expected, impacted transaction revenue in the fourth quarter. Origination with other lending sources, notably private equity debt funds and insurance companies, continued to increase.
At the outset of 2020, debt capital remains plentiful at attractive rates from a variety of capital sources, including government-sponsored enterprises, which have actively returned to the market.
Our loan servicing portfolio ended the year at $230 billion, up over 19% from year-end 2018. As expected, leasing activity decelerated sequentially in Q4, with leasing in our advisory business down nearly 7%, which compares with a record quarter in Q4 2018 when leasing revenue rose over 25%. 
Leasing revenue in our largest market, the U.S. declined by about 10%, driven by a particularly tough prior year comparison, which saw growth of nearly 33% and the lagging impact of a slight macroeconomic deterioration that occurred earlier in 2019. In addition, prior year growth included a benefit of about 6% from M&A activity, and we did not see a similar benefit in the current year's fourth quarter.
Lastly, co-working adversely impacted leasing growth by about 3%, a similar level to that of the third quarter of 2019. 
Turning to Slide 9. Our Global Workplace Solutions segment grew growth and fee revenue by approximately 19% and 13%, respectively. Strong revenue growth, combined with focused cost discipline drove adjusted EBITDA growth of nearly 24% on over 120 basis points of margin expansion. Notably, margins improved on a year-over-year basis across all 3 lines of business, facilities management, project management and transaction services.
Occupier demand for multiple services remains robust, with new contracts encompassing our full suite of services accounting for 40% of the new business secured in the fourth quarter, as measured by EBITDA.
In one prominent example, we extended our relationship with Merck, the U.S.-based pharmaceutical company. We have been providing facilities management and project management services in Europe and have now added facilities management in the U.S. and Latin America and expanded into transactions and other real estate services globally.
The GWS new business pipeline also remains strong as we kick-off 2020. This pipeline is dominated by well-known companies with complex worldwide requirements that are well served by a globally integrated firm like CBRE.
Flipping to Slide 10. Let's now take a look at our Real Estate Investment segment. The $9 million year-over-year decline in this segment's adjusted EBITDA stemmed primarily from certain large asset sales in the Development and Investment Management businesses, shifting from the fourth quarter of 2019 to early 2020. This shift resulted in about $18 million of adjusted EBITDA, moving from the fourth quarter of 2019 to the first quarter of 2020. Several of these deals have subsequently closed at valuations in line with previous underwriting assumptions.
Investments in the start-up of our Flexible Workspace business, Hana, also contributed about $8 million to the adjusted EBITDA decline. We opened our first 3 Hana units in 2019, and we expect 15 to 20 units to be opened by the end of 2020. We are pleased with the reception to Hana and believe we are well suited to operate Flexible Workspaces for institutional property owners, given our creditworthiness and the secular growth of agile workspaces. 
We are pursuing a variety of deal structures, including traditional leases and see these structures moving towards partnerships, management agreements or other asset-light structures over time.
For the quarter, we had an adjusted EBITDA contribution of about $11 million, consistent with our underwriting assumptions from Telford Homes, the U.K. multifamily development business we acquired in October 2019. Our results also included about $98 million revenue related to Telford. The integration of this business is proceeding as expected. And we remain excited about the opportunity this acquisition affords us to expand our successful development business into EMEA. This is especially true given the improved sentiment we are seeing in the U.K. with reduced uncertainty now that they have formally withdrawn from the EU.
As expected, the U.S. development business improved in Q4 compared with Q3, despite the impact of some deal slippage into the first quarter of 2020, and we are continuing to transact sales at previously anticipated valuation levels. In addition, underlying market trends remain strong, as evidenced by our in-process portfolio and pipeline, together reaching new record levels at year-end 2019, with our in-process activity increasing by $2.1 billion, while the pipeline increased $2.3 billion, of which more than 65% of the increase was attributable to Telford.
In Investment Management, we raised $13 billion in capital during 2019, while AUM increased by more than $6 billion in the quarter to nearly $113 billion. Both our capital raising and total AUM are new records for the business. Importantly, Investment Management revenue, excluding carried interest, which is largely recurring fee-based revenue, climbed to approximately $395 million for the year. This drove the contribution from recurring adjusted EBITDA within the REI business to over 40% of this segment's full year total adjusted EBITDA.
Turning to our outlook for 2020. On Slide 11, we anticipate another year of solid growth for CBRE, given our current expectation of the continued appeal of commercial real estate relative to other asset classes and our cautiously optimistic view that GDP will expand versus 2019.
We also expect the diversity of our revenue across lines of business, our client base and geographies will be supportive of our growth in 2020. Advisory Services fee revenue is expected to increase in the mid-single-digit range, driven by growth of a similar range in both leasing and capital markets. This outlook reflects the tough comparisons we will face in the first half of the year and the activity we've seen so far in 2020. It also reflects a subdued set of expectations for the APAC region, primarily China, as a result of the impacts from coronavirus.
For the Global Workplace Solutions segment, we anticipate fee revenue rising in the low double-digit percentage range. We expect to renew and/or expand around 90% of our expiring contracts, consistent with our historical average. Given the strong growth we've been delivering in this segment and the highly differentiated platform CBRE offers to our outsourcing clients, we expect to be increasingly focused on profitability. As a result, we expect to continue to be selective going forward about the accounts we are willing to service and how we design our commercial approach to them.
Continuing on Slide 12. We expect solid adjusted EBITDA growth from our Advisory and GWS segments and project adjusted EBITDA from our REI segment will increase significantly to around $250 million, in part due to the previously discussed shift of certain asset sales into 2020. We expect the contribution from REI to be roughly equally weighted between the first and second half of the year as compared to 2019, when over 2/3 of this segment's adjusted EBITDA contribution was recorded in the first half of the year. This also includes an expected $20 million contribution from the Telford acquisition, which we anticipate will be roughly offset by our incremental investment in Hana.
As we ramp up Hana, our OpEx investments for 2020 should be approximately $40 million, with almost half attributable to noncash rent expense.
We also expect the quarterly headwind caused by to abate over the course of the year as occupiers are drawn to our high-quality workspaces, resulting in revenue growth.
In light of all of these factors and our expectations for below the line items, we expect full year 2020 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $4.05 to $4.25. This indicates anticipated growth of around 12% at the midpoint of our range, which, if attained would be our 11th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth.
I would also note that given the cadence of growth achieved in 2019, we would expect 2020 adjusted EPS growth to be higher in the second half than in the first half, with around 60% of total EPS to be generated in the second half of 2020.
Turning to Slide 13. Our long track record of delivering solid growth across our key financial metrics has been supported by our capital allocation process. During 2019, we deployed nearly $930 million of capital. This includes about $272 million for CapEx, net of tenant concessions, of which about half was discretionary in nature and largely attributable to investments made to enhance the value of the CBRE digital platform through enablement CapEx.
This discretionary amount also includes just over $28 million of CapEx to support the launch of Hana. While we expect the investment per unit to decline in 2020, total CapEx related to Hana should increase to between $60 million to $70 million as we get more units up and running. 
We also spent over $500 million for acquisitions, mostly for Telford as well as for infill M&A. And $145 million for share repurchases, including $51 million in Q4 at an average price of $50.85.
While supporting these investments, we also lowered net leverage by nearly 0.2 turns and ended the year with significant balance sheet capacity. The investments we made during 2019 are part of our long-term commitment to enhance the resiliency of our business while extending our leadership position within the commercial real estate services industry. In fact, since the last cyclical peak, we have reduced our net leverage by 1.3x, while simultaneously increasing the diversification of our revenues and our exposure to less cyclical businesses, primarily through investments in our outsourcing business.
This, combined with our healthy balance sheet should afford us the ample capacity to take advantage of any potential market dislocations that may occur. Our financial position is unrivaled by our peers and will enable us to opportunistically invest in enhancing our capabilities and extending our long-term growth trajectory across all parts of the economic cycle.
Finally, we have added free cash flow to our earnings release disclosures. Internally, we are continually focusing on optimizing our existing business and evaluating new investments on their ability to accelerate growth while expanding our future cash flows. We believe our ability to grow cash flow while pursuing strong top and bottom line growth helps drive returns for shareholders. And given this, we believe it is important to actively report on free cash flow on a regular basis.
With that, I'll ask you to turn to Slide 14 as Bob provides a few closing thoughts."

Before we take your questions, I'd like to briefly comment on CBRE's efforts around environmental sustainability, since this is a subject that we are hearing about increasingly from our shareholders.
CBRE has long been at the forefront of sustainability issues in our sector. With responsibility for managing nearly 7 billion square feet of space around the world, we are very well positioned to have an impact on sustainability, and we've been doing just that for some time. We've registered more than 5,600 U.S. properties in the ENERGY STAR program and have completed more than 1,000 Lean certifications on behalf of our clients. In our own workplaces, we pledged in 2016 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by the year 2025. We are well on our way to exceeding this goal with emissions already down 28%.
The strides we are making have resulted in CBRE's inclusion in indexes that benchmark sustainability performance, such as the Dow Jones World Sustainability Index and the FTSE4Good Index. Most recently, Barron's named us the 13th most sustainable company out of 1,000 major U.S. companies that were evaluated, reflecting our leading performance on a variety of environmental, social and governance metrics. We look forward to updating the market in May when we publish our annual corporate responsibility report.

As you've seen, CBRE ended 2019 with solid growth, highlighting the benefits of our diverse business and resulting in our 10th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth.
Our fourth quarter performance was led by very strong property sales, particularly in the U.S., U.K. and Continental Europe. This performance has extended into 2020 as investors continue to believe commercial real estate is attractive relative to other asset classes.
Growth was also very strong in our Occupier Outsourcing business, Global Workplace Solutions, where our scale and increasingly differentiated capability enable us to capture a growing share of this expanding market. This is particularly true regarding global multiservice opportunities. Leasing declined year-over-year, partially offsetting the gains in sales and outsourcing. However, it is notable that Q4 2019 was the second largest leasing quarter in the history of our company, trailing only 2018's fourth quarter. We remain optimistic on leasing growth in 2020, although we will have challenging comparisons in the year's first half. Our view is informed by a survey of our top leasing clients who indicated they intend to lease slightly more space this year than in 2019.
The contribution from our Real Estate Investments segment was down due largely to a delay in the timing of certain large asset sales. Several of these assets have already been sold in the first quarter. We expect 2020 to be a solid year for asset sales in this business with our development activity at record levels. We continue to see a backdrop that supports strong business performance. While we are closely watching the potential impact of ongoing risks, particularly the coronavirus, we expect global economic growth to be on par with 2019 based on what we know today. With this in mind, we expect that macro conditions and our ability to take market share should drive our 11th consecutive year of solid double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth in 2020. Leah will describe our 2020 outlook in detail after she reviews the quarter's performance and our financial position. Leah?"

Our Advisory Services segment grew fee revenue about 3% over the prior year period, while adjusted EBITDA rose over 4%. This positive operating leverage drove our fifth consecutive quarter of margin expansion in our advisory business, with adjusted EBITDA margin on fee revenue increasing 30 basis points to approach 21%. 
Excluding the impact of OMSR gains, which can fluctuate significantly in any given quarter, our advisory margins expanded by nearly 90 basis points. Performance was driven by notable strengths in EMEA and to a lesser degree, Asia Pacific.
Revenue growth was led by global property sales, which grew 21%, resulting in new quarterly and annual revenue records for property sales. Strong growth was achieved in most parts of the world, led by the United Kingdom, up 44%; Continental Europe, up 34%, which was driven by double-digit growth in our largest markets in the region, France and Germany; and the United States, which was up over 20%. 
We continue to benefit from market share expansion, and for the full year 2019, we gained nearly 120 basis points of share in the U.S., according to Real Capital Analytics.
Our fourth quarter U.S. property sales activity was notably robust for large transactions with sales over $100 million, up 88% compared to last year. We also saw broad-based growth across property types with office, industrial and hotel transactions, all increasing significantly. 
Commercial mortgage origination revenue declined 15% as a result of slower activity from the government-sponsored enterprises earlier in the year. Prior to the formation of the new caps, which, as expected, impacted transaction revenue in the fourth quarter. Origination with other lending sources, notably private equity debt funds and insurance companies, continued to increase.
At the outset of 2020, debt capital remains plentiful at attractive rates from a variety of capital sources, including government-sponsored enterprises, which have actively returned to the market.
Our loan servicing portfolio ended the year at $230 billion, up over 19% from year-end 2018. As expected, leasing activity decelerated sequentially in Q4, with leasing in our advisory business down nearly 7%, which compares with a record quarter in Q4 2018 when leasing revenue rose over 25%. 
Leasing revenue in our largest market, the U.S. declined by about 10%, driven by a particularly tough prior year comparison, which saw growth of nearly 33% and the lagging impact of a slight macroeconomic deterioration that occurred earlier in 2019. In addition, prior year growth included a benefit of about 6% from M&A activity, and we did not see a similar benefit in the current year's fourth quarter.
Lastly, co-working adversely impacted leasing growth by about 3%, a similar level to that of the third quarter of 2019. 
Turning to Slide 9. Our Global Workplace Solutions segment grew growth and fee revenue by approximately 19% and 13%, respectively. Strong revenue growth, combined with focused cost discipline drove adjusted EBITDA growth of nearly 24% on over 120 basis points of margin expansion. Notably, margins improved on a year-over-year basis across all 3 lines of business, facilities management, project management and transaction services.
Occupier demand for multiple services remains robust, with new contracts encompassing our full suite of services accounting for 40% of the new business secured in the fourth quarter, as measured by EBITDA.
In one prominent example, we extended our relationship with Merck, the U.S.-based pharmaceutical company. We have been providing facilities management and project management services in Europe and have now added facilities management in the U.S. and Latin America and expanded into transactions and other real estate services globally.
The GWS new business pipeline also remains strong as we kick-off 2020. This pipeline is dominated by well-known companies with complex worldwide requirements that are well served by a globally integrated firm like CBRE.
Flipping to Slide 10. Let's now take a look at our Real Estate Investment segment. The $9 million year-over-year decline in this segment's adjusted EBITDA stemmed primarily from certain large asset sales in the Development and Investment Management businesses, shifting from the fourth quarter of 2019 to early 2020. This shift resulted in about $18 million of adjusted EBITDA, moving from the fourth quarter of 2019 to the first quarter of 2020. Several of these deals have subsequently closed at valuations in line with previous underwriting assumptions.
Investments in the start-up of our Flexible Workspace business, Hana, also contributed about $8 million to the adjusted EBITDA decline. We opened our first 3 Hana units in 2019, and we expect 15 to 20 units to be opened by the end of 2020. We are pleased with the reception to Hana and believe we are well suited to operate Flexible Workspaces for institutional property owners, given our creditworthiness and the secular growth of agile workspaces. 
We are pursuing a variety of deal structures, including traditional leases and see these structures moving towards partnerships, management agreements or other asset-light structures over time.
For the quarter, we had an adjusted EBITDA contribution of about $11 million, consistent with our underwriting assumptions from Telford Homes, the U.K. multifamily development business we acquired in October 2019. Our results also included about $98 million revenue related to Telford. The integration of this business is proceeding as expected. And we remain excited about the opportunity this acquisition affords us to expand our successful development business into EMEA. This is especially true given the improved sentiment we are seeing in the U.K. with reduced uncertainty now that they have formally withdrawn from the EU.
As expected, the U.S. development business improved in Q4 compared with Q3, despite the impact of some deal slippage into the first quarter of 2020, and we are continuing to transact sales at previously anticipated valuation levels. In addition, underlying market trends remain strong, as evidenced by our in-process portfolio and pipeline, together reaching new record levels at year-end 2019, with our in-process activity increasing by $2.1 billion, while the pipeline increased $2.3 billion, of which more than 65% of the increase was attributable to Telford.
In Investment Management, we raised $13 billion in capital during 2019, while AUM increased by more than $6 billion in the quarter to nearly $113 billion. Both our capital raising and total AUM are new records for the business. Importantly, Investment Management revenue, excluding carried interest, which is largely recurring fee-based revenue, climbed to approximately $395 million for the year. This drove the contribution from recurring adjusted EBITDA within the REI business to over 40% of this segment's full year total adjusted EBITDA.
Turning to our outlook for 2020. On Slide 11, we anticipate another year of solid growth for CBRE, given our current expectation of the continued appeal of commercial real estate relative to other asset classes and our cautiously optimistic view that GDP will expand versus 2019.
We also expect the diversity of our revenue across lines of business, our client base and geographies will be supportive of our growth in 2020. Advisory Services fee revenue is expected to increase in the mid-single-digit range, driven by growth of a similar range in both leasing and capital markets. This outlook reflects the tough comparisons we will face in the first half of the year and the activity we've seen so far in 2020. It also reflects a subdued set of expectations for the APAC region, primarily China, as a result of the impacts from coronavirus.
For the Global Workplace Solutions segment, we anticipate fee revenue rising in the low double-digit percentage range. We expect to renew and/or expand around 90% of our expiring contracts, consistent with our historical average. Given the strong growth we've been delivering in this segment and the highly differentiated platform CBRE offers to our outsourcing clients, we expect to be increasingly focused on profitability. As a result, we expect to continue to be selective going forward about the accounts we are willing to service and how we design our commercial approach to them.
Continuing on Slide 12. We expect solid adjusted EBITDA growth from our Advisory and GWS segments and project adjusted EBITDA from our REI segment will increase significantly to around $250 million, in part due to the previously discussed shift of certain asset sales into 2020. We expect the contribution from REI to be roughly equally weighted between the first and second half of the year as compared to 2019, when over 2/3 of this segment's adjusted EBITDA contribution was recorded in the first half of the year. This also includes an expected $20 million contribution from the Telford acquisition, which we anticipate will be roughly offset by our incremental investment in Hana.
As we ramp up Hana, our OpEx investments for 2020 should be approximately $40 million, with almost half attributable to noncash rent expense.
We also expect the quarterly headwind caused by to abate over the course of the year as occupiers are drawn to our high-quality workspaces, resulting in revenue growth.
In light of all of these factors and our expectations for below the line items, we expect full year 2020 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $4.05 to $4.25. This indicates anticipated growth of around 12% at the midpoint of our range, which, if attained would be our 11th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth.
I would also note that given the cadence of growth achieved in 2019, we would expect 2020 adjusted EPS growth to be higher in the second half than in the first half, with around 60% of total EPS to be generated in the second half of 2020.
Turning to Slide 13. Our long track record of delivering solid growth across our key financial metrics has been supported by our capital allocation process. During 2019, we deployed nearly $930 million of capital. This includes about $272 million for CapEx, net of tenant concessions, of which about half was discretionary in nature and largely attributable to investments made to enhance the value of the CBRE digital platform through enablement CapEx.
This discretionary amount also includes just over $28 million of CapEx to support the launch of Hana. While we expect the investment per unit to decline in 2020, total CapEx related to Hana should increase to between $60 million to $70 million as we get more units up and running. 
We also spent over $500 million for acquisitions, mostly for Telford as well as for infill M&A. And $145 million for share repurchases, including $51 million in Q4 at an average price of $50.85.
While supporting these investments, we also lowered net leverage by nearly 0.2 turns and ended the year with significant balance sheet capacity. The investments we made during 2019 are part of our long-term commitment to enhance the resiliency of our business while extending our leadership position within the commercial real estate services industry. In fact, since the last cyclical peak, we have reduced our net leverage by 1.3x, while simultaneously increasing the diversification of our revenues and our exposure to less cyclical businesses, primarily through investments in our outsourcing business.
This, combined with our healthy balance sheet should afford us the ample capacity to take advantage of any potential market dislocations that may occur. Our financial position is unrivaled by our peers and will enable us to opportunistically invest in enhancing our capabilities and extending our long-term growth trajectory across all parts of the economic cycle.
Finally, we have added free cash flow to our earnings release disclosures. Internally, we are continually focusing on optimizing our existing business and evaluating new investments on their ability to accelerate growth while expanding our future cash flows. We believe our ability to grow cash flow while pursuing strong top and bottom line growth helps drive returns for shareholders. And given this, we believe it is important to actively report on free cash flow on a regular basis.
With that, I'll ask you to turn to Slide 14 as Bob provides a few closing thoughts."

Before we take your questions, I'd like to briefly comment on CBRE's efforts around environmental sustainability, since this is a subject that we are hearing about increasingly from our shareholders.
CBRE has long been at the forefront of sustainability issues in our sector. With responsibility for managing nearly 7 billion square feet of space around the world, we are very well positioned to have an impact on sustainability, and we've been doing just that for some time. We've registered more than 5,600 U.S. properties in the ENERGY STAR program and have completed more than 1,000 Lean certifications on behalf of our clients. In our own workplaces, we pledged in 2016 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by the year 2025. We are well on our way to exceeding this goal with emissions already down 28%.
The strides we are making have resulted in CBRE's inclusion in indexes that benchmark sustainability performance, such as the Dow Jones World Sustainability Index and the FTSE4Good Index. Most recently, Barron's named us the 13th most sustainable company out of 1,000 major U.S. companies that were evaluated, reflecting our leading performance on a variety of environmental, social and governance metrics. We look forward to updating the market in May when we publish our annual corporate responsibility report. 
With that, operator, we'll open the line for questions."

Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows: First, I'll provide an overview of our financial results for the quarter; next, Bob Sulentic, our President and CEO; and Leah stearns, our CFO, will discuss our first quarter results in more detail. After these comments, we'll open up the call for your questions.
Before I begin, I'll remind you that this presentation contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Future growth prospects, operations, market share, capital deployment, acquisition integration, financial performance and 2020 outlook, including the impact of COVID-19 and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical fact. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. For a full discussion of the risks and other factors that may impact these forward-looking statements, please refer to this morning's earnings release and our most recent annual and quarterly reports filed on Form 10-K and 10-Q, respectively. We have provided reconciliations of adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, fee revenue and certain other non-GAAP financial measures included in our remarks to the most directly comparable GAAP measures together with explanations of these measures in the appendix of this presentation slide deck.
Now please turn to Slide 4 of our presentation, which highlights our financial results for the first quarter of 2020. Combined services revenue grew 13%, while adjusted EBITDA rose 8%, primarily driven by advisory services. Adjusted EBITDA in our Real Estate investment segment fell 56% year-over-year, largely due to a $27 million decline in co-investments in our Public Securities business, driven by the equity market sell-off at the end of the quarter and fewer large development deals that in Q1 2019. Overall, adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA decreased modestly versus the prior year with strength in advisory services offsetting most of the REI decline. As a reminder, this will be the last quarter that we will provide geographic level disclosures based on the old segment reporting in our Excel supplemental, given the change to reporting 3 global business segments that we adopted at the beginning of 2019.
Now for an update on our business fundamentals, please turn to Slide 6, and I will turn the call over to Bob."

We hope all of you are coping with COVID-19's many disruptions, and we wish you and your families good health during this very difficult time. We are encouraged by the emerging signs that COVID-19 is being brought under control and early moves by some governments to reopen parts of their economies. We hope this progress can continue, and we extend our thanks to everyone on the front lines of the battle with this disease. With the global economy in a recession today, the steps we have taken over the past decade to strengthen CBRE have prepared us well for the current environment. Compared with the global financial crisis, we have a stronger market position across our business lines, a more diversified and contractual revenue base. A significantly stronger balance sheet with markedly more liquidity and a leadership team that is far better equipped to manage our cost structure. As the impact of COVID-19 began to emerge, we moved aggressively in early to take out nonessential costs. In early April, I decided to forgo my salary and our top executive leaders also agreed to meaningfully reduce their compensation. While these moves do not materially impact our financials, they create a precedent that allows us to take on other difficult actions to adjust our workforce to reflect lower levels of client demand. These moves include some job eliminations, but mostly consist of furloughs and reduced work schedules, giving us flexibility to bring back staff as needed when business activity resumes. The coming quarters will no doubt be challenging for our industry. In light of how suddenly and severely, economic growth has collapsed, we are taking actions to mitigate the impact across every part of our business, which Leah will cover in her remarks.
Notably, we moved 100% of our people who work from CBRE offices in the U.S. to working from home on the night of March 13. This seamless transition confirmed the scalability of our digital and technology infrastructure and the adaptability of our workforce. Every substantial downturn creates fundamental changes in the way that commercial real estate is designed, developed, financed and used. I will cite 5 examples that occurred in the aftermath of the great financial crisis. First, e-commerce catalyzed a sharp increase in warehouse and logistics space utilization. Second, demand exploded for institutionally managed multifamily housing. Third, the growth of real estate outsourcing accelerated as companies pursued greater cost efficiencies. Fourth, an increased emphasis on the office occupancy experience drove demand for leasing and related project services. And finally, property ownership became much more institutional with well capitalized investors depending on third-party firms to manage, lease, value, finance and monetize these assets. CBRE benefited in a big way from each of these trends, which taken together, had a major impact on our decade-long record of robust growth. COVID-19 is likely to bring about equally powerful changes to our sector, and we believe CBRE is again well positioned for our industry's next evolution. Given our strong balance sheet and industry-leading market position, we are poised to withstand the negative impacts of COVID-19, while also remaining very focused on identifying and capitalizing on potential long-term growth catalysts that will emerge from this crisis.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Leah."

Our advisory Services segment grew fee revenue about 5%, while adjusted EBITDA rose nearly 11%. Advisory adjusted EBITDA margin on fee revenue increased 100 basis points to 17.5%. The segment's sixth consecutive quarter of",1572,"Thanks, Bob. Turning to Slide 8. Our advisory Services segment grew fee revenue about 5%, while adjusted EBITDA rose nearly 11%. Advisory adjusted EBITDA margin on fee revenue increased 100 basis points to 17.5%. The segment's sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin expansion. For most of our markets, COVID-19 did not have a material impact until mid-March. In January and February, our U.S. sales and leasing businesses posted healthy gains, but revenue declined by mid-teens in March. In April, U.S. sales and leasing revenue declined over 40% from April 2019 levels. Across the rest of our transactional business, declines were more muted due to its diversified geographic footprint. In response to these trends, we have taken decisive action to temporarily lower costs within our transactional business through furloughs of non revenue-generating staff as well as reduced nonessential costs such as promotional and travel and entertainment expenses. Despite these late quarter pressures, revenue growth for our property sales business rose by 12% during Q1, which was a new all-time high for CBRE in first quarter property sales revenue. Growth was led by North Asia, as strength in Japan offset weakness in Greater China, and in Continental Europe, where our largest market, France and Germany delivered double-digit revenue gains. In the U.S., property sales revenue was up 3%. The increase was tempered by a decline in average deal size. During the quarter and continuing the trend we saw emerge in late 2019, leasing revenue slipped by 2% on both a global basis and in our largest market, the U.S. This decline reflects very tough comparisons with Q1 2019 when recent growth was more than 20% globally and 28% in the U.S. Like the prior 2 quarters, activity with co-working providers lowered U.S. leasing growth by about 3%. Certain Advisory segment revenues were less impacted by COVID-19 in Q1, including our loan servicing, valuations and property management businesses. During the quarter, these lines of business accounted for approximately 22% of the Advisory segment revenues and delivered 8% revenue growth.
Turning to Slide 9. Our Global Workplace Solutions segment grew growth and fee revenue by approximately 18% and 17%, respectively. Fee revenue rose 20% in facilities management and nearly 16% in project management. We had our best quarter ever for contract renewals with a rate that was once again over 90%, and we secured new business with large high-quality clients in the transportation and logistics and life sciences sectors. Adjusted EBITDA was flat with the prior year period. This primarily reflected a write-down of receivables due to a contract settlement with a client, which reduced the adjusted EBITDA margin for this segment by 110 basis points. There were also some other items such as a shift to lower margin facilities management and COVID-related expenses that also weighed on the margin. Since the emergence of COVID-19, our GWS team has been highly focused on helping our clients navigate this challenging situation and enhancing our long-term partnerships, which Bob will discuss in his closing remarks.
Turning to Slide 10. Let's now look at our Real Estate Investment segment, where adjusted EBITDA fell 56% year-over-year to $38 million. This primarily was driven by a $27 million decline in co-investment returns provided by our Public securities business, reflecting the sharp equity market selloff at the end of the quarter. We also faced a tough comparison for large development asset sales, which were particularly strong in Q1 2019. Activity in our development business started 2020 strong with several deals, which we had expected to close in late Q4, being completed within the first 30 days of the year. Later in the quarter and partially attributable to the early impact of COVID-19, we saw further delays in development transactions. Importantly, these declines were partially offset by our investment management business, which saw continued growth in recurring revenue, which climbed 7% over prior year and contributed $20 million and adjusted EBITDA, over 50% of this segment's total in the quarter.
Finally, investment in the start-up of our enterprise-focused flexible workspace business, HANA, subtracted about $9 million from adjusted EBITDA.
Looking at Slide 11. Let's now take a look at our 2020 outlook. Given the uncertainty caused by COVID-19, we have withdrawn our explicit EPS guidance for the year and will instead provide qualitative commentary for each of our business segments. In Advisory, we expect a significant drop in revenue from our two largest business lines, leasing and property sales. That will outpace the decline in economic activity. As I highlighted previously, April's sales and leasing revenue in the U.S. contracted severely and the timing and the velocity of any recovery is highly dependent on the trajectory of the containment of COVID-19 as well as the recovery of consumer and business sentiments. Additionally, while our business is geographically diverse, the U.S. and U.K. comprise more than 70% of our global leasing and property sales revenue in 2019. We also expect loan origination volumes to decline due to continued economic uncertainty, which will weigh on loan servicing revenue. We will also need to support modest liquidity requirements necessitated by the GSE's rent forbearance, specifically for Fannie Mae, which comprises about 12% of our loan servicing portfolio. Thus far, a dominiums number of borrowers have been approved for forbearance, and this has not had a material impact on our business to date. Lastly, about 2/3 of the cost of sales in our Advisory business is variable in nature as commissions decline in steps with transaction volumes. This should help to support our margins in this segment as cost of sales comprise the majority of our total costs in Advisory.
Moving to GWS, where revenue is generated from multiyear contracts. We expect this segment to be relatively resilient and continue to expect positive revenue growth, albeit at a rate lower than our original expectations as the pandemic creates pressures not seen in previous downturns, largely stemming from logistical challenges. Our expectations for growth in GWS reflects the in-year impact of our new business secured in 2019, which is being partially offset by the operational challenges and onboarding new clients as a result of the current shelter in place orders. In addition, we are absorbing certain COVID-19 costs within our GWS business to ensure we are fully prepared to support our clients as they reopen their business locations. In addition, while infrequent, we have experienced business upsets on certain GWS client accounts. Given the slower pace of growth expected in 2020, we are focused on improving our business processes to ensure we are ready to accelerate growth when business conditions rebound. We continue to believe that our outsourcing business is positioned to benefit from challenging economic conditions, offering clients more efficient and cost-effective facility solutions. We expect project management, which comprises about 12% of our GWS Segment revenue to see near-term pressures as clients delay some work.
Looking at REI. We believe this business segment is positioned to perform more resiliently than in previous recessions. Our development business is in a relatively strong position with conservatively financed projects, stable equity partners, and a pipeline that is heavily weighted toward core industrial and logistics projects as well as office properties that are about 80% pre-leased. Nonetheless, the pace of development asset dispositions will continue to slow in the near-term as we and our equity partners are not under pressure to monetize assets quickly. Revenue and adjusted EBITDA and investment management is highly recurring, as I mentioned earlier, and we expect the impact of co-investments to ease over time as we reduce our exposure to publicly traded securities. As you would expect, we've also started to incur costs directly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, which totaled around $3 million in Q1. These costs are expected to increase as we prepare offices for the return of our employees, incur incremental compensation for certain employees required to work on-site and enhance safety training.
Lastly, we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of the dislocation in the flexible workspace market, and have positioned Hana to serve enterprise clients that desire private workspaces. However, in the short term, we will slow the pace of expected Hana unit openings in 2020. Until we have more clarity around COVID-19 impact on occupier demand.
Turning to Slide 12. Our financial position is strong, $0.4 billion, no debt maturities until 2023 and an investment-grade credit rating. Our significant balance sheet flexibility provides us a solid foundation from which to execute our strategy. In 2020, our capital allocation will continue to prioritize internal investments in our platform and people to drive superior client outcomes and long-term growth. Our M&A strategy is focused on enhancing and differentiating our capabilities globally, and we believe that COVID-19 crisis may lead to unique and compelling opportunities. Finally, we may utilize our share repurchase program to continue offsetting the impact of our stock-based compensation program. And on a more opportunistic basis, if we believe our stock presents an attractive investment compared with other discretionary uses. While the current situation is highly uncertain, we're confident that we've enhanced the resiliency of our business and our capital structure to build upon our industry leadership position. In addition, our senior leadership team is taking decisive action to identify opportunities to further differentiate CBRE and position the business to accelerate once we are more certain of an economic recovery.
With that, I'll ask you to turn to Slide 13, as Bob provides a few closing thoughts."

Before we conclude this morning's call, I'll take a few minutes to highlight ways that CBRE's business activities for clients are producing social good. We know this is of great importance to many of our shareholders because they tell us so on a regular basis. And with the COVID-19 pandemic, the need has never been more urgent. CBRE teams around the world have been going to extraordinary links to serve our clients as they react to the demands of COVID-19. In Spain, our team worked with our client, the Hospital Del Mar to convert the Hotel Barcelona Princess into an extension of the hospital. The 363 room field hospital opened on April 1 and serves more than 200 COVID-19 patients. CBRE's on-site technicians provided essential maintenance and installation services to keep the field hospital running. In the U.K., we supported our client national exhibition center in the creation of its Birmingham Nightingale Field Hospital for COVID-19 patients. The first phase of the hospital opened on April 16, our team delivered essential materials and services and provides ongoing maintenance of the hospital. In Atlanta, our project management team worked with our client, Piedmont Healthcare to move up the opening of the patient floors in a new building under construction by more than 3 months to create more capacity as the hospital prepared for potentially higher admissions due to COVID-19. While many of our people have been working remotely, we have some 40,000 professionals like the ones highlighted here who have been working at client locations to keep properties operational and essential projects moving forward. They are among the unsung heroes of the COVID-19 crisis, and we salute them. We also recognize that COVID-19 has caused significant hardship for some of our CBRE people. In response, we have set aside $5 million of our more than $15 million COVID-19 relief fund to help colleagues who have fallen on hard times. The fund's remaining $10 million is dedicated to support regional and local organizations that are alleviating COVID-19 worst defects around the world. It's part of our commitment to looking out for one another as well as for our communities.
With that, operator, we'll open the lines for questions."

Clearly, we have a very big industrial business. We develop it, we sell it, we manage it, we finance it. And everything that's about COVID-19 that's driving e-commerce will drive the use of industrial space, and that will be an opportunity. We think multifamily will continue to grow around the world. We develop it. We finance it. We sell it. And we've got this new business in the U.K. that while in the short run, is under pressure, Telford, because of what's going on, there's going to be a real secular push for institutionally managed multifamily there. Office space is going to be a little confusing. In the short run, there's going to be a lot of discovery about working from home versus working in offices. Our best guess is that there'll be more working from home and less dense use of office, lots of services provided to get to that state of affairs. And sometimes when you can't figure out what's going to happen, you look for clues, we think a good analogy is what happened in the last 3 years before COVID-19 when there was an intense move toward alternative workplace in office space around the world. And one of the big concerns about that was that occupiers were going to be able to use 65%, 70%, 75% of the space that they had previously occupied. That, in fact, happened. But it also created for ourselves and our competitors, one of the biggest opportunities we've seen in years as there was a lot of opportunity to do new leasing, reconfigure space, et cetera. So we're going to watch what happens with our office space. We also think there's going to be something that goes on in the middle between what happens at home and what happens in multi-tenant buildings with flex spaces. It's not going to be co-working as we've known it with membership type circumstances, but we think suites type high-quality with real data security very professionally managed is going to be quite attractive to some subset of occupiers as they serve their people working from home, maybe smaller populations, permanent populations in office PAUSE and our Hana product, we think, is well positioned to take advantage of that if that happens. We very much like the positioning of that product, which is suites oriented. So those are some of the things that could happen. There will be other things outsourcing will almost inevitably accelerate because of the intense focus on cost control that corporations have. We will benefit from that. So we're watching all these things, and there'll be some things happen that we can't see as we sit here right now."

It was an opportunity to take advantage of the brand we have, the capabilities we have, the balance sheet we have to go into a market where we hadn't been before and build a capability that was very much in line with the secular trend where we had a lot of knowledge a lot of market presence and other things. And it was a great size bet for us with the assumption of that $440 million, and it made our business materially stronger. You should expect to see us do that across our 3 segments going forward, and we're not pushing any one segment more or less than the others.

We do believe the flex space market is going to be real. It's going to be important to landlords. We're spending a lot of time with our big occupiers. We know they're going to want some of that capability in their portfolio. It's going to be different than what most of the flex space market has been historically. Much of it's been around the membership model, individuals or small groups in shared space. Hana from day one has been a suite product. Hana from day one has been higher quality, less dense, very strong on data security. We think it's a product that very likely could play quite well going forward. Of course, we're going to have to watch and see what happens. We also believe that there's a real chance, and we're in discussions with some landlords on this that landlords that want to control flex space in their own buildings, high-quality, flex space, suites oriented, we're going to want to have somebody white label that for them because they do not want to try to build the infrastructure themselves to operate it.

Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing our financial results, and it is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website cbre.com, along with a presentation slide deck that you can use to follow along with our prepared remarks as well as an Excel file that contains additional supplemental materials. 
Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows: First, I'll provide an overview of our financial results for the quarter; next, Bob Sulentic, our President and CEO; and Leah Stearns, our CFO, will discuss our first quarter results in more detail. After these comments, we'll open up the call for your questions.
Before I begin, I'll remind you that this presentation contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Future growth prospects, operations, market share, capital deployment, acquisition integration, financial performance and 2020 outlook, including the impact of COVID-19 and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical fact. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. 
You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. For a full discussion of the risks and other factors that may impact these forward-looking statements, please refer to this morning's earnings release and our most recent annual and quarterly reports filed on Form 10-K and 10-Q, respectively. We have provided reconciliations of adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, fee revenue and certain other non-GAAP financial measures included in our remarks to the most directly comparable GAAP measures together with explanations of these measures in the appendix of this presentation slide deck.
Now please turn to Slide 4 of our presentation, which highlights our financial results for the first quarter of 2020. Combined services revenue grew 13%, while adjusted EBITDA rose 8%, primarily driven by advisory services. Adjusted EBITDA in our Real Estate investment segment fell 56% year-over-year, largely due to a $27 million decline in co-investments in our Public Securities business, driven by the equity market sell-off at the end of the quarter and fewer large development deals that in Q1 2019. Overall, adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA decreased modestly versus the prior year with strength in advisory services offsetting most of the REI decline. As a reminder, this will be the last quarter that we will provide geographic level disclosures based on the old segment reporting in our Excel supplemental, given the change to reporting 3 global business segments that we adopted at the beginning of 2019.
Now for an update on our business fundamentals, please turn to Slide 6, and I will turn the call over to Bob."

We hope all of you are coping with COVID-19's many disruptions, and we wish you and your families' good health during this very difficult time. We are encouraged by the emerging signs that COVID-19 is being brought under control and early moves by some governments to reopen parts of their economies. We hope this progress can continue, and we extend our thanks to everyone on the front lines of the battle with this disease. 
With the global economy in a recession today, the steps we have taken over the past decade to strengthen CBRE have prepared us well for the current environment. Compared with the global financial crisis, we have a stronger market position across our business lines, a more diversified and contractual revenue base. A significantly stronger balance sheet with markedly more liquidity and a leadership team that is far better equipped to manage our cost structure. As the impact of COVID-19 began to emerge, we moved aggressively in early to take out nonessential costs. 
In early April, I decided to forgo my salary and our top executive leaders also agreed to meaningfully reduce their compensation. While these moves do not materially impact our financials, they create a precedent that allows us to take on other difficult actions to adjust our workforce to reflect lower levels of client demand. These moves include some job eliminations, but mostly consist of furloughs and reduced work schedules, giving us flexibility to bring back staff as needed when business activity resumes. The coming quarters will no doubt be challenging for our industry. In light of how suddenly and severely, economic growth has collapsed, we are taking actions to mitigate the impact across every part of our business, which Leah will cover in her remarks.
Notably, we moved 100% of our people who work from CBRE offices in the U.S. to working from home on the night of March 13. This seamless transition confirmed the scalability of our digital and technology infrastructure and the adaptability of our workforce. Every substantial downturn creates fundamental changes in the way that commercial real estate is designed, developed, financed and used. I will cite 5 examples that occurred in the aftermath of the great financial crisis. First, e-commerce catalyzed a sharp increase in warehouse and logistics space utilization. Second, demand exploded for institutionally managed multifamily housing. Third, the growth of real estate outsourcing accelerated as companies pursued greater cost efficiencies. Fourth, an increased emphasis on the office occupancy experience drove demand for leasing and related project services. And finally, property ownership became much more institutional with well capitalized investors depending on third-party firms to manage, lease, value, finance and monetize these assets. 
CBRE benefited in a big way from each of these trends, which taken together, had a major impact on our decade-long record of robust growth. COVID-19 is likely to bring about equally powerful changes to our sector, and we believe CBRE is again well positioned for our industry's next evolution. Given our strong balance sheet and industry-leading market position, we are poised to withstand the negative impacts of COVID-19, while also remaining very focused on identifying and capitalizing on potential long-term growth catalysts that will emerge from this crisis.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Leah."

Our Advisory Services segment grew fee revenue about 5%, while adjusted EBITDA rose nearly 11%. Advisory adjusted EBITDA margin on fee revenue increased 100 basis points to 17.5%. The segment's sixth consecutive quarter of",1582,"Thanks, Bob. Turning to Slide 8. Our Advisory Services segment grew fee revenue about 5%, while adjusted EBITDA rose nearly 11%. Advisory adjusted EBITDA margin on fee revenue increased 100 basis points to 17.5%. The segment's sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin expansion. For most of our markets, COVID-19 did not have a material impact until mid-March. 
In January and February, our U.S. sales and leasing businesses posted healthy gains, but revenue declined by mid-teens in March. In April, U.S. sales and leasing revenue declined over 40% from April 2019 levels. Across the rest of our transactional business, declines were more muted due to its diversified geographic footprint. In response to these trends, we have taken decisive action to temporarily lower costs within our transactional business through furloughs of non-revenue-generating staff as well as reduced nonessential costs such as promotional and travel and entertainment expenses. Despite these late quarter pressures, revenue growth for our property sales business rose by 12% during Q1, which was a new all-time high for CBRE in first quarter property sales revenue. 
Growth was led by North Asia, as strength in Japan offset weakness in Greater China, and in Continental Europe, where our largest market, France and Germany delivered double-digit revenue gains. In the U.S., property sales revenue was up 3%. The increase was tempered by a decline in average deal size. During the quarter and continuing the trend we saw emerge in late 2019, leasing revenue slipped by 2% on both a global basis and in our largest market, the U.S. This decline reflects very tough comparisons with Q1 2019 when recent growth was more than 20% globally and 28% in the U.S. Like the prior 2 quarters, activity with co-working providers lowered U.S. leasing growth by about 3%. Certain advisory segment revenues were less impacted by COVID-19 in Q1, including our loan servicing, valuations and Property Management businesses. During the quarter, these lines of business accounted for approximately 22% of the advisory segment revenues and delivered 8% revenue growth.
Turning to Slide 9. Our Global Workplace Solutions segment grew growth and fee revenue by approximately 18% and 17%, respectively. Fee revenue rose 20% in facilities management and nearly 16% in Project Management. We had our best quarter ever for contract renewals with a rate that was once again over 90%, and we secured new business with large high-quality clients in the transportation and logistics and life sciences sectors. Adjusted EBITDA was flat with the prior year period. This primarily reflected a write-down of receivables due to a contract settlement with a client, which reduced the adjusted EBITDA margin for this segment by 110 basis points. There were also some other items such as a shift to lower margin facilities management and COVID-related expenses that also weighed on the margin. Since the emergence of COVID-19, our GWS team has been highly focused on helping our clients navigate this challenging situation and enhancing our long-term partnerships, which Bob will discuss in his closing remarks.
Turning to Slide 10. Let's now look at our Real Estate Investment segment, where adjusted EBITDA fell 56% year-over-year to $38 million. This primarily was driven by a $27 million decline in co-investment returns provided by our public securities business, reflecting the sharp equity market selloff at the end of the quarter. We also faced a tough comparison for large development asset sales, which were particularly strong in Q1 2019. Activity in our development business started 2020 strong with several deals, which we had expected to close in late Q4, being completed within the first 30 days of the year. Later in the quarter and partially attributable to the early impact of COVID-19, we saw further delays in development transactions. Importantly, these declines were partially offset by our Investment Management business, which saw continued growth in recurring revenue, which climbed 7% over prior year and contributed $20 million and adjusted EBITDA, over 50% of this segment's total in the quarter.
Finally, investment in the start-up of our enterprise-focused flexible workspace business, Hana, subtracted about $9 million from adjusted EBITDA.
Looking at Slide 11. Let's now take a look at our 2020 outlook. Given the uncertainty caused by COVID-19, we have withdrawn our explicit EPS guidance for the year and will instead provide qualitative commentary for each of our business segments. In Advisory, we expect a significant drop in revenue from our 2 largest business lines, leasing and property sales. That will outpace the decline in economic activity. As I highlighted previously, April's sales and leasing revenue in the U.S. contracted severely and the timing and the velocity of any recovery is highly dependent on the trajectory of the containment of COVID-19 as well as the recovery of consumer and business sentiments. 
Additionally, while our business is geographically diverse, the U.S. and U.K. comprise more than 70% of our global leasing and property sales revenue in 2019. We also expect loan origination volumes to decline due to continued economic uncertainty, which will weigh on loan servicing revenue. We will also need to support modest liquidity requirements necessitated by the GSE's rent forbearance, specifically for Fannie Mae, which comprises about 12% of our loan servicing portfolio. Thus far, a dominiums number of borrowers have been approved for forbearance, and this has not had a material impact on our business to date. Lastly, about 2/3 of the cost of sales in our advisory business is variable in nature as commissions decline in steps with transaction volumes. This should help to support our margins in this segment as cost of sales comprise the majority of our total costs in advisory.
Moving to GWS, where revenue is generated from multiyear contracts. We expect this segment to be relatively resilient and continue to expect positive revenue growth, albeit at a rate lower than our original expectations. As the pandemic creates pressures not seen in previous downturns, largely stemming from logistical challenges. Our expectations for growth in GWS reflects the in-year impact of our new business secured in 2019, which is being partially offset by the operational challenges and onboarding new clients as a result of the current shelter in place orders. In addition, we are absorbing certain COVID-19 costs within our GWS business to ensure we are fully prepared to support our clients as they reopen their business locations. In addition, while infrequent, we have experienced business upsets on certain GWS client accounts. Given the slower pace of growth expected in 2020, we are focused on improving our business processes to ensure we are ready to accelerate growth when business conditions rebound. We continue to believe that our outsourcing business is positioned to benefit from challenging economic conditions, offering clients more efficient and cost-effective facility solutions. We expect Project Management, which comprises about 12% of our GWS Segment revenue to see near-term pressures as clients delay some work.
Looking at REI. We believe this business segment is positioned to perform more resiliently than in previous recessions. Our development business is in a relatively strong position with conservatively financed projects, stable equity partners, and a pipeline that is heavily weighted toward core industrial and logistics projects as well as office properties that are about 80% pre-leased. Nonetheless, the pace of development asset dispositions will continue to slow in the near-term as we and our equity partners are not under pressure to monetize assets quickly. Revenue and adjusted EBITDA in Investment Management is highly recurring, as I mentioned earlier, and we expect the impact of co-investments to ease over time as we reduce our exposure to publicly traded securities. As you would expect, we've also started to incur costs directly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, which totaled around $3 million in Q1. These costs are expected to increase as we prepare offices for the return of our employees, incur incremental compensation for certain employees required to work on-site and enhance safety training.
Lastly, we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of the dislocation in the flexible workspace market, and have positioned Hana to serve enterprise clients that desire private workspaces. However, in the short term, we will slow the pace of expected Hana unit openings in 2020. Until we have more clarity around COVID-19 impact on occupier demand.
Turning to Slide 12. Our financial position is strong, we ended Q1 with just 0.6 turns of leverage, liquidity of $3.4 billion, no debt maturities until 2023 and an investment-grade credit rating. Our significant balance sheet flexibility provides us a solid foundation from which to execute our strategy. In 2020, our capital allocation will continue to prioritize internal investments in our platform and people to drive superior client outcomes and long-term growth. Our M&A strategy is focused on enhancing and differentiating our capabilities globally, and we believe that COVID-19 crisis may lead to unique and compelling opportunities. Finally, we may utilize our share repurchase program to continue offsetting the impact of our stock-based compensation program. And on a more opportunistic basis, if we believe our stock presents an attractive investment compared with other discretionary uses. 
While the current situation is highly uncertain, we're confident that we've enhanced the resiliency of our business and our capital structure to build upon our industry leadership position. In addition, our senior leadership team is taking decisive action to identify opportunities to further differentiate CBRE and position the business to accelerate once we are more certain of an economic recovery.
With that, I'll ask you to turn to Slide 13, as Bob provides a few closing thoughts."

Before we conclude this morning's call, I'll take a few minutes to highlight ways that CBRE's business activities for clients are producing social good. We know this is of great importance to many of our shareholders because they tell us so on a regular basis. And with the COVID-19 pandemic, the need has never been more urgent. 
CBRE teams around the world have been going to extraordinary links to serve our clients as they react to the demands of COVID-19. In Spain, our team worked with our client, the Hospital Del Mar to convert the Hotel Barcelona Princess into an extension of the hospital. The 363 room field hospital opened on April 1 and serves more than 200 COVID-19 patients. CBRE's on-site technicians provided essential maintenance and installation services to keep the field hospital running. In the U.K., we supported our client National Exhibition Center in the creation of its Birmingham Nightingale field hospital for COVID-19 patients. The first phase of the hospital opened on April 16, our team delivered essential materials and services and provides ongoing maintenance of the hospital. In Atlanta, our project management team worked with our client, Piedmont Healthcare to move up the opening of the patient floors in a new building under construction by more than 3 months to create more capacity as the hospital prepared for potentially higher admissions due to COVID-19. 
While many of our people have been working remotely, we have some 40,000 professionals like the ones highlighted here who have been working at client locations to keep properties operational and essential projects moving forward. They are among the unsung heroes of the COVID-19 crisis, and we salute them. We also recognize that COVID-19 has caused significant hardship for some of our CBRE people. In response, we have set aside $5 million of our more than $15 million COVID-19 relief fund to help colleagues who have fallen on hard times. The fund's remaining $10 million is dedicated to support regional and local organizations that are alleviating COVID-19 worst defects around the world. It's part of our commitment to looking out for one another as well as for our communities.
With that, operator, we'll open the lines for questions."

Clearly, we have a very big industrial business. We develop it, we sell it, we manage it, we finance it. And everything that's about COVID-19 that's driving e-commerce will drive the use of industrial space, and that will be an opportunity. We think multifamily will continue to grow around the world. We develop it. We finance it. We sell it. And we've got this new business in the U.K. that while in the short run, is under pressure, Telford, because of what's going on, there's going to be a real secular push for institutionally managed multifamily there. 
Office space is going to be a little confusing. In the short run, there's going to be a lot of discovery about working from home versus working in offices. Our best guess is that there'll be more working from home and less dense use of office, lots of services provided to get to that state of affairs. And sometimes when you can't figure out what's going to happen, you look for clues, we think a good analogy is what happened in the last 3 years before COVID-19 when there was an intense move toward alternative workplace in office space around the world. And one of the big concerns about that was that occupiers were going to be able to use 65%, 70%, 75% of the space that they had previously occupied. That, in fact, happened. But it also created for ourselves and our competitors, one of the biggest opportunities we've seen in years as there was a lot of opportunity to do new leasing, reconfigure space, et cetera. 
So we're going to watch what happens with our office space. We also think there's going to be something that goes on in the middle between what happens at home and what happens in multi-tenant buildings with flex space. It's not going to be co-working as we've known it with membership type circumstances, but we think suites type high-quality with real data security very professionally managed is going to be quite attractive to some subset of occupiers as they serve their people working from home, maybe smaller populations, permanent populations in offices, and our Hana product, we think, is well positioned to take advantage of that if that happens. We very much like the positioning of that product, which is suites oriented. So those are some of the things that could happen. There will be other things outsourcing will almost inevitably accelerate because of the intense focus on cost control that corporations have. We will benefit from that. So we're watching all these things, and there'll be some things happen that we can't see as we sit here right now."

We believe the visibility that we'll have into the second half of the year as the next 2 months unfold will be critical to our assessment in terms of future opportunity for capital allocation and the deployment of our excess liquidity.

But the way you should think about CBRE's M&A strategies to look at the Telford deal. It was an opportunity to take advantage of the brand we have, the capabilities we have, the balance sheet we have to go into a market where we hadn't been before and build a capability that was very much in line with the secular trend where we had a lot of knowledge a lot of market presence and other things. And it was a great size bet for us with the assumption of that $440 million, and it made our business materially stronger. You should expect to see us do that across our 3 segments going forward, and we're not pushing any 1 segment more or less than the others.

In terms of the prospects for that, I mentioned earlier, we think that Hana gives us a very good option on what might happen in the flex space market. We do believe the flex space market is going to be real. It's going to be important to landlords. We're spending a lot of time with our big occupiers. We know they're going to want some of that capability in their portfolio. It's going to be different than what most of the flex space market has been historically. Much of it's been around the membership model, individuals or small groups in shared space. Hana from day one has been a suite product. Hana from day one has been higher quality, less dense, very strong on data security. We think it's a product that very likely could play quite well going forward. Of course, we're going to have to watch and see what happens. 
We also believe that there's a real chance, and we're in discussions with some landlords on this that landlords that want to control flex space in their own buildings, high-quality, flex space, suites oriented, we're going to want to have somebody white label that for them because they do not want to try to build the infrastructure themselves to operate it. They just -- they aren't going to have the scale to do that. So we're hopeful that, that could be one of the good opportunities for us coming out of the COVID-19 situation."

Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing our financial results, and it is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website cbre.com, along with a presentation slide deck that you can use to follow along with our prepared remarks as well as an Excel file that contains additional supplemental materials. 
Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows: First, I'll provide an overview of our financial results for the quarter; next, Bob Sulentic, our President and CEO; and Leah Stearns, our CFO, will discuss our first quarter results in more detail. After these comments, we'll open up the call for your questions.
Before I begin, I'll remind you that this presentation contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding CBRE's future growth prospects, operations, market share, capital deployment, acquisition integration, financial performance and 2020 outlook, including the impact of COVID-19 and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical fact. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. 
You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. For a full discussion of the risks and other factors that may impact these forward-looking statements, please refer to this morning's earnings release and our most recent annual and quarterly reports filed on Form 10-K and 10-Q, respectively. We have provided reconciliations of adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, fee revenue and certain other non-GAAP financial measures included in our remarks to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, together with explanations of these measures, in the appendix of this presentation slide deck.
Now please turn to Slide 4 of our presentation, which highlights our financial results for the first quarter of 2020. Combined services revenue grew 13%, while adjusted EBITDA rose 8%, primarily driven by advisory services. Adjusted EBITDA in our Real Estate Investment segment fell 56% year-over-year, largely due to a $27 million decline in co-investments in our Public Securities business, driven by the equity market sell-off at the end of the quarter and fewer large development deals than in Q1 2019. Overall, adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA decreased modestly versus the prior year with strength in advisory services offsetting most of the REI decline. As a reminder, this will be the last quarter that we will provide geographic level disclosures based on the old segment reporting in our Excel supplemental, given the change to reporting 3 global business segments that we adopted at the beginning of 2019.
Now for an update on our business fundamentals, please turn to Slide 6, and I will turn the call over to Bob."

We hope all of you are coping with COVID-19's many disruptions, and we wish you and your families good health during this very difficult time. We are encouraged by the emerging signs that COVID-19 is being brought under control and early moves by some governments to reopen parts of their economies. We hope this progress can continue, and we extend our thanks to everyone on the front lines of the battle with this disease. 
With the global economy in a recession today, the steps we have taken over the past decade to strengthen CBRE have prepared us well for the current environment. Compared with the global financial crisis, we have a stronger market position across our business lines, a more diversified and contractual revenue base, a significantly stronger balance sheet with markedly more liquidity and a leadership team that is far better equipped to manage our cost structure. As the impact of COVID-19 began to emerge, we moved aggressively and early to take out nonessential costs. 
In early April, I decided to forgo my salary, and our top executive leaders also agreed to meaningfully reduce their compensation. While these moves do not materially impact our financials, they create a precedent that allows us to take on other difficult actions to adjust our workforce to reflect lower levels of client demand. These moves include some job eliminations, but mostly consist of furloughs and reduced work schedules, giving us flexibility to bring back staff as needed when business activity resumes. The coming quarters will no doubt be challenging for our industry. In light of how suddenly and severely economic growth has collapsed, we are taking actions to mitigate the impact across every part of our business, which Leah will cover in her remarks.
Notably, we moved 100% of our people who work from CBRE offices in the U.S. to working from home on the night of March 13. This seamless transition confirmed the scalability of our digital and technology infrastructure and the adaptability of our workforce. Every substantial downturn creates fundamental changes in the way that commercial real estate is designed, developed, financed and used. I will cite 5 examples that occurred in the aftermath of the great financial crisis. First, e-commerce catalyzed a sharp increase in warehouse and logistics space utilization. Second, demand exploded for institutionally managed multifamily housing. Third, the growth of real estate outsourcing accelerated as companies pursued greater cost efficiencies. Fourth, an increased emphasis on the office occupancy experience drove demand for leasing and related project services. And finally, property ownership became much more institutional with well capitalized investors depending on third-party firms to manage, lease, value, finance and monetize these assets. 
CBRE benefited in a big way from each of these trends, which taken together, had a major impact on our decade-long record of robust growth. COVID-19 is likely to bring about equally powerful changes to our sector, and we believe CBRE is again well positioned for our industry's next evolution. Given our strong balance sheet and industry-leading market position, we are poised to withstand the negative impacts of COVID-19, while also remaining very focused on identifying and capitalizing on potential long-term growth catalysts that will emerge from this crisis.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Leah."

Our Advisory Services segment grew fee revenue about 5%, while adjusted EBITDA rose nearly 11%.

Our Advisory Services segment grew fee revenue about 5%, while adjusted EBITDA rose nearly 11%. Advisory adjusted EBITDA margin on fee revenue increased 100 basis points to 17.5%, the segment's sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin expansion. For most of our markets, COVID-19 did not have a material impact until mid-March. 
In January and February, our U.S. sales and leasing businesses posted healthy gains, but revenue declined by mid-teens in March. In April, U.S. sales and leasing revenue declined over 40% from April 2019 levels. Across the rest of our transactional business, declines were more muted due to its diversified geographic footprint. In response to these trends, we have taken decisive action to temporarily lower costs within our transactional business through furloughs of non-revenue-generating staff as well as reduced nonessential costs such as promotional and travel and entertainment expenses. Despite these late quarter pressures, revenue growth for our property sales business rose by 12% during Q1, which was a new all-time high for CBRE in first quarter property sales revenue. 
Growth was led by North Asia, as strength in Japan offset weakness in Greater China, and in Continental Europe, where our largest markets, France and Germany, delivered double-digit revenue gains. In the U.S., property sales revenue was up 3%. The increase was tempered by a decline in average deal size. During the quarter and continuing the trend we saw emerge in late 2019, leasing revenue slipped by 2% on both a global basis and in our largest market, the U.S. This decline reflects very tough comparisons with Q1 2019 when recent growth was more than 20% globally and 28% in the U.S. Like the prior 2 quarters, activity with co-working providers lowered U.S. leasing growth by about 3%. Certain advisory segment revenues were less impacted by COVID-19 in Q1, including our loan servicing, valuations and Property Management businesses. During the quarter, these lines of business accounted for approximately 22% of the advisory segment revenues and delivered 8% revenue growth.
Turning to Slide 9. Our Global Workplace Solutions segment grew growth and fee revenue by approximately 18% and 17%, respectively. Fee revenue rose 20% in facilities management and nearly 16% in Project Management. We had our best quarter ever for contract renewals with a rate that was once again over 90%, and we secured new business with large high-quality clients in the transportation and logistics and life sciences sectors. Adjusted EBITDA was flat with the prior year period. This primarily reflected a write-down of receivables due to a contract settlement with a client, which reduced the adjusted EBITDA margin for this segment by 110 basis points. There were also some other items such as a shift to lower margin facilities management and COVID-related expenses that also weighed on the margin. Since the emergence of COVID-19, our GWS team has been highly focused on helping our clients navigate this challenging situation and enhancing our long-term partnerships, which Bob will discuss in his closing remarks.
Turning to Slide 10. Let's now look at our Real Estate Investment segment, where adjusted EBITDA fell 56% year-over-year to $38 million. This primarily was driven by a $27 million decline in co-investment returns provided by our public securities business, reflecting the sharp equity market selloff at the end of the quarter. We also faced a tough comparison for large development asset sales, which were particularly strong in Q1 2019. Activity in our development business started 2020 strong with several deals, which we had expected to close in late Q4, being completed within the first 30 days of the year. Later in the quarter and partially attributable to the early impact of COVID-19, we saw further delays in development transactions. Importantly, these declines were partially offset by our Investment Management business, which saw continued growth in recurring revenue, which climbed 7% over prior year and contributed $20 million in adjusted EBITDA, over 50% of this segment's total in the quarter.
Finally, investment in the start-up of our enterprise-focused flexible workspace business, Hana, subtracted about $9 million from adjusted EBITDA.
Looking at Slide 11. Let's now take a look at our 2020 outlook. Given the uncertainty caused by COVID-19, we have withdrawn our explicit EPS guidance for the year and will instead provide qualitative commentary for each of our business segments. In Advisory, we expect a significant drop in revenue from our 2 largest business lines, leasing and property sales. That will outpace the decline in economic activity. As I highlighted previously, April's sales and leasing revenue in the U.S. contracted severely and the timing and the velocity of any recovery is highly dependent on the trajectory of the containment of COVID-19 as well as the recovery of consumer and business sentiment. 
Additionally, while our business is geographically diverse, the U.S. and U.K. comprised more than 70% of our global leasing and property sales revenue in 2019. We also expect loan origination volumes to decline due to continued economic uncertainty, which will weigh on loan servicing revenue. We will also need to support modest liquidity requirements necessitated by the GSE's rent forbearance, specifically for Fannie Mae, which comprises about 12% of our loan servicing portfolio. Thus far, a de minimis number of borrowers have been approved for forbearance, and this has not had a material impact on our business to date. Lastly, about 2/3 of the cost of sales in our advisory business is variable in nature as commissions declined in step with transaction volumes. This should help to support our margins in this segment as cost of sales comprise the majority of our total costs in Advisory.
Moving to GWS, where revenue is generated from multiyear contracts. We expect this segment to be relatively resilient and continue to expect positive revenue growth, albeit at a rate lower than our original expectations. As the pandemic creates pressures not seen in previous downturns, largely stemming from logistical challenges. Our expectations for growth in GWS reflects the in-year impact of our new business secured in 2019, which is being partially offset by the operational challenges in onboarding new clients as a result of the current shelter-in-place orders. In addition, we are absorbing certain COVID-19 costs within our GWS business to ensure we are fully prepared to support our clients as they reopen their business locations. In addition, while infrequent, we have experienced business upsets on certain GWS client accounts. Given the slower pace of growth expected in 2020, we are focused on improving our business processes to ensure we are ready to accelerate growth when business conditions rebound. We continue to believe that our outsourcing business is positioned to benefit from challenging economic conditions, offering clients more efficient and cost-effective facility solutions. We expect Project Management, which comprises about 12% of our GWS Segment revenue, to see near-term pressures as clients delay some work.
Looking at REI. We believe this business segment is positioned to perform more resiliently than in previous recessions. Our development business is in a relatively strong position with conservatively financed projects, stable equity partners, and a pipeline that is heavily weighted toward core industrial and logistics projects as well as office properties that are about 80% pre-leased. Nonetheless, the pace of development asset dispositions will continue to slow in the near-term as we and our equity partners are not under pressure to monetize assets quickly. Revenue and adjusted EBITDA in Investment Management is highly recurring, as I mentioned earlier, and we expect the impact of co-investments to ease over time as we reduce our exposure to publicly traded securities. As you would expect, we've also started to incur costs directly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, which totaled around $3 million in Q1. These costs are expected to increase as we prepare offices for the return of our employees, incur incremental compensation for certain employees required to work on-site and enhance safety training.
Lastly, we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of the dislocation in the flexible workspace market, and have positioned Hana to serve enterprise clients that desire private workspaces. However, in the short term, we will slow the pace of expected Hana unit openings in 2020, until we have more clarity around COVID-19's impact on occupier demand.
Turning to Slide 12. Our financial position is strong. We ended Q1 with just 0.6 turns of leverage, liquidity of $3.4 billion, no debt maturities until 2023 and an investment-grade credit rating. Our significant balance sheet flexibility provides us a solid foundation from which to execute our strategy. In 2020, our capital allocation will continue to prioritize internal investments in our platform and people to drive superior client outcomes and long-term growth. Our M&A strategy is focused on enhancing and differentiating our capabilities globally, and we believe the COVID-19 crisis may lead to unique and compelling opportunities. Finally, we may utilize our share repurchase program to continue offsetting the impact of our stock-based compensation program. And on a more opportunistic basis, if we believe our stock presents an attractive investment compared with other discretionary uses. 
While the current situation is highly uncertain, we're confident that we've enhanced the resiliency of our business and our capital structure to build upon our industry leadership position. In addition, our senior leadership team is taking decisive action to identify opportunities to further differentiate CBRE and position the business to accelerate once we are more certain of an economic recovery.
With that, I'll ask you to turn to Slide 13, as Bob provides a few closing thoughts."

We know this is of great importance to many of our shareholders because they tell us so on a regular basis. And with the COVID-19 pandemic, the need has never been more urgent. 
CBRE teams around the world have been going to extraordinary lengths to serve our clients as they react to the demands of COVID-19. In Spain, our team worked with our client, the Hospital del Mar, to convert the Hotel Barcelona Princess into an extension of the hospital. The 363-room field hospital opened on April 1 and serves more than 200 COVID-19 patients. CBRE's on-site technicians provided essential maintenance and installation services to keep the field hospital running. In the U.K., we supported our client National Exhibition Centre in the creation of its Birmingham Nightingale field hospital for COVID-19 patients. The first phase of the hospital opened on April 16. Our team delivered essential materials and services and provides ongoing maintenance of the hospital. In Atlanta, our project management team worked with our client Piedmont Healthcare to move up the opening of the patient floors in a new building under construction by more than 3 months to create more capacity as the hospital prepared for potentially higher admissions due to COVID-19. 
While many of our people have been working remotely, we have some 40,000 professionals like the ones highlighted here, who have been working at client locations to keep properties operational and essential projects moving forward. They are among the unsung heroes of the COVID-19 crisis, and we salute them. We also recognize that COVID-19 has caused significant hardship for some of our CBRE people. In response, we have set aside $5 million of our more than $15 million COVID-19 relief fund to help colleagues who have fallen on hard times. The fund's remaining $10 million is dedicated to support regional and local organizations that are alleviating COVID-19's worst effects around the world. It's part of our commitment to looking out for one another as well as for our communities.
With that, operator, we'll open the lines for questions."

Clearly, we have a very big industrial business. We develop it, we sell it, we manage it, we finance it. And everything that's about COVID-19 that's driving e-commerce will drive the use of industrial space, and that will be an opportunity. We think multifamily will continue to grow around the world. We develop it. We finance it. We sell it. And we've got this new business in the U.K. that while in the short run, is under pressure, Telford, because of what's going on, there's going to be a real secular push for institutionally managed multifamily there. 
Office space is going to be a little confusing. In the short run, there's going to be a lot of discovery about working from home versus working in offices. Our best guess is that there'll be more working from home and less dense use of office, lots of services provided to get to that state of affairs. And sometimes when you can't figure out what's going to happen, you look for clues, we think a good analogy is what happened in the last 3 years before COVID-19 when there was an intense move toward alternative workplace in office space around the world. And one of the big concerns about that was that occupiers were going to be able to use 65%, 70%, 75% of the space that they had previously occupied. That, in fact, happened. But it also created for ourselves and our competitors one of the biggest opportunities we've seen in years as there was a lot of opportunity to do new leasing, reconfigure space, et cetera. 
So we're going to watch what happens with our office space. We also think there's going to be something that goes on in the middle between what happens at home and what happens in multi-tenant buildings with flex space. It's not going to be co-working as we've known it with membership type circumstances, but we think suites-type, high-quality with real data security, very professionally managed is going to be quite attractive to some subset of occupiers as they serve their people working from home, maybe smaller populations, permanent populations in offices, and our Hana product, we think, is well positioned to take advantage of that if that happens. We very much like the positioning of that product, which is suites oriented. So those are some of the things that could happen. There will be other things. Outsourcing will almost inevitably accelerate because of the intense focus on cost control that corporations have. We will benefit from that. So we're watching all these things, and there'll be some things happen that we can't see as we sit here right now."

And we, of course, have a significant base of our transactions that are renewals, and I think historically, that's been about 30% of our leasing, so that continued. But there is definitely a big impact on leasing when you can't go look at the space. And when people just have huge uncertainty in general about how long this COVID-19 thing is going to go. So we saw the downward pressure to the degree that we had described, it was down 40%, and we're going to wait and see how that plays out from here."

And so it was actually executed fairly quickly in March. So as a result of that, we typically, for our programmatic share repurchase program, which effectively offsets our stock-based compensation expense, look to do that over the course of the year, and we'll continue to evaluate that. For Q2, I would just say, we're putting a premium on liquidity. We believe the visibility that we'll have into the second half of the year as the next 2 months unfold will be critical to our assessment in terms of future opportunity for capital allocation and the deployment of our excess liquidity. And so we are going to take a pause just in Q2 to ensure that we're able to have that visibility in how the year unfolds, and we'll look to reassess in August."

But our strategy for M&A remains the same, and we see the same kind of opportunities we saw before. We'll probably -- because of the relative strength of our balance sheet and some pressure that people might be under, we could see more opportunities. But the way you should think about CBRE's M&A strategies to look at the Telford deal. It was an opportunity to take advantage of the brand we have, the capabilities we have, the balance sheet we have to go into a market where we hadn't been before and build a capability that was very much in line with the secular trend where we had a lot of knowledge, a lot of market presence and other things. And it was a great size bet for us with the assumption of that $440 million, and it made our business materially stronger. You should expect to see us do that across our 3 segments going forward, and we're not pushing any 1 segment more or less than the others. We're asking each of them to look for opportunities to build their business with M&A, where those businesses we buy can do more on the CBRE platform than they could do on their own or on another platform. We're encouraged that those opportunities will arise."

We are -- we have a significant position as it relates to origination for the GSEs, and that has certainly been a major part of our underlying DSF business. But from a CMBS perspective, the GSEs have a liquidity role to play in the market. And so we're continuing to see them provide liquidity. What we are seeing though is there are higher or more restrictive covenants around underlying liquidity reserves for borrowers. And so that is slowing some of the activity.

That is certainly something that will grow over time as our loan book increases. We have a very solid base of loans that we currently have in that portion of our overall portfolio. They have a strong debt service coverage ratio of about 1.9. We have a strong loan-to-value of about 65%. So we feel very good about where we are from a reserve perspective. I think if you go back to the GFC and assume the default levels that occurred then, we have a reserve that would be positioned in excess of what the losses would accumulate to be at the GFC level. So we feel very good about where we are. From an overall perspective, we've also seen very limited requests for forbearance, we've seen less than 1% of what could be required to fund request to be funded so far. So again, I think we feel very good about where we are and that the quality of the loan book that we're currently sitting with today is in a solid position."

In terms of the prospects for that, I mentioned earlier, we think that Hana gives us a very good option on what might happen in the flex space market. We do believe the flex space market is going to be real. It's going to be important to landlords. We're spending a lot of time with our big occupiers. We know they're going to want some of that capability in their portfolio. It's going to be different than what most of the flex space market has been historically. Much of it's been around the membership model, individuals or small groups in shared space. Hana from day one has been a suite product. Hana from day one has been higher quality, less dense, very strong on data security. We think it's a product that very likely could play quite well going forward. Of course, we're going to have to watch and see what happens. 
We also believe that there's a real chance, and we're in discussions with some landlords on this, that landlords that want to control flex space in their own buildings, high-quality, flex space, suites oriented, are going to want to have somebody white label that for them because they do not want to try to build the infrastructure themselves to operate it. They just -- they aren't going to have the scale to do that. So we're hopeful that, that could be one of the good opportunities for us coming out of the COVID-19 situation."

Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing our financial results, and it is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website cbre.com, along with a presentation slide deck that you can use to follow along with our prepared remarks as well as an Excel file that contains additional supplemental materials. 
Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows: First, I'll provide an overview of our financial results for the quarter; next, Bob Sulentic, our President and CEO; and Leah Stearns, our CFO, will discuss our first quarter results in more detail. After these comments, we'll open up the call for your questions.
Before I begin, I'll remind you that this presentation contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding CBRE's future growth prospects, operations, market share, capital deployment, acquisition integration, financial performance and 2020 outlook, including the impact of COVID-19 and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical fact. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. 
You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. For a full discussion of the risks and other factors that may impact these forward-looking statements, please refer to this morning's earnings release and our most recent annual and quarterly reports filed on Form 10-K and 10-Q, respectively. We have provided reconciliations of adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, fee revenue and certain other non-GAAP financial measures included in our remarks to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, together with explanations of these measures, in the appendix of this presentation slide deck.
Now please turn to Slide 4 of our presentation, which highlights our financial results for the first quarter of 2020. Combined services revenue grew 13%, while adjusted EBITDA rose 8%, primarily driven by advisory services. Adjusted EBITDA in our Real Estate Investment segment fell 56% year-over-year, largely due to a $27 million decline in co-investments in our Public Securities business, driven by the equity market sell-off at the end of the quarter and fewer large development deals than in Q1 2019. Overall, adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA decreased modestly versus the prior year with strength in advisory services offsetting most of the REI decline. As a reminder, this will be the last quarter that we will provide geographic level disclosures based on the old segment reporting in our Excel supplemental, given the change to reporting 3 global business segments that we adopted at the beginning of 2019.
Now for an update on our business fundamentals, please turn to Slide 6, and I will turn the call over to Bob."

We hope all of you are coping with COVID-19's many disruptions, and we wish you and your families good health during this very difficult time. We are encouraged by the emerging signs that COVID-19 is being brought under control and early moves by some governments to reopen parts of their economies. We hope this progress can continue, and we extend our thanks to everyone on the front lines of the battle with this disease. 
With the global economy in a recession today, the steps we have taken over the past decade to strengthen CBRE have prepared us well for the current environment. Compared with the global financial crisis, we have a stronger market position across our business lines, a more diversified and contractual revenue base, a significantly stronger balance sheet with markedly more liquidity and a leadership team that is far better equipped to manage our cost structure. As the impact of COVID-19 began to emerge, we moved aggressively and early to take out nonessential costs. 
In early April, I decided to forgo my salary, and our top executive leaders also agreed to meaningfully reduce their compensation. While these moves do not materially impact our financials, they create a precedent that allows us to take on other difficult actions to adjust our workforce to reflect lower levels of client demand. These moves include some job eliminations, but mostly consist of furloughs and reduced work schedules, giving us flexibility to bring back staff as needed when business activity resumes. The coming quarters will no doubt be challenging for our industry. In light of how suddenly and severely economic growth has collapsed, we are taking actions to mitigate the impact across every part of our business, which Leah will cover in her remarks.
Notably, we moved 100% of our people who work from CBRE offices in the U.S. to working from home on the night of March 13. This seamless transition confirmed the scalability of our digital and technology infrastructure and the adaptability of our workforce. Every substantial downturn creates fundamental changes in the way that commercial real estate is designed, developed, financed and used. 
I will cite 5 examples that occurred in the aftermath of the great financial crisis. First, e-commerce catalyzed a sharp increase in warehouse and logistics space utilization. Second, demand exploded for institutionally managed multifamily housing. Third, the growth of real estate outsourcing accelerated as companies pursued greater cost efficiencies. Fourth, an increased emphasis on the office occupancy experience drove demand for leasing and related project services. And finally, property ownership became much more institutional with well-capitalized investors depending on third-party firms to manage, lease, value, finance and monetize these assets. 
CBRE benefited in a big way from each of these trends, which taken together, had a major impact on our decade-long record of robust growth. COVID-19 is likely to bring about equally powerful changes to our sector, and we believe CBRE is again well positioned for our industry's next evolution. Given our strong balance sheet and industry-leading market position, we are poised to withstand the negative impacts of COVID-19, while also remaining very focused on identifying and capitalizing on potential long-term growth catalysts that will emerge from this crisis.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Leah."

Our Advisory Services segment grew fee revenue about 5%, while adjusted EBITDA rose nearly 11%.

Our Advisory Services segment grew fee revenue about 5%, while adjusted EBITDA rose nearly 11%. Advisory adjusted EBITDA margin on fee revenue increased 100 basis points to 17.5%, the segment's sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin expansion. For most of our markets, COVID-19 did not have a material impact until mid-March. 
In January and February, our U.S. sales and leasing businesses posted healthy gains, but revenue declined by mid-teens in March. In April, U.S. sales and leasing revenue declined over 40% from April 2019 levels. Across the rest of our transactional business, declines were more muted due to its diversified geographic footprint. In response to these trends, we have taken decisive action to temporarily lower costs within our transactional business through furloughs of non-revenue-generating staff as well as reduced nonessential costs such as promotional and travel and entertainment expenses. Despite these late quarter pressures, revenue growth for our property sales business rose by 12% during Q1, which was a new all-time high for CBRE in first quarter property sales revenue. 
Growth was led by North Asia, as strength in Japan offset weakness in Greater China, and in Continental Europe, where our largest markets, France and Germany, delivered double-digit revenue gains. In the U.S., property sales revenue was up 3%. The increase was tempered by a decline in average deal size. During the quarter and continuing the trend we saw emerge in late 2019, leasing revenue slipped by 2% on both a global basis and in our largest market, the U.S. This decline reflects very tough comparisons with Q1 2019 when recent growth was more than 20% globally and 28% in the U.S. Like the prior 2 quarters, activity with co-working providers lowered U.S. leasing growth by about 3%. 
Certain advisory segment revenues were less impacted by COVID-19 in Q1, including our loan servicing, valuations and Property Management businesses. During the quarter, these lines of business accounted for approximately 22% of the advisory segment revenues and delivered 8% revenue growth.
Turning to Slide 9. Our Global Workplace Solutions segment grew growth and fee revenue by approximately 18% and 17%, respectively. Fee revenue rose 20% in facilities management and nearly 16% in Project Management. We had our best quarter ever for contract renewals with a rate that was once again over 90%, and we secured new business with large high-quality clients in the transportation and logistics and life sciences sectors. Adjusted EBITDA was flat with the prior year period. This primarily reflected a write-down of receivables due to a contract settlement with a client, which reduced the adjusted EBITDA margin for this segment by 110 basis points. 
There were also some other items such as a shift to lower margin facilities management and COVID-related expenses that also weighed on the margin. Since the emergence of COVID-19, our GWS team has been highly focused on helping our clients navigate this challenging situation and enhancing our long-term partnerships, which Bob will discuss in his closing remarks.
Turning to Slide 10. Let's now look at our Real Estate Investment segment, where adjusted EBITDA fell 56% year-over-year to $38 million. This primarily was driven by a $27 million decline in co-investment returns provided by our public securities business, reflecting the sharp equity market selloff at the end of the quarter. We also faced a tough comparison for large development asset sales, which were particularly strong in Q1 2019. Activity in our development business started 2020 strong with several deals, which we had expected to close in late Q4, being completed within the first 30 days of the year. 
Later in the quarter and partially attributable to the early impact of COVID-19, we saw further delays in development transactions. Importantly, these declines were partially offset by our Investment Management business, which saw continued growth in recurring revenue, which climbed 7% over prior year and contributed $20 million in adjusted EBITDA, over 50% of this segment's total in the quarter.
Finally, investment in the start-up of our enterprise-focused flexible workspace business, Hana, subtracted about $9 million from adjusted EBITDA.
Looking at Slide 11. Let's now take a look at our 2020 outlook. Given the uncertainty caused by COVID-19, we have withdrawn our explicit EPS guidance for the year and will instead provide qualitative commentary for each of our business segments. In Advisory, we expect a significant drop in revenue from our 2 largest business lines, leasing and property sales. That will outpace the decline in economic activity. As I highlighted previously, April's sales and leasing revenue in the U.S. contracted severely and the timing and the velocity of any recovery is highly dependent on the trajectory of the containment of COVID-19 as well as the recovery of consumer and business sentiment. 
Additionally, while our business is geographically diverse, the U.S. and U.K. comprised more than 70% of our global leasing and property sales revenue in 2019. We also expect loan origination volumes to decline due to continued economic uncertainty, which will weigh on loan servicing revenue. We will also need to support modest liquidity requirements necessitated by the GSE's rent forbearance, specifically for Fannie Mae, which comprises about 12% of our loan servicing portfolio. Thus far, a de minimis number of borrowers have been approved for forbearance, and this has not had a material impact on our business to date. Lastly, about 2/3 of the cost of sales in our advisory business is variable in nature as commissions declined in step with transaction volumes. This should help to support our margins in this segment as cost of sales comprise the majority of our total costs in Advisory.
Moving to GWS, where revenue is generated from multiyear contracts. We expect this segment to be relatively resilient and continue to expect positive revenue growth, albeit at a rate lower than our original expectations. As the pandemic creates pressures not seen in previous downturns, largely stemming from logistical challenges. Our expectations for growth in GWS reflects the in-year impact of our new business secured in 2019, which is being partially offset by the operational challenges in onboarding new clients as a result of the current shelter-in-place orders. In addition, we are absorbing certain COVID-19 costs within our GWS business to ensure we are fully prepared to support our clients as they reopen their business locations. 
In addition, while infrequent, we have experienced business upsets on certain GWS client accounts. Given the slower pace of growth expected in 2020, we are focused on improving our business processes to ensure we are ready to accelerate growth when business conditions rebound. We continue to believe that our outsourcing business is positioned to benefit from challenging economic conditions, offering clients more efficient and cost-effective facility solutions. We expect Project Management, which comprises about 12% of our GWS Segment revenue, to see near-term pressures as clients delay some work.
Looking at REI. We believe this business segment is positioned to perform more resiliently than in previous recessions. Our development business is in a relatively strong position with conservatively financed projects, stable equity partners, and a pipeline that is heavily weighted toward core industrial and logistics projects as well as office properties that are about 80% pre-leased. Nonetheless, the pace of development asset dispositions will continue to slow in the near term as we and our equity partners are not under pressure to monetize assets quickly. Revenue and adjusted EBITDA in Investment Management is highly recurring, as I mentioned earlier, and we expect the impact of co-investments to ease over time as we reduce our exposure to publicly traded securities. 
As you would expect, we've also started to incur costs directly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, which totaled around $3 million in Q1. These costs are expected to increase as we prepare offices for the return of our employees, incur incremental compensation for certain employees required to work on-site and enhance safety training.
Lastly, we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of the dislocation in the flexible workspace market and have positioned Hana to serve enterprise clients that desire private workspaces. However, in the short term, we will slow the pace of expected Hana unit openings in 2020, until we have more clarity around COVID-19's impact on occupier demand.
Turning to Slide 12. Our financial position is strong. We ended Q1 with just 0.6 turns of leverage, liquidity of $3.4 billion, no debt maturities until 2023 and an investment-grade credit rating. Our significant balance sheet flexibility provides us a solid foundation from which to execute our strategy. In 2020, our capital allocation will continue to prioritize internal investments in our platform and people to drive superior client outcomes and long-term growth. Our M&A strategy is focused on enhancing and differentiating our capabilities globally, and we believe the COVID-19 crisis may lead to unique and compelling opportunities. 
Finally, we may utilize our share repurchase program to continue offsetting the impact of our stock-based compensation program. And on a more opportunistic basis, if we believe our stock presents an attractive investment compared with other discretionary uses. 
While the current situation is highly uncertain, we're confident that we've enhanced the resiliency of our business and our capital structure to build upon our industry leadership position. In addition, our senior leadership team is taking decisive action to identify opportunities to further differentiate CBRE and position the business to accelerate once we are more certain of an economic recovery.
With that, I'll ask you to turn to Slide 13, as Bob provides a few closing thoughts."

Before we conclude this morning's call, I'll take a few minutes to highlight ways that CBRE's business activities for clients are producing social good. We know this is of great importance to many of our shareholders because they tell us so on a regular basis. And with the COVID-19 pandemic, the need has never been more urgent. 
CBRE teams around the world have been going to extraordinary lengths to serve our clients as they react to the demands of COVID-19. In Spain, our team worked with our client, the Hospital del Mar, to convert the Hotel Barcelona Princess into an extension of the hospital. The 363-room field hospital opened on April 1 and serves more than 200 COVID-19 patients. CBRE's on-site technicians provided essential maintenance and installation services to keep the field hospital running. 
In the U.K., we supported our client National Exhibition Centre in the creation of its Birmingham Nightingale field hospital for COVID-19 patients. The first phase of the hospital opened on April 16. Our team delivered essential materials and services and provides ongoing maintenance of the hospital. In Atlanta, our project management team worked with our client Piedmont Healthcare to move up the opening of the patient floors in a new building under construction by more than 3 months to create more capacity as the hospital prepared for potentially higher admissions due to COVID-19. 
While many of our people have been working remotely, we have some 40,000 professionals like the ones highlighted here, who have been working at client locations to keep properties operational and essential projects moving forward. They are among the unsung heroes of the COVID-19 crisis, and we salute them. We also recognize that COVID-19 has caused significant hardship for some of our CBRE people. In response, we have set aside $5 million of our more than $15 million COVID-19 relief fund to help colleagues who have fallen on hard times. The fund's remaining $10 million is dedicated to support regional and local organizations that are alleviating COVID-19's worst effects around the world.

Clearly, we have a very big industrial business. We develop it, we sell it, we manage it, we finance it. And everything that's about COVID-19 that's driving e-commerce will drive the use of industrial space, and that will be an opportunity. We think multifamily will continue to grow around the world. We develop it. We finance it. We sell it. And we've got this new business in the U.K. that while in the short run, is under pressure, Telford, because of what's going on, there's going to be a real secular push for institutionally managed multifamily there. 
Office space is going to be a little confusing. In the short run, there's going to be a lot of discovery about working from home versus working in offices. Our best guess is that there'll be more working from home and less dense use of office, lots of services provided to get to that state of affairs. And sometimes when you can't figure out what's going to happen, you look for clues, we think a good analogy is what happened in the last 3 years before COVID-19 when there was an intense move toward alternative workplace in office space around the world. 
And one of the big concerns about that was that occupiers were going to be able to use 65%, 70%, 75% of the space that they had previously occupied. That, in fact, happened. But it also created for ourselves and our competitors one of the biggest opportunities we've seen in years as there was a lot of opportunity to do new leasing, reconfigure space, et cetera. 
So we're going to watch what happens with our office space. We also think there's going to be something that goes on in the middle between what happens at home and what happens in multi-tenant buildings with flex space. It's not going to be co-working as we've known it with membership type circumstances, but we think suites-type, high-quality with real data security, very professionally managed is going to be quite attractive to some subset of occupiers as they serve their people working from home, maybe smaller populations, permanent populations in offices, and our Hana product, we think, is well positioned to take advantage of that if that happens. We very much like the positioning of that product, which is suites oriented. 
So those are some of the things that could happen. There will be other things. Outsourcing will almost inevitably accelerate because of the intense focus on cost control that corporations have. We will benefit from that. So we're watching all these things, and there'll be some things happen that we can't see as we sit here right now."

We'll probably -- because of the relative strength of our balance sheet and some pressure that people might be under, we could see more opportunities. 
But the way you should think about CBRE's M&A strategies to look at the Telford deal. It was an opportunity to take advantage of the brand we have, the capabilities we have, the balance sheet we have to go into a market where we hadn't been before and build a capability that was very much in line with the secular trend where we had a lot of knowledge, a lot of market presence and other things. And it was a great size bet for us with the assumption of that $440 million, and it made our business materially stronger. You should expect to see us do that across our 3 segments going forward, and we're not pushing any 1 segment more or less than the others. We're asking each of them to look for opportunities to build their business with M&A, where those businesses we buy can do more on the CBRE platform than they could do on their own or on another platform.

Again, this has not happened previously, where there may have just been some disconnect in terms of what our client wanted, and how it was executed.

In terms of the prospects for that, I mentioned earlier, we think that Hana gives us a very good option on what might happen in the flex space market. 
We do believe the flex space market is going to be real. It's going to be important to landlords. We're spending a lot of time with our big occupiers. We know they're going to want some of that capability in their portfolio. It's going to be different than what most of the flex space market has been historically. Much of it's been around the membership model, individuals or small groups in shared space. Hana from day one has been a suite product. Hana from day one has been higher quality, less dense, very strong on data security. We think it's a product that very likely could play quite well going forward. Of course, we're going to have to watch and see what happens. 
We also believe that there's a real chance, and we're in discussions with some landlords on this, that landlords that want to control flex space in their own buildings, high-quality, flex space, suites oriented, are going to want to have somebody white label that for them because they do not want to try to build the infrastructure themselves to operate it. They just -- they aren't going to have the scale to do that. So we're hopeful that, that could be one of the good opportunities for us coming out of the COVID-19 situation."

Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing our financial results and posted on the Investor Relations page of our website, cbre.com, along with the presentation slide deck that you can use to follow along with our prepared remarks as well as an Excel file that contains additional supplemental materials. 
Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows: First, I'll provide an overview of our financial results for the quarter; next, Bob Sulentic, our President and CEO; and Leah Stearns, our CFO, will discuss our second quarter results in more detail. After their comments, we'll open up the call for your questions. 
Before I begin, I'll remind you that this presentation contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A examples of these statements include our expectations regarding CBRE's future growth prospects, operations, market share, capital deployment, acquisition, integration, financial performance and 2020 outlook including the impact of COVID-19 and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical fact. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. For a full discussion of the risks and other factors that may impact these forward-looking statements, please refer to this morning's earnings release and our most recent annual and quarterly reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, respectively. 
We have provided reconciliations of adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, fee revenue and certain other non-GAAP financial measures included in our remarks to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, together with explanations of these measures in the appendix of the presentation slide deck. 
Now please turn to Slide 4 of our presentation, which highlights our financial results for the second quarter of 2020. Total revenue and fee revenue fell about 6% and 21%, respectively, driven by declines in advisory and REI. Lower revenue, coupled with $25 million of incremental COVID-related costs and a $16 million donation to the company's COVID relief fund caused adjusted EBITDA to fall 43%. 
Overall, adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.35, including the negative impact of around $0.10 attributable to the COVID-related expenses and relief fund donation. 
Now for insights on the quarter and our longer-term outlook. Please turn to Slide 6, and I will turn the call over to Bob."

As expected, COVID-19 took a toll on our performance in the second quarter with impacts felt across every part of our business. However, the overall impact was cushioned by our diverse business mix, particularly to sustained growth of our contractual businesses over the past decade. We also benefited from early moves to reduce our expense base. A process that is continuing and strengthened our financial position and cash flow generation despite the ongoing challenges from the pandemic. Double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth in our Global Workplace Solutions segment demonstrated the resiliency of a business that occupier clients increasingly rely on in good times and bad to run essential operations and drive critical cost efficiencies. Since the global financial crisis, other parts of our business have become more resilient as well. For example, our U.S. development business is expected to earn twice as much, both this year and next as it did at the peak of the last market cycle. This reflects greater emphasis on core product development, particularly industrial and multifamily projects, along with an emphasis on fee development. 
We have built a $245 billion loan servicing portfolio that adds growing recurring revenue to our capital markets offering. We are large originators for Freddie and Fannie, which are expected to match last year's loan volumes this year, and we are positioned to capture a significant share of their business. 
Our investment management business grew nicely in the quarter. Today, it earns a significant majority of its adjusted EBITDA from recurring asset management fees. This business continues to raise new capital at a brisk pace, so the revenue base should grow. 
Like any major crisis, COVID will have near-term and long-term effects on our sector and how we serve clients. In the near term, we've seen precipitous drop in leasing and sales activity. Investment capital has moved to the sidelines as investors begin the process of price discovery. 
Occupiers are hesitant to make long-term decisions amid the uncertainty preferring short-term lease renewals where possible. Our ongoing interaction with major occupier clients has given us insight into their current thinking. 3 distinct trends are emerging. First, most companies will give their employees greater flexibility to choose between working in the office and working from home. Second, the physical office will remain vitally important in these hybrid work models, particularly in fostering culture and collaboration and attracting talent. Third, the decades-long densification trend is likely to reverse, negating some of the effects on office demand associated with more remote working. 
The pandemic has elevated the importance of the workplace strategy on corporate agendas. Now more than ever, clients will need the strategic insight, thoughtful advice and reliable execution that CBRE and our people are best positioned to provide. We have built the company for opportunities like this and intend to capitalize on it. 
Now I'm going to turn the call over to Leah, who will take you through the second quarter."

Our advisory Services segment fee revenue and adjusted EBITDA fell about 31% and 60%, respectively. As expected, significant weakness in our high-margin but cycle sensitive sales and leasing businesses drove the declines.",1760,"Thanks, Bob. Turning to Slide 8. Our advisory Services segment fee revenue and adjusted EBITDA fell about 31% and 60%, respectively. As expected, significant weakness in our high-margin but cycle sensitive sales and leasing businesses drove the declines. Our advisory adjusted EBITDA margin fell to around 10%, which was impacted by revenue compression, about $8 million in incremental COVID-related expenses and $11 million for the company's donation to our COVID relief fund. Together, these items reduced the advisory margin approximately 140 basis points in the quarter. 
Global leasing revenue declined about 38% as the pandemic negatively impacted our largest markets in the quarter. In the U.S., Continental Europe and the U.K., which collectively comprise over 80% of global leasing. Revenue decreased 43%, 25% and 20%, respectively. Greater China, which comprised more than 3% of global leasing this quarter, achieved 14% growth following a 26% decline in Q1. While there was pressure across all property types in the quarter, industrial was resilient, with leasing revenue declining just 10%. We saw a similar pattern in property sales with global revenue down 48% and declines of 26% in Continental Europe, 51% in the U.S. and 76% in the U.K. 
Notably, we improved our U.S. market position significantly with 160 basis point share gain. Our 17.6% share for the quarter is 860 basis points more than our closest competitor. Like leasing, we saw a rebound in Greater China, with property sales climbing 46% after decreasing over [ 70% ] in Q1. 
Commercial mortgage revenue fell 28%, as most capital sources pulled back from lending. We did, however, see an increase in activity from banks with a strong appetite for office and industrial projects. The selling of credit markets that began in the second quarter, has extended into July. Other advisory services business lines were less impacted by COVID during the quarter. Advisory property and project management revenue fell about 8% driven by the temporary shutdown of construction activity and reduced spending on capital projects. 
Valuation revenues fell about 12%, with modest growth in EMEA and our APAC market. 
Finally, loan servicing revenue grew 15% as our portfolio reached $245 billion. Our multifamily properties, which comprise nearly half of our global servicing portfolio and more than 2/3 in the U.S. is proving to be resilient during the pandemic. We have just a handful of loans and forbearance and have not received a new request since May. 
Turning to Slide 9. Our Global Workplace Solutions segment saw lighter than usual revenue performance, but strong growth in profitability. Facilities management, which accounts for more than 85% of this segment's fee revenue, and is a contractual business, saw a 7% growth. This was offset by more cyclically sensitive project management and transaction services, which together, posted a 33% fee revenue decline. Even with lower contributions from these higher-margin revenue sources and $17 million incurred for COVID-related expenses and infor the COVID relief fund, GWS' adjusted EBITDA margin on fee revenue expanded more than 170 basis points to 15.4%, leading to adjusted EBITDA growth of more than 11%. This is the highest quarterly margin ever for the GWS business, and our performance was driven by proactive cost management. We sustained a high contract renewal rate in the quarter. And the new business pipeline continued to increase from year-end levels. 
COVID logistical challenges continue to hamper and prolong the contracting and onboarding processes. Yet, after a pause at the onset of the COVID crisis, companies are beginning to move ahead with outsourcing plans as they seek to capture efficiencies in a constrained economic environment. GWS is also a well diversified business, serving clients across a wide array, property types and industries, including many deemed essential during the current crisis. We're very proud of the work our GWS team continues to do supporting our clients during this challenging time. 
Turning to Slide 10. Our Real Estate Investments segment adjusted EBITDA came in at $18 million, down 41%. It included incremental covet expenses and the relief fund donation allocation which together totaled about $2 million. Investment management was the standout performer with adjusted EBITDA rising 62%. This reflected strong growth in recurring asset management fees, AUM, increasing $3 billion from a year earlier period as well as higher carried interest in co-investment returns, partially offset by lower acquisition, incentives and disposition fees. Our focus on core and core plus strategies is highly advantageous in the current environment. Capital raising remained elevated, totaling $11.4 billion over the past 12 months. 
As Bob mentioned, U.S. development is well positioned entering the downturn. Although adjusted EBITDA fell about 55%, this was largely due to deal timing. We continue to be optimistic about second half performance as our in process activity stands at $13.7 billion. About half of that activity is comprised of fee development and build-to-suit and the remaining assets are well capitalized with strong equity partners. 
Our development business in the U.K. incurred an adjusted EBITDA loss of $11 million during the period. This loss was largely attributable to COVID-19 including [indiscernible] as well as constrained sales activity. We expect commercial activities have largely reduced assumed. 
Lastly, in our enterprise-focused co-working solution, Hana, was in line with results in the period were impacted by mandated shutdowns and elevated costs to ensure the safety of occupants as units reopened. 
Let's now take a look at our 2020 outlook on Slide 11. Given the continued uncertainty about COVID-19 trajectory and its impact on the broader economy, we will get EPS guidance. Options for the remainder of 2020 in detail, where our revenue decline was shallow. We now expect the recovery are gradual and drawn out. We expect revenue declines in Q3 and Q4 to be similar to that of Q2 with relatively better performance outside of the Americas. 
Sales and leasing revenue, while off significantly in the quarter, benefited from robust pipelines built before the COVID crisis. Future performance is highly dependent on pipeline replenishment, and and we are tracking signed confidentiality agreements and other leading indicators to inform our expectations for the remainder of the year. For the rest on for the remainder of the year. For the rest of the advisory business combined, we expect a mid- to high single-digit revenue decline. 
Variable costs, which comprise about half of our advisory cost structure are expected to decline a bit more than overall revenue. We anticipate a modest mid-single-digit decrease in advisory fixed costs, as it typically takes longer for our actions in this area to show an impact. 
Moving to GWS. We expect gross revenue to rise in the mid-single digits and fee revenue in the mid- to high single digits, with growth in contractual facilities management revenue offsetting an expected decline in GWS transaction revenue. As a result of disciplined cost management, we also expect to achieve modest margin expansion. Which will drive high-single digit adjusted EBITDA growth. This growth rate includes an expected headwind from COVID related items in the mid single-digit range. Our outlook is also premised on slower growth and facilities management revenue as we faced tough compares in Q3 and Q4 when facilities management achieved growth of 15% and 18%, respectively. 
Our first half results benefited from the high level of client onboarding in late 2019 that drove the strong prior year growth rate. Simultaneously, while the logistical challenges of contracting and onboarding clients are slowly receding, we did not bring on new clients during the first half at the same pace as last year. This is expected to weigh on growth in Q3 and Q4, and we would expect growth to resume to double-digit levels once these new client transition delays abate. 
Looking at REI. We continue to believe our core legacy business lines, global investment management and U.S. development are well positioned for the current environment, and we anticipate more resilient performance than during the last downturn. 
In Investment management, we expect adjusted EBITDA growth in the mid-teens range as higher recurring adjusted EBITDA is offset by lower contributions from net promotes. As dispositions slow and lower co-investment returns. We expect U.S. development to contribute similar adjusted EBITDA as in 2019 as investors continue to have an appetite for high-quality assets. 
At present, nearly 80% of our in process portfolio is comprised of health care, industrial and multifamily properties and office properties that are at least 90% leased. We expect U.K. multifamily residential development to generate sequentially improved adjusted EBITDA in each of the remaining quarters and be about breakeven for the year. 
Construction resumed during May, and we remain confident in the long-term trajectory of this business, given the housing shortage in the U.K. and our robust pipeline of new projects. Similarly, we continue to believe in the long-term rationale for our investment in Hana, but expect to incur a larger adjusted EBITDA loss in 2020 than in the prior year. This is primarily the result of additional units being brought online in 2020 as well as revenue delays due to COVID-19-related shutdowns and longer new unit development periods. 
Longer term, we see an opportunity for an accelerated transition to an asset-light investment model, partly catalyzed by dislocations in the flex based market. 
Turning to Slide 12. Our financial position has continued to strengthen despite the challenges of COVID-19. We ended Q2 with just 0.6 turns of leverage, down 0.2 turns from a year ago and $3.5 billion of liquidity, an increase of $0.5 billion from the year ago period. In addition, we have no debt maturing until 2023. We given the uncertainty around the virus' trajectory and its impact on economic activity, we will continue to prioritize liquidity over discretionary capital deployment. 
Once we have more confidence in an economic recovery, we will resume deploying discretionary capital in line with our capital allocation strategy. In the meantime, we are continuing to prioritize investments in our people and platform and selective M&A. A key focus will be companies that enhance the diversification of our service offerings and resiliency of the overall business by increasing the scale of less cyclical business lines. 
Finally, we view our share price as highly attractive at current levels and could resume repurchases when appropriate, if we are unable to identify suitable and properly priced acquisition opportunities. While the environment remains highly uncertain, we're confident that our business and our capital structure are positioned to not only weather the challenges presented by COVID but build on our industry leadership position and maximize long-term earnings growth. 
With that, I'll ask you to turn to Slide 13, as Bob provides a few closing thoughts."

This certainly has been a trying time for everyone, and we are proud of how our people have helped our clients and our company to navigate the COVID-19 crisis. In addition to the challenges of COVID-19, recent months have also seen significant social unrest here in the U.S., which has called attention to the racial inequality and injustice that have persisted in our society for too long. It has also highlighted the need for better progress on diversity and inclusion within Corporate America. 
From speaking with many of you, we know that this topic is extremely important to our shareholders, and you expect us to address it. So I'll take a few moments to tell you where we are. We have made progress with diversity and inclusion on several fronts. For example, since 2015, we have meaningfully increased diversity on both our Board of Directors and management Executive Committee and put more women into key leadership roles. These are important gains that we are proud of. At the same time, we must do more to improve ethnic diversity at our company, particularly within our management and brokerage ranks. This is a challenge we are focused on and actively addressing. 
Last month, we appointed our first Chief Diversity Officer, Tim Disman, who has long been a senior leader at CBRE. Tim has joined the 12 member Global Executive Committee that is responsible for running our company and will report directly to me. We intend to give Tim the necessary resources and support to accelerate our progress on diversity and inclusion. This is a priority for me personally as well as for the company.

Something like 80% of the big clients we surveyed said that the office will be as important or almost as important as it was historically. And by the way, that answer came in the midst of the COVID crisis and all that goes with the COVID crisis. The other thing we know is will be de densified. And so the net-net of what will happen is, yes, there'll be more work from home. There'll be less people in the office, but almost everybody will be back in the office in a less dense format. That's what will play out in the long run. In the short run, people are trying to avoid making decisions until they have more clarity on what's going to happen with COVID-19."

I think that is critical to regaining confidence. Part of the price discovery that's going on right now, I think, starts with seeing a recovery on the leasing side to really build confidence on the investor side. And so we need to see really where that equilibrium shakes out. We certainly are seeing activity continue. And it's not as severe as we had expected, as I said in my remarks. But I think it will be really critical to begin to see leasing decisions on a larger scale basis, particularly on the large leasing transactions. The place where we've seen the most significant decline is on those large transactions. We still have actually seen a high-volume of transactions. But on a relative basis, they've been on a smaller set of -- or smaller size deals. So I think we really need to see confidence come back around leasing that will lead to more strong and confident underwriting behind our investor clients. And I think that will lead to better capital market performance in the future."

Here's generally what happens though. And by the way, this was happening before COVID. You look at the percentage of your people that are in the office at any given point in time, and then you add a buffer on top of that, and you tend to size to that amount of space. So that's probably going to come down some. If 10% or 15% or 20% of people are going to work a couple of days from home a week. That number will come down some. But the amount of space per person is going to go up meaningfully. I mean offices have gotten pretty dense going into COVID-19, and that trend has been going on for years and years. We don't know exactly where that's going to play out, but it could offset most of the downward pressure in what we're seeing from people working from home. 
By the way, I'll give you my personal view on this from having talked to a lot of clients. I think the certainty about people working from home to some degree is at least as high as everybody says it is. I think the certainty about people coming back to the office is higher than the headlines out there today because it's exciting to give a new headline to talk about all the productivity of working from home. But then you go talk to executives that run businesses that have to deal with onboarding new people, moving managers around oversee new people, training people, dealing with collaboration, dealing with creativity. And what you hear is we've got to get people back to the office. So I think both of those trends have high certainty, more working from home and the importance of the office going forward. 
And maybe they'll offset each other, the actual math hasn't sorted out yet."

So utilization is -- you can't get any read on utilization. But from day 1, Hana was a suite model. It was a model that was oriented toward institutional occupiers, strong focus on data security, strong focus, a very professionally-managed environment. And here's what it does for occupiers that we believe will make it an important concept going forward. It allows you to -- the flexibility to move in and out quickly without capital expenditures. It allows you the flexibility to assemble teams in a particular market or a different market for relatively short periods of time. By the way, not months, but years, short -- instead of 5 years, a year or 2 years. We believe that will be at least as important going forward as it was before COVID-19. We are excited about the Hana model. We are anticipating that it will be more of a service provider model and that the landlords will actually own the units going forward. There was a move in that direction anyway. So we think strategically, Hana was oriented toward a market that we're going to see post-COVID-19 and about 2/3 of the clients we surveyed suggested that co-working, although they're going to call it flexible space going forward, will be a significant part of what they do in their utilization of space in the future."

Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing our financial results and posted it on the Investor Relations page of our website, cbre.com, along with the presentation slide deck that you can use to follow along with our prepared remarks as well as an Excel file that contains additional supplemental materials.  
Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows: First, I'll provide an overview of our financial results for the quarter; next, Bob Sulentic, our President and CEO; and Leah Stearns, our CFO, will discuss our second quarter results in more detail. After their comments, we'll open up the call for your questions. 
Before I begin, I'll remind you that this presentation contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding CBRE's future growth prospects, operations, market share, capital deployment, acquisition, integration, financial performance and 2020 outlook including the impact of COVID-19 and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical fact. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. For a full discussion of the risks and other factors that may impact these forward-looking statements, please refer to this morning's earnings release and our most recent annual and quarterly reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, respectively.  
We have provided reconciliations of adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, fee revenue and certain other non-GAAP financial measures included in our remarks to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, together with explanations of these measures in the appendix of the presentation slide deck.  
Now please turn to Slide 4 of our presentation, which highlights our financial results for the second quarter of 2020. Total revenue and fee revenue fell about 6% and 21%, respectively, driven by declines in advisory and REI. Lower revenue, coupled with $25 million of incremental COVID-related costs and a $16 million donation to the company's COVID relief fund caused adjusted EBITDA to fall 43%.  
Overall, adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.35, including the negative impact of around $0.10 attributable to the COVID-related expenses and relief fund donation.  
Now for insights on the quarter and our longer-term outlook, please turn to Slide 6, and I will turn the call over to Bob."

As expected, COVID-19 took a toll on our performance in the second quarter with impacts felt across every part of our business. However, the overall impact was cushioned by our diverse business mix, particularly to sustained growth of our contractual businesses over the past decade. We also benefited from early moves to reduce our expense base. A process that is continuing and strengthened our financial position and cash flow generation despite the ongoing challenges from the pandemic. Double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth in our Global Workplace Solutions segment demonstrated the resiliency of a business that occupier clients increasingly rely on in good times and bad to run essential operations and drive critical cost efficiencies. Since the global financial crisis, other parts of our business have become more resilient as well. For example, our U.S. development business is expected to earn twice as much, both this year and next as it did at the peak of the last market cycle. This reflects greater emphasis on core product development, particularly industrial and multifamily projects, along with an emphasis on fee development.  
We have built a $245 billion loan servicing portfolio that adds growing recurring revenue to our capital markets offering. We are large originators for Freddie and Fannie, which are expected to match last year's loan volumes this year, and we are positioned to capture a significant share of their business.  
Our investment management business grew nicely in the quarter. Today, it earns a significant majority of its adjusted EBITDA from recurring asset management fees. This business continues to raise new capital at a brisk pace, so the revenue base should grow.  
Like any major crisis, COVID will have near-term and long-term effects on our sector and how we serve clients. In the near term, we've seen precipitous drop in leasing and sales activity. Investment capital has moved to the sidelines as investors begin the process of price discovery.  
Occupiers are hesitant to make long-term decisions amid the uncertainty preferring short-term lease renewals where possible. Our ongoing interaction with major occupier clients has given us insight into their current thinking. 3 distinct trends are emerging. First, most companies will give their employees greater flexibility to choose between working in the office and working from home. Second, the physical office will remain vitally important in these hybrid work models, particularly in fostering culture and collaboration and attracting talent. Third, the decades-long densification trend is likely to reverse, negating some of the effects on office demand associated with more remote working.  
The pandemic has elevated the importance of the workplace strategy on corporate agendas. Now more than ever, clients will need the strategic insight, thoughtful advice and reliable execution that CBRE and our people are best positioned to provide. We have built the company for opportunities like this and intend to capitalize on it.  
Now I'm going to turn the call over to Leah, who will take you through the second quarter."
4204816,675444536,2053350,"CBRE Group, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 31, 2020",2020-07-31,"Earnings Calls","CBRE Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bob. Turning to Slide 8. Our advisory Services segment fee revenue and adjusted EBITDA fell about 31% and 60%, respectively. As expected, significant weakness in our high-margin but cycle sensitive sales and leasing businesses drove the declines.",1801,"Thanks, Bob. Turning to Slide 8. Our advisory Services segment fee revenue and adjusted EBITDA fell about 31% and 60%, respectively. As expected, significant weakness in our high-margin but cycle sensitive sales and leasing businesses drove the declines. Our advisory adjusted EBITDA margin fell to around 10%, which was impacted by revenue compression, about $8 million in incremental COVID-related expenses and $11 million for the company's donation to our COVID relief fund. Together, these items reduced the advisory margin approximately 140 basis points in the quarter.  
Global leasing revenue declined about 38% as the pandemic negatively impacted our largest markets in the quarter. In the U.S., Continental Europe and the U.K., which collectively comprise over 80% of global leasing, revenue decreased 43%, 25% and 20%, respectively. Greater China, which comprised more than 3% of global leasing this quarter, achieved 14% growth following a 26% decline in Q1. While there was pressure across all property types in the quarter, industrial was resilient, with leasing revenue declining just 10%. We saw a similar pattern in property sales with global revenue down 48% and declines of 26% in Continental Europe, 51% in the U.S. and 76% in the U.K.  
Notably, we improved our U.S. market position significantly with 160 basis point share gain. Our 17.6% share for the quarter is 860 basis points more than our closest competitor. Like leasing, we saw a rebound in Greater China, with property sales climbing 46% after decreasing over 70% in Q1.  
Commercial mortgage revenue fell 28%, as most capital sources pulled back from lending. We did, however, see an increase in activity from banks with a strong appetite for office and industrial projects. The selling of credit markets that began in the second quarter has extended into July. Other Advisory Services business lines were less impacted by COVID during the quarter. Advisory Property and Project Management revenue fell about 8%, driven by the temporary shutdown of construction activity and reduced spending on capital projects.  
Valuation revenues fell about 12%, with modest growth in EMEA and our APAC market.  
Finally, loan servicing revenue grew 15% as our portfolio reached $245 billion. Our multifamily properties, which comprise nearly half of our global servicing portfolio and more than 2/3 in the U.S., is proving to be resilient during the pandemic. We have just a handful of loans and forbearance and have not received a new request since May.  
Turning to Slide 9. Our Global Workplace Solutions segment saw lighter than usual revenue performance, but strong growth in profitability. Facilities Management, which accounts for more than 85% of this segment's fee revenue and is a contractual business, saw a 7% growth. This was offset by more cyclically sensitive Project Management and transaction services, which together, posted a 33% fee revenue decline. Even with lower contributions from these higher-margin revenue sources and $17 million incurred for COVID-related expenses and $3 million for the COVID relief fund, GWS' adjusted EBITDA margin on fee revenue expanded more than 170 basis points to 15.4%, leading to adjusted EBITDA growth of more than 11%. This is the highest quarterly margin ever for the GWS business, and our performance was driven by proactive cost management. We sustained a high contract renewal rate in the quarter, and the new business pipeline continued to increase from year-end levels.  
COVID logistical challenges continue to hamper and prolong the contracting and onboarding processes. Yet, after a pause at the onset of the COVID crisis, companies are beginning to move ahead with outsourcing plans as they seek to capture efficiencies in a constrained economic environment. GWS is also a well diversified business, serving clients across a wide array, property types and industries, including many deemed essential during the current crisis. We're very proud of the work our GWS team continues to do supporting our clients during this challenging time.  
Turning to Slide 10. Our Real Estate Investments segment adjusted EBITDA came in at $18 million, down 41%. It included incremental COVID expenses and the relief fund donation allocation, which together totaled about $2 million. Investment management was the standout performer with adjusted EBITDA rising 62%. This reflected strong growth in recurring asset management fees, AUM, increasing $3 billion from a year earlier period as well as higher carried interest in co-investment returns, partially offset by lower acquisition, incentives and disposition fees. Our focus on core and core plus strategies is highly advantageous in the current environment. Capital raising remained elevated, totaling $11.4 billion over the past 12 months.  
As Bob mentioned, U.S. development is well positioned entering the downturn. Although adjusted EBITDA fell about 55%, this was largely due to deal timing. We continue to be optimistic about second half performance as our in process activity stands at $13.7 billion. About half of that activity is comprised of fee development and build-to-suit and the remaining assets are well capitalized with strong equity partners.  
Our development business in the U.K. incurred an adjusted EBITDA loss of $11 million during the period. This loss was largely attributable to transitory operational challenges due to COVID-19 including temporary construction stoppages and other challenges as well as constrained sales activity. We expect performance to improve now that construction and commercial activities have largely reduced assumed.  
Lastly, the $9 million adjusted EBITDA loss in our enterprise-focused co-working solution, Hana, was in line with Q1 performance. Hana's results in the period were impacted by mandated shutdowns and elevated costs to ensure the safety of occupants as units reopened.  
Let's now take a look at our 2020 outlook on Slide 11. Given the continued uncertainty about COVID-19 trajectory and its impact on the broader economy, we will again refrain from providing explicit EPS guidance, however, we will discuss our expectations for the remainder of 2020 in detail. Starting with Advisory Services segment, where our revenue decline was shallower than we expected in the second quarter, we now expect the recovery in our transaction businesses to be more gradual and drawn out. We expect revenue declines in Q3 and Q4 to be similar to that of Q2 with relatively better performance outside of the Americas.  
Sales and leasing revenue, while off significantly in the quarter, benefited from robust pipelines built before the COVID crisis. Future performance is highly dependent on pipeline replenishment, and we are tracking signed confidentiality agreements and other leading indicators to inform our expectations for the remainder of the year. For the rest of the Advisory business combined, we expect a mid- to high single-digit revenue decline.  
Variable costs, which comprise about half of our Advisory cost structure, are expected to decline a bit more than overall revenue. We anticipate a modest mid single-digit decrease in Advisory fixed costs, as it typically takes longer for our actions in this area to show an impact.  
Moving to GWS. We expect gross revenue to rise in the mid-single digits and fee revenue in the mid- to high-single digits, with growth in contractual Facilities Management revenue offsetting an expected decline in GWS transaction revenue. As a result of disciplined cost management, we also expect to achieve modest margin expansion, which will drive high-single digit adjusted EBITDA growth. This growth rate includes an expected headwind from COVID related items in the mid single-digit range. Our outlook is also premised on slower growth and Facilities Management revenue, as we faced tough compares in Q3 and Q4 when facilities management achieved growth of 15% and 18%, respectively.  
Our first half results benefited from the high level of client onboarding in late 2019 that drove the strong prior year growth rate. Simultaneously, while the logistical challenges of contracting and onboarding clients are slowly receding, we did not bring on new clients during the first half at the same pace as last year. This is expected to weigh on growth in Q3 and Q4, and we would expect growth to resume to double-digit levels once these new client transition delays abate.  
Looking at REI. We continue to believe our core legacy business lines, global investment management and U.S. development are well positioned for the current environment, and we anticipate more resilient performance than during the last downturn. In Investment management, we expect adjusted EBITDA growth in the mid-teens range as higher recurring adjusted EBITDA is offset by lower contributions from net promotes as dispositions slow and lower co-investment returns. We expect U.S. development to contribute similar adjusted EBITDA as in 2019 as investors continue to have an appetite for high-quality assets.  
At present, nearly 80% of our in-process portfolio is comprised of health care, industrial and multifamily properties, and office properties that are at least 90% leased. We expect U.K. multifamily residential development to generate sequentially improved adjusted EBITDA in each of the remaining quarters and be about breakeven for the year.  
Construction resumed during May, and we remain confident in the long-term trajectory of this business, given the housing shortage in the U.K. and our robust pipeline of new projects. Similarly, we continue to believe in the long-term rationale for our investment in Hana, but expect to incur a larger adjusted EBITDA loss in 2020 than in the prior year. This is primarily the result of additional units being brought online in 2020 as well as revenue delays due to COVID-19 related shutdowns and longer new unit development periods.  
Longer term, we see an opportunity for an accelerated transition to an asset-light investment model, partly catalyzed by dislocations in the flex based market.  
Turning to Slide 12. Our financial position has continued to strengthen despite the challenges of COVID-19. We ended Q2 with just 0.6 turns of leverage, down 0.2 turns from a year ago, and $3.5 billion of liquidity, an increase of $0.5 billion from the year ago period. In addition, we have no debt maturing until 2023. Given the uncertainty around the virus' trajectory and its impact on economic activity, we will continue to prioritize liquidity over discretionary capital deployment.  
Once we have more confidence in an economic recovery, we will resume deploying discretionary capital in line with our capital allocation strategy. In the meantime, we are continuing to prioritize investments in our people and platform and selective M&A. A key focus will be companies that enhance the diversification of our service offerings and resiliency of the overall business by increasing the scale of less cyclical business lines. Finally, we view our share price as highly attractive at current levels and could resume repurchases when appropriate, if we are unable to identify suitable and properly priced acquisition opportunities. While the environment remains highly uncertain, we're confident that our business and our capital structure are positioned to not only weather the challenges presented by COVID but build on our industry leadership position and maximize long-term earnings growth.  
With that, I'll ask you to turn to Slide 13, as Bob provides a few closing thoughts."

This certainly has been a trying time for everyone, and we are proud of how our people have helped our clients and our company to navigate the COVID-19 crisis. In addition to the challenges of COVID-19, recent months have also seen significant social unrest here in the U.S., which has called attention to the racial inequality and injustice that have persisted in our society for too long. It has also highlighted the need for better progress on diversity and inclusion within Corporate America.  
From speaking with many of you, we know that this topic is extremely important to our shareholders, and you expect us to address it. So I'll take a few moments to tell you where we are. We have made progress with diversity and inclusion on several fronts. For example, since 2015, we have meaningfully increased diversity on both our Board of Directors and management Executive Committee and put more women into key leadership roles. These are important gains that we are proud of. At the same time, we must do more to improve ethnic diversity at our company, particularly within our management and brokerage ranks. This is a challenge we are focused on and actively addressing.  
Last month, we appointed our first Chief Diversity Officer, Tim Disman, who has long been a senior leader at CBRE. Tim has joined the 12 member Global Executive Committee that is responsible for running our company and will report directly to me. We intend to give Tim the necessary resources and support to accelerate our progress on diversity and inclusion. This is a priority for me personally as well as for the company.

So this is what we know. There will be more flexibility to do hybrid working going forward. There will be more work from home. There will also be a big focus on the office on an enduring basis. Something like 80% of the big clients we surveyed said that the office will be as important or almost as important as it was historically. And by the way, that answer came in the midst of the COVID crisis and all that goes with the COVID crisis. The other thing we know is that space will be de-densified. And so the net-net of what will happen is, yes, there'll be more work from home, there'll be less people in the office, but almost everybody will be back in the office in a less dense format.

I think that is critical to regaining confidence. Part of the price discovery that's going on right now, I think, starts with seeing a recovery on the leasing side to really build confidence on the investor side. And so we need to see really where that equilibrium shakes out. We certainly are seeing activity continue. And it's not as severe as we had expected, as I said in my remarks. But I think it will be really critical to begin to see leasing decisions on a larger scale basis, particularly on the large leasing transactions. The place where we've seen the most significant decline is on those large transactions. We still have actually seen a high-volume of transactions. But on a relative basis, they've been on a smaller set of -- or smaller size deals. So I think we really need to see confidence come back around leasing that will lead to more strong and confident underwriting behind our investor clients. And I think that will lead to better capital market performance in the future."

Here's generally what happens though. And by the way, this was happening before COVID. You look at the percentage of your people that are in the office at any given point in time, and then you add a buffer on top of that, and you tend to size to that amount of space. So that's probably going to come down some. If 10% or 15% or 20% of people are going to work a couple of days from home a week. That number will come down some. But the amount of space per person is going to go up meaningfully. I mean offices have gotten pretty dense going into COVID-19, and that trend had been going on for years and years. We don't know exactly where that's going to play out, but it could offset most of the downward pressure in what we're seeing from people working from home. 
By the way, I'll give you my personal view on this from having talked to a lot of clients. I think the certainty about people working from home to some degree is at least as high as everybody says it is. I think the certainty about people coming back to the office is higher than the headlines out there today because it's exciting to give a new headline to talk about all the productivity of working from home. But then you go talk to executives that run businesses that have to deal with onboarding new people, moving managers around, oversee new people, training people, dealing with collaboration, dealing with creativity, and what you hear is we've got to get people back to the office. So I think both of those trends have high certainty, more working from home and the importance of the office going further -- going forward. And maybe they'll offset each other. The actual math hasn't sorted out yet."

So utilization is -- you can't get any read on utilization. But from day 1, Hana was a suite model. It was a model that was oriented toward institutional occupiers, strong focus on data security, strong focus on  a very professionally-managed environment. And here's what it does for occupiers that we believe will make it an important concept going forward. It allows you to -- the flexibility to move in and out quickly without capital expenditures. It allows you the flexibility to assemble teams in a particular market or a different market for relatively short periods of time. By the way, not months, but years, short -- instead of 5 years, a year or 2 years. We believe that will be at least as important going forward as it was before COVID-19. We are excited about the Hana model. We are anticipating that it will be more of a service provider model and that the landlords will actually own the units going forward. There was a move in that direction anyway. So we think strategically, Hana was oriented toward a market that we're going to see post-COVID-19 and about 2/3 of the clients we surveyed suggested that co-working, although they're going to call it flexible space going forward, will be a significant part of what they do in their utilization of space in the future."

Now that is something that we consider in the context of a more normalized environment, and we want to make sure that we use our buyback in a framework -- within a framework that is cognizant of our current leverage in the overall economic environment. And so my comments were meant to imply within our current capital allocation strategy. In a normal environment, we would actually be in the market from a share repurchase perspective. But given the importance that we're placing on liquidity today because of the uncertainty around COVID, we are taking a more conservative approach and, therefore, preserving capital.

It's just the period of transition from when we sign a contract to then go into full transition mode. That's the part that has presented a challenge for us just in terms of driving growth out of that pipeline. We certainly aren't seeing a lack of interest in our service offerings.

With respect to distressed sales, there are some, but I would say, investors are being very patient.

Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing our financial results and posted it on the Investor Relations page of our website, cbre.com, along with the presentation slide deck that you can use to follow along with our prepared remarks as well as an Excel file that contains additional supplemental materials.  
Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows: first, I'll provide an overview of our financial results for the quarter; next, Bob Sulentic, our President and CEO; and Leah Stearns, our CFO, will discuss our second quarter results in more detail. After their comments, we'll open up the call for your questions. 
Before I begin, I'll remind you that this presentation contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding CBRE's future growth prospects, operations, market share, capital deployment, acquisition, integration, financial performance and 2020 outlook including the impact of COVID-19 and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical fact. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. 
For a full discussion of the risks and other factors that may impact these forward-looking statements, please refer to this morning's earnings release and our most recent annual and quarterly reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, respectively.  
We have provided reconciliations of adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, fee revenue and certain other non-GAAP financial measures included in our remarks to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, together with explanations of these measures in the appendix of the presentation slide deck.  
Now please turn to Slide 4 of our presentation, which highlights our financial results for the second quarter of 2020. Total revenue and fee revenue fell about 6% and 21%, respectively, driven by declines in advisory and REI. Lower revenue, coupled with $25 million of incremental COVID-related costs and a $16 million donation to the company's COVID relief fund caused adjusted EBITDA to fall 43%.  
Overall, adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.35, including the negative impact of around $0.10 attributable to the COVID-related expenses and relief fund donation.  
Now for insights on the quarter and our longer-term outlook, please turn to Slide 6, and I will turn the call over to Bob."

As expected, COVID-19 took a toll on our performance in the second quarter with impacts felt across every part of our business. However, the overall impact was cushioned by our diverse business mix, particularly to sustained growth of our contractual businesses over the past decade. We also benefited from early moves to reduce our expense base. A process that is continuing and strengthened our financial position and cash flow generation despite the ongoing challenges from the pandemic. Double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth in our Global Workplace Solutions segment demonstrated the resiliency of a business that occupier clients increasingly rely on in good times and bad to run essential operations and drive critical cost efficiencies. 
Since the global financial crisis, other parts of our business have become more resilient as well. For example, our U.S. development business is expected to earn twice as much, both this year and next as it did at the peak of the last market cycle. This reflects greater emphasis on core product development, particularly industrial and multifamily projects, along with an emphasis on fee development.  
We have built a $245 billion loan servicing portfolio that adds growing recurring revenue to our capital markets offering. We are large originators for Freddie and Fannie, which are expected to match last year's loan volumes this year, and we are positioned to capture a significant share of their business.  
Our investment management business grew nicely in the quarter. Today, it earns a significant majority of its adjusted EBITDA from recurring asset management fees. This business continues to raise new capital at a brisk pace, so the revenue base should grow.  
Like any major crisis, COVID will have near-term and long-term effects on our sector and how we serve clients. In the near term, we've seen precipitous drop in leasing and sales activity. Investment capital has moved to the sidelines as investors begin the process of price discovery.  
Occupiers are hesitant to make long-term decisions amid the uncertainty preferring short-term lease renewals where possible. Our ongoing interaction with major occupier clients has given us insight into their current thinking. 3 distinct trends are emerging. First, most companies will give their employees greater flexibility to choose between working in the office and working from home. Second, the physical office will remain vitally important in these hybrid work models, particularly in fostering culture and collaboration and attracting talent. Third, the decades-long densification trend is likely to reverse, negating some of the effects on office demand associated with more remote working.  
The pandemic has elevated the importance of the workplace strategy on corporate agendas. Now more than ever, clients will need the strategic insight, thoughtful advice and reliable execution that CBRE and our people are best positioned to provide. We have built the company for opportunities like this and intend to capitalize on it.  
Now I'm going to turn the call over to Leah, who will take you through the second quarter."
4204816,675444536,2070881,"CBRE Group, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 31, 2020",2020-07-31,"Earnings Calls","CBRE Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bob. Turning to Slide 8. Our advisory Services segment fee revenue and adjusted EBITDA fell about 31% and 60%, respectively. As expected, significant weakness in our high-margin but cycle sensitive sales and leasing businesses drove the declines.",1798,"Thanks, Bob. Turning to Slide 8. Our advisory Services segment fee revenue and adjusted EBITDA fell about 31% and 60%, respectively. As expected, significant weakness in our high-margin but cycle sensitive sales and leasing businesses drove the declines. Our advisory adjusted EBITDA margin fell to around 10%, which was impacted by revenue compression, about $8 million in incremental COVID-related expenses and $11 million for the company's donation to our COVID relief fund. Together, these items reduced the advisory margin approximately 140 basis points in the quarter.  
Global leasing revenue declined about 38% as the pandemic negatively impacted our largest markets in the quarter. In the U.S., Continental Europe and the U.K., which collectively comprise over 80% of global leasing, revenue decreased 43%, 25% and 20%, respectively. Greater China, which comprised more than 3% of global leasing this quarter, achieved 14% growth following a 26% decline in Q1. While there was pressure across all property types in the quarter, industrial was resilient, with leasing revenue declining just 10%. We saw a similar pattern in property sales with global revenue down 48% and declines of 26% in Continental Europe, 51% in the U.S. and 76% in the U.K.  
Notably, we improved our U.S. market position significantly with 160 basis point share gain. Our 17.6% share for the quarter is 860 basis points more than our closest competitor. Like leasing, we saw a rebound in Greater China, with property sales climbing 46% after decreasing over 70% in Q1.  
Commercial mortgage revenue fell 28%, as most capital sources pulled back from lending. We did, however, see an increase in activity from banks with a strong appetite for office and industrial projects. The selling of credit markets that began in the second quarter has extended into July. Other Advisory Services business lines were less impacted by COVID during the quarter. Advisory Property and Project Management revenue fell about 8%, driven by the temporary shutdown of construction activity and reduced spending on capital projects.  
Valuation revenues fell about 12%, with modest growth in EMEA and our APAC market.  
Finally, loan servicing revenue grew 15% as our portfolio reached $245 billion. Our multifamily properties, which comprise nearly half of our global servicing portfolio and more than 2/3 in the U.S., is proving to be resilient during the pandemic. We have just a handful of loans and forbearance and have not received a new request since May.  
Turning to Slide 9. Our Global Workplace Solutions segment saw lighter than usual revenue performance, but strong growth in profitability. Facilities Management, which accounts for more than 85% of this segment's fee revenue and is a contractual business, saw a 7% growth. This was offset by more cyclically sensitive Project Management and transaction services, which together, posted a 33% fee revenue decline. Even with lower contributions from these higher-margin revenue sources and $17 million incurred for COVID-related expenses and $3 million for the COVID relief fund, GWS' adjusted EBITDA margin on fee revenue expanded more than 170 basis points to 15.4%, leading to adjusted EBITDA growth of more than 11%. This is the highest quarterly margin ever for the GWS business, and our performance was driven by proactive cost management. We sustained a high contract renewal rate in the quarter, and the new business pipeline continued to increase from year-end levels.  
COVID logistical challenges continue to hamper and prolong the contracting and onboarding processes. Yet, after a pause at the onset of the COVID crisis, companies are beginning to move ahead with outsourcing plans as they seek to capture efficiencies in a constrained economic environment. GWS is also a well-diversified business, serving clients across a wide array, property types and industries, including many deemed essential during the current crisis. We're very proud of the work our GWS team continues to do supporting our clients during this challenging time.  
Turning to Slide 10. Our Real Estate Investments segment adjusted EBITDA came in at $18 million, down 41%. It included incremental COVID expenses and the relief fund donation allocation, which together totaled about $2 million. Investment management was the standout performer with adjusted EBITDA rising 62%. This reflected strong growth in recurring asset management fees, AUM, increasing $3 billion from a year earlier period as well as higher carried interest in co-investment returns, partially offset by lower acquisition, incentives and disposition fees. Our focus on core and core plus strategies is highly advantageous in the current environment. Capital raising remained elevated, totaling $11.4 billion over the past 12 months.  
As Bob mentioned, U.S. development is well positioned entering the downturn. Although adjusted EBITDA fell about 55%, this was largely due to deal timing. We continue to be optimistic about second half performance as our in process activity stands at $13.7 billion. About half of that activity is comprised of fee development and build-to-suit and the remaining assets are well capitalized with strong equity partners.  
Our development business in the U.K. incurred an adjusted EBITDA loss of $11 million during the period. This loss was largely attributable to transitory operational challenges due to COVID-19 including temporary construction stoppages and other challenges as well as constrained sales activity. We expect performance to improve now that construction and commercial activities have largely reduced assumed.  
Lastly, the $9 million adjusted EBITDA loss in our enterprise-focused co-working solution, Hana, was in line with Q1 performance. Hana's results in the period were impacted by mandated shutdowns and elevated costs to ensure the safety of occupants as units reopened.  
Let's now take a look at our 2020 outlook on Slide 11. Given the continued uncertainty about COVID-19 trajectory and its impact on the broader economy, we will again refrain from providing explicit EPS guidance, however, we will discuss our expectations for the remainder of 2020 in detail. Starting with Advisory Services segment, where our revenue decline was shallower than we expected in the second quarter, we now expect the recovery in our transaction businesses to be more gradual and drawn out. We expect revenue declines in Q3 and Q4 to be similar to that of Q2 with relatively better performance outside of the Americas.  
Sales and leasing revenue, while off significantly in the quarter, benefited from robust pipelines built before the COVID crisis. Future performance is highly dependent on pipeline replenishment, and we are tracking signed confidentiality agreements and other leading indicators to inform our expectations for the remainder of the year. For the rest of the Advisory business combined, we expect a mid- to high single-digit revenue decline.  
Variable costs, which comprise about half of our Advisory cost structure, are expected to decline a bit more than overall revenue. We anticipate a modest mid-single-digit decrease in Advisory fixed costs, as it typically takes longer for our actions in this area to show an impact.  
Moving to GWS. We expect gross revenue to rise in the mid-single digits and fee revenue in the mid- to high-single digits, with growth in contractual Facilities Management revenue offsetting an expected decline in GWS transaction revenue. As a result of disciplined cost management, we also expect to achieve modest margin expansion, which will drive high-single digit adjusted EBITDA growth. This growth rate includes an expected headwind from COVID related items in the mid-single-digit range. Our outlook is also premised on slower growth and Facilities Management revenue, as we faced tough compares in Q3 and Q4 when facilities management achieved growth of 15% and 18%, respectively.  
Our first half results benefited from the high level of client onboarding in late 2019 that drove the strong prior year growth rate. Simultaneously, while the logistical challenges of contracting and onboarding clients are slowly receding, we did not bring on new clients during the first half at the same pace as last year. This is expected to weigh on growth in Q3 and Q4, and we would expect growth to resume to double-digit levels once these new client transition delays abate.  
Looking at REI. We continue to believe our core legacy business lines, global investment management and U.S. development are well positioned for the current environment, and we anticipate more resilient performance than during the last downturn. In Investment management, we expect adjusted EBITDA growth in the mid-teens range as higher recurring adjusted EBITDA is offset by lower contributions from net promotes as dispositions slow and lower co-investment returns. We expect U.S. development to contribute similar adjusted EBITDA as in 2019 as investors continue to have an appetite for high-quality assets.  
At present, nearly 80% of our in-process portfolio is comprised of health care, industrial and multifamily properties, and office properties that are at least 90% leased. We expect U.K. multifamily residential development to generate sequentially improved adjusted EBITDA in each of the remaining quarters and be about breakeven for the year.  
Construction resumed during May, and we remain confident in the long-term trajectory of this business, given the housing shortage in the U.K. and our robust pipeline of new projects. Similarly, we continue to believe in the long-term rationale for our investment in Hana, but expect to incur a larger adjusted EBITDA loss in 2020 than in the prior year. This is primarily the result of additional units being brought online in 2020 as well as revenue delays due to COVID-19 related shutdowns and longer new unit development periods.  
Longer term, we see an opportunity for an accelerated transition to an asset-light investment model, partly catalyzed by dislocations in the flex based market.  
Turning to Slide 12. Our financial position has continued to strengthen despite the challenges of COVID-19. We ended Q2 with just 0.6 turns of leverage, down 0.2 turns from a year ago, and $3.5 billion of liquidity, an increase of $0.5 billion from the year ago period. In addition, we have no debt maturing until 2023. Given the uncertainty around the virus' trajectory and its impact on economic activity, we will continue to prioritize liquidity over discretionary capital deployment.  
Once we have more confidence in an economic recovery, we will resume deploying discretionary capital in line with our capital allocation strategy. In the meantime, we are continuing to prioritize investments in our people and platform and selective M&A. A key focus will be companies that enhance the diversification of our service offerings and resiliency of the overall business by increasing the scale of less cyclical business lines. Finally, we view our share price as highly attractive at current levels and could resume repurchases when appropriate, if we are unable to identify suitable and properly priced acquisition opportunities. While the environment remains highly uncertain, we're confident that our business and our capital structure are positioned to not only weather the challenges presented by COVID but build on our industry leadership position and maximize long-term earnings growth.  
With that, I'll ask you to turn to Slide 13, as Bob provides a few closing thoughts."

This certainly has been a trying time for everyone, and we are proud of how our people have helped our clients and our company to navigate the COVID-19 crisis. In addition to the challenges of COVID-19, recent months have also seen significant social unrest here in the U.S., which has called attention to the racial inequality and injustice that have persisted in our society for too long. It has also highlighted the need for better progress on diversity and inclusion within Corporate America.  
From speaking with many of you, we know that this topic is extremely important to our shareholders, and you expect us to address it. So I'll take a few moments to tell you where we are. We have made progress with diversity and inclusion on several fronts. For example, since 2015, we have meaningfully increased diversity on both our Board of Directors and Management Executive Committee and put more women into key leadership roles. These are important gains that we are proud of. At the same time, we must do more to improve ethnic diversity at our company, particularly within our management and brokerage ranks. This is a challenge we are focused on and actively addressing.  
Last month, we appointed our first Chief Diversity Officer, Tim Dismond, who has long been a senior leader at CBRE. Tim has joined the 12-member Global Executive Committee that is responsible for running our company and will report directly to me. We intend to give Tim the necessary resources and support to accelerate our progress on diversity and inclusion. This is a priority for me personally as well as for the company. 
With that, operator, we'll open the lines for questions."

So this is what we know. There will be more flexibility to do hybrid working going forward. There will be more work from home. There will also be a big focus on the office on an enduring basis. Something like 80% of the big clients we surveyed said that the office will be as important or almost as important as it was historically. And by the way, that answer came in the midst of the COVID crisis and all that goes with the COVID crisis. The other thing we know is that space will be de-densified. And so the net-net of what will happen is, yes, there'll be more work from home, there'll be less people in the office, but almost everybody will be back in the office in a less dense format. That's what will play out in the long run. In the short run, people are trying to avoid making decisions until they have more clarity on what's going to happen with COVID-19."

And so we need to see really where that equilibrium shakes out. We certainly are seeing activity continue. And it's not as severe as we had expected, as I said in my remarks. But I think it will be really critical to begin to see leasing decisions on a larger scale basis, particularly on the large leasing transactions. The place where we've seen the most significant decline is on those large transactions. We still have actually seen a high-volume of transactions. But on a relative basis, they've been on a smaller set of -- or smaller size deals. So I think we really need to see confidence come back around leasing that will lead to more strong and confident underwriting behind our investor clients.

Here's generally what happens though. And by the way, this was happening before COVID. You look at the percentage of your people that are in the office at any given point in time, and then you add a buffer on top of that, and you tend to size to that amount of space. So that's probably going to come down some. If 10% or 15% or 20% of people are going to work a couple of days from home a week. That number will come down some. But the amount of space per person is going to go up meaningfully. I mean offices have gotten pretty dense going into COVID-19, and that trend had been going on for years and years. We don't know exactly where that's going to play out, but it could offset most of the downward pressure in what we're seeing from people working from home. 
By the way, I'll give you my personal view on this from having talked to a lot of clients. I think the certainty about people working from home to some degree is at least as high as everybody says it is. I think the certainty about people coming back to the office is higher than the headlines out there today because it's exciting to give a new headline to talk about all the productivity of working from home. But then you go talk to executives that run businesses that have to deal with onboarding new people, moving managers around, oversee new people, training people, dealing with collaboration, dealing with creativity, and what you hear is we've got to get people back to the office. So I think both of those trends have high certainty, more working from home and the importance of the office going further -- going forward. And maybe they'll offset each other. The actual math hasn't sorted out yet."

So utilization is -- you can't get any read on utilization. But from day 1, Hana was a suite model. It was a model that was oriented toward institutional occupiers, strong focus on data security, strong focus on a very professionally managed environment. And here's what it does for occupiers that we believe will make it an important concept going forward. It allows you to -- the flexibility to move in and out quickly without capital expenditures. It allows you the flexibility to assemble teams in a particular market or a different market for relatively short periods of time. By the way, not months, but years, short -- instead of 5 years, a year or 2 years. We believe that will be at least as important going forward as it was before COVID-19. We are excited about the Hana model. We are anticipating that it will be more of a service provider model and that the landlords will actually own the units going forward. There was a move in that direction anyway. So we think strategically, Hana was oriented toward a market that we're going to see post-COVID-19 and about 2/3 of the clients we surveyed suggested that co-working, although they're going to call it flexible space going forward, will be a significant part of what they do in their utilization of space in the future."

And ultimately, if those investment opportunities are capped or are exhausted and we don't see anything that's attractive on the horizon, our next lever for us within the capital allocation strategy is our buyback. Now that is something that we consider in the context of a more normalized environment, and we want to make sure that we use our buyback in a framework -- within a framework that is cognizant of our current leverage in the overall economic environment. And so my comments were meant to imply within our current capital allocation strategy. In a normal environment, we would actually be in the market from a share repurchase perspective. But given the importance that we're placing on liquidity today because of the uncertainty around COVID, we are taking a more conservative approach and, therefore, preserving capital.

They're pretty similar to what we saw last year, but certainly, the pipeline is up. I would add that the pipeline continues to grow. It's just the period of transition from when we sign a contract to then go into full transition mode. That's the part that has presented a challenge for us just in terms of driving growth out of that pipeline. We certainly aren't seeing a lack of interest in our service offerings. It's just we're in the moment of a crisis, and there's a bit of a pause in terms of decisions that are being made, not just on our leasing and Advisory business but also within our Occupier Outsourcing business.

With respect to distressed sales, there are some, but I would say, investors are being very patient. I think it's important to remember that coming into this public health crisis, this was not an over stretched industry from an underwriting perspective. There was discipline. Cap rates were strong, and it was in a situation where there was over leverage and significant bubble like activity.

Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing our financial results and posted it on the Investor Relations page of our website, cbre.com, along with the presentation slide deck that you can use to follow along with our prepared remarks as well as an Excel file that contains additional supplemental materials.  
Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows: first, I'll provide an overview of our financial results for the quarter; next, Bob Sulentic, our President and CEO; and Leah Stearns, our CFO, will discuss our second quarter results in more detail. After their comments, we'll open up the call for your questions. 
Before I begin, I'll remind you that this presentation contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding CBRE's future growth prospects, operations, market share, capital deployment, acquisition, integration, financial performance and 2020 outlook including the impact of COVID-19 and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical fact. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. 
For a full discussion of the risks and other factors that may impact these forward-looking statements, please refer to this morning's earnings release and our most recent annual and quarterly reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, respectively.  
We have provided reconciliations of adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, fee revenue and certain other non-GAAP financial measures included in our remarks to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, together with explanations of these measures in the appendix of the presentation slide deck.  
Now please turn to Slide 4 of our presentation, which highlights our financial results for the second quarter of 2020. Total revenue and fee revenue fell about 6% and 21%, respectively, driven by declines in advisory and REI. Lower revenue, coupled with $25 million of incremental COVID-related costs and a $16 million donation to the company's COVID relief fund caused adjusted EBITDA to fall 43%.  
Overall, adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.35, including the negative impact of around $0.10 attributable to the COVID-related expenses and relief fund donation.  
Now for insights on the quarter and our longer-term outlook, please turn to Slide 6, and I will turn the call over to Bob."
4204816,675444536,2070882,"CBRE Group, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 31, 2020",2020-07-31,"Earnings Calls","CBRE Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Kristyn, and good morning, everyone. As expected, COVID-19 took a toll on our performance in the second quarter with impacts felt across every part of our business.

As expected, COVID-19 took a toll on our performance in the second quarter with impacts felt across every part of our business. However, the overall impact was cushioned by our diverse business mix, particularly to sustained growth of our contractual businesses over the past decade. We also benefited from early moves to reduce our expense base. A process that is continuing and strengthened our financial position and cash flow generation despite the ongoing challenges from the pandemic. Double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth in our Global Workplace Solutions segment demonstrated the resiliency of a business that occupier clients increasingly rely on in good times and bad to run essential operations and drive critical cost efficiencies. 
Since the global financial crisis, other parts of our business have become more resilient as well. For example, our U.S. development business is expected to earn twice as much, both this year and next as it did at the peak of the last market cycle. This reflects greater emphasis on core product development, particularly industrial and multifamily projects, along with an emphasis on fee development.  
We have built a $245 billion loan servicing portfolio that adds growing recurring revenue to our capital markets offering. We are large originators for Freddie and Fannie, which are expected to match last year's loan volumes this year, and we are positioned to capture a significant share of their business.  
Our investment management business grew nicely in the quarter. Today, it earns a significant majority of its adjusted EBITDA from recurring asset management fees. This business continues to raise new capital at a brisk pace, so the revenue base should grow.  
Like any major crisis, COVID will have near-term and long-term effects on our sector and how we serve clients. In the near term, we've seen precipitous drop in leasing and sales activity. Investment capital has moved to the sidelines as investors begin the process of price discovery.  
Occupiers are hesitant to make long-term decisions amid the uncertainty preferring short-term lease renewals where possible. Our ongoing interaction with major occupier clients has given us insight into their current thinking. 3 distinct trends are emerging. First, most companies will give their employees greater flexibility to choose between working in the office and working from home. Second, the physical office will remain vitally important in these hybrid work models, particularly in fostering culture and collaboration and attracting talent. Third, the decades-long densification trend is likely to reverse, negating some of the effects on office demand associated with more remote working.  
The pandemic has elevated the importance of the workplace strategy on corporate agendas. Now more than ever, clients will need the strategic insight, thoughtful advice and reliable execution that CBRE and our people are best positioned to provide. We have built the company for opportunities like this and intend to capitalize on it.  
Now I'm going to turn the call over to Leah, who will take you through the second quarter."

Our advisory Services segment fee revenue and adjusted EBITDA fell about 31% and 60%, respectively. As expected, significant weakness in our high-margin but cycle sensitive sales and leasing businesses drove the declines. Our advisory adjusted EBITDA margin fell to around 10%, which was impacted by revenue compression, about $8 million in incremental COVID-related expenses and $11 million for the company's donation to our COVID relief fund. Together, these items reduced the advisory margin approximately 140 basis points in the quarter.  
Global leasing revenue declined about 38% as the pandemic negatively impacted our largest markets in the quarter. In the U.S., Continental Europe and the U.K., which collectively comprise over 80% of global leasing, revenue decreased 43%, 25% and 20%, respectively. Greater China, which comprised more than 3% of global leasing this quarter, achieved 14% growth following a 26% decline in Q1. While there was pressure across all property types in the quarter, industrial was resilient, with leasing revenue declining just 10%. We saw a similar pattern in property sales with global revenue down 48% and declines of 26% in Continental Europe, 51% in the U.S. and 76% in the U.K.  
Notably, we improved our U.S. market position significantly with 160 basis point share gain. Our 17.6% share for the quarter is 860 basis points more than our closest competitor. Like leasing, we saw a rebound in Greater China, with property sales climbing 46% after decreasing over 70% in Q1.  
Commercial mortgage revenue fell 28%, as most capital sources pulled back from lending. We did, however, see an increase in activity from banks with a strong appetite for office and industrial projects. The selling of credit markets that began in the second quarter has extended into July. Other Advisory Services business lines were less impacted by COVID during the quarter. Advisory Property and Project Management revenue fell about 8%, driven by the temporary shutdown of construction activity and reduced spending on capital projects.  
Valuation revenues fell about 12%, with modest growth in EMEA and our APAC market.  
Finally, loan servicing revenue grew 15% as our portfolio reached $245 billion. Our multifamily properties, which comprise nearly half of our global servicing portfolio and more than 2/3 in the U.S., is proving to be resilient during the pandemic. We have just a handful of loans and forbearance and have not received a new request since May.  
Turning to Slide 9. Our Global Workplace Solutions segment saw lighter than usual revenue performance, but strong growth in profitability. Facilities Management, which accounts for more than 85% of this segment's fee revenue and is a contractual business, saw a 7% growth. This was offset by more cyclically sensitive Project Management and transaction services, which together, posted a 33% fee revenue decline. Even with lower contributions from these higher-margin revenue sources and $17 million incurred for COVID-related expenses and $3 million for the COVID relief fund, GWS' adjusted EBITDA margin on fee revenue expanded more than 170 basis points to 15.4%, leading to adjusted EBITDA growth of more than 11%. This is the highest quarterly margin ever for the GWS business, and our performance was driven by proactive cost management. We sustained a high contract renewal rate in the quarter, and the new business pipeline continued to increase from year-end levels.  
COVID logistical challenges continue to hamper and prolong the contracting and onboarding processes. Yet, after a pause at the onset of the COVID crisis, companies are beginning to move ahead with outsourcing plans as they seek to capture efficiencies in a constrained economic environment. GWS is also a well-diversified business, serving clients across a wide array, property types and industries, including many deemed essential during the current crisis. We're very proud of the work our GWS team continues to do supporting our clients during this challenging time.  
Turning to Slide 10. Our Real Estate Investments segment adjusted EBITDA came in at $18 million, down 41%. It included incremental COVID expenses and the relief fund donation allocation, which together totaled about $2 million. Investment management was the standout performer with adjusted EBITDA rising 62%. This reflected strong growth in recurring asset management fees, AUM, increasing $3 billion from a year earlier period as well as higher carried interest in co-investment returns, partially offset by lower acquisition, incentives and disposition fees. Our focus on core and core plus strategies is highly advantageous in the current environment. Capital raising remained elevated, totaling $11.4 billion over the past 12 months.  
As Bob mentioned, U.S. development is well positioned entering the downturn. Although adjusted EBITDA fell about 55%, this was largely due to deal timing. We continue to be optimistic about second half performance as our in process activity stands at $13.7 billion. About half of that activity is comprised of fee development and build-to-suit and the remaining assets are well capitalized with strong equity partners.  
Our development business in the U.K. incurred an adjusted EBITDA loss of $11 million during the period. This loss was largely attributable to transitory operational challenges due to COVID-19 including temporary construction stoppages and other challenges as well as constrained sales activity. We expect performance to improve now that construction and commercial activities have largely reduced assumed.  
Lastly, the $9 million adjusted EBITDA loss in our enterprise-focused co-working solution, Hana, was in line with Q1 performance. Hana's results in the period were impacted by mandated shutdowns and elevated costs to ensure the safety of occupants as units reopened.  
Let's now take a look at our 2020 outlook on Slide 11. Given the continued uncertainty about COVID-19 trajectory and its impact on the broader economy, we will again refrain from providing explicit EPS guidance, however, we will discuss our expectations for the remainder of 2020 in detail. Starting with Advisory Services segment, where our revenue decline was shallower than we expected in the second quarter, we now expect the recovery in our transaction businesses to be more gradual and drawn out. We expect revenue declines in Q3 and Q4 to be similar to that of Q2 with relatively better performance outside of the Americas.  
Sales and leasing revenue, while off significantly in the quarter, benefited from robust pipelines built before the COVID crisis. Future performance is highly dependent on pipeline replenishment, and we are tracking signed confidentiality agreements and other leading indicators to inform our expectations for the remainder of the year. For the rest of the Advisory business combined, we expect a mid- to high single-digit revenue decline.  
Variable costs, which comprise about half of our Advisory cost structure, are expected to decline a bit more than overall revenue. We anticipate a modest mid-single-digit decrease in Advisory fixed costs, as it typically takes longer for our actions in this area to show an impact.  
Moving to GWS. We expect gross revenue to rise in the mid-single digits and fee revenue in the mid- to high-single digits, with growth in contractual Facilities Management revenue offsetting an expected decline in GWS transaction revenue. As a result of disciplined cost management, we also expect to achieve modest margin expansion, which will drive high-single digit adjusted EBITDA growth. This growth rate includes an expected headwind from COVID related items in the mid-single-digit range. Our outlook is also premised on slower growth and Facilities Management revenue, as we faced tough compares in Q3 and Q4 when facilities management achieved growth of 15% and 18%, respectively.  
Our first half results benefited from the high level of client onboarding in late 2019 that drove the strong prior year growth rate. Simultaneously, while the logistical challenges of contracting and onboarding clients are slowly receding, we did not bring on new clients during the first half at the same pace as last year. This is expected to weigh on growth in Q3 and Q4, and we would expect growth to resume to double-digit levels once these new client transition delays abate.  
Looking at REI. We continue to believe our core legacy business lines, global investment management and U.S. development are well positioned for the current environment, and we anticipate more resilient performance than during the last downturn. In Investment management, we expect adjusted EBITDA growth in the mid-teens range as higher recurring adjusted EBITDA is offset by lower contributions from net promotes as dispositions slow and lower co-investment returns. We expect U.S. development to contribute similar adjusted EBITDA as in 2019 as investors continue to have an appetite for high-quality assets.  
At present, nearly 80% of our in-process portfolio is comprised of health care, industrial and multifamily properties, and office properties that are at least 90% leased. We expect U.K. multifamily residential development to generate sequentially improved adjusted EBITDA in each of the remaining quarters and be about breakeven for the year.  
Construction resumed during May, and we remain confident in the long-term trajectory of this business, given the housing shortage in the U.K. and our robust pipeline of new projects. Similarly, we continue to believe in the long-term rationale for our investment in Hana, but expect to incur a larger adjusted EBITDA loss in 2020 than in the prior year. This is primarily the result of additional units being brought online in 2020 as well as revenue delays due to COVID-19 related shutdowns and longer new unit development periods.  
Longer term, we see an opportunity for an accelerated transition to an asset-light investment model, partly catalyzed by dislocations in the flex based market.  
Turning to Slide 12. Our financial position has continued to strengthen despite the challenges of COVID-19. We ended Q2 with just 0.6 turns of leverage, down 0.2 turns from a year ago, and $3.5 billion of liquidity, an increase of $0.5 billion from the year ago period. In addition, we have no debt maturing until 2023. Given the uncertainty around the virus' trajectory and its impact on economic activity, we will continue to prioritize liquidity over discretionary capital deployment.  
Once we have more confidence in an economic recovery, we will resume deploying discretionary capital in line with our capital allocation strategy. In the meantime, we are continuing to prioritize investments in our people and platform and selective M&A. A key focus will be companies that enhance the diversification of our service offerings and resiliency of the overall business by increasing the scale of less cyclical business lines. Finally, we view our share price as highly attractive at current levels and could resume repurchases when appropriate, if we are unable to identify suitable and properly priced acquisition opportunities. While the environment remains highly uncertain, we're confident that our business and our capital structure are positioned to not only weather the challenges presented by COVID but build on our industry leadership position and maximize long-term earnings growth.  
With that, I'll ask you to turn to Slide 13, as Bob provides a few closing thoughts."

This certainly has been a trying time for everyone, and we are proud of how our people have helped our clients and our company to navigate the COVID-19 crisis. In addition to the challenges of COVID-19, recent months have also seen significant social unrest here in the U.S., which has called attention to the racial inequality and injustice that have persisted in our society for too long. It has also highlighted the need for better progress on diversity and inclusion within Corporate America.  
From speaking with many of you, we know that this topic is extremely important to our shareholders, and you expect us to address it. So I'll take a few moments to tell you where we are. We have made progress with diversity and inclusion on several fronts. For example, since 2015, we have meaningfully increased diversity on both our Board of Directors and Management Executive Committee and put more women into key leadership roles. These are important gains that we are proud of. At the same time, we must do more to improve ethnic diversity at our company, particularly within our management and brokerage ranks. This is a challenge we are focused on and actively addressing.  
Last month, we appointed our first Chief Diversity Officer, Tim Dismond, who has long been a senior leader at CBRE. Tim has joined the 12-member Global Executive Committee that is responsible for running our company and will report directly to me. We intend to give Tim the necessary resources and support to accelerate our progress on diversity and inclusion. This is a priority for me personally as well as for the company. 
With that, operator, we'll open the lines for questions."

So this is what we know. There will be more flexibility to do hybrid working going forward. There will be more work from home. There will also be a big focus on the office on an enduring basis. Something like 80% of the big clients we surveyed said that the office will be as important or almost as important as it was historically. And by the way, that answer came in the midst of the COVID crisis and all that goes with the COVID crisis. The other thing we know is that space will be de-densified. And so the net-net of what will happen is, yes, there'll be more work from home, there'll be less people in the office, but almost everybody will be back in the office in a less dense format. That's what will play out in the long run. In the short run, people are trying to avoid making decisions until they have more clarity on what's going to happen with COVID-19."

I think that is critical to regaining confidence. Part of the price discovery that's going on right now, I think, starts with seeing a recovery on the leasing side to really build confidence on the investor side. And so we need to see really where that equilibrium shakes out. We certainly are seeing activity continue. And it's not as severe as we had expected, as I said in my remarks. But I think it will be really critical to begin to see leasing decisions on a larger scale basis, particularly on the large leasing transactions. The place where we've seen the most significant decline is on those large transactions. We still have actually seen a high-volume of transactions. But on a relative basis, they've been on a smaller set of -- or smaller size deals. So I think we really need to see confidence come back around leasing that will lead to more strong and confident underwriting behind our investor clients. And I think that will lead to better capital market performance in the future."

Here's generally what happens though. And by the way, this was happening before COVID. You look at the percentage of your people that are in the office at any given point in time, and then you add a buffer on top of that, and you tend to size to that amount of space. So that's probably going to come down some. If 10% or 15% or 20% of people are going to work a couple of days from home a week. That number will come down some. But the amount of space per person is going to go up meaningfully. I mean offices have gotten pretty dense going into COVID-19, and that trend had been going on for years and years. We don't know exactly where that's going to play out, but it could offset most of the downward pressure in what we're seeing from people working from home. 
By the way, I'll give you my personal view on this from having talked to a lot of clients. I think the certainty about people working from home to some degree is at least as high as everybody says it is. I think the certainty about people coming back to the office is higher than the headlines out there today because it's exciting to give a new headline to talk about all the productivity of working from home. But then you go talk to executives that run businesses that have to deal with onboarding new people, moving managers around, oversee new people, training people, dealing with collaboration, dealing with creativity, and what you hear is we've got to get people back to the office. So I think both of those trends have high certainty, more working from home and the importance of the office going further -- going forward. And maybe they'll offset each other. The actual math hasn't sorted out yet."

So utilization is -- you can't get any read on utilization. But from day 1, Hana was a suite model. It was a model that was oriented toward institutional occupiers, strong focus on data security, strong focus on a very professionally managed environment. And here's what it does for occupiers that we believe will make it an important concept going forward. It allows you to -- the flexibility to move in and out quickly without capital expenditures. It allows you the flexibility to assemble teams in a particular market or a different market for relatively short periods of time. By the way, not months, but years, short -- instead of 5 years, a year or 2 years. We believe that will be at least as important going forward as it was before COVID-19. We are excited about the Hana model. We are anticipating that it will be more of a service provider model and that the landlords will actually own the units going forward. There was a move in that direction anyway. So we think strategically, Hana was oriented toward a market that we're going to see post-COVID-19 and about 2/3 of the clients we surveyed suggested that co-working, although they're going to call it flexible space going forward, will be a significant part of what they do in their utilization of space in the future."

We then look at how do we add capabilities to our existing lines of business or potentially add new capabilities that will serve our clients in the most effective and value creative way. And ultimately, if those investment opportunities are capped or are exhausted and we don't see anything that's attractive on the horizon, our next lever for us within the capital allocation strategy is our buyback. Now that is something that we consider in the context of a more normalized environment, and we want to make sure that we use our buyback in a framework -- within a framework that is cognizant of our current leverage in the overall economic environment. And so my comments were meant to imply within our current capital allocation strategy. In a normal environment, we would actually be in the market from a share repurchase perspective. But given the importance that we're placing on liquidity today because of the uncertainty around COVID, we are taking a more conservative approach and, therefore, preserving capital. We believe that moments and times like this can create incredible opportunities for investments that wouldn't otherwise present themselves.

We're seeing activity across many different sectors, life sciences, TMT industrial. So I think overall, we're seeing lots of opportunities across many different areas of our client base. They're pretty similar to what we saw last year, but certainly, the pipeline is up. I would add that the pipeline continues to grow. It's just the period of transition from when we sign a contract to then go into full transition mode. That's the part that has presented a challenge for us just in terms of driving growth out of that pipeline. We certainly aren't seeing a lack of interest in our service offerings. It's just we're in the moment of a crisis, and there's a bit of a pause in terms of decisions that are being made, not just on our leasing and Advisory business but also within our Occupier Outsourcing business. So as soon as we begin to see momentum convert from that pipeline into transitions and ultimately allow us to begin monetizing those new outsourcing contracts, I think that business will be back on its normal double-digit trajectory going forward."

It's just uncertain given all of the COVID-related issues, if we do see a second wave, whether or not there will be an opportunity for more price discovery. With respect to distressed sales, there are some, but I would say, investors are being very patient. I think it's important to remember that coming into this public health crisis, this was not an over stretched industry from an underwriting perspective. There was discipline. Cap rates were strong, and it was in a situation where there was over leverage and significant bubble like activity. So we feel really good that owners of properties today are sitting there and have the ability to be patient and can weather this crisis."

Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing our financial results and it is posted on the Investor Relations page website, cbre.com, along with the slide deck that you can use to follow along with our prepared remarks as well as an Excel file that contains additional supplemental materials. Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows: first, I'll provide an overview of our financial results for the quarter. Next, Bob Sulentic, our President and CEO; and Leah Stearns, our CFO, will discuss our third quarter results in more detail. After their comments, we'll open up the call for your questions.  
Before I begin, I'll remind you that this presentation contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding CBRE's future growth prospects, operations, market share, capital deployment, acquisition integration, financial performance, including profitability and margins, the active cost savings initiatives and our 2020 outlook, including the impact of COVID-19 and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical fact. 
We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. For a full discussion of the risks and other factors that may impact these forward-looking statements, please refer to this morning's earnings release and our most recent annual and quarterly reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, respectively. We have provided reconciliations of adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, fee revenue and certain other non-GAAP financial measures included in our remarks to most directly comparable GAAP measures, together with explanations of these measures in the appendix of our presentation slide deck.   
Now please turn to Slide 4 of our presentation, which highlights our financial results for the third quarter of 2020. Total revenue and fee revenue fell about 5% and 13%, respectively, driven by a decline in our Advisory Services segment. Lower revenue was partially offset by disciplined cost management and temporary cost reduction as well as the initial benefits of transformation initiatives targeted to improve the ongoing cost structure of the business. This limited the adjusted EBITDA decline to 3%. Overall, adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.73, while GAAP EPS, which includes around $0.13 of transformation initiative costs, totaled $0.55.   
Now for insights on the quarter and our longer-term outlook, please turn to Slide 6 as I turn it over to Bob."

Facilities management, which provides steady recurring revenue, has grown exponentially, with the portfolio up by. 1.7 billion square feet in 10 years and now totaling 4.2 billion square feet. And we have added a data center management capability that is growing robustly. Our industrial and multifamily offerings have also grown dramatically and are proving to be very resilient in the current environment. These offerings together cut across leasing, sales and mortgage origination and servicing. They also comprise the majority of our real estate development portfolio. U.S. Project management has grown fivefold in 10 years and is further catalyzing demand for this group's specialized services. Finally, our investment management business' core asset portfolio which has grown more than 300% over 10 years and now comprises nearly 85% of total AUM has held up quite well this year. The resilient aspects of our business are helping us weather the sharp COVID driven fall in property leasing and sales. 
Another key contributor was quickly aligning our expenses with reduced market demand. A significant portion of our compensation structure falls automatically in the current environment, and our global leadership team has rapidly implemented other cost management actions. Many of these actions were contemplated before COVID, following a strategically designed to enhance scalability and efficiency.   This work has been quite effective, cutting where appropriate without compromising our future. 
I want to briefly comment on the macro environment before handing the call to Leah. At the present time, COVID is putting downward pressure on parts of our business and creating larger opportunity in other parts, several of which I highlighted earlier. Inevitably, the magnitude of COVID's impact will diminish considerably once the public health crisis passes. We can expect our sales and leasing businesses, where decision-making is now largely frozen, to be prime beneficiaries. However, a significant amount of the total rhythm change will be permitted. For instance, our work with occupier clients confirms that companies will continue moving toward a hybrid model that combines working from the office and from home. Occupiers will take space for fewer employees but that space will be less densely populated, more intensely managed and more flexible. There will be a premium on high-quality, well-managed buildings with great infrastructure. 
We are continuing to take advantage of the strong secular growth trends that were driven by the last cycle, including occupier outsourcing, industrial and logistics space, institutional quality multifamily assets and workplace experienced services. We expect new secular opportunities to be created in the wake of COVID and are positioning our strategy and leadership focus and allocating our capital to make the most of them as the new cycle unfolds. With that, I'll turn the call over to Leah, who will take you through the quarter in detail."

While our advisory adjusted EB",1830,"Thanks, Bob. Turning to Slide 8. Our Advisory services segment fee revenue and adjusted EBITDA fell over 23% and nearly 32%, respectively,  reflecting weakness in high-margin sales and leasing activities that Bob alluded to. While our advisory adjusted EBITDA margin fell about 180 basis points year-over-year, it improved sequentially approximately 560 basis points to about 15.5%. This sequential improvement was due to the combined impact of short-term cost reductions, including continued furloughs, lower bonus accruals and tight management of travel and entertainment expenses as well as the initial impact of transformation and workforce optimization efforts. Additionally, about 190 basis points of the sequential improvement was due to the cadence of COVID-related items. 
Global leasing revenue declined about 31%, as the pandemic continued to negatively impact our major global markets. In the U.S., Continental Europe and the U.K., which together comprised about 81% of global leasing in the period, revenue decreased 36%, 22% and 6%, respectively. The U.K. benefited from some large industrial transactions during the quarter, which helped to offset weak demand for office space. Globally, industrial leasing fueled by the continued shift to e-commerce increased 10% in Q3 and 8% year-to-date. 
Advisory sales improved sequentially, falling 34% year-over-year in Q3 versus 48% in Q2. All 3 regions saw sequential improvement, paced by Continental Europe, where advisory sales revenue fell just 7% in Q3 compared with 26% in Q2. In the U.S., we added 280 basis points to our market share according to RCA, as investors seek out the best device and execution in a challenging market. Given the high level of institutional dry powder and continued low interest rates, investor demand for quality real estate assets with strong rent rolls and creditworthy tenants remain solid despite the pandemic. Commercial mortgage revenue fell 21% in the quarter. The lending environment improved marginally from the second quarter, but lenders remained quite conservative in their underwriting standards, which weighed on volumes. 
Notably, multifamily volumes rebounded sequentially during the quarter, and by September, exceeded the prior year level. Refinancing activity comprised 60% of our year-to-date originations, up from the typical 40% to 50% range. Our other advisory services business line were less impacted by COVID during the quarter. Valuation revenue fell about 10%, in line with the last quarter, while advisory property and project management and loan servicing each saw fee revenue growth of over 2%. Core growth in loan servicing was the result of lower loan prepayment fees. Excluding prepayment fees, our servicing revenue would have grown at a low double-digit clip, consistent with previous quarters. The loan servicing portfolio grew 13% over the prior year period and 3% sequentially to nearly $253 billion. Forbearance requests also continued to be immaterial for this business.   
Turning to Slide 9. Our Global Workplace Solutions business increased fee revenue nearly 6%, as 9% growth in Facilities Management and 13% growth in Project Management offset a steep decline in GWS transaction revenue. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded nearly 480 basis points to nearly 17% despite the loss of high-margin transaction revenue, and this was our second consecutive quarter of record profitability. This strong improvement in profitability was partially driven by temporary measures, primarily associated with lower discretionary spending and bonus accruals,  long-term cost efficiency initiatives and about $12 million in expenses in the prior year period that did not recur. Structural changes to the cost structure contributed about 1/3 of the margin improvement. We also expect to drive gradual long-term improvements in profitability as our client relationships expand and mature.   Long-tenured satisfied clients typically expand their scope of service and engage us to support their project and transaction management needs. 
While our margins are improving and our new business pipeline is strong, we continue to feel the effects of pandemic-related delays in securing and onboarding new GWS clients. Several large contract decisions slipped from Q3 to Q4, while others are temporarily on hold. As a result, we continue to expect top line growth to be more muted than we would typically expect in a more normal recessionary environment.   
Turning to Slide 10. Let's now look at our Real Estate Investments segment, where we achieved $65 million of adjusted EBITDA, a $51 million increase from the prior year period. Development was the standout performer, with adjusted EBITDA rising to approximately $50 million, reflecting a large number of asset sales and a small contribution from the U.K. multifamily development business we acquired last October. We are benefiting from positioning our portfolio to meet elevated demand for multifamily, industrial and healthcare assets. In fact, these 3 property types, plus office buildings that are at least 90% leased, comprise over 80% of our in process activity. Because of this and our sizable pipeline, we expect our development business will remain resilient moving forward. 
Our investment management business also had an impressive quarter. Adjusted EBITDA rose over 12%, and importantly, adjusted EBITDA from recurring sources increased nearly 70%. This reflected continued strong growth in assets under management, which reached a new record at $114.5 billion and more than offset a lower contribution from carried interest revenue and co-investment returns.   
Lastly, Cana's adjusted EBITDA loss of nearly $10 million was slightly higher than in the last quarter. Cana's results continue to be impacted by lower-than-anticipated occupancy as a result of the pandemic   as well as costs associated with expanding our enterprise focused, flexible space solutions. 
Turning to Slide 11. Given COVID-19's uncertain trajectory and adverse economic impact, we will again refrain from providing explicit EPS guidance, but we'll provide an update on our expectations for the full year and fourth quarter. In advisory, we are taking a conservative view of transaction activity in Q4. Transaction revenue has performed better than expected during this crisis, which is partially driven by the transaction size and geographic diversification embedded in our business. In the U.S., deals $250,000, which comprise over half of total transaction revenue declined about 26% year-to-date versus 40% decrease from transactions over $2 million. We anticipate a similar benefit of this diversification in our Q4 results, but also expect the transaction business to recover more gradually. We expect sales and leasing revenue together to be down approximately 30% to 40% in Q4, in line with the trends we saw in the second and third quarters, with the Americas slightly lagging other parts of the world. For the rest of the advisory business combined, we foresee a mid- single-digit revenue decline in the fourth quarter. This reflects the expectation that Q4 will be our highest revenue-generating quarter as it usually is. 
Given this uptick in revenue and our continued focus on cost management, we expect advisory adjusted EBITDA fee margin to continue expanding by around 2% compared with Q3. 
Moving to GWS. We now believe growth in fee revenue will rise in the mid single-digit range for the year, with growth in contractual facilities management and project management revenue offsetting continued weakness fraction. This marginally lower than normal growth expectation reflects our view that the pandemic related delays I mentioned earlier will improve more slow than we previously expected. At the same time, we expect double-digit full year adjusted EBITDA growth, reflecting the benefit of stronger-than-expected Q3 performance and the continuation of our cost management efforts into Q4. We expect margin expansion will be slower sequentially as the benefit of temporary cost actions dissipate. 
Looking at REI, our global investment management and development business lines are well positioned for the current environment, and we foresee more resilient performance than during the last downturn. In Investment Management, we anticipate adjusted EBITDA will grow in the high teens range from the $91 million achieved last year. We now expect growth in recurring EBITDA stemming from our growing AUM   to be complemented by higher expectations for incentive fees and carried interest than we previously anticipated. We now project U.S. development adjusted EBITDA to exceed the more than $100 million generated in 2019. Demand for quality assets has been stronger than we previously anticipated and we now expect to complete more asset sales before year end. 
We again expect sequential growth in adjusted EBITDA from U.K. multifamily development in Q4. The pace of improvement since the peak of the pandemic has exceeded our expectations, and we now expect a small but positive EBITDA contribution from U.K. multifamily development for the full year. This is an improvement from the breakeven performance we expected previously. 
And finally, our expectations for HANA remain consistent with our previous outlook, with an adjusted EBITDA loss of around $35 million to $40 million for 2020, which is marginally higher than the loss incurred in 2019. 
Turning to Slide 12. We've continued to fortify our financial position throughout the COVID-19 crisis.   On a run rate basis, we have lowered our expense structure by nearly $200 million. We expect to realize about $120 million of this in 2020 and approximately $80 million in 2021. We primarily achieved these reductions by making structural changes in the design of our workforce, while also focusing on rightsizing our cost base and teams to meet future demand. In addition, our liquidity has increased by almost $1 billion from a year ago period to $4.2 billion, and we ended Q3 with just 0.2 turns of leverage, down over 0.4 turns from a year ago. This improvement reflects the long-term strategic work we initiated well before the pandemic to drive improvements in profitability and cash flow conversion.  
Given that we've been able to strengthen our financial position meaningfully at the depth of the COVID-19 crisis, we're highly confident we have ample capacity to withstand future challenges while simultaneously deploying discretionary capital. As Bob highlighted at the outset of the call, we strongly believe there will be parts of our business that will benefit from COVID-driven secular trends as well as portions that are likely to be adversely impacted. We plan to focus our discretionary capital deployment on areas where we believe the crisis is likely to accelerate demand. At the moment, we are deploying capital for internal investments and actively evaluating a steadily increasing M&A pipeline as we begin to see strategic opportunities. 
This means we will prioritize internal investments and M&A rather than share repurchases. We want to ensure we are using our liquidity and financial capacity to enhance the revenue and profitability growth trajectory of our business as well as the resiliency of our business over the long run, while also recognizing that the cost actions we've taken this year have impacted our people. As we've said before, once the time is appropriate, if we are unable to identify suitable and properly valued acquisition opportunities, we will then consider share repurchases. 
While the environment remains highly uncertain, we're more confident than ever that our business and our capital structure are positioned to not only weather the challenges presented by COVID, but to build on our industry leadership position and maximize long-term earnings and cash flow. With that, please turn to Slide 13, and I'll turn the call back to Bob."

The third quarter actions were principally around the spans and layers exercise that we did, just looking at the overall shape and structure of our organization and making sure that we were appropriately structured to be as efficient as possible coming out of this. So most related to severance and other separation costs related to that action. We do have some lease terminations and other things that have gone through as we've sought to consolidate our workforce, but the vast majority of it is represented in terms of severance costs."

People need to think about getting project managers on-site and getting work done. All of that is hard to do in this department. Decision makers traveling the C space, it just has inevitably slowed things down. And clients very directly tell us that. They tell us that they're not in a decision-making mode or their decision making has been delayed for those reasons, not knowing how the space is going to get laid out when they move into or when they move out of it. And so again, it's so important as all of us think about what this means for our business, the use of office space and the impact of COVID on the leasing or office occupancy. There's the absence of decision making that's taking place that will come back and happen when we get to the other side of COVID.

But like every other kind of office space out there,  most markets around the world, people aren't going into the office space in the short term. They're working from home because of COVID. So in the short term, Hana has been impacted materially. It performed like we thought it was going to perform this quarter.

So if we look at the space needs, I think near term, there will be less impact on rents in some of those smaller markets and particularly on smaller-sized leases. In those cases and in certain asset classes or property types like industrial as well as multifamily on the capital markets side, I think you'll be able to see more price discovery happen sooner. But certainly, from an office perspective, we're watching those smaller markets and those smaller space transactions really lead the path for that price discovery. And we would expect that as COVID begins to attenuate and we have a vaccine and better therapeutics, we would be able to see more occupancy levels increase in office space, and that should lead to more leasing decisions, as Bob alluded to, and help to drive more capital market transactions in office. So we certainly would expect there to be in terms of capital market activity, transactions happen where you have strong credit rent rolls, long-term tenant leases in place. Those transactions are happening, but we're seeing the pause is really in the largest cities and in value-add asset class space where there's just too much risk for underwriting today."

Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing our financial results, and it is posted on the Investor Relations page website, cbre.com, along with a presentation slide deck that you can use to follow along with our prepared remarks as well as an Excel file that contains additional supplemental materials.
Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows: First, I'll provide an overview of our financial results for the quarter. Next, Bob Sulentic, our President and CEO; and Leah Stearns, our CFO, will discuss our third quarter results in more detail. After their comments, we'll open up the call for your questions.
Before I begin, I'll remind you that this presentation contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding CBRE's future growth prospects, operations, market share, capital deployment, acquisition integration, financial performance, including profitability and margins, the active cost savings initiatives and our 2020 outlook, including the impact of COVID-19 and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical fact.
We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only, and certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements.
For a full discussion of the risks and other factors that may impact these forward-looking statements, please refer to this morning's earnings release and our most recent annual and quarterly reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, respectively.
We have provided reconciliations of adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, fee revenue and certain other non-GAAP financial measures included in our remarks to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, together with explanations of these measures in the appendix of our presentation slide deck.
Now please turn to Slide 4 of our presentation, which highlights our financial results for the third quarter of 2020.
Total revenue and fee revenue fell about 5% and 13%, respectively, driven by a decline in our Advisory Services segment. Lower revenue was partially offset by disciplined cost management and temporary cost reduction as well as the initial benefits of transformation initiatives targeted to improve the ongoing cost structure of the business. This limited the adjusted EBITDA decline to 3%. Overall, adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.73, while GAAP EPS, which includes around $0.13 of transformation initiative costs, totaled $0.55.
Now for insights on the quarter and our longer-term outlook, please turn to Slide 6 as I turn it over to Bob."

The results we reported this morning highlight the progress CBRE has made in building a more resilient business since the last downturn occurred more than a decade ago. We are a remarkably different company from the one that endured the global financial crisis. I'll briefly cite some specific ways the company has evolved and improved.
Facilities Management, which provides steady recurring revenue, has grown exponentially, with the portfolio up by 3.7 billion square feet in 10 years and now totaling 4.2 billion square feet. And we have added a data center management capability that is growing robustly.
Our industrial and multifamily offerings have also grown dramatically and are proving to be very resilient in the current environment. These offerings together cut across leasing, sales and mortgage origination and servicing. They also comprise the majority of our Real Estate development portfolio.
U.S. Project Management has grown fivefold in 10 years, and COVID is further catalyzing demand for this group's specialized services.
Finally, our Investment Management business' core asset portfolio, which has grown more than 300% over 10 years and now comprises nearly 85% of total AUM, has held up quite well this year. The resilient aspects of our business are helping us weather the sharp COVID driven fall in property leasing and sales.
Another key contributor was quickly aligning our expenses with reduced market demand. A significant portion of our compensation structure falls automatically in the current environment, and our global leadership team has rapidly implemented other cost management actions. Many of these actions were contemplated before COVID, following a strategic review in design to enhance scalability and efficiency. This work has been quite effective, cutting where appropriate without compromising our future.
I want to briefly comment on the macro environment before handing the call to Leah.
At the present time, COVID is putting downward pressure on parts of our business and creating larger opportunity in other parts, several of which I highlighted earlier. Inevitably, the magnitude of COVID's impact will diminish considerably once the public health crisis passes. We can expect our sales and leasing businesses, where decision-making is now largely frozen, to be prime beneficiaries.
However, a significant amount of the total rhythm change will be permanent. For instance, our work with occupier clients confirms that companies will continue moving toward a hybrid model that combines working from the office and from home. Occupiers will take space for fewer employees but that space will be less densely populated, more intensely managed and more flexible. There will be a premium on high-quality, well-managed buildings with great infrastructure.
We are continuing to take advantage of the strong secular growth trends that were driven by the last cycle, including occupier outsourcing, industrial and logistics space, institutional quality multifamily assets and workplace experienced services. We expect new secular opportunities to be created in the wake of COVID and are positioning our strategy and leadership focus and allocating our capital to make the most of them as the new cycle unfolds.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Leah, who will take you through the quarter in detail."
4204816,690770788,2124504,"CBRE Group, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2020",2020-10-29,"Earnings Calls","CBRE Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bob. Turning to Slide 8. Our Advisory Services segment fee revenue and adjusted EBITDA fell over 23% and nearly 32%, respectively, reflecting weakness in high-margin sales and leasing activities that Bob alluded to.While our Advisory adjusted EB",1833,"Thanks, Bob. Turning to Slide 8. Our Advisory Services segment fee revenue and adjusted EBITDA fell over 23% and nearly 32%, respectively, reflecting weakness in high-margin sales and leasing activities that Bob alluded to.
While our Advisory adjusted EBITDA margin fell about 180 basis points year-over-year, it improved sequentially approximately 560 basis points to about 15.5%. This sequential improvement was due to the combined impact of short-term cost reductions, including continued furloughs, lower bonus accruals and tight management of travel and entertainment expenses as well as the initial impact of transformation and workforce optimization efforts. Additionally, about 190 basis points of the sequential improvement was due to the cadence of COVID-related items.
Global leasing revenue declined about 31%, as the pandemic continued to negatively impact our major global markets. In the U.S., Continental Europe and the U.K., which together comprised about 81% of global leasing in the period, revenue decreased 36%, 22% and 6%, respectively. The U.K. benefited from some large industrial transactions during the quarter, which helped to offset weak demand for office space. Globally, industrial leasing fueled by the continued shift to e-commerce increased 10% in Q3 and 8% year-to-date.
Advisory sales improved sequentially, falling 34% year-over-year in Q3 versus 48% in Q2. All 3 regions saw sequential improvement, paced by Continental Europe, where advisory sales revenue fell just 7% in Q3 compared with 26% in Q2.
In the U.S., we added 280 basis points to our market share according to RCA, as investors seek out the best device and execution in a challenging market. Given the high level of institutional dry powder and continued low interest rates, investor demand for quality real estate assets with strong rent rolls and creditworthy tenants remain solid despite the pandemic.
Commercial mortgage revenue fell 21% in the quarter. The lending environment improved marginally from the second quarter, but lenders remained quite conservative in their underwriting standards, which weighed on volumes.
Notably, multifamily volumes rebounded sequentially during the quarter, and by September, exceeded the prior year level. Refinancing activity comprised 60% of our year-to-date originations, up from the typical 40% to 50% range.
Our other Advisory Services business lines were less impacted by COVID during the quarter. Valuation revenue fell about 10%, in line with the last quarter, while Advisory Property and Project Management and Loan Servicing each saw fee revenue growth of over 2%.
Lower growth in Loan Servicing was the result of lower loan prepayment fees. Excluding prepayment fees, our servicing revenue would have grown at a low double-digit clip, consistent with previous quarters. The Loan Servicing portfolio grew 13% over the prior year period and 3% sequentially to nearly $253 billion. Forbearance requests also continued to be immaterial for this business.
Turning to Slide 9. Our Global Workplace Solutions business increased fee revenue nearly 6%, as 9% growth in Facilities Management and 13% growth in Project Management offset a steep decline in GWS transaction revenue. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded nearly 480 basis points to nearly 17% despite the loss of high-margin transaction revenue, and this was our second consecutive quarter of record profitability.
This strong improvement in profitability was partially driven by temporary measures, primarily associated with lower discretionary spending and bonus accruals, long-term cost efficiency initiatives and about $12 million in expenses in the prior year period that did not recur.
Structural changes to the cost structure contribute a -- contributed about 1/3 of the margin improvement. We also expect to drive gradual long-term improvements in profitability as our client relationships expand and mature. Long-tenured satisfied clients typically expand their scope of service and engage us to support their project and transaction management needs.
While our margins are improving and our new business pipeline is strong, we continue to feel the effects of pandemic-related delays in securing and onboarding new GWS clients. Several large contract decisions slipped from Q3 to Q4, while others are temporarily on hold. As a result, we continue to expect top line growth to be more muted than we would typically expect in a more normal recessionary environment.
Turning to Slide 10. Let's now look at our Real Estate Investments segment, where we achieved $65 million of adjusted EBITDA, a $51 million increase from the prior year period. Development was the standout performer, with adjusted EBITDA rising to approximately $50 million, reflecting a large number of asset sales and a small contribution from the U.K. multifamily Development business we acquired last October. We are benefiting from positioning our portfolio to meet elevated demand for multifamily, industrial and healthcare assets.
In fact, these 3 property types, plus office buildings that are at least 90% leased, comprise over 80% of our in-process activity. Because of this and our sizable pipeline, we expect our Development business will remain resilient moving forward.
Our Investment Management business also had an impressive quarter. Adjusted EBITDA rose over 12%, and importantly, adjusted EBITDA from recurring sources increased nearly 70%. This reflected continued strong growth in Assets Under Management, which reached a new record at $114.5 billion and more than offset a lower contribution from carried interest revenue and co-investment returns.
Lastly, Hana's adjusted EBITDA loss of nearly $10 million was slightly higher than in the last quarter. Hana's results continue to be impacted by lower-than-anticipated occupancy as a result of the pandemic as well as costs associated with expanding our enterprise focused, flexible space solutions.
Turning to Slide 11. Given COVID-19's uncertain trajectory and adverse economic impact, we will again refrain from providing explicit EPS guidance, but we'll provide an update on our expectations for the full year and fourth quarter.
In Advisory, we are taking a conservative view of transaction activity in Q4. Transaction revenue has performed better than expected during this crisis, which is partially driven by the transaction size and geographic diversification embedded in our business.
In the U.S., deals less than $250,000, which comprise over half of total transaction revenue declined about 26% year-to-date versus 40% decrease from transactions over $2 million. We anticipate a similar benefit of this diversification in our Q4 results, but also expect the transaction business to recover more gradually. We expect sales and leasing revenue together to be down approximately 30% to 40% in Q4, in line with the trends we saw in the second and third quarters, with the Americas slightly lagging other parts of the world.
For the rest of the Advisory business combined, we foresee a mid-single-digit revenue decline in the fourth quarter. This reflects the expectation that Q4 will be our highest revenue-generating quarter as it usually is.
Given this uptick in revenue and our continued focus on cost management, we expect Advisory adjusted EBITDA fee margin to continue expanding by around 2% compared with Q3.
Moving to GWS. We now believe growth in fee revenue will rise in the mid-single-digit range for the year, with growth in contractual Facilities Management and Project Management revenue offsetting continued weakness in GWS transaction. This marginally lower-than-normal growth expectation reflects our view that the pandemic related delays I mentioned earlier will improve more slowly than we previously expected.
At the same time, we expect double-digit full year adjusted EBITDA growth, reflecting the benefit of stronger-than-expected Q3 performance and the continuation of our cost management efforts into Q4. We expect margin expansion will be slower sequentially as the benefit of temporary cost actions dissipate.
Looking at REI, our Global Investment Management and Development business lines are well positioned for the current environment, and we foresee more resilient performance than during the last downturn. In Investment Management, we anticipate adjusted EBITDA will grow in the high teens range from the $91 million achieved last year.
We now expect growth in recurring EBITDA stemming from our growing AUM to be complemented by higher expectations for incentive fees and carried interest than we previously anticipated. We now project U.S. Development adjusted EBITDA to exceed the more than $100 million generated in 2019. Demand for quality assets has been stronger than we previously anticipated and we now expect to complete more asset sales before year end.
We again expect sequential growth in adjusted EBITDA from U.K. multifamily Development in Q4. The pace of improvement since the peak of the pandemic has exceeded our expectations, and we now expect a small but positive EBITDA contribution from U.K. multifamily Development for the full year. This is an improvement from the breakeven performance we expected previously.
And finally, our expectations for Hana remain consistent with our previous outlook, with an adjusted EBITDA loss of around $35 million to $40 million for 2020, which is marginally higher than the loss incurred in 2019.
Turning to Slide 12. We've continued to fortify our financial position throughout the COVID-19 crisis.   On a run rate basis, we have lowered our expense structure by nearly $200 million. We expect to realize about $120 million of this in 2020 and approximately $80 million in 2021. We primarily achieved these reductions by making structural changes in the design of our workforce, while also focusing on rightsizing our cost base and teams to meet future demand.
In addition, our liquidity has increased by almost $1 billion from a year ago period to $4.2 billion, and we ended Q3 with just 0.2 turns of leverage, down over 0.4 turns from a year ago. This improvement reflects the long-term strategic work we initiated well before the pandemic to drive improvements in profitability and cash flow conversion.
Given that we've been able to strengthen our financial position meaningfully at the depth of the COVID-19 crisis, we're highly confident we have ample capacity to withstand future challenges while simultaneously deploying discretionary capital.
As Bob highlighted at the outset of the call, we strongly believe there will be parts of our business that will benefit from COVID-driven secular trends as well as portions that are likely to be adversely impacted. We plan to focus our discretionary capital deployment on areas where we believe the crisis is likely to accelerate demand.
At the moment, we are deploying capital for internal investments and actively evaluating a steadily increasing M&A pipeline as we begin to see strategic opportunities.
This means we will prioritize internal investments and M&A rather than share repurchases. We want to ensure we are using our liquidity and financial capacity to enhance the revenue and profitability growth trajectory of our business as well as the resiliency of our business over the long run, while also recognizing that the cost actions we've taken this year have impacted our people.
As we've said before, once the time is appropriate, if we are unable to identify suitable and properly valued acquisition opportunities, we will then consider share repurchases.
While the environment remains highly uncertain, we're more confident than ever that our business and our capital structure are positioned to not only weather the challenges presented by COVID, but to build on our industry leadership position and maximize long-term earnings and cash flow growth.
With that, please turn to Slide 13, and I'll turn the call back to Bob."

We think the offices that will be used less densely, we think they'll be more intensively managed. We think buildings with great infrastructure will be favored.

People need to think about getting project managers on-site and getting work done.
All of that is hard to do in this environment. Decision makers traveling the see space, it just has inevitably slowed things down. And clients very directly tell us that. They tell us that they're not in a decision-making mode or their decision making has been delayed for those reasons, not knowing how the space is going to get laid out when they move into it or when they move out of it.
And so again, there's -- it's so important as all of us think about what this means for our business, the use of office space and the impact of COVID on leasing or office occupancy. There's the absence of decision making that's taking place that will come back and happen when we get to the other side of COVID.

We believe that there's evidence that Flex Space like Hana will become more necessary than it is today. But like every other kind of office space out there, most markets around the world, people aren't going into the office space in the short term. They're working from home because of COVID.
So in the short term, Hana has been impacted materially. It performed like we thought it was going to perform this quarter. But in the short term, it's been impacted materially like every other kind of office space has been in the long term.

So if we look at the space needs, I think near term, there will be less impact on rents in some of those smaller markets and particularly on smaller-sized leases. In those cases and in certain asset classes or property types like industrial as well as multifamily on the capital markets side, I think you'll be able to see more price discovery happen sooner.
But certainly, from an office perspective, we're watching those smaller markets and those smaller space transactions really lead the path for that price discovery. And we would expect that as COVID begins to attenuate and we have a vaccine and better therapeutics, we would be able to see more occupancy levels increase in office space, and that should lead to more leasing decisions, as Bob alluded to, and help to drive more capital market transactions in office.
So we certainly would expect there to be in terms of capital market activity, transactions happen where you have strong credit rent rolls, long-term tenant leases in place.

So one phenomenon that I think we will see happen in the fourth quarter is the 1031 exchange activity around transactions from a capital markets perspective. That tends to be when we see quite a bit of multifamily transactions come to market as -- in that smaller to mid-tier range. So that is something that we would expect to help buoy the market, particularly in the U.S.
But we do have transactions happening within the sales part of our business. There are well diversified, strong credit tenant, long duration rentals, underlying certain assets as well as certain asset class -- certain office assets as well as certain asset classes like industrial and multifamily that are commanding a tighter bid-ask spread, and that's resulting in transactions happening in the market.
So we certainly think there are transactions out there to be done, and that was evidenced in the third quarter around our leasing and sales results. But it's certainly a more muted market just because there is such a significant pause going on around decisions that are being made, particularly in office."

Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing our financial results, and it is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website, cbre.com, along with a presentation slide deck that you can use to follow along with our prepared remarks as well as an Excel file that contains additional supplemental materials.
Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows: First, I'll provide an overview of our financial results for the quarter. Next, Bob Sulentic, our President and CEO; and Leah Stearns, our CFO, will discuss our third quarter results in more detail. After their comments, we'll open up the call for your questions.
Before I begin, I'll remind you that this presentation contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding CBRE's future growth prospects, operations, market share, capital deployment, acquisition integration, financial performance, including profitability and margins, the effect of cost savings initiatives and our 2020 outlook, including the impact of COVID-19 and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical fact.
We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only, and certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. For a full discussion of the risks and other factors that may impact these forward-looking statements, please refer to this morning's earnings release and our most recent annual and quarterly reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, respectively.
We have provided reconciliations of adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, fee revenue and certain other non-GAAP financial measures included in our remarks to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, together with explanations of these measures in the appendix of our presentation slide deck.
Now please turn to Slide 4 of our presentation, which highlights our financial results for the third quarter of 2020.
Total revenue and fee revenue fell about 5% and 13%, respectively, driven by a decline in our Advisory Services segment. Lower revenue was partially offset by disciplined cost management and temporary cost reduction as well as the initial benefits of transformation initiatives targeted to improve the ongoing cost structure of the business. This limited the adjusted EBITDA decline to 3%. Overall, adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.73, while GAAP EPS, which includes around $0.13 of transformation initiative costs, totaled $0.55.
Now for insights on the quarter and our longer-term outlook, please turn to Slide 6 as I turn the call over to Bob."

The results we reported this morning highlight the progress CBRE has made in building a more resilient business since the last downturn occurred more than a decade ago. We are a remarkably different company from the one that endured the global financial crisis. I'll briefly cite some specific ways the company has evolved and improved.
Facilities Management, which provides steady recurring revenue, has grown exponentially, with the portfolio up by 3.7 billion square feet in 10 years and now totaling 4.2 billion square feet. And we have added a data center management capability that is growing robustly.
Our industrial and multifamily offerings have also grown dramatically and are proving to be very resilient in the current environment. These offerings together cut across leasing, sales and mortgage origination and servicing. They also comprise the majority of our Real Estate development portfolio.
U.S. Project Management has grown fivefold in 10 years, and COVID is further catalyzing demand for this group's specialized services.
Finally, our Investment Management business' core asset portfolio, which has grown more than 300% over 10 years and now comprises nearly 85% of total AUM, has held up quite well this year. The resilient aspects of our business are helping us weather the sharp COVID-driven fall in property leasing and sales.
Another key contributor was quickly aligning our expenses with reduced market demand. A significant portion of our compensation structure falls automatically in the current environment, and our global leadership team has rapidly implemented other cost management actions. Many of these actions were contemplated before COVID following a strategic review designed to enhance scalability and efficiency. This work has been quite effective, cutting where appropriate without compromising our future.
I want to briefly comment on the macro environment before handing the call to Leah.
At the present time, COVID is putting downward pressure on parts of our business and creating larger opportunities in other parts, several of which I highlighted earlier. Inevitably, the magnitude of COVID's impact will diminish considerably once the public health crisis passes. We can expect our sales and leasing businesses, where decision-making is now largely frozen, to be prime beneficiaries.
However, a significant amount of the COVID-driven change will be permanent. For instance, our work with occupier clients confirms that companies will continue moving toward a hybrid model that combines working from the office and from home. Occupiers will take space for fewer employees but that space will be less densely populated, more intensely managed and more flexible. There will be a premium on high-quality, well-managed buildings with great infrastructure.
We are continuing to take advantage of the strong secular growth trends that were driven by the last cycle, including occupier outsourcing, industrial and logistics space, institutional quality multifamily assets and workplace experience services. We expect new secular opportunities to be created in the wake of COVID and are positioning our strategy and leadership focus and allocating our capital to make the most of them as the new cycle unfolds.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Leah, who will take you through the quarter in detail."

Our Advisory Services segment fee revenue and adjusted EBITDA fell over 23% and nearly 32%, respectively, reflecting weakness in high-margin sales and leasing activities that Bob alluded to.While our advisory adjusted EB",1832,"Thanks, Bob. Turning to Slide 8. Our Advisory Services segment fee revenue and adjusted EBITDA fell over 23% and nearly 32%, respectively, reflecting weakness in high-margin sales and leasing activities that Bob alluded to.
While our advisory adjusted EBITDA margin fell about 180 basis points year-over-year, it improved sequentially approximately 560 basis points to about 15.5%. This sequential improvement was due to the combined impact of short-term cost reductions, including continued furloughs, lower bonus accruals and tight management of travel and entertainment expenses as well as the initial impacts of transformation and workforce optimization efforts. Additionally, about 190 basis points of the sequential improvement was due to the cadence of COVID-related items.
Global leasing revenue declined about 31%, as the pandemic continued to negatively impact our major global markets. In the U.S., Continental Europe and the U.K., which together comprised about 81% of global leasing in the period, revenue decreased 36%, 22% and 6%, respectively. The U.K. benefited from some large industrial transactions during the quarter, which helped to offset weak demand for office space. Globally, industrial leasing fueled by the continued shift to e-commerce increased 10% in Q3 and 8% year-to-date.
Advisory sales improved sequentially, falling 34% year-over-year in Q3 versus 48% in Q2. All 3 regions saw sequential improvement, paced by Continental Europe, where advisory sales revenue fell just 7% in Q3 compared with 26% in Q2.
In the U.S., we added 280 basis points to our market share according to RCA, as investors seek out the best device and execution in a challenging market. Given the high level of institutional dry powder and continued low interest rates, investor demand for quality real estate assets with strong rent rolls and creditworthy tenants remain solid despite the pandemic.
Commercial mortgage revenue fell 21% in the quarter. The lending environment improved marginally from the second quarter, but lenders remained quite conservative in their underwriting standards, which weighed on volumes.
Notably, multifamily volumes rebounded sequentially during the quarter, and by September, exceeded the prior year level. Refinancing activity comprised 60% of our year-to-date originations, up from the typical 40% to 50% range.
Our other Advisory Services business lines were less impacted by COVID during the quarter. Valuation revenue fell about 10%, in line with the last quarter, while Advisory Property and Project Management and loan servicing each saw fee revenue growth of over 2%.
Lower growth in Loan Servicing was the result of lower loan prepayment fees. Excluding prepayment fees, our servicing revenue would have grown at a low double-digit clip, consistent with previous quarters. The loan servicing portfolio grew 13% over the prior year period and 3% sequentially to nearly $253 billion. Forbearance requests also continued to be immaterial for this business.
Turning to Slide 9. Our Global Workplace Solutions business increased fee revenue nearly 6%, as 9% growth in Facilities Management and 13% growth in Project Management offset a steep decline in GWS transaction revenue. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded nearly 480 basis points to nearly 17% despite the loss of high-margin transaction revenue, and this was our second consecutive quarter of record profitability.
This strong improvement in profitability was partially driven by temporary measures primarily associated with lower discretionary spending and bonus accruals, long-term cost efficiency initiatives and about $12 million in expenses in the prior year period that did not recur.
Structural changes to the cost structure contribute a -- contributed about 1/3 of the margin improvement. We also expect to drive gradual long-term improvements in profitability as our client relationships expand and mature. Long-tenured satisfied clients typically expand their scope of service and engage us to support their project and transaction management needs.
While our margins are improving and our new business pipeline is strong, we continue to feel the effects of pandemic-related delays in securing and onboarding new GWS clients. Several large contract decisions slipped from Q3 to Q4, while others are temporarily on hold. As a result, we continue to expect top line growth to be more muted than we would typically expect in a more normal recessionary environment.
Turning to Slide 10. Let's now look at our Real Estate Investments segment, where we achieved $65 million of adjusted EBITDA, a $51 million increase from the prior year period. Development was the standout performer, with adjusted EBITDA rising to approximately $50 million, reflecting a large number of asset sales and a small contribution from the U.K. multifamily development business we acquired last October. We are benefiting from positioning our portfolio to meet elevated demand for multifamily, industrial and health care assets.
In fact, these 3 property types, plus office buildings that are at least 90% leased, comprise over 80% of our in-process activity. Because of this and our sizable pipeline, we expect our development business will remain resilient moving forward.
Our investment management business also had an impressive quarter. Adjusted EBITDA rose over 12%, and importantly, adjusted EBITDA from recurring sources increased nearly 70%. This reflected continued strong growth in assets under management, which reached a new record at $114.5 billion and more than offset a lower contribution from carried interest revenue and co-investment returns.
Lastly, Hana's adjusted EBITDA loss of nearly $10 million was slightly higher than in the last quarter. Hana's results continue to be impacted by lower-than-anticipated occupancy as a result of the pandemic as well as costs associated with expanding our enterprise-focused, flexible space solutions.
Turning to Slide 11. Given COVID-19's uncertain trajectory and adverse economic impact, we will again refrain from providing explicit EPS guidance, but we'll provide an update on our expectations for the full year and fourth quarter.
In advisory, we are taking a conservative view of transaction activity in Q4. Transaction revenue has performed better than expected during this crisis, which is partially driven by the transaction size and geographic diversification embedded in our business.
In the U.S., deals less than $250,000, which comprise over half of total transaction revenue declined about 26% year-to-date versus 40% decrease from transactions over $2 million. We anticipate a similar benefit of this diversification in our Q4 results but also expect the transaction business to recover more gradually. We expect sales and leasing revenue together to be down approximately 30% to 40% in Q4, in line with the trends we saw in the second and third quarters, with the Americas slightly lagging other parts of the world.
For the rest of the advisory business combined, we foresee a mid-single-digit revenue decline in the fourth quarter. This reflects the expectation that Q4 will be our highest revenue-generating quarter as it usually is. Given this uptick in revenue and our continued focus on cost management, we expect advisory adjusted EBITDA fee margin to continue expanding by around 2% compared with Q3.
Moving to GWS. We now believe growth in fee revenue will rise in the mid-single-digit range for the year, with growth in contractual Facilities Management and Project Management revenue offsetting continued weakness in GWS transaction. This marginally lower-than-normal growth expectation reflects our view that the pandemic-related delays I mentioned earlier will improve more slowly than we previously expected.
At the same time, we expect double-digit full year adjusted EBITDA growth, reflecting the benefit of stronger-than-expected Q3 performance and the continuation of our cost management efforts into Q4. We expect margin expansion will be slower sequentially as the benefit of temporary cost actions dissipate.
Looking at REI, our Global Investment Management and development business lines are well positioned for the current environment, and we foresee more resilient performance than during the last downturn. In Investment Management, we anticipate adjusted EBITDA will grow in the high teens range from the $91 million achieved last year.
We now expect growth in recurring EBITDA stemming from our growing AUM to be complemented by higher expectations for incentive fees and carried interest than we previously anticipated. We now project U.S. development adjusted EBITDA to exceed the more than $100 million generated in 2019. Demand for quality assets has been stronger than we previously anticipated, and we now expect to complete more asset sales before year end.
We again expect sequential growth in adjusted EBITDA from U.K. multifamily development in Q4. The pace of improvement since the peak of the pandemic has exceeded our expectations, and we now expect a small but positive EBITDA contribution from U.K. multifamily development for the full year. This is an improvement from the breakeven performance we expected previously.
And finally, our expectations for Hana remain consistent with our previous outlook, with an adjusted EBITDA loss of around $35 million to $40 million for 2020, which is marginally higher than the loss incurred in 2019.
Turning to Slide 12. We've continued to fortify our financial position throughout the COVID-19 crisis. On a run rate basis, we have lowered our expense structure by nearly $200 million. We expect to realize about $120 million of this in 2020 and approximately $80 million in 2021. We primarily achieved these reductions by making structural changes in the design of our workforce while also focusing on rightsizing our cost base and teams to meet future demand.
In addition, our liquidity has increased by almost $1 billion from a year ago period to $4.2 billion, and we ended Q3 with just 0.2 turns of leverage, down over 0.4 turns from a year ago. This improvement reflects the long-term strategic work we initiated well before the pandemic to drive improvements in profitability and cash flow conversion.
Given that we've been able to strengthen our financial position meaningfully at the depth of the COVID-19 crisis, we're highly confident we have ample capacity to withstand future challenges while simultaneously deploying discretionary capital.
As Bob highlighted at the outset of the call, we strongly believe there will be parts of our business that will benefit from COVID-driven secular trends as well as portions that are likely to be adversely impacted. We plan to focus our discretionary capital deployment on areas where we believe the crisis is likely to accelerate demand.
At the moment, we are deploying capital for internal investments and actively evaluating a steadily increasing M&A pipeline as we begin to see strategic opportunities. This means we will prioritize internal investments and M&A rather than share repurchases. We want to ensure we are using our liquidity and financial capacity to enhance the revenue and profitability growth trajectory of our business as well as the resiliency of our business over the long run while also recognizing that the cost actions we've taken this year have impacted our people. As we've said before, once the time is appropriate, if we are unable to identify suitable and properly valued acquisition opportunities, we will then consider share repurchases.
While the environment remains highly uncertain, we're more confident than ever that our business and our capital structure are positioned to not only weather the challenges presented by COVID but to build on our industry leadership position and maximize long-term earnings and cash flow growth.
With that, please turn to Slide 13, and I'll turn the call back to Bob."

One, we do think there will be some real change in the way office space is used going forward. We think there will be less people in the office. We think the offices will be used less densely. We think they'll be more intensively managed. We think buildings with great infrastructure will be favored.

People need to think about getting project managers on-site and getting work done.
All of that is hard to do in this environment. Decision makers traveling the see space, it just has inevitably slowed things down. And clients very directly tell us that. They tell us that they're not in a decision-making mode or their decision-making has been delayed for those reasons, not knowing how the space is going to get laid out when they move into it or when they move out of it.
And so again, there's -- it's so important as all of us think about what this means for our business, the use of office space and the impact of COVID on leasing or office occupancy. There's the absence of decision making that's taking place that will come back and happen when we get to the other side of COVID.

We believe that there's evidence that flex space like Hana will become more necessary than it is today. But like every other kind of office space out there, most markets around the world, people aren't going into the office space in the short term. They're working from home because of COVID.
So in the short term, Hana has been impacted materially. It performed like we thought it was going to perform this quarter.

So if we look at the space needs, I think near term, there will be less impact on rents in some of those smaller markets and particularly on smaller-sized leases. In those cases and in certain asset classes or property types like industrial as well as multifamily on the capital markets side, I think you'll be able to see more price discovery happen sooner.
But certainly, from an office perspective, we're watching those smaller markets and those smaller space transactions really lead the path for that price discovery. And we would expect that as COVID begins to attenuate and we have a vaccine and better therapeutics, we would be able to see more occupancy levels increase in office space, and that should lead to more leasing decisions, as Bob alluded to, and help to drive more capital market transactions in office.
So we certainly would expect there to be, in terms of capital market activity, transactions happen where you have strong credit rent rolls, long-term tenant leases in place.

So one phenomenon that I think we will see happen in the fourth quarter is the 1031 exchange activity around transactions from a capital markets perspective. That tends to be when we see quite a bit of multifamily transactions come to market as -- in that smaller to mid-tier range. So that is something that we would expect to help buoy the market, particularly in the U.S.
But we do have transactions happening within the sales part of our business. There are well-diversified, strong credit tenant, long duration rent rolls, underlying certain assets as well as certain asset class -- certain office assets as well as certain asset classes like industrial and multifamily that are commanding a tighter bid-ask spread, and that's resulting in transactions happening in the market.
So we certainly think there are transactions out there to be done, and that was evidenced in the third quarter around our leasing and sales results. But it's certainly a more muted market just because there is such a significant pause going on around decisions that are being made, particularly in office."
