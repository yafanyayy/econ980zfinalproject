Speakers on today's call are Vincent Pilette, NortonLifelock's CEO; Samir Kapuria, President; and Matt Brown, Interim CFO. The call will be available for replay via webcast on our website. 
As a reminder, in connection with the sale of certain assets of our Enterprise Security business to Broadcom on November 4, 2019, we changed our corporate name from Symantec to NortonLifeLock. The results of our enterprise trade business were classified as discontinued operations in our condensed consolidated statements of operations, and thus, excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. 
Starting in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we operate in 1 reportable segment. Revenues and associated cost of our ID Analytics solutions, which were formally included in the Enterprise Security segment, are now included in our remaining reportable segment. On January 31, 2020, we completed the sale of our ID Analytics solutions. 
I'd like to remind everyone that all references to financial metrics are non-GAAP, unless otherwise stated. Please refer to the supplemental materials posted on the Investor Relations website for further definitions of our non-GAAP metrics. 
Please note, non-GAAP financial measures referenced during this call are reconciled to their comparable GAAP financial measures in the press release and supplemental materials posted on our website. We believe our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating performance for reasons discussed below. Our management team uses these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our operating results as well as planning and forecasting future periods. We believe our non-GAAP financial risk measures also facilitate comparisons of our performance to prior periods and that investors benefit from understanding our non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental and should not be considered as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. 
Today's call contains forward-looking statements based on conditions we currently see. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, and speak only as of the current date, and as such, involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. In particular, our statements regarding our sale of our Enterprise Security assets to Broadcom and the anticipated benefits from such sales and cost reductions associated with this transaction are subject to a variety of risks. Please refer to the cautionary statement in our press release for more information. 
You will also find a detailed discussion about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC, and in particular, in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 29, 2019, and recently filed quarterly report on Form 10-Q.

I'm very pleased to report that we delivered better-than-expected results in Q3, the first quarter of NortonLifelock as a stand-alone company. We delivered revenue above the high end of the range, supported by bookings growth of 4%. EPS was $0.25, up $0.09 from a year ago and well above our guidance, driven by strong execution and lower stranded costs. We have accelerated our transition to become the pure-play leader in consumer cyber safety, and we are driving towards our annual target of $1.50 EPS.  We have delivered on our commitment of returning more than 100% and of the net proceeds from the sales of our enterprise business to Broadcom by paying a $12 per share special dividend on January 31 and starting a $1.6 billion share repurchase program in December. 
Before I go into more detail, I would like to thank all of our employees. Achieving these results in a quarter in which we completed the sales of our enterprise business is another testament to the operational discipline and the dedication of our team. These encouraging results speak for themselves, but let me give you a few more details. 
Since the close of the sale of our enterprise business on November 4, we have been removing stranded costs at an accelerated pace. Previously, our estimated cumulative stranded costs post close were $1.2 billion, with cash cost of $900 million to remove these stranded activities. We have accelerated our transition to be done in Q2 fiscal year '21, 3 months ahead of plan. Cumulative stranded costs post close are now tracking to less than $1 billion in total, of which $750 million are in cash. We are making good strides towards exiting or rightsizing the cost base to achieve target operating margin of 50% for the total company by the end of the transition period. 
In addition, we made significant progress towards our goal to monetize and dispose of underutilized assets to more than offset the stranded cash costs. We recently closed the sales of our ID Analytics business for $375 million in cash. In addition, we received the first round of bid for the sales of our soon-to-be vacated properties, including our Mountain View campus. We now project the cash proceeds from the underutilized assets to be approximately $1.5 billion, significantly higher than the $1.1 billion we previously estimated on our last earnings call. When you combine the $10.7 billion sales of the enterprise business with the $1.5 billion in monetization of assets, less than $750 million in stranded costs, we project to generate roughly $11.5 billion in gross proceeds directly or indirectly related to the sales of our enterprise assets. Wow. I know it would be very proud. Even after taxes, which are now lower than initially expected and the return of a substantial amount of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and stock buybacks, we are left with meaningful capacity to invest and sustainably grow our consumer business. 
When I started as CEO, I talked about some key priorities for us in the short term. First, establish credibility by consistently delivering on what we say. Secondly, accelerate the transition to quickly get to a long-term business model with 50% profitability for the company. And lastly and more importantly, free up investment capacity to return the company to sustainable growth, delivering on the full potential of a stand-alone consumer business. I also said that it would take time to reach our full potential. I think it goes without saying that we have delivered on our commitments in terms of executing on the sales of the enterprise business, accelerating the elimination of stranded costs and maximizing the value of our underutilized assets. 
As for the ongoing Consumer Cyber Safety business, this quarter, we delivered bookings growth of 4% year-over-year and increased net subscribers by 66,000 sequentially while maintaining our operating margin over 50%, when you exclude the impact of stranded costs. It is the first positive quarter of net customer adds in a long time. But to be fair, 1 quarter does not make a trend. While customer count is stabilizing, our focused execution and reprioritized investments have us on the right path to deliver long-term sustainable growth. Our strategy is working. 
I will pass now the call over to my business partner, Samir, for more details on our product initiatives and selling motions."

Our momentum in launching Norton 360 memberships worldwide continues. In the third quarter, we expanded our membership offerings in EMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin America, including Ireland, South Africa, Australia and Mexico. We remain focused on our strategy to deliver increasing value to NortonLifeLock members by offering a broad set of cyber safety solutions. 
In the third quarter, average revenue per user, or ARPU, increased to $8.99 per month, up 1.2% sequentially and up 2.7% year-over-year. More importantly, we saw continued stabilization of our direct customer count. We grew customer count sequentially this quarter for the first time in more than 2 years. We added new customers at the top of the funnel, while maintaining our high retention rates. Our cyber safety message is resonating with customers. We believe the growth in customers directly results from our strategy to invest and drive consumer awareness of the value of our offering. 
In addition to our direct customers, we also protect millions of customers through indirect relationships we've established through partnerships around the world, including telcos, employee benefits, retailers and e-tailers. One example is a recent partnership agreement we signed with a large telecom service provider who will be bundling our new membership product, Powered by LifeLock. This will be the first time we'll be launching the full version of LifeLock, which includes identity restoration outside the United States. We're starting to see more and more of these organizations understand how much value cyber safety can bring both their businesses and their customers. These relationships contribute to our foundation for growth in the future. 
We are continuing to invest in our product capabilities to address cyber threats that are evolving at a fast pace. Let me highlight 2 examples of identity offerings that we launched in the quarter. In December, we launched Home Title Alert. This additional feature is available to our U.S. members who subscribe to the highest level of identity protection. For many Americans, their home is their most valuable asset, and we're helping protect it from fraud. We're now monitoring for changes to their home title and tax records at the county recorders office. With this service, members are alerted when potential scammers use victim's identities to take out fraudulent loans or place leans on a victim's home for financial benefit. This is one of many examples of our continued focus on innovation to deliver additional protection to our members across security, privacy, identity and home. We also expanded our identity theft offering outside the U.S. with the launch of our dark web monitoring service powered by LifeLock in Japan. The dark web is an indexed part of the Internet. And it is a hotbed of criminal activity where criminals can buy and sell stolen information. When we detect our members' information on the dark web, we alert our members so they can take action. This product has seen good adoption in that market, and we're working hard to deliver it to consumers around the globe. Those are just 2 examples of leading innovation, but we have a robust R&D pipeline of products that we believe will help keep our customers cybersafe. 
Let me turn the call over to Matt to discuss Q3 actual results in more detail."

Let me review our Q3 results in a bit more detail, focusing on non-GAAP results. Q3 revenue was $618 million, up 1% year-over-year in constant currency and above our guidance range of $602 million to $612 million. ID Analytics revenue was i",600,"Thanks, Samir. Let me review our Q3 results in a bit more detail, focusing on non-GAAP results. Q3 revenue was $618 million, up 1% year-over-year in constant currency and above our guidance range of $602 million to $612 million. ID Analytics revenue was included in both actuals and our guidance and landed at $15 million for the quarter. Diluted EPS was $0.25, exceeding our guidance range, driven primarily by better-than-expected stranded costs in our P&L. Operating margin was 36.2% compared to 28.6% in Q3 '19. We drove strong margin performance by reducing stranded costs. In just 1 quarter, we reduced our headcount by 52% and significantly reduced our real estate footprint, making substantial progress on rightsizing our company for the go-forward business. While progress was made, Q3 continuing operations include stranded operating expenses of approximately $85 million. 
As we stated on our prior quarter earnings call, during this transition period, our reporting cost structure will be complex and burdened with stranded costs. The timing of the transition, the net costs associated with our transition service agreements, asset write-offs and the location of these costs in the P&L will impact operating margin and/or EPS for the next 3 quarters. For example, depending on the underlying nature of these costs, they may be recorded in operating expenses of continuing operations or transition services expenses, which are included below the line in other income and expense, or discontinued operations or restructuring, which are excluded from our non-GAAP results altogether. Because of this complexity, we are providing detail on the approximate amount and location of stranded costs incurred in the quarter in our earnings deck posted on our Investor Relations website which I invite everyone to review. 
In Q3, our cash flow from operations was $399 million, with free cash flow of $389 million. These amounts include cash flow from continuing and discontinued operations, which also includes stranded costs and benefited from collections of enterprise-related receivables in the quarter. By the way, the estimated tax liability on the enterprise sale is now estimated at $2.2 billion versus the $2.5 billion estimated at the time of the deal. The majority of this tax liability is left to be paid in Q4 '20, and therefore, will be reflected in that quarter's cash flow from operations. 
We ended the third quarter with cash and short-term investments of $12.8 billion, and our total debt level was unchanged at $4.5 billion. Our strong cash flow has enabled us to return a significant amount of cash to our shareholders. In Q3, under our $1.6 billion share buyback plan, we repurchased 14.1 million shares for $364 million in cash. In addition, in Q3, we paid our recently increased regular quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share. And lastly, we recently completed the previously announced special dividend of $12 per share.  We will continue to return cash to our shareholders while maintaining our ability to invest in growth opportunities. We now expect our estimated cash balance at the end of the transition to be over $2.5 billion as a result of lower expected cash transition costs, lower expected cash taxes on the enterprise sale, lower cash paid on the special dividend due to timing of our share buyback and higher expected cash receipts from the sale of underutilized assets. 
All told, this has significantly increased our cash expectations and allows greater flexibility to create more value to invest and sustainably grow the business as well as gives us the option to deploy additional capital as we opportunistically manage dilution. 
Let me now turn the call back to Vincent to provide our Q4 outlook."

Let me now provide our Q4 outlook and also discuss our long-term growth strategy for NortonLifeLock. In the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $595 million to $605 million, excluding ID Analytics which closed in January. We will continue to drive the business for growth, which is expected to continue to yield low single-digit bookings growth in Q4, ultimately delivering revenue growth in later quarters. 
We expect Q4 non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.15 to $0.20 per share based on assumptions of flat share count with the business operating at approximately -- sorry, 50% profit margin when excluding the stranded costs. 
As we exit our transition period upon elimination of the stranded costs and with a full benefit from share buybacks, we expect the operating margin to reach 50% and annualized EPS to come to approximately $1.50. 
Fiscal year 2020. So as we turn to previous marketing investment levels, primarily targeted at direct acquisition programs in the U.S. and worldwide. We will continue to invest in our distribution and product road map. While these initiatives take time to generate revenue, we are encouraged to see 2 consecutive quarters of 4% billings growth year-over-year. 
We believe NortonLifeLock is well positioned to continue our market leadership by offering a simple, reliable path to cyber safety. Our mission to protect our customers' digital and connected lives is reflected in our commitment to make the world safer. 
Our transformation is well underway. We have become much more nimble and customer-focused, and we are on track to achieve our near-term goals to remove stranded costs and lay the foundation for growth. For our mid- to long-term goals, we're excited by the opportunity to deliver innovative solutions to protect consumers and produce sustained revenue and earnings growth with strong cash flow generation for our shareholders. 
As I told all of our employees, it will not be a linear path. There will be challenges along the way, but the opportunity is tremendous, and our focus is on protecting and delighting consumers with innovative solutions. And with that, Matt, Samir and I are now happy to take your questions."

I think we share the data on that progression on an annual basis, and we are very happy with the results we've had over this year. So next quarter, we'll be sharing the percentage of existing customers that have moved into that program. But in addition to that, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we have also rolled out new identity protection capabilities in international markets like the dark web monitoring in Japan and the soon-to-be-released identity threat restoration service in another country. So what we're seeing is the combination of capabilities and value we're providing are resonating with our customers, and that's resulting in both the ARPU as well as retention you've seen in our reporting today."

The second one was to really move from mainly being U.S.-centric to being more international. We've been growing in Europe. We've been growing in Asia Pacific. And that, of course, is to support a new product launch. So those are important factors. And then we've aligned our marketing investment to the rollout of Norton 360 membership structure, making our customers aware of the incremental value we provide them through the membership. When you raise the noise level, if you want, in the market or the awareness level in the market, you have a long way to go in terms of improving the productivity of those marketing investments. So I do believe that while we've raised it here in fiscal year '20, we have opportunity to gain productivity from those investments going into fiscal year  '21."

Customer count growth are 2 very good leading indicators of the future state of the business and what it will mean for the revenue line, which is more of an accounting line.

And what you see today in the -- on the revenue line is the impact of those metrics 12 months ago. So obviously, as I mentioned, booking growth and customer count growth are 2 operational metrics that we are really driving for. And achieving these results, I would say, are early sign of success. I would not call them yet sustainable growth, but they're definitely encouraging signs. We are on the right path to deliver on our strategy. 
In terms of the cash flow, you mentioned the cost on the continued operations P&L, you also have discontinued operations and restructuring, all of which impact cash flow. And this quarter, in Q3, we also had the collection of the accounts receivable from the enterprise segment since the deal from Broadcom did not take the AR that we're pretty close.

As a reminder, in connection with the sale of certain assets of our Enterprise Security business to Broadcom on November 4, 2019, we changed our corporate name to -- from Symantec to NortonLifeLock. The results of our Enterprise Security business were classified as discontinued operations in our condensed consolidated statements of operations and, thus, excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented.
Starting in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we operate in one reportable segment. Revenues and associated cost of our ID Analytics solutions, which were formally included in the Enterprise Security segment, are now included in our remaining reportable segment. On January 31, 2020, we completed the sale of our ID Analytics solutions.
I'd like to remind everyone that all references to financial metrics are non-GAAP unless otherwise stated. Please refer to the supplemental materials posted on the Investor Relations website for further definitions of our non-GAAP metrics.
Please note, non-GAAP financial measures referenced during this call are reconciled to their comparable GAAP financial measures in the press release and supplemental materials posted on our website. We believe our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating performance for reasons discussed below. Our management team uses these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our operating results as well as planning and forecasting future periods. We believe our non-GAAP financial risk measures also facilitate comparisons of our performance to prior periods and that investors benefit from understanding our non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental and should not be considered as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP.

Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the current date and as such, involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. In particular, our statements regarding our sale of our Enterprise Security assets to Broadcom and the anticipated benefits from such sale and cost reductions associated with this transaction are subject to a variety of risks. Please refer to the cautionary statement in our press release for more information. You will also find a detailed discussion about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC and in particular, in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 29, 2019, and recently filed quarterly report on Form 10-Q.

I'm very pleased to report that we delivered better-than-expected results in Q3, the first quarter of NortonLifeLock as a stand-alone company. We delivered revenue above the high end of the range supported",733,"Thank you, Soohwan, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very pleased to report that we delivered better-than-expected results in Q3, the first quarter of NortonLifeLock as a stand-alone company. We delivered revenue above the high end of the range supported by bookings growth of 4%. EPS was $0.25, up $0.09 from a year ago and well above our guidance, driven by strong execution and lower stranded costs.
We have accelerated our transition to become the pure-play leader in consumer cyber safety, and we are driving towards our annual target of $1.50 EPS. We have delivered on our commitment of returning more than 100% of the net proceeds from the sales of our enterprise business to Broadcom by paying a $12 per share special dividend on January 31 and starting a $1.6 billion share repurchase program in December.
Before I go into more detail, I would like to thank all of our employees. Achieving these results in a quarter in which we completed the sales of our enterprise business is another testament to the operational discipline and the dedication of our team. These encouraging results speak for themselves, but let me give you a few more details.
Since the close of the sale of our enterprise business on November 4, we have been removing stranded costs at an accelerated pace. Previously, our estimated cumulative stranded costs post close were $1.2 billion with cash cost of $900 million to remove these stranded activities. We have accelerated our transition to be done in Q2 fiscal year '21, 3 months ahead of plan. Cumulative stranded costs post close are now tracking to less than $1 billion in total, of which $750 million are in cash. We are making good strides towards exiting or rightsizing the cost base to achieve target operating margin of 50% for the total company by the end of the transition period.
In addition, we made significant progress towards our goal to monetize and dispose of underutilized assets to more than offset the stranded cash costs. We recently closed the sales of our ID Analytics business for $375 million in cash. In addition, we received the first round of bid for the sales of our soon-to-be vacated properties, including our Mountain View campus. We now project the cash proceeds from the underutilized assets to be approximately $1.5 billion, significantly higher than the $1.1 billion we previously estimated on our last earnings call. When you combine the $10.7 billion sales of the enterprise business with the $1.5 billion in monetization of assets less the $750 million in stranded costs, we project to generate roughly $11.5 billion in gross proceeds directly or indirectly related to the sales of our enterprise assets. Wow, I know Rick would be very proud. Even after taxes, which are now lower than initially expected and the return of a substantial amount of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and stock buybacks, we are left with meaningful capacity to invest and sustainably grow our consumer business.
When I started as CEO, I talked about some key priorities for us in the short term: first, establish credibility by consistently delivering on what we say; secondly, accelerate the transition to quickly get to a long-term business model with 50% profitability for the company; and lastly and more importantly, free up investment capacity to return the company to sustainable growth, delivering on the full potential of a stand-alone consumer business. I also said that it would take time to reach our full potential. I think it goes without saying that we have delivered on our commitments in terms of executing on the sales of the enterprise business, accelerating the elimination of stranded costs and maximizing the value of our underutilized assets.
As for the ongoing consumer Cyber Safety business, this quarter, we delivered bookings growth of 4% year-over-year and increased net subscribers by 66,000 sequentially while maintaining our operating margin over 50% when you exclude the impact of stranded costs. It is the first positive quarter of net customer adds in a long time, but to be fair, 1 quarter does not make a trend. While customer count is stabilizing, our focused execution and reprioritized investments have us on the right path to deliver long-term sustainable growth. Our strategy is working.
I will pass now the call over to my business partner, Samir, for more details on our product initiatives and selling motions."

Our momentum in launching Norton 360 memberships worldwide continues. In the third quarter, we expanded our membership offerings in EMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin America, including Ireland, South Africa, Australia and Mexico. We remain focused on our strategy to deliver increasing value to NortonLifeLock members by offering a broad set of cyber safety solutions.
In the third quarter, average revenue per user, or ARPU, increased to $8.99 per month, up 1.2% sequentially and up 2.7% year-over-year. More importantly, we saw continued stabilization of our direct customer count. We grew customer count sequentially this quarter for the first time in more than 2 years. We added new customers at the top of the funnel while maintaining our high retention rates. Our cyber safety message is resonating with customers. We believe the growth in customers directly results from our strategy to invest and drive consumer awareness of the value of our offering.
In addition to our direct customers, we also protect millions of customers through indirect relationships we've established through partnerships around the world, including telcos, employee benefits, retailers and e-tailers. One example is a recent partnership agreement we signed with a large telecom service provider who will be bundling our new membership product powered by LifeLock. This will be the first time we'll be launching the full version of LifeLock, which includes identity restoration outside the United States. We're starting to see more and more of these organizations understand how much value cyber safety can bring both their businesses and their customers. These relationships contribute to our foundation for growth in the future.
We are continuing to invest in our product capabilities to address cyber threats that are evolving at a fast pace. Let me highlight 2 examples of identity offerings that we launched in the quarter. In December, we launched home title alert. This additional feature is available to our U.S. members who subscribe to the highest level of identity protection. For many Americans, their home is their most valuable asset, and we're helping protect it from fraud. We're now monitoring for changes to their home title and tax records at the county recorder's office. With this service, members are alerted when potential scammers use victim's identities to take out fraudulent loans or place leans on a victim's home for financial benefit. This is one of many examples of our continued focus on innovation to deliver additional protection to our members across security, privacy, identity and home.
We also expanded our identity theft offering outside the U.S. with the launch of our Dark Web Monitoring service powered by LifeLock in Japan. The dark web is an unindexed part of the Internet, and it is a hotbed of criminal activity where criminals can buy and sell stolen information. When we detect our members' information on the dark web, we alert our members so they can take action. This product has seen good adoption in that market, and we are working hard to deliver it to consumers around the globe. Those are just 2 examples of leading innovation, but we have a robust R&D pipeline of products that we believe will help keep our customers cyber safe.
Let me turn the call over to Matt to discuss Q3 actual results in more detail."
35000,650501039,1902346,"NortonLifeLock Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 06, 2020",2020-02-06,"Earnings Calls","Gen Digital Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Samir. Let me review our Q3 results in a bit more detail, focusing on non-GAAP results. Q3 revenue was $618 million, up 1% year-over-year in constant currency and above our guidance range of $602 million to $612 million. ID Analytics revenue was i",600,"Thanks, Samir. Let me review our Q3 results in a bit more detail, focusing on non-GAAP results. Q3 revenue was $618 million, up 1% year-over-year in constant currency and above our guidance range of $602 million to $612 million. ID Analytics revenue was included in both actuals and our guidance and landed at $15 million for the quarter. Diluted EPS was $0.25, exceeding our guidance range, driven primarily by better-than-expected stranded costs in our P&L. Operating margin was 36.2% compared to 28.6% in Q3 '19. We drove strong margin performance by reducing stranded costs. In just 1 quarter, we reduced our headcount by 52% and significantly reduced our real estate footprint, making substantial progress on rightsizing our company for the go-forward business. While progress was made, Q3 continuing operations included stranded operating expenses of approximately $85 million.
As we stated on our prior quarter earnings call, during this transition period, our reporting cost structure will be complex and burdened with stranded costs. The timing of the transition, the net costs associated with our transition service agreements, asset write-offs and the location of these costs in the P&L will impact operating margin and/or EPS for the next 3 quarters. For example, depending on the underlying nature of these costs, they may be recorded in operating expenses of continuing operations or transition services expenses, which are included below the line in other income and expense, or discontinued operations or restructuring, which are excluded from our non-GAAP results altogether. Because of this complexity, we are providing detail on the approximate amounts and location of stranded costs incurred in the quarter in our earnings deck posted on our Investor Relations website, which I invite everyone to review.
In Q3, our cash flow from operations was $399 million with free cash flow of $389 million. These amounts include cash flow from continuing and discontinued operations, which also includes stranded costs and benefited from collections of enterprise-related receivables in the quarter. By the way, the estimated tax liability on the enterprise sale is now estimated at $2.2 billion versus the $2.5 billion estimated at the time of the deal. The majority of this tax liability is left to be paid in Q4 '20 and therefore, will be reflected in that quarter's cash flow from operations.
We ended the third quarter with cash and short-term investments of $12.8 billion, and our total debt level was unchanged at $4.5 billion. Our strong cash flow has enabled us to return a significant amount of cash to our shareholders. In Q3, under our $1.6 billion share buyback plan, we repurchased 14.1 million shares for $364 million in cash. In addition, in Q3, we paid our recently increased regular quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share. And lastly, we recently completed the previously announced special dividend of $12 per share. We will continue to return cash to our shareholders while maintaining our ability to invest in growth opportunities. We now expect our estimated cash balance at the end of the transition to be over $2.5 billion as a result of lower expected cash transition costs, lower expected cash taxes on the enterprise sale, lower cash paid on the special dividend due to timing of our share buyback and higher expected cash receipts from the sale of underutilized assets.
All told, this has significantly increased our cash expectations and allows greater flexibility to create more value to invest and sustainably grow the business as well as gives us the option to deploy additional capital as we opportunistically manage dilution.
Let me now turn the call back to Vincent to provide our Q4 outlook."

Let me now provide our Q4 outlook and also discuss our long-term growth strategy for NortonLifeLock. In the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $595 million to $605 million, excluding ID Analytics which closed in January. We will continue to drive the business for growth, which is expected to continue to yield low single-digit bookings growth in Q4, ultimately delivering revenue growth in later quarters.
We expect Q4 non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.15 to $0.20 per share based on assumptions of flat share count with the business operating at approximately, sorry, 50% profit margin when excluding the stranded costs. As we exit our transition period upon elimination of the stranded costs and with a full benefit from share buybacks, we expect the operating margin to reach 50% and annualized EPS to come to approximately $1.50.
Fiscal year 2020. So as we turn to previous marketing investment levels primarily targeted at direct acquisition programs in the U.S. and worldwide, we will continue to invest in our distribution and product road map. While these initiatives take time to generate revenue, we are encouraged to see 2 consecutive quarters of 4% billings growth year-over-year. We believe NortonLifeLock is well positioned to continue our market leadership by offering a simple, reliable path to cyber safety. Our mission to protect our customers' digital and connected lives is reflected in our commitment to make the world safer.
Our transformation is well underway. We have become much more nimble and customer-focused, and we are on track to achieve our near-term goals to remove stranded costs and lay the foundation for growth. For our mid- to long-term goals, we're excited by the opportunity to deliver innovative solutions to protect consumers and produce sustained revenue and earnings growth with strong cash flow generation for our shareholders.
As I told all of our employees, it will not be a linear path. There will be challenges along the way, but the opportunity is tremendous, and our focus is on protecting and delighting consumers with innovative solutions.
And with that, Matt, Samir and I are now happy to take your questions."

I think we share the data on that progression on an annual basis, and we are very happy with the results we've had over this year. So next quarter, we'll be sharing the percentage of existing customers that have moved into that program. But in addition to that, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we have also rolled out new identity protection capabilities in international markets like the Dark Web Monitoring in Japan and the soon-to-be-released identity threat restoration service in another country. So what we're seeing is the combination of capabilities and value we're providing are resonating with our customers, and that's resulting in both the ARPU as well as retention you've seen in our reporting today."

There were 3 sets of actions we've done with those investments. The first one was really to move from long-form marketing to social media and other new areas in which we had not been marketing in the past. So that's one shift. The second one was to really move from mainly being U.S. centric to be more international. We've been growing in Europe. We've been growing in Asia Pacific, and that, of course, is to support a new product launch. So those are important factors. And then we've aligned our marketing investment to the rollout of Norton 360, our membership structure, making our customers aware of the incremental value we provide them through the membership.
When you raise the noise level, if you want, in the market or the awareness level in the market, you have a long way to go in terms of improving the productivity of those marketing investments. So I do believe that while we've raised it here in fiscal year '20, we have opportunity to gain productivity from those investments going into fiscal year '21."

And the early sign of success has been mainly of raising the marketing investment to then review where we are marketing our products and making consumers aware of the need and the product, so moving into new channels that we discussed and moving internationally. And then afterwards, because we are a product company, obviously, continuously launching new products, and Samir talked about the new functionalities, Norton 360, a new concept for membership fee, you can access to all of the functionalities on our portfolio, and that's got really good reception."

And what you see today in the -- on the revenue line is the impact of those metrics 12 months ago. So obviously, as I mentioned, booking growth and customer count growth are 2 operational metrics that we are really driving for, and achieving these results, I would say, are early sign of success. I would not call them yet sustainable growth, but they're definitely encouraging signs. We are on the right path to deliver on our strategy.
In terms of the cash flow, you mentioned the cost on the continued operations P&L. You also have discontinued operations and restructuring, all of which impact cash flow. And this quarter, in Q3, we also had the collection of the accounts receivable from the enterprise segment since the deal from Broadcom did not take the AR that were preclose. So it was really a higher quarter due to that. When we peel down our cash flow statement and look what's linked to our consumer business, we're well on track to deliver our $900 million free cash flow annualized for the quarter if you want or by the end of the transition period."

As a reminder, in connection with the sale of certain assets of our Enterprise Security business to Broadcom on November 4, 2019, we changed our corporate name to -- from Symantec to NortonLifeLock. The results of our Enterprise Security business were classified as discontinued operations in our condensed consolidated statements of operations and, thus, excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented.
Starting in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we operate in one reportable segment. Revenues and associated cost of our ID Analytics solutions, which were formally included in the Enterprise Security segment, are now included in our remaining reportable segment. On January 31, 2020, we completed the sale of our ID Analytics solutions.
I'd like to remind everyone that all references to financial metrics are non-GAAP unless otherwise stated. Please refer to the supplemental materials posted on the Investor Relations website for further definitions of our non-GAAP metrics.
Please note, non-GAAP financial measures referenced during this call are reconciled to their comparable GAAP financial measures in the press release and supplemental materials posted on our website. We believe our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating performance for reasons discussed below. Our management team uses these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our operating results as well as planning and forecasting future periods. We believe our non-GAAP financial risk measures also facilitate comparisons of our performance to prior periods and that investors benefit from understanding our non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental and should not be considered as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP.
Today's call contains forward-looking statements based on conditions we currently see. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the current date and as such, involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. In particular, our statements regarding our sale of our Enterprise Security assets to Broadcom and the anticipated benefits from such sale and cost reductions associated with this transaction are subject to a variety of risks. Please refer to the cautionary statement in our press release for more information. You will also find a detailed discussion about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC and in particular, in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 29, 2019, and recently filed quarterly report on Form 10-Q.

I'm very pleased to report that we delivered better-than-expected results in Q3, the first quarter of NortonLifeLock as a stand-alone company. We delivered revenue above the high end of the range supported by bookings growth of 4%. EPS was $0.25, up $0.09 from a year ago and well above our guidance, driven by strong execution and lower stranded costs.
We have accelerated our transition to become the pure-play leader in consumer cyber safety, and we are driving towards our annual target of $1.50 EPS. We have delivered on our commitment of returning more than 100% of the net proceeds from the sales of our enterprise business to Broadcom by paying a $12 per share special dividend on January 31 and starting a $1.6 billion share repurchase program in December.
Before I go into more detail, I would like to thank all of our employees. Achieving these results in a quarter in which we completed the sales of our enterprise business is another testament to the operational discipline and the dedication of our team. These encouraging results speak for themselves, but let me give you a few more details.
Since the close of the sale of our enterprise business on November 4, we have been removing stranded costs at an accelerated pace. Previously, our estimated cumulative stranded costs post close were $1.2 billion with cash cost of $900 million to remove these stranded activities. We have accelerated our transition to be done in Q2 fiscal year '21, 3 months ahead of plan. Cumulative stranded costs post close are now tracking to less than $1 billion in total, of which $750 million are in cash. We are making good strides towards exiting or rightsizing the cost base to achieve target operating margin of 50% for the total company by the end of the transition period.
In addition, we made significant progress towards our goal to monetize and dispose of underutilized assets to more than offset the stranded cash costs. We recently closed the sales of our ID Analytics business for $375 million in cash. In addition, we received the first round of bid for the sales of our soon-to-be vacated properties, including our Mountain View campus. We now project the cash proceeds from the underutilized assets to be approximately $1.5 billion, significantly higher than the $1.1 billion we previously estimated on our last earnings call. When you combine the $10.7 billion sales of the enterprise business with the $1.5 billion in monetization of assets less the $750 million in stranded costs, we project to generate roughly $11.5 billion in gross proceeds directly or indirectly related to the sales of our enterprise assets. Wow, I know Rick would be very proud. Even after taxes, which are now lower than initially expected and the return of a substantial amount of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and stock buybacks, we are left with meaningful capacity to invest and sustainably grow our consumer business.
When I started as CEO, I talked about some key priorities for us in the short term: first, establish credibility by consistently delivering on what we say; secondly, accelerate the transition to quickly get to a long-term business model with 50% profitability for the company; and lastly and more importantly, free up investment capacity to return the company to sustainable growth, delivering on the full potential of a stand-alone consumer business. I also said that it would take time to reach our full potential. I think it goes without saying that we have delivered on our commitments in terms of executing on the sales of the enterprise business, accelerating the elimination of stranded costs and maximizing the value of our underutilized assets.
As for the ongoing consumer Cyber Safety business, this quarter, we delivered bookings growth of 4% year-over-year and increased net subscribers by 66,000 sequentially while maintaining our operating margin over 50% when you exclude the impact of stranded costs. It is the first positive quarter of net customer adds in a long time, but to be fair, 1 quarter does not make a trend. While customer count is stabilizing, our focused execution and reprioritized investments have us on the right path to deliver long-term sustainable growth. Our strategy is working.
I will pass now the call over to my business partner, Samir, for more details on our product initiatives and selling motions."

Our momentum in launching Norton 360 memberships worldwide continues. In the third quarter, we expanded our membership offerings in EMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin America, including Ireland, South Africa, Australia and Mexico. We remain focused on our strategy to deliver increasing value to NortonLifeLock members by offering a broad set of cyber safety solutions.
In the third quarter, average revenue per user, or ARPU, increased to $8.99 per month, up 1.2% sequentially and up 2.7% year-over-year. More importantly, we saw continued stabilization of our direct customer count. We grew customer count sequentially this quarter for the first time in more than 2 years. We added new customers at the top of the funnel while maintaining our high retention rates. Our cyber safety message is resonating with customers. We believe the growth in customers directly results from our strategy to invest and drive consumer awareness of the value of our offering.
In addition to our direct customers, we also protect millions of customers through indirect relationships we've established through partnerships around the world, including telcos, employee benefits, retailers and e-tailers. One example is a recent partnership agreement we signed with a large telecom service provider who will be bundling our new membership product powered by LifeLock. This will be the first time we'll be launching the full version of LifeLock, which includes identity restoration outside the United States. We're starting to see more and more of these organizations understand how much value cyber safety can bring both their businesses and their customers. These relationships contribute to our foundation for growth in the future.
We are continuing to invest in our product capabilities to address cyber threats that are evolving at a fast pace. Let me highlight 2 examples of identity offerings that we launched in the quarter. In December, we launched home title alert. This additional feature is available to our U.S. members who subscribe to the highest level of identity protection. For many Americans, their home is their most valuable asset, and we're helping protect it from fraud. We're now monitoring for changes to their home title and tax records at the county recorder's office. With this service, members are alerted when potential scammers use victim's identities to take out fraudulent loans or place leans on a victim's home for financial benefit. This is one of many examples of our continued focus on innovation to deliver additional protection to our members across security, privacy, identity and home.
We also expanded our identity theft offering outside the U.S. with the launch of our Dark Web Monitoring service powered by LifeLock in Japan. The dark web is an unindexed part of the Internet, and it is a hotbed of criminal activity where criminals can buy and sell stolen information. When we detect our members' information on the dark web, we alert our members so they can take action. This product has seen good adoption in that market, and we are working hard to deliver it to consumers around the globe. Those are just 2 examples of leading innovation, but we have a robust R&D pipeline of products that we believe will help keep our customers cyber safe.
Let me turn the call over to Matt to discuss Q3 actual results in more detail."

Let me review our Q3 results in a bit more detail, focusing on non-GAAP results. Q3 revenue was $618 million, up 1% year-over-year in constant currency and above our guidance range of $602 million to $612 million. ID Analytics revenue was included in both actuals and our guidance and landed at $15 million for the quarter. Diluted EPS was $0.25, exceeding our guidance range, driven primarily by better-than-expected stranded costs in our P&L. Operating margin was 36.2% compared to 28.6% in Q3 '19. We drove strong margin performance by reducing stranded costs. In just 1 quarter, we reduced our headcount by 52% and significantly reduced our real estate footprint, making substantial progress on rightsizing our company for the go-forward business. While progress was made, Q3 continuing operations included stranded operating expenses of approximately $85 million.
As we stated on our prior quarter earnings call, during this transition period, our reporting cost structure will be complex and burdened with stranded costs. The timing of the transition, the net costs associated with our transition service agreements, asset write-offs and the location of these costs in the P&L will impact operating margin and/or EPS for the next 3 quarters. For example, depending on the underlying nature of these costs, they may be recorded in operating expenses of continuing operations or transition services expenses, which are included below the line in other income and expense, or discontinued operations or restructuring, which are excluded from our non-GAAP results altogether. Because of this complexity, we are providing detail on the approximate amounts and location of stranded costs incurred in the quarter in our earnings deck posted on our Investor Relations website, which I invite everyone to review.
In Q3, our cash flow from operations was $399 million with free cash flow of $389 million. These amounts include cash flow from continuing and discontinued operations, which also includes stranded costs and benefited from collections of enterprise-related receivables in the quarter. By the way, the estimated tax liability on the enterprise sale is now estimated at $2.2 billion versus the $2.5 billion estimated at the time of the deal. The majority of this tax liability is left to be paid in Q4 '20 and therefore, will be reflected in that quarter's cash flow from operations.
We ended the third quarter with cash and short-term investments of $12.8 billion, and our total debt level was unchanged at $4.5 billion. Our strong cash flow has enabled us to return a significant amount of cash to our shareholders. In Q3, under our $1.6 billion share buyback plan, we repurchased 14.1 million shares for $364 million in cash. In addition, in Q3, we paid our recently increased regular quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share. And lastly, we recently completed the previously announced special dividend of $12 per share. We will continue to return cash to our shareholders while maintaining our ability to invest in growth opportunities. We now expect our estimated cash balance at the end of the transition to be over $2.5 billion as a result of lower expected cash transition costs, lower expected cash taxes on the enterprise sale, lower cash paid on the special dividend due to timing of our share buyback and higher expected cash receipts from the sale of underutilized assets.
All told, this has significantly increased our cash expectations and allows greater flexibility to create more value to invest and sustainably grow the business as well as gives us the option to deploy additional capital as we opportunistically manage dilution.

Let me now provide our Q4 outlook and also discuss our long-term growth strategy for NortonLifeLock. In the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $595 million to $605 million, excluding ID Analytics which closed in January. We will continue to drive the business for growth, which is expected to continue to yield low single-digit bookings growth in Q4, ultimately delivering revenue growth in later quarters.
We expect Q4 non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.15 to $0.20 per share based on assumptions of flat share count with the business operating at approximately, sorry, 50% profit margin when excluding the stranded costs. As we exit our transition period upon elimination of the stranded costs and with a full benefit from share buybacks, we expect the operating margin to reach 50% and annualized EPS to come to approximately $1.50.
Fiscal year 2020. So as we turn to previous marketing investment levels primarily targeted at direct acquisition programs in the U.S. and worldwide, we will continue to invest in our distribution and product road map. While these initiatives take time to generate revenue, we are encouraged to see 2 consecutive quarters of 4% billings growth year-over-year. We believe NortonLifeLock is well positioned to continue our market leadership by offering a simple, reliable path to cyber safety. Our mission to protect our customers' digital and connected lives is reflected in our commitment to make the world safer.
Our transformation is well underway. We have become much more nimble and customer-focused, and we are on track to achieve our near-term goals to remove stranded costs and lay the foundation for growth. For our mid- to long-term goals, we're excited by the opportunity to deliver innovative solutions to protect consumers and produce sustained revenue and earnings growth with strong cash flow generation for our shareholders.
As I told all of our employees, it will not be a linear path. There will be challenges along the way, but the opportunity is tremendous, and our focus is on protecting and delighting consumers with innovative solutions.
And with that, Matt, Samir and I are now happy to take your questions."

I think we share the data on that progression on an annual basis, and we are very happy with the results we've had over this year. So next quarter, we'll be sharing the percentage of existing customers that have moved into that program. But in addition to that, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we have also rolled out new identity protection capabilities in international markets like the Dark Web Monitoring in Japan and the soon-to-be-released identity threat restoration service in another country.

There were 3 sets of actions we've done with those investments. The first one was really to move from long-form marketing to social media and other new areas in which we had not been marketing in the past. So that's one shift. The second one was to really move from mainly being U.S. centric to be more international. We've been growing in Europe. We've been growing in Asia Pacific, and that, of course, is to support a new product launch. So those are important factors. And then we've aligned our marketing investment to the rollout of Norton 360, our membership structure, making our customers aware of the incremental value we provide them through the membership.
When you raise the noise level, if you want, in the market or the awareness level in the market, you have a long way to go in terms of improving the productivity of those marketing investments.

I'll start with the growth. Booking growth 4% for now 2 quarters in a row, customer count growth are 2 very good leading indicators of the future state of the business and what it will mean for the revenue line, which is more of an accounting line. If you go back to the end of fiscal year '19, we had revenue decline, we had deferred balance decline, and we had customer count decline. And what you see today in the -- on the revenue line is the impact of those metrics 12 months ago. So obviously, as I mentioned, booking growth and customer count growth are 2 operational metrics that we are really driving for, and achieving these results, I would say, are early sign of success. I would not call them yet sustainable growth, but they're definitely encouraging signs. We are on the right path to deliver on our strategy.
In terms of the cash flow, you mentioned the cost on the continued operations P&L. You also have discontinued operations and restructuring, all of which impact cash flow. And this quarter, in Q3, we also had the collection of the accounts receivable from the enterprise segment since the deal from Broadcom did not take the AR that were preclose. So it was really a higher quarter due to that. When we peel down our cash flow statement and look what's linked to our consumer business, we're well on track to deliver our $900 million free cash flow annualized for the quarter if you want or by the end of the transition period."

As a reminder, in connection with the sale of certain assets of our Enterprise Security business to Broadcom on November 4, 2019, we changed our corporate name to -- from Symantec to NortonLifeLock. The results of our Enterprise Security business were classified as discontinued operations in our condensed consolidated statements of operations and, thus, excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented.
Starting in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we operate in one reportable segment. Revenues and associated cost of our ID Analytics solutions, which were formally included in the Enterprise Security segment, are now included in our remaining reportable segment. On January 31, 2020, we completed the sale of our ID Analytics solutions.

Please note, non-GAAP financial measures referenced during this call are reconciled to their comparable GAAP financial measures in the press release and supplemental materials posted on our website. We believe our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating performance for reasons discussed below. Our management team uses these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our operating results as well as planning and forecasting future periods.

Non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental and should not be considered as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP.

I'm very pleased to report that we delivered better-than-expected results in Q3, the first quarter of NortonLifeLock as a stand-alone company. We delivered revenue above the high end of the range supported by bookings growth of 4%. EPS was $0.25, up $0.09 from a year ago and well above our guidance, driven by strong execution and lower stranded costs.
We have accelerated our transition to become the pure-play leader in consumer cyber safety, and we are driving towards our annual target of $1.50 EPS. We have delivered on our commitment of returning more than 100% of the net proceeds from the sales of our enterprise business to Broadcom by paying a $12 per share special dividend on January 31 and starting a $1.6 billion share repurchase program in December.
Before I go into more detail, I would like to thank all of our employees. Achieving these results in a quarter in which we completed the sales of our enterprise business is another testament to the operational discipline and the dedication of our team. These encouraging results speak for themselves, but let me give you a few more details.
Since the close of the sale of our enterprise business on November 4, we have been removing stranded costs at an accelerated pace. Previously, our estimated cumulative stranded costs post close were $1.2 billion with cash cost of $900 million to remove these stranded activities. We have accelerated our transition to be done in Q2 fiscal year '21, 3 months ahead of plan. Cumulative stranded costs post close are now tracking to less than $1 billion in total, of which $750 million are in cash. We are making good strides towards exiting or rightsizing the cost base to achieve target operating margin of 50% for the total company by the end of the transition period.
In addition, we made significant progress towards our goal to monetize and dispose of underutilized assets to more than offset the stranded cash costs. We recently closed the sales of our ID Analytics business for $375 million in cash. In addition, we received the first round of bid for the sales of our soon-to-be vacated properties, including our Mountain View campus. We now project the cash proceeds from the underutilized assets to be approximately $1.5 billion, significantly higher than the $1.1 billion we previously estimated on our last earnings call. When you combine the $10.7 billion sales of the enterprise business with the $1.5 billion in monetization of assets less the $750 million in stranded costs, we project to generate roughly $11.5 billion in gross proceeds directly or indirectly related to the sales of our enterprise assets. Wow, I know Rick would be very proud. Even after taxes, which are now lower than initially expected and the return of a substantial amount of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and stock buybacks, we are left with meaningful capacity to invest and sustainably grow our consumer business.
When I started as CEO, I talked about some key priorities for us in the short term: first, establish credibility by consistently delivering on what we say; secondly, accelerate the transition to quickly get to a long-term business model with 50% profitability for the company; and lastly and more importantly, free up investment capacity to return the company to sustainable growth, delivering on the full potential of a stand-alone consumer business. I also said that it would take time to reach our full potential. I think it goes without saying that we have delivered on our commitments in terms of executing on the sales of the enterprise business, accelerating the elimination of stranded costs and maximizing the value of our underutilized assets.
As for the ongoing consumer Cyber Safety business, this quarter, we delivered bookings growth of 4% year-over-year and increased net subscribers by 66,000 sequentially while maintaining our operating margin over 50% when you exclude the impact of stranded costs. It is the first positive quarter of net customer adds in a long time, but to be fair, 1 quarter does not make a trend. While customer count is stabilizing, our focused execution and reprioritized investments have us on the right path to deliver long-term sustainable growth. Our strategy is working.
I will pass now the call over to my business partner, Samir, for more details on our product initiatives and selling motions."

Our momentum in launching Norton 360 memberships worldwide continues. In the third quarter, we expanded our membership offerings in EMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin America, including Ireland, South Africa, Australia and Mexico. We remain focused on our strategy to deliver increasing value to NortonLifeLock members by offering a broad set of cyber safety solutions.
In the third quarter, average revenue per user, or ARPU, increased to $8.99 per month, up 1.2% sequentially and up 2.7% year-over-year. More importantly, we saw continued stabilization of our direct customer count. We grew customer count sequentially this quarter for the first time in more than 2 years. We added new customers at the top of the funnel while maintaining our high retention rates. Our cyber safety message is resonating with customers. We believe the growth in customers directly results from our strategy to invest and drive consumer awareness of the value of our offering.
In addition to our direct customers, we also protect millions of customers through indirect relationships we've established through partnerships around the world, including telcos, employee benefits, retailers and e-tailers. One example is a recent partnership agreement we signed with a large telecom service provider who will be bundling our new membership product powered by LifeLock. This will be the first time we'll be launching the full version of LifeLock, which includes identity restoration outside the United States. We're starting to see more and more of these organizations understand how much value cyber safety can bring both their businesses and their customers. These relationships contribute to our foundation for growth in the future.
We are continuing to invest in our product capabilities to address cyber threats that are evolving at a fast pace. Let me highlight 2 examples of identity offerings that we launched in the quarter. In December, we launched home title alert. This additional feature is available to our U.S. members who subscribe to the highest level of identity protection. For many Americans, their home is their most valuable asset, and we're helping protect it from fraud. We're now monitoring for changes to their home title and tax records at the county recorder's office. With this service, members are alerted when potential scammers use victim's identities to take out fraudulent loans or place leans on a victim's home for financial benefit. This is one of many examples of our continued focus on innovation to deliver additional protection to our members across security, privacy, identity and home.
We also expanded our identity theft offering outside the U.S. with the launch of our Dark Web Monitoring service powered by LifeLock in Japan. The dark web is an unindexed part of the Internet, and it is a hotbed of criminal activity where criminals can buy and sell stolen information. When we detect our members' information on the dark web, we alert our members so they can take action. This product has seen good adoption in that market, and we are working hard to deliver it to consumers around the globe. Those are just 2 examples of leading innovation, but we have a robust R&D pipeline of products that we believe will help keep our customers cyber safe.
Let me turn the call over to Matt to discuss Q3 actual results in more detail."

Let me review our Q3 results in a bit more detail, focusing on non-GAAP results. Q3 revenue was $618 million, up 1% year-over-year in constant currency and above our guidance range of $602 million to $612 million. ID Analytics revenue was included in both actuals and our guidance and landed at $15 million for the quarter. Diluted EPS was $0.25, exceeding our guidance range, driven primarily by better-than-expected stranded costs in our P&L. Operating margin was 36.2% compared to 28.6% in Q3 '19. We drove strong margin performance by reducing stranded costs. In just 1 quarter, we reduced our head count by 52% and significantly reduced our real estate footprint, making substantial progress on rightsizing our company for the go-forward business. While progress was made, Q3 continuing operations included stranded operating expenses of approximately $85 million.
As we stated on our prior quarter earnings call, during this transition period, our reporting cost structure will be complex and burdened with stranded costs. The timing of the transition, the net costs associated with our transition service agreements, asset write-offs and the location of these costs in the P&L will impact operating margin and/or EPS for the next 3 quarters. For example, depending on the underlying nature of these costs, they may be recorded in operating expenses of continuing operations or transition services expenses, which are included below the line in other income and expense, or discontinued operations or restructuring, which are excluded from our non-GAAP results altogether. Because of this complexity, we are providing detail on the approximate amounts and location of stranded costs incurred in the quarter in our earnings deck posted on our Investor Relations website, which I invite everyone to review.
In Q3, our cash flow from operations was $399 million with free cash flow of $389 million. These amounts include cash flow from continuing and discontinued operations, which also includes stranded costs and benefited from collections of enterprise-related receivables in the quarter. By the way, the estimated tax liability on the enterprise sale is now estimated at $2.2 billion versus the $2.5 billion estimated at the time of the deal. The majority of this tax liability is left to be paid in Q4 '20 and therefore, will be reflected in that quarter's cash flow from operations.
We ended the third quarter with cash and short-term investments of $12.8 billion, and our total debt level was unchanged at $4.5 billion. Our strong cash flow has enabled us to return a significant amount of cash to our shareholders. In Q3, under our $1.6 billion share buyback plan, we repurchased 14.1 million shares for $364 million in cash. In addition, in Q3, we paid our recently increased regular quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share. And lastly, we recently completed the previously announced special dividend of $12 per share. We will continue to return cash to our shareholders while maintaining our ability to invest in growth opportunities. We now expect our estimated cash balance at the end of the transition to be over $2.5 billion as a result of lower expected cash transition costs, lower expected cash taxes on the enterprise sale, lower cash paid on the special dividend due to timing of our share buyback and higher expected cash receipts from the sale of underutilized assets.
All told, this has significantly increased our cash expectations and allows greater flexibility to create more value to invest and sustainably grow the business as well as gives us the option to deploy additional capital as we opportunistically manage dilution.
Let me now turn the call back to Vincent to provide our Q4 outlook."

Let me now provide our Q4 outlook and also discuss our long-term growth strategy for NortonLifeLock. In the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $595 million to $605 million, excluding ID Analytics which closed in January. We will continue to drive the business for growth, which is expected to continue to yield low single-digit bookings growth in Q4, ultimately delivering revenue growth in later quarters.
We expect Q4 non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.15 to $0.20 per share based on assumptions of flat share count with the business operating at approximately, sorry, 50% profit margin when excluding the stranded costs. As we exit our transition period upon elimination of the stranded costs and with a full benefit from share buybacks, we expect the operating margin to reach 50% and annualized EPS to come to approximately $1.50.
Fiscal year 2020. So as we turn to previous marketing investment levels primarily targeted at direct acquisition programs in the U.S. and worldwide, we will continue to invest in our distribution and product road map. While these initiatives take time to generate revenue, we are encouraged to see 2 consecutive quarters of 4% billings growth year-over-year. We believe NortonLifeLock is well positioned to continue our market leadership by offering a simple, reliable path to cyber safety. Our mission to protect our customers' digital and connected lives is reflected in our commitment to make the world safer.
Our transformation is well underway. We have become much more nimble and customer-focused, and we are on track to achieve our near-term goals to remove stranded costs and lay the foundation for growth. For our mid- to long-term goals, we're excited by the opportunity to deliver innovative solutions to protect consumers and produce sustained revenue and earnings growth with strong cash flow generation for our shareholders.
As I told all of our employees, it will not be a linear path. There will be challenges along the way, but the opportunity is tremendous, and our focus is on protecting and delighting consumers with innovative solutions.

I think we share the data on that progression on an annual basis, and we are very happy with the results we've had over this year. So next quarter, we'll be sharing the percentage of existing customers that have moved into that program. But in addition to that, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we have also rolled out new identity protection capabilities in international markets like the Dark Web Monitoring in Japan and the soon-to-be-released identity threat restoration service in another country. So what we're seeing is the combination of capabilities and value we're providing are resonating with our customers, and that's resulting in both the ARPU as well as retention you've seen in our reporting today."

There were 3 sets of actions we've done with those investments. The first one was really to move from long-form marketing to social media and other new areas in which we had not been marketing in the past. So that's one shift. The second one was to really move from mainly being U.S. centric to be more international. We've been growing in Europe. We've been growing in Asia Pacific, and that, of course, is to support a new product launch. So those are important factors. And then we've aligned our marketing investment to the rollout of Norton 360, our membership structure, making our customers aware of the incremental value we provide them through the membership.
When you raise the noise level, if you want, in the market or the awareness level in the market, you have a long way to go in terms of improving the productivity of those marketing investments. So I do believe that while we've raised it here in fiscal year '20, we have opportunity to gain productivity from those investments going into fiscal year '21."

In terms of the cash flow, you mentioned the cost on the continued operations P&L. You also have discontinued operations and restructuring, all of which impact cash flow.

Speakers on today's call are Vincent Pilette, NortonLifeLock's CEO; Samir Kapuria, President; and Matt Brown, Interim CFO. The call will be available for replay via webcast on our website.
As a reminder, in connection with the sale of certain assets of our Enterprise Security business to Broadcom on November 4, 2019, we changed our corporate name to -- from Symantec to NortonLifeLock. The results of our Enterprise Security business were classified as discontinued operations in our condensed consolidated statements of operations and, thus, excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented.
Starting in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we operate in one reportable segment. Revenues and associated cost of our ID Analytics solutions, which were formally included in the Enterprise Security segment, are now included in our remaining reportable segment. On January 31, 2020, we completed the sale of our ID Analytics solutions.
I'd like to remind everyone that all references to financial metrics are non-GAAP unless otherwise stated. Please refer to the supplemental materials posted on the Investor Relations website for further definitions of our non-GAAP metrics.
Please note, non-GAAP financial measures referenced during this call are reconciled to their comparable GAAP financial measures in the press release and supplemental materials posted on our website. We believe our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating performance for reasons discussed below. Our management team uses these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our operating results as well as planning and forecasting future periods. We believe our non-GAAP financial risk measures also facilitate comparisons of our performance to prior periods and that investors benefit from understanding our non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental and should not be considered as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP.
Today's call contains forward-looking statements based on conditions we currently see. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the current date and as such, involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. In particular, our statements regarding our sale of our Enterprise Security assets to Broadcom and the anticipated benefits from such sale and cost reductions associated with this transaction are subject to a variety of risks. Please refer to the cautionary statement in our press release for more information. You will also find a detailed discussion about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC and in particular, in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 29, 2019, and recently filed quarterly report on Form 10-Q.

I'm very pleased to report that we delivered better-than-expected results in Q3, the first quarter of NortonLifeLock as a stand-alone company. We delivered revenue above the high end of the range supported by bookings growth of 4%. EPS was $0.25, up $0.09 from a year ago and well above our guidance, driven by strong execution and lower stranded costs.
We have accelerated our transition to become the pure-play leader in consumer cyber safety, and we are driving towards our annual target of $1.50 EPS. We have delivered on our commitment of returning more than 100% of the net proceeds from the sales of our enterprise business to Broadcom by paying a $12 per share special dividend on January 31 and starting a $1.6 billion share repurchase program in December.
Before I go into more detail, I would like to thank all of our employees. Achieving these results in a quarter in which we completed the sales of our enterprise business is another testament to the operational discipline and the dedication of our team. These encouraging results speak for themselves, but let me give you a few more details.
Since the close of the sale of our enterprise business on November 4, we have been removing stranded costs at an accelerated pace. Previously, our estimated cumulative stranded costs post close were $1.2 billion with cash cost of $900 million to remove these stranded activities. We have accelerated our transition to be done in Q2 fiscal year '21, 3 months ahead of plan. Cumulative stranded costs post close are now tracking to less than $1 billion in total, of which $750 million are in cash. We are making good strides towards exiting or rightsizing the cost base to achieve target operating margin of 50% for the total company by the end of the transition period.
In addition, we made significant progress towards our goal to monetize and dispose of underutilized assets to more than offset the stranded cash costs. We recently closed the sales of our ID Analytics business for $375 million in cash. In addition, we received the first round of bid for the sales of our soon-to-be vacated properties, including our Mountain View campus. We now project the cash proceeds from the underutilized assets to be approximately $1.5 billion, significantly higher than the $1.1 billion we previously estimated on our last earnings call. 
When you combine the $10.7 billion sales of the enterprise business with the $1.5 billion in monetization of assets less the $750 million in stranded costs, we project to generate roughly $11.5 billion in gross proceeds directly or indirectly related to the sales of our enterprise assets. Wow, I know Rick would be very proud. Even after taxes, which are now lower than initially expected and the return of a substantial amount of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and stock buybacks, we are left with meaningful capacity to invest and sustainably grow our consumer business.
When I started as CEO, I talked about some key priorities for us in the short term: first, establish credibility by consistently delivering on what we say; secondly, accelerate the transition to quickly get to a long-term business model with 50% profitability for the company; and lastly and more importantly, free up investment capacity to return the company to sustainable growth, delivering on the full potential of a stand-alone consumer business. I also said that it would take time to reach our full potential. I think it goes without saying that we have delivered on our commitments in terms of executing on the sales of the enterprise business, accelerating the elimination of stranded costs and maximizing the value of our underutilized assets.
As for the ongoing consumer Cyber Safety business, this quarter, we delivered bookings growth of 4% year-over-year and increased net subscribers by 66,000 sequentially while maintaining our operating margin over 50% when you exclude the impact of stranded costs. It is the first positive quarter of net customer adds in a long time, but to be fair, 1 quarter does not make a trend. While customer count is stabilizing, our focused execution and reprioritized investments have us on the right path to deliver long-term sustainable growth. Our strategy is working.
I will pass now the call over to my business partner, Samir, for more details on our product initiatives and selling motions."

Our momentum in launching Norton 360 memberships worldwide continues. In the third quarter, we expanded our membership offerings in EMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin America, including Ireland, South Africa, Australia and Mexico. We remain focused on our strategy to deliver increasing value to NortonLifeLock members by offering a broad set of cyber safety solutions.
In the third quarter, average revenue per user, or ARPU, increased to $8.99 per month, up 1.2% sequentially and up 2.7% year-over-year. More importantly, we saw continued stabilization of our direct customer count. We grew customer count sequentially this quarter for the first time in more than 2 years. We added new customers at the top of the funnel while maintaining our high retention rates. Our cyber safety message is resonating with customers. We believe the growth in customers directly results from our strategy to invest and drive consumer awareness of the value of our offering.
In addition to our direct customers, we also protect millions of customers through indirect relationships we've established through partnerships around the world, including telcos, employee benefits, retailers and e-tailers. One example is a recent partnership agreement we signed with a large telecom service provider who will be bundling our new membership product powered by LifeLock. This will be the first time we'll be launching the full version of LifeLock, which includes identity restoration outside the United States. We're starting to see more and more of these organizations understand how much value cyber safety can bring both their businesses and their customers. These relationships contribute to our foundation for growth in the future.
We are continuing to invest in our product capabilities to address cyber threats that are evolving at a fast pace. Let me highlight 2 examples of identity offerings that we launched in the quarter. In December, we launched home title alert. This additional feature is available to our U.S. members who subscribe to the highest level of identity protection. For many Americans, their home is their most valuable asset, and we're helping protect it from fraud. We're now monitoring for changes to their home title and tax records at the county recorder's office. With this service, members are alerted when potential scammers use victim's identities to take out fraudulent loans or place leans on a victim's home for financial benefit. This is one of many examples of our continued focus on innovation to deliver additional protection to our members across security, privacy, identity and home.
We also expanded our identity theft offering outside the U.S. with the launch of our Dark Web Monitoring service powered by LifeLock in Japan. The dark web is an unindexed part of the Internet, and it is a hotbed of criminal activity where criminals can buy and sell stolen information. When we detect our members' information on the dark web, we alert our members so they can take action. This product has seen good adoption in that market, and we are working hard to deliver it to consumers around the globe. Those are just 2 examples of leading innovation, but we have a robust R&D pipeline of products that we believe will help keep our customers cyber safe.
Let me turn the call over to Matt to discuss Q3 actual results in more detail."

Let me review our Q3 results in a bit more detail, focusing on non-GAAP results.

Let me review our Q3 results in a bit more detail, focusing on non-GAAP results. Q3 revenue was $618 million, up 1% year-over-year in constant currency and above our guidance range of $602 million to $612 million. ID Analytics revenue was included in both actuals and our guidance and landed at $15 million for the quarter. Diluted EPS was $0.25, exceeding our guidance range, driven primarily by better-than-expected stranded costs in our P&L. Operating margin was 36.2% compared to 28.6% in Q3 '19. We drove strong margin performance by reducing stranded costs. In just 1 quarter, we reduced our head count by 52% and significantly reduced our real estate footprint, making substantial progress on rightsizing our company for the go-forward business. While progress was made, Q3 continuing operations included stranded operating expenses of approximately $85 million.
As we stated on our prior quarter earnings call, during this transition period, our reporting cost structure will be complex and burdened with stranded costs. The timing of the transition, the net costs associated with our transition service agreements, asset write-offs and the location of these costs in the P&L will impact operating margin and/or EPS for the next 3 quarters. For example, depending on the underlying nature of these costs, they may be recorded in operating expenses of continuing operations or transition services expenses, which are included below the line in other income and expense, or discontinued operations or restructuring, which are excluded from our non-GAAP results altogether. Because of this complexity, we are providing detail on the approximate amounts and location of stranded costs incurred in the quarter in our earnings deck posted on our Investor Relations website, which I invite everyone to review.
In Q3, our cash flow from operations was $399 million with free cash flow of $389 million. These amounts include cash flow from continuing and discontinued operations, which also includes stranded costs and benefited from collections of enterprise-related receivables in the quarter. By the way, the estimated tax liability on the enterprise sale is now estimated at $2.2 billion versus the $2.5 billion estimated at the time of the deal. The majority of this tax liability is left to be paid in Q4 '20 and therefore, will be reflected in that quarter's cash flow from operations.
We ended the third quarter with cash and short-term investments of $12.8 billion, and our total debt level was unchanged at $4.5 billion. Our strong cash flow has enabled us to return a significant amount of cash to our shareholders. In Q3, under our $1.6 billion share buyback plan, we repurchased 14.1 million shares for $364 million in cash. In addition, in Q3, we paid our recently increased regular quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share. And lastly, we recently completed the previously announced special dividend of $12 per share. We will continue to return cash to our shareholders while maintaining our ability to invest in growth opportunities. We now expect our estimated cash balance at the end of the transition to be over $2.5 billion as a result of lower expected cash transition costs, lower expected cash taxes on the enterprise sale, lower cash paid on the special dividend due to timing of our share buyback and higher expected cash receipts from the sale of underutilized assets.
All told, this has significantly increased our cash expectations and allows greater flexibility to create more value to invest and sustainably grow the business as well as gives us the option to deploy additional capital as we opportunistically manage dilution.
Let me now turn the call back to Vincent to provide our Q4 outlook."

Let me now provide our Q4 outlook and also discuss our long-term growth strategy for NortonLifeLock. In the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $595 million to $605 million, excluding ID Analytics which closed in January. We will continue to drive the business for growth, which is expected to continue to yield low single-digit bookings growth in Q4, ultimately delivering revenue growth in later quarters.
We expect Q4 non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.15 to $0.20 per share based on assumptions of flat share count with the business operating at approximately, sorry, 50% profit margin when excluding the stranded costs. As we exit our transition period upon elimination of the stranded costs and with a full benefit from share buybacks, we expect the operating margin to reach 50% and annualized EPS to come to approximately $1.50.
Fiscal year 2020. So as we turn to previous marketing investment levels primarily targeted at direct acquisition programs in the U.S. and worldwide, we will continue to invest in our distribution and product road map. While these initiatives take time to generate revenue, we are encouraged to see 2 consecutive quarters of 4% billings growth year-over-year. We believe NortonLifeLock is well positioned to continue our market leadership by offering a simple, reliable path to cyber safety. Our mission to protect our customers' digital and connected lives is reflected in our commitment to make the world safer.
Our transformation is well underway. We have become much more nimble and customer-focused, and we are on track to achieve our near-term goals to remove stranded costs and lay the foundation for growth. For our mid- to long-term goals, we're excited by the opportunity to deliver innovative solutions to protect consumers and produce sustained revenue and earnings growth with strong cash flow generation for our shareholders.
As I told all of our employees, it will not be a linear path. There will be challenges along the way, but the opportunity is tremendous, and our focus is on protecting and delighting consumers with innovative solutions.
And with that, Matt, Samir and I are now happy to take your questions."

I think we share the data on that progression on an annual basis, and we are very happy with the results we've had over this year. So next quarter, we'll be sharing the percentage of existing customers that have moved into that program. 
But in addition to that, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we have also rolled out new identity protection capabilities in international markets like the Dark Web Monitoring in Japan and the soon-to-be-released identity threat restoration service in another country. So what we're seeing is the combination of capabilities and value we're providing are resonating with our customers, and that's resulting in both the ARPU as well as retention you've seen in our reporting today."

There were 3 sets of actions we've done with those investments. The first one was really to move from long-form marketing to social media and other new areas in which we had not been marketing in the past. So that's one shift. The second one was to really move from mainly being U.S. centric to be more international. We've been growing in Europe. We've been growing in Asia Pacific, and that, of course, is to support a new product launch. So those are important factors. And then we've aligned our marketing investment to the rollout of Norton 360, our membership structure, making our customers aware of the incremental value we provide them through the membership. When you raise the noise level, if you want, in the market or the awareness level in the market, you have a long way to go in terms of improving the productivity of those marketing investments.

And what you see today in the -- on the revenue line is the impact of those metrics 12 months ago. So obviously, as I mentioned, booking growth and customer count growth are 2 operational metrics that we are really driving for, and achieving these results, I would say, are early sign of success. I would not call them yet sustainable growth, but they're definitely encouraging signs. We are on the right path to deliver on our strategy.
In terms of the cash flow, you mentioned the cost on the continued operations P&L. You also have discontinued operations and restructuring, all of which impact cash flow. And this quarter, in Q3, we also had the collection of the accounts receivable from the enterprise segment since the deal from Broadcom did not take the AR that were preclose. So it was really a higher quarter due to that. When we peel down our cash flow statement and look what's linked to our consumer business, we're well on track to deliver our $900 million free cash flow annualized for the quarter if you want or by the end of the transition period."

I want to start this call by thanking all our employees, as I know many of you are listening. Each of you has persevered in driving our mission and supporting our customers while working from home and adjusting to this new reality. Our mission is to protect people's online activities, which has never been more relevant than today. And on behalf of all our employees, I also want to thank our customers for the trust you have placed in our products and in us. 
Our business is built around prevention, detection and restoration of potential damages caused by hackers. Managing and handling crisis is part of our DNA, and the entire NortonLifeLock team is rising to the occasion, adapting ourselves and our processes to help customers in need as well as communities by donating time and resources. There is no other company I would rather be part of as we navigate the challenges that the world is currently facing. 
We are pleased to report better-than-expected results in Q4, the second quarter of NortonLifeLock as a stand-alone company. Consumer revenue was up 1% year-over-year in constant currency, supported by bookings growth of 4%. We generated $0.26 EPS, up $0.10 from a year ago, driven by strong execution and the elimination of stranded costs. In addition to year-over-year bookings growth of mid-single digits, we increased net customer count by 46,000 sequentially. We grew average revenue per users. We delivered industry-leading retention while maintaining our operating profit margin over 51% when you exclude the impact of stranded costs. This was our second sequential quarter of net customer growth, adding over 100,000 customers in the last 6 months. For the first time since 2014, we've had 2 consecutive quarters of net adds. Through the quarter, we saw a steady performance with a strong finish in the month of March. However, we're still in stabilization phase, especially in this current environment. The business is moving in the right direction, and we believe that our focused execution will deliver consistent, sustainable growth over time. The need for our products is more present than ever, driven by working from home, virtual meetings, online gaming, streaming, e-shopping, telemedicine and numerous other online transactions and interactions that put us all at risk from cyber criminals, looking to take advantage of this accelerated trend. 
As Samir will remind us all in a moment, our portfolio does a tremendous job protecting people from online threat, but it is not a static world. As the threats evolve with our behaviors and technology, we are focused on delivering a portfolio that protects each element of our customers' digital lives. That is our mission. And we will know that we are succeeding when these added products and features consistently deliver customer count growth. That is why it is our #1 measure of success. 
Let me mention a few of these highlights now. This quarter, we expanded our family offering. We offered free usage during the COVID-19 crisis. We received 3 awards from AV-TEST Institute for our device protection solutions, and we made numerous other improvements to our platform and products. In April, we expanded our international reach and capabilities with the launch of Norton 360 with LifeLock in Canada. We have a long history of innovation here at NortonLifelock, and we know that product innovation will be a cornerstone of our long-term success. 
Our fourth quarter performance not only reflects the strong execution of our team, but also demonstrate the resiliency and opportunity of our business model. We sell direct to consumers with minimal reliance on physical partners, delivering high-value at a relatively low ARPU, plus over 95% of our business is recurring. 
Considering these challenging times and the various requests from our investors, let me expand on each of these points, starting with recurring revenue. 90% of our revenue is direct to consumers. The vast majority of our bookings are annual subscriptions, which are paid upfront, while revenue is recognized ratably each quarter. Our indirect revenue, about 10% of our total, is also half recurring. Partners like telecom carriers and employee benefit providers pay us every month as they provide our products to their customer base. On the first day of the quarter, we have visibility on over 70% of our revenue coming off our balance sheet, and as I mentioned, over 95% of our total revenue is recurring. 
Secondly, we have minimal reliance on physical retail or OEM partners. The bookings generated by these channels represent about 5% of our total bookings and the revenues included in the indirect part of our business. This 5% might be impacted by a prolonged health crisis, and we will be conservative with our forecasting. However, we do not believe travel restrictions or supply chain disruptions have much impact on our distribution capabilities overall. 
Lastly, and most importantly, we are providing tremendous and relevant value for a monthly ARPU of $9. During this environment when consumers are spending almost all of their time at home and online, we're providing a round-the-clock protection for our members. We've all heard about increasing instances of online criminal activity. In April, our restoration team already started handling the first cases of identity theft related to COVID-19 subsidy payments. The opportunity for cyber crime has substantially increased, and we know that Norton 360 is helping our customers manage their online activities with more confidence knowing that Norton 360 is keeping them safe. 
In the back half of Q4 and during the month of April, we have seen this customer confidence in our products reflected in solid renewal rates and new bookings. So our mission to protect everyone's digital life is more relevant than ever. And our business and financial model is as resilient as any in these uncertain times. 
Now our balance sheet and cash position are equally strong. At the end of the quarter, after dividend payments and buyback, our cash balance was $2.3 billion. As a result of refinancing actions taken in Q3, we have addressed all debt maturities until the end of fiscal year 2022. Our various stress tests show that we are well capitalized with strong liquidity and plenty of financial flexibility to strategically invest in our business, make interest payments and continue to return cash to our shareholders. Our balance sheet and capital structure give us optionality to make accretive stocking acquisitions, return further capital through buybacks or both. Matt will provide you with more details about the financial and the liquidity strength in his section. 
So what about the stranded costs, you might ask? Well, if I only talk about it now, it is because I consider the transition to be almost done with all decisions made to cross the finish line in August. We've run our transition to a pure-play consumer company at a rapid and decisive pace. As I stand in front of you today on May 14, essentially all transitions have been serviced and closed. All stranded job elimination notifications have been made, and our operational headcount today is around 2,500. Q1 and the beginning of Q2 will reflect the last asset write-offs and other scheduled restructuring activities. By August, we will have spent a cumulative total of $750 million in cash stranded costs. The total proceeds from the sales of underutilized assets are still projected to be around $1.5 billion, and we have already realized half of it from the sales of DigiCert and ID Analytics, fully funding the cash stranded costs. The other half is made up of various properties that we put up for sale. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, we had multiple offers for each of the building we own. While some contract negotiations have been slowed down, we are confident in our ability to monetize this asset in the near future. We believe that our bargaining position is enhanced by our strong balance sheet and cash position. By the end of the summer, our transition should be completed, officially done in 9 months, which is 3 months faster than initially planned. 
In fiscal year 2020, we sold the Enterprise business for $11 billion and rightsized our infrastructure functions to be leaner and nimbler, taking out $1.5 billion in annual run rate cost out. In fiscal year '21, it is all about the productivity of our product innovation and selling motions for our consumer business. We can now focus all of our attention and energy on developing great products, taking a platform approach through upselling various levels of membership and optimizing our marketing in an environment where consumers might be increasingly receptive to our products and services. 
We are passionate about our mission to protect people's online activities. We are building a leadership team that is dedicated to fulfilling that consumer needs, and you will hear more about our progress in the future. 
I will now pass the call over to my business partner, Samir, for more details on our product initiatives, selling motions and our position going into fiscal year '21."

A moment in history that I would say is bringing the world closer together despite the fact we have to stay physically apart. We are focusing on health and safety for our families, our friends and our communities. As cyber safety is at the forefront of this tidal wave of change, we're clearly seeing a [indiscernible] stay-at-home mode of life. We've seen new attacks focused on leveraging COVID-19 as a means to enable fraud and identity theft through tailored malware, phishing messages, online commerce scams and more. Hackers are preying on people's emotions, fear and panic to get them to click impulsively on various malicious links. We are seeing fake offers for masks and vaccines. We're seeing phishing e-mails purportedly coming from organizations like the World Health Organization and Center for Disease Control. Hackers are also targeting recipients of stimulus checks from various governments around the world. Instead of getting the help they're looking for, many consumers end up giving away personal identifiable information or downloading 
[Audio Gap]
Our mission is to keep customers aware as cyber safety has become more important than ever.  Households now spend more hours online, whether for school, work or in the community, protecting the home and family in a simple way is even more of a need. That's why we've strengthened our offering here. 
Norton Family brings the protection and security of our products to every member of the family across multiple devices and platforms. On top of that, we recently extended our time management capability for windows to include iOS and Android devices. With many kids spending more of their day on technology, the time management capability enables parents to 
[Audio Gap]
on the Internet, akin to an online time allowance. When kids reach their allowance limit, they have the ability to simply request additional time, for example, to finish an online learning activity. And parents can add more time to
[Audio Gap]
as part of our continued commitment to go beyond supervision and blocking to also provide tools, which help parents keep the online safety conversation going on with their children, which leads to a deeper understanding of how to be safe online. 
In addition to being a stand-alone product, Norton Family is also included as parental control in our Norton 360 membership. Norton 360 is our full cyber safety platform, bringing together end-to-end security, privacy, identity, home and family capabilities to provide the best safety coverage available to our members. Norton 360 is now available in 43 countries as we completed its global rollout during Q4. This had been a major undertaking, and I would like to thank all 
[Audio Gap]
transformative goal with precision, we can now focus on adding new areas of value to our 
[Audio Gap]
new ways. No other safety company has the reach and scale of Norton 360 to help as many consumers as we do. 
Rounding out our cyber 
[Audio Gap] 
the other 3 pillars of privacy, security and identity, here's a quick update on each of these areas. 
[Audio Gap] 
even more relevant in the current environment as people are exchanging more sensitive information through digital channels, be it personal health care information to enable telehealth or financial information for personal accounting or even shopping for food. A VPN or virtual private network has become even more crucial to help block hackers from stealing personal information over the Internet. VPN has included in most tiers of our Norton 360 members, and we're encouraging our members to use it more frequently to help prevent hackers from eavesdropping on their internet activity. 
While Norton is our flagship brand with end-to-end capabilities and premium positioning, we have another brand called Surf easy to extend our reach into the value segment of the privacy market. SurfEasy provides VPN protection for 5, devices unlimited bandwidth and ad tracker blocking technology for a very competitive price. We're currently marketing SurfEasy in the U.S., U.K. and India. As Vincent said earlier, growing our customer count is the #1 goal for our company, and we believe SurfEasy will be another way to bring in new customers within our product family. 
Security. Security is an integral part of the value we deliver for our members, and we have maintained consistent leadership in device security. During the quarter, we received 3 awards from the AV-TEST Institute for our device protection solutions. These included the Windows Home User Best Protection and Best Performance awards as well as the award for Best Android Protection. This represents NortonLifeLock's fifth consecutive best protection win for Norton Security. We are committed to building innovative to protect consumers' devices from ever-evolving cyber threats.
As people spend more time online to work and play in this environment, we believe securing devices is the foundation for security and will be more important than ever. Identity crossed a major milestone this last quarter with our first full-fledged LifeLock identity restoration suite to a country outside of the United States. Last agreement with a large international telecom service provider. That partner is TELUS, the second largest telecom company in Canada. Creating a safer, friendlier world online is one of TELUS' pillars, aligning our 2 companies together very closely. Similar to the social security number of the United States, Canada has the social insurance number, which is the government's unique identifier for Canadian residents. It is used as a proof of identity for any and all types of credit, health insurance and education, amongst other things. This considers the most important piece of personal identifiable information in Canada and, therefore, highly targeted by hackers. TELUS launched our Norton 360 with LifeLock in April, and we're looking forward to bringing the same level of protection and restoration capabilities to Canadians that our American customers have enjoyed for over a decade. Canada is a nascent market where identity theft protection products have not existed before. Currently, the market has been limited to just credit scores and alerts, which are small features of an overall protection plan. We believe that Canada will grow to be an important market for us over time, akin to the U.S. years ago. It will take some time to educate the market about the benefits of identity protection. 
Partners like telcos, employee benefits, retailers and e-tailers are all an important part of our go-to-market strategy, and we continue to work to bring our products to more and more partners and their customers. Working with our partners helps broaden our audience, combine our capabilities and reach consumers closer to where they need cyber safety. Look out for more from us in this area in the near future. 
In the fourth quarter, average revenue per user, or ARPU, increased to $9.07 per month, up 1% sequentially and up 3% year-over-year. We also had another quarter of customer increase, adding 46,000 in the quarter. For the whole year, our retention rate was stable at 85%. These metrics demonstrate that customers appreciate the value we are providing. We have more enhancements with our membership programs for the future, and we look forward to updating you in coming quarters about our robust R&D pipeline of products. 
Let me now turn the call over to Matt to discuss the Q4 actual results in more detail."
35000,663837177,1986834,"NortonLifeLock Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, May 14, 2020",2020-05-14,"Earnings Calls","Gen Digital Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Samir. Let me review our Q4 results in a bit more detail. Q4 revenue was better than expected at $614 million. And revenue, excluding ID Analytics, which was sold on January 31, was $610 million, up 1% year-over-year in constant currency. Q4 repor",1070,"Thanks, Samir. Let me review our Q4 results in a bit more detail. Q4 revenue was better than expected at $614 million. And revenue, excluding ID Analytics, which was sold on January 31, was $610 million, up 1% year-over-year in constant currency. Q4 reported billings, excluding ID Analytics, was up 3% year-over-year despite the FX headwinds, which reduced ending contract liabilities on our balance sheet. The reported billings growth was supported by our second consecutive quarter of net customer adds, adding 46,000 customers in Q4, along with a steady customer retention rate at 85% for the year. Diluted EPS was $0.26, up 63% year-over-year and exceeded our guidance range, driven by strong execution and better-than-expected stranded costs in our P&L.
As we stated in our prior quarter earnings calls, during this transition period, our reported cost structure will be complex and burdened with stranded costs. However, this is becoming less so as we progress through our accelerated transition. We expect Q1 to be the last quarter with significant transition-related moving pieces in our financials. In Q4, total company operating margin from continuing operations was burdened by approximately $60 million in stranded costs and reached 41.5% compared to 27.2% in the year ago period, an increase of more than 14 points, and 36.2% in the prior quarter. Our execution on eliminating stranded costs is evidenced by the steady operating margin growth, and we're well on our way to achieving the 50% post-transition operating margin for the total company. In addition, we continue to service and reduce our TSAs, and eliminate the positions that were linked to stranded activities. 
In Q4, ending headcount was down to approximately 3,700 employees. And as Vincent mentioned, we finished substantially all remaining notifications at the end of April. Notified employees will remain on our books through Q1 in accordance with country-specific notice periods, such as Warren in the U.S. But operationally, we are now running the business with approximately 2,500 employees, achieving the long-term model we targeted when we sold the Enterprise business well ahead of schedule. 
On the topic of cash, and as we mentioned to you in last quarter's earnings call, Q4 cash flow from operating activities includes large onetime payments for divestiture-related tax amounts. And as a result of these payments as well as net cash outflows from stranded costs, our cash flow from operating activities in Q4 was materially negative as planned. However, absent the onetime payments and stranded costs, our business is operating in line with our long-term model of approximately $900 million in free cash flow on an annual basis. We ended the fourth quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.3 billion, giving us plenty of flexibility, driving our business for growth. 
This past quarter, we continued to return significant amounts of capital to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. We repurchased 29 million shares in the quarter for a total of $658 million, and we've utilized $1 billion, thus far, of the $1.6 billion share buyback authorization. In addition, we cash settled the principal and conversion rights of a $250 million convertible note, which lowered our overall debt level and reduced our diluted share count. We paid our regular dividend of $0.125 per share this quarter, and we remain committed to paying our annual dividend of $0.50 per share. 
And last, but certainly not least, we made good on our commitment to return 100% of the after-tax proceeds from the sale of the Enterprise business via the $12 per share special dividend at the end of January. 
I'd like to now spend a couple of minutes discussing how we're positioned amid the economic uncertainty caused by the recent COVID-19 crisis. In the early days of the COVID-19 crisis, we paused our share buyback with approximately $600 million left on the authorization to be flexible with any challenges and opportunities that may arise in the new economic environment. This was a prudent approach as our excess cash capacity affords us greater flexibility. However, we remain open to a number of options and plan to resume our buyback program opportunistically. 
Another impact of the COVID-19 crisis is the delay in the sales of our underutilized real estate assets as some potential buyers take a slower approach. However, we believe it is a temporary delay and remain confident we will be able to move forward with the sales in a reasonable time frame. Importantly, this slowdown does not impact our ability to achieve the post-transition operating margin outlook. And more importantly, we are not relying on that cash to run the business. As Vincent mentioned, the vast majority of our business is direct to our highly recurring diverse subscriber base. The ratable nature of our business helps minimize disruption in our financials from short-term economic headwinds. In addition, our balance sheet is strong with $2.3 billion in cash and short-term investments as of Q4 as well as access to our undrawn $1 billion revolver. And we have a capital-efficient model reflected in our low CapEx spending. We spent just $3 million in Q4 and expect our annual CapEx should be approximately $40 million, with depreciation expense to be in the range of our CapEx spending going forward. In addition, the maturities of our outstanding debt extend well into the future. Our $750 million senior note that's due in September is being replaced by the $750 million delayed draw term loan that we structured back in November and pushes that maturity out to fiscal year 2025. The next debt maturities don't occur until almost 2 years from now. In addition, we are well within our covenant limits. We ran a series of downturn scenarios to stress test the business. Even under severe downturn sensitivity scenarios, we have sufficient room in our financial covenants as well as minimum cash flow needed to operate the business and protect our regular cash dividend. For example, our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA would have to drop by almost 40% before triggering any issues with our covenants at the current debt levels. So we feel very good about our liquidity and capital structure. 
To recap, I'm very pleased with how we executed. We turned in a strong financial performance this quarter, delivering revenue and EPS growth, reducing debt, lowering our share count, accelerating our transition and maintaining strong liquidity heading into the COVID-19 economic environment. 
Let me now turn the call back to Vincent to provide our Q1 outlook."

Let me now provide our Q1 outlook and also discuss our long-term growth strategy for NortonLifeLock. 
March trends continued into April. Quarter-to-date, we generated slightly positive customer net adds and/or mid-single-digit booking growth overall. Direct to consumers booking grew high single digits in April as people continue to adapt to life working from home. This growth was partially offset by decline in our retail sales, impacting our overall indirect partner sales. Maintaining this net positive trend, we expect revenue in the range of $590 million to $605 million or 0% to 2% growth when normalizing for IDA and the extra week in Q1 fiscal year '20. This revenue outlook is supported by bookings growth in the low to mid single-digit range. 
We expect Q1 non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.18 to $0.22 per share with the business operating at approximately 50% profit margin when excluding the stranded cost as stranded activities are expected to be fully eliminated by August, although we will write-off additional assets in Q1 with the goal to be over 90% done by the end of June. 
In fiscal year '20, we returned to previous marketing investment levels, primarily targeted at direct acquisition programs. And we will continue to invest in our distribution and product road map for long-term impact. While these initiatives take time to generate revenue, we are very encouraged to see 3 consecutive quarter of low to mid-single-digit bookings growth year-over-year. 
I also said that while we have a fantastic opportunity to define a simple and reliable path to cyber safety, it won't be a linear road by any means. Certainly, no one could have anticipated the world to go into a full lockdown only a month after we last gave guidance. While we will be cautious and agile in managing our business, our mission to protect and safely enable customer digital lives is more relevant than ever. 
And with that, Matt, Samir and I are now happy to take any questions. Operator?"

So let me first go back at the core. As we develop the cyber safety membership, Norton 360, we have underlying growth drivers, which is that more and more consumers are driving their operations, their lives online, and they want to do that in a safe environment. We have, since we became NortonLifelock in November, reinvested marketing to make our products known out there. We had launched Norton 360 at the beginning of this fiscal year, as you know, and we pushed that rollout through. We are on a steady path, if you want, turning a situation where we had a declining customer count into bringing more and more new customers. It was passed through the quarter. We saw in the month of March, more demand and slower conversion or realization of that increased demand. We saw that through the month of April. And obviously, you can understand that all of the activities from working from home, not wanting to go into the shopping malls and all of those things, have only increased the need for better protection online. As you mentioned, that was offset partially by the fact that at physical stores, we couldn't go and buy a token or one of our products, but that was a mild offset. So we're encouraged by the trends. It will be a long-term trend. We believe that will continue, which is more people will work from home, will live their live online and will need our products."

We have great operational teams driving each 1 of those 3 areas and driving for growth.

Behind that, it is the marketing investment, it's the Net Promoter Scores and the customer satisfaction, and we're driving that. If you see our retention, it has improved in each one of the cohort by tenure. But you know that the first year tenure is a lower retention and then an increase as they see into our portfolio.

And so as we've sort of been consistent in this message over the last couple of quarters, our reporting structure is complex. The stranded costs show up in different areas of the P&L depending on the types of activities. And so for that reason, though, we expect these activities to come to a close, they may be impacting a different area of the P&L. 
Having said that, our core business, we expect to operate at that 50% operating margin that we've discussed and have continued to discuss. And so we will, of course, make it clear next quarter when we report where those stranded costs showed up, but that is the reason for the guide of $0.18 to $0.22."

We also went back to what happened in 2008, look at the retention rate during that time. And actually, it was pretty resilient and sustainable even then. Now every environment or every crisis is unique, and this one brings something that is very different. It changes the way we operate our lives. I changed the way we work. It changes the way we interact, the way we shop. And I think there is an underlying acceleration of the need for more privacy, more security online. That's why you see companies like Logitech selling more video conferencing systems, and us with that selling more security products. And I think the trends of having more awareness of few lives moving online is a structural trend. Now it may be impacting in the short term here and there by different economic headwind, but I think we're well positioned from that. 
And we have the perfect solution, launching last year the Norton 360 membership, we saw an acceleration of the adoption rate through the last [ 2 ] quarters, and we're pretty pleased by that."

As a reminder, in connection with the sale of certain assets for our Enterprise Security business to Broadcom on November 4, 2019, we changed our corporate name from Symantec to NortonLifeLock. The results of our Enterprise Security business were classified as discontinued operations in our condensed consolidated statement of operations and thus, excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented.  
Starting in the second quarter of fiscal '20, we operate in 1 reportable segment. Revenues and associated costs of our ID Analytics solutions, which were formerly included in the Enterprise Security segment, are now included in our remaining reportable segment. On January 31, 2020, we completed the sale of our ID Analytics solutions.  
I'd like to remind everyone that all references to final metrics are non-GAAP, unless otherwise stated. Please refer to the supplemental materials posted on the Investor Relations website for further definitions of our non-GAAP metrics. 
Please note, non-GAAP financial measures referenced during this call are reconciled to their comparable GAAP financial measures in the press release and supplemental materials posted on our website. We believe our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating performance for reasons discussed below. Our management team uses these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our operating results as well as when planning and forecasting future periods. We believe our non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate comparisons of our performance to prior periods and that investors benefit from understanding our non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental and should not be considered as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP.  
Today's call contains forward-looking statements based on conditions we currently see. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the current date, and as such, involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. In particular, our statements regarding the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business and industry, our sale of our Enterprise Security assets to Broadcom, any anticipated benefits from such sale and cost reductions associated with this transaction are subject to a variety of risks. Please refer to the cautionary statement in our press release for more information. You will also find a detailed discussion of our risk factors in our filings with the SEC and, in particular, our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 29, 2019, and recently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.

I want to start this call by thanking all our employees, as I know many of you are listening. Each of you has persevered in driving our mission and supporting our customers while working from home and adjusting to this new reality. Our mission is to protect people's online activities, which has never been more relevant than today. And on behalf of all our employees, I also want to thank our customers for the trust you have placed in our products and in us. Our business is built around prevention, detection and restoration of potential damages caused by hackers. Managing and handling crisis is part of our DNA, and the entire NortonLifeLock team is rising to the occasion, adapting ourselves and our processes to help customers in need as well as communities by donating time and resources. There is no other company I would rather be part of as we navigate the challenges that the world is currently facing.  
We are pleased to report better-than-expected results in Q4, the second quarter of NortonLifeLock as a stand-alone company. Consumer revenue was up 1% year-over-year in constant currency, supported by bookings growth of 4%. We generated $0.26 EPS, up $0.10 from a year ago, driven by strong execution and the elimination of stranded costs. In addition to year-over-year bookings growth of mid-single digits, we increased net customer count by 46,000 sequentially. We grew average revenue per users. We delivered industry-leading retention while maintaining our operating profit margin over 51% when you exclude the impact of stranded costs. This was our second sequential quarter of net customer growth, adding over 100,000 customers in the last 6 months. 
For the first time since 2014, we've had 2 consecutive quarters of net adds. Through the quarter, we saw a steady performance with a strong finish in the month of March. However, we're still in stabilization phase, especially in this current environment. The business is moving in the right direction, and we believe that our focused execution will deliver consistent, sustainable growth over time. The need for our products is more present than ever, driven by working from home, virtual meetings, online gaming, streaming, e-shopping, telemedicine and numerous other online transactions and interactions that put us all at risk from cyber criminals, looking to take advantage of this accelerated trend.  
As Samir will remind us all in a moment, our portfolio does a tremendous job protecting people from online threat, but it is not a static world. As the threats evolve with our behaviors and technology, we are focused on delivering a portfolio that protects each element of our customers' digital lives. That is our mission. And we will know that we are succeeding when these added products and features consistently deliver customer count growth. That is why it is our #1 measure of success.  
Let me mention a few of these highlights now. This quarter, we expanded our family offering. We offered free usage during the COVID-19 crisis. We received 3 awards from AV-TEST Institute for our device protection solutions, and we made numerous other improvements to our platform and products. In April, we expanded our international reach and capabilities with the launch of Norton 360 with LifeLock in Canada. We have a long history of innovation here at NortonLifelock, and we know that product innovation will be a cornerstone of our long-term success.  
Our fourth quarter performance not only reflects the strong execution of our team, but also demonstrate the resiliency and opportunity of our business model. We sell direct to consumers with minimal reliance on physical partners, delivering high-value at a relatively low ARPU, plus over 95% of our business is recurring.  
Considering these challenging times and the various requests from our investors, let me expand on each of these points, starting with recurring revenue. 90% of our revenue is direct to consumers. The vast majority of our bookings are annual subscriptions, which are paid upfront, while revenue is recognized ratably each quarter. Our indirect revenue, about 10% of our total, is also half recurring. Partners like telecom carriers and employee benefit providers pay us every month as they provide our products to their customer base. On the first day of the quarter, we have visibility on over 70% of our revenue coming off our balance sheet, and as I mentioned, over 95% of our total revenue is recurring.  
Secondly, we have minimal reliance on physical retail or OEM partners. The bookings generated by these channels represent about 5% of our total bookings and the revenues included in the indirect part of our business. This 5% might be impacted by a prolonged health crisis, and we will be conservative with our forecasting. However, we do not believe travel restrictions or supply chain disruptions have much impact on our distribution capabilities overall.  
Lastly, and most importantly, we are providing tremendous and relevant value for a monthly ARPU of $9. During this environment when consumers are spending almost all of their time at home and online, we're providing a round-the-clock protection for our members. We've all heard about increasing instances of online criminal activity. In April, our restoration team already started handling the first cases of identity theft related to COVID-19 subsidy payments. The opportunity for cyber crime has substantially increased, and we know that Norton 360 is helping our customers manage their online activities with more confidence knowing that Norton 360 is keeping them safe.  
In the back half of Q4 and during the month of April, we have seen this customer confidence in our products reflected in solid renewal rates and new bookings. So our mission to protect everyone's digital life is more relevant than ever. And our business and financial model is as resilient as any in these uncertain times.  
Now our balance sheet and cash position are equally strong. At the end of the quarter, after dividend payments and buyback, our cash balance was $2.3 billion. As a result of refinancing actions taken in Q3, we have addressed all debt maturities until the end of fiscal year 2022. Our various stress tests show that we are well capitalized with strong liquidity and plenty of financial flexibility to strategically invest in our business, make interest payments and continue to return cash to our shareholders. Our balance sheet and capital structure give us optionality to make accretive stocking acquisitions, return further capital through buybacks or both. Matt will provide you with more details about the financial and the liquidity strength in his section.  
So what about the stranded costs, you might ask. Well, if I only talk about it now, it is because I consider the transition to be almost done with all decisions made to cross the finish line in August. We've run our transition to a pure-play consumer company at a rapid and decisive pace. 
As I stand in front of you today on May 14, essentially all transitions have been serviced and closed. All stranded job elimination notifications have been made, and our operational head count today is around 2,500. Q1 and the beginning of Q2 will reflect the last asset write-offs and other scheduled restructuring activities. By August, we will have spent a cumulative total of $750 million in cash stranded costs. The total proceeds from the sales of underutilized assets are still projected to be around $1.5 billion, and we have already realized half of it from the sales of DigiCert and ID Analytics, fully funding the cash stranded costs. The other half is made up of various properties that we put up for sale. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, we had multiple offers for each of the building we own. While some contract negotiations have been slowed down, we are confident in our ability to monetize this asset in the near future. We believe that our bargaining position is enhanced by our strong balance sheet and cash position. By the end of the summer, our transition should be completed, officially done in 9 months, which is 3 months faster than initially planned.  
In fiscal year 2020, we sold the Enterprise business for $11 billion and rightsized the infrastructure functions to be leaner and nimbler, taking out $1.5 billion in annual run rate cost out. In fiscal year '21, it is all about the productivity of our product innovation and selling motions for our consumer business. We can now focus all of our attention and energy on developing great products, taking a platform approach through upselling various levels of membership and optimizing our marketing in an environment where consumers might be increasingly receptive to our products and services.  
We are passionate about our mission to protect people's online activities. We are building a leadership team that is dedicated to fulfilling that consumer needs, and you will hear more about our progress in the future.  
I will now pass the call over to my business partner, Samir, for more details on our product initiatives, selling motions and our position going into fiscal year '21."

We're living through a generational event. A moment in history that I would say is bringing the world closer together despite the fact we have to stay physically apart.

A moment in history that I would say is bringing the world closer together despite the fact we have to stay physically apart. We have quickly evolved to a common purpose of focusing on health and safety for our families, our friends and our communities. 
As cyber safety is at the forefront of this tidal wave of change, we're clearly seeing a rise in attackers taking advantage of the stay-at-home mode of life. We've seen new attacks focused on leveraging COVID-19 as a means to enable fraud and identity theft through tailored malware, phishing messages, online commerce scams and more. Hackers are preying on people's emotions, fear and panic to get them to click impulsively on various malicious links. We are seeing fake offers for masks and vaccines. We're seeing phishing e-mails purportedly coming from organizations like the World Health Organization and Center for Disease Control. Hackers are also targeting recipients of stimulus checks from various governments around the world. Instead of getting the help they're looking for, many consumers end up giving away personal identifiable information or downloading malware on their devices. 
Our mission is to keep customers aware as cyber safety has become more important than ever. As all households now spend more hours online, whether for school, work or in the community, protecting the home and family in a simple way is even more of a need. That's why we've strengthened our offering here. 
Norton Family brings the protection and security of our products to every member of the family across multiple devices and platforms. On top of that, we recently extended our time management capability for windows to include iOS and Android devices. With many kids spending more of their day on technology, the time management capability enables parents to easily manage the duration their children are on the Internet, akin to an online time allowance. When kids reach their allowance limit, they have the ability to simply request additional time, for example, to finish an online learning activity, and parents can add more time to their balance. Time extension is part of our continued commitment to go beyond supervision and blocking to also provide tools, which help parents keep the online safety conversation going on with their children, which leads to a deeper understanding of how to be safe online. 
In addition to being a stand-alone product, Norton Family is also included as parental control in our Norton 360 membership. Norton 360 is our full cyber safety platform, bringing together end-to-end security, privacy, identity, home and family capabilities to provide the best safety coverage available to our members. Norton 360 is now available in 43 countries as we completed its global rollout during Q4. This had been a major undertaking, and I would like to thank all of our team for accomplishing this transformative goal with precision in execution time. We can now focus on adding new areas of value to our membership and delighting our customers in new ways. No other safety company has the reach and scale of Norton 360 to help as many consumers as we do. 
Rounding out our cyber safety portfolio with the other 3 pillars of privacy, security and identity, here's a quick update on each of these areas. Our privacy offering has become even more relevant in the current environment as people are exchanging more sensitive information through digital channels, be it personal health care information to enable telehealth or financial information for personal accounting or even shopping for food. A VPN, or virtual private network, has become even more crucial. A VPN uses encryption to help block hackers from stealing personal information over the Internet. VPN has included in most tiers of our Norton 360 membership, and we're encouraging our members to use it more frequently to help prevent hackers from eavesdropping on their internet activity. 
While Norton is our flagship brand with end-to-end capabilities and premium positioning, we also started marketing another brand called SurfEasy to extend our reach into the value segment of the privacy market. SurfEasy provides VPN protection for 5 devices, unlimited bandwidth and ad tracker blocking technology for a very competitive price. We're currently marketing SurfEasy in the U.S., U.K. and India. As Vincent said earlier, growing our customer count is the #1 goal for our company, and we believe SurfEasy will be another way to bring in new customers within our product family. 
Security. Security is an integral part of the value we deliver for our members, and we have maintained consistent leadership in device security. During the quarter, we received 3 awards from the AV-TEST Institute for our device protection solutions. These included the Windows Home User Best Protection and Best Performance awards as well as the award for Best Android Protection. This represents NortonLifeLock's fifth consecutive Best Protection win for Norton Security. We are committed to building innovative technology that helps protect consumers' devices from ever-evolving cyber threats.
As people spend more time online to work and play in this environment, we believe securing devices is the foundation for security and will be more important than ever. Identity crossed a major milestone this last quarter with our first full-fledged LifeLock identity restoration suite to a country outside of the United States. Last quarter, we mentioned that we signed a partnership agreement with a large international telecom service provider. That partner is TELUS, the second largest telecom company in Canada. Creating a safer, friendlier world online is one of TELUS' pillars, aligning our 2 companies together very closely. 
Similar to the social security number of the United States, Canada has the social insurance number, which is the government's unique identifier for Canadian residents. It is used as a proof of identity for any and all types of credit, health insurance and education, amongst other things. This considers the most important piece of personal identifiable information in Canada and, therefore, highly targeted by hackers. TELUS launched our Norton 360 with LifeLock in April, and we're looking forward to bringing the same level of protection and restoration capabilities to Canadians that our American customers have enjoyed for over a decade. Canada is a nascent market where identity theft protection products have not existed before. Currently, the market has been limited to just credit scores and alerts, which are a small features of an overall protection plan. We believe that Canada will grow to be an important market for us over time, akin to the U.S. years ago. It will take some time to educate the market about the benefits of identity protection. 
Partners like telcos, employee benefits, retailers and e-tailers are all an important part of our go-to-market strategy, and we continue to work to bring our products to more and more partners and their customers. Working with our partners helps broaden our audience, combine our capabilities and reach consumers closer to where they need cyber safety. Look out for more from us in this area in the near future. 
In the fourth quarter, average revenue per user, or ARPU, increased to $9.07 per month, up 1% sequentially and up 3% year-over-year. We also had another quarter of customer increase, adding 46,000 in the quarter. For the whole year, our retention rate was stable at 85%. These metrics demonstrate that customers appreciate the value we are providing. We have more enhancements with our membership programs for the future, and we look forward to updating you in coming quarters about our robust R&D pipeline of products. 
Let me now turn the call over to Matt to discuss the Q4 actual results in more detail."
35000,663837177,1987010,"NortonLifeLock Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, May 14, 2020",2020-05-14,"Earnings Calls","Gen Digital Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Samir. Let me review our Q4 results in a bit more detail, focusing on non-GAAP results. Q4 revenue was better than expected at $614 million. And revenue, excluding ID Analytics, which was sold on January 31, was $610 million, up 1% year-over-year",1075,"Thanks, Samir. Let me review our Q4 results in a bit more detail, focusing on non-GAAP results. Q4 revenue was better than expected at $614 million. And revenue, excluding ID Analytics, which was sold on January 31, was $610 million, up 1% year-over-year in constant currency. Q4 reported billings, excluding ID Analytics, was up 3% year-over-year despite the FX headwinds, which reduced ending contract liabilities on our balance sheet. The reported billings growth was supported by our second consecutive quarter of net customer adds, adding 46,000 customers in Q4, along with a steady customer retention rate at 85% for the year. Diluted EPS was $0.26, up 63% year-over-year and exceeded our guidance range, driven by strong execution and better-than-expected stranded costs in our P&L.
As we stated in our prior quarter earnings calls, during this transition period, our reported cost structure will be complex and burdened with stranded costs. However, this is becoming less so as we progress through our accelerated transition. We expect Q1 to be the last quarter with significant transition-related moving pieces in our financials. In Q4, total company operating margin from continuing operations was burdened by approximately $60 million in stranded costs and reached 41.5% compared to 27.2% in the year ago period, an increase of more than 14 points, and 36.2% in the prior quarter. Our execution on eliminating stranded costs is evidenced by the steady operating margin growth, and we're well on our way to achieving the 50% post-transition operating margin for the total company. In addition, we continue to service and reduce our TSAs, and eliminate the positions that were linked to stranded activities. 
In Q4, ending head count was down to approximately 3,700 employees. And as Vincent mentioned, we finished substantially all remaining notifications at the end of April. Notified employees will remain on our books through Q1 in accordance with country-specific notice periods, such as one in the U.S. But operationally, we are now running the business with approximately 2,500 employees, achieving the long-term model we targeted when we sold the Enterprise business well ahead of schedule. 
On the topic of cash, and as we mentioned to you in last quarter's earnings call, Q4 cash flow from operating activities includes large onetime payments for divestiture-related tax amounts. And as a result of these payments as well as net cash outflows from stranded costs, our cash flow from operating activities in Q4 was materially negative as planned. However, absent the onetime payments and stranded costs, our business is operating in line with our long-term model of approximately $900 million in free cash flow on an annual basis. We ended the fourth quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.3 billion, giving us plenty of flexibility, driving our business for growth. 
This past quarter, we continued to return significant amounts of capital to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. We repurchased 29 million shares in the quarter for a total of $658 million, and we've utilized $1 billion, thus far, of the $1.6 billion share buyback authorization. In addition, we cash settled the principal and conversion rights of a $250 million convertible note, which lowered our overall debt level and reduced our diluted share count. We paid our regular dividend of $0.125 per share this quarter, and we remain committed to paying our annual dividend of $0.50 per share. And last, but certainly not least, we made good on our commitment to return 100% of the after-tax proceeds from the sale of the Enterprise business via the $12 per share special dividend at the end of January. 
I'd like to now spend a couple of minutes discussing how we're positioned amid the economic uncertainty caused by the recent COVID-19 crisis. In the early days of the COVID-19 crisis, we paused our share buyback with approximately $600 million left on the authorization to be flexible with any challenges and opportunities that may arise in the new economic environment. This was a prudent approach as our excess cash capacity affords us greater flexibility. However, we remain open to a number of options and plan to resume our buyback program opportunistically. 
Another impact of the COVID-19 crisis is the delay in the sales of our underutilized real estate assets as some potential buyers take a slower approach. However, we believe it is a temporary delay and remain confident we will be able to move forward with the sales in a reasonable time frame. Importantly, this slowdown does not impact our ability to achieve the post-transition operating margin outlook. And more importantly, we are not relying on that cash to run the business. 
As Vincent mentioned, the vast majority of our business is direct to our highly recurring diverse subscriber base. The ratable nature of our business helps minimize disruption in our financials from short-term economic headwinds. In addition, our balance sheet is strong with $2.3 billion in cash and short-term investments as of Q4 as well as access to our undrawn $1 billion revolver. And we have a capital-efficient model reflected in our low CapEx spending. We spent just $3 million in Q4 and expect our annual CapEx should be approximately $40 million, with depreciation expense to be in the range of our CapEx spending going forward. In addition, the maturities of our outstanding debt extend well into the future. Our $750 million senior note that's due in September is being replaced by the $750 million delayed draw term loan that we structured back in November and pushes that maturity out to fiscal year 2025. The next debt maturities don't occur until almost 2 years from now. In addition, we are well within our covenant limits. We ran a series of downturn scenarios to stress test the business. 
Even under severe downturn sensitivity scenarios, we have sufficient room in our financial covenants as well as minimum cash flow needed to operate the business and protect our regular cash dividend. For example, our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA would have to drop by almost 40% before triggering any issues with our covenants at the current debt levels. So we feel very good about our liquidity and capital structure. 
To recap, I'm very pleased with how we executed. We turned in a strong financial performance this quarter, delivering revenue and EPS growth, reducing debt, lowering our share count, accelerating our transition and maintaining strong liquidity heading into the COVID-19 economic environment. 
Let me now turn the call back to Vincent to provide our Q1 outlook."
35000,663837177,1987010,"NortonLifeLock Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, May 14, 2020",2020-05-14,"Earnings Calls","Gen Digital Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Matt.

Let me now provide our Q1 outlook and also discuss our long-term growth strategy for NortonLifeLock. 
March trends continued into April. Quarter-to-date, we generated slightly positive customer net adds and almost mid-single-digit booking growth overall. Direct-to-consumers booking grew high single digit in April as people continue to adapt to life working from home. This growth was partially offset by decline in our retail sales, impacting our overall indirect partner sales. Maintaining this net positive trend, we expect revenue in the range of $590 million to $605 million or 0% to 2% growth when normalizing for IDA and the extra week in Q1 fiscal year '20. This revenue outlook is supported by bookings growth in the low to mid-single-digit range. 
We expect Q1 non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.18 to $0.22 per share with the business operating at approximately 50% profit margin when excluding the stranded cost. As stranded activities are expected to be fully eliminated by August, although we will write off additional assets in Q1 with the goal to be over 90% done by the end of June. 
In fiscal year '20, we returned to previous marketing investment levels, primarily targeted at direct acquisition programs. And we will continue to invest in our distribution and product road map for long-term impact. While these initiatives take time to generate revenue, we are very encouraged to see 3 consecutive quarter of low to mid-single-digit bookings growth year-over-year. 
I also said that while we have a fantastic opportunity to define a simple and reliable path to cyber safety, it won't be a linear road by any means. Certainly, no one could have anticipated the world to go into a full lockdown only a month after we last gave guidance. While we will be cautious and agile in managing our business, our mission to protect and safely enable customer digital lives is more relevant than ever. 
And with that, Matt, Samir and I are now happy to take any questions. Operator?"

So let me first go back at the core. As we develop the cyber safety membership, Norton 360, we have underlying growth drivers, which is that more and more consumers are driving their operations, their lives online, and they want to do that in a safe environment. We have, since we became NortonLifelock in November, reinvested in marketing to make our products known out there. We had launched Norton 360 at the beginning of this fiscal year, as you know, and we pushed that rollout through. We were on a steady path, if you want, turning a situation where we had a declining customer count into bringing more and more new customers. It was passed through the quarter. We saw in the month of March, more demand and slow conversion or realization of that increased demand. We saw that through the month of April. And obviously, you can understand that all of the activities from working from home, not wanting to go into the shopping malls and all of those things, have only increased the need for better protection online. As you mentioned, that was offset partially by the fact that at physical stores, we couldn't go and buy a token or one of our products, but that was a mild offset. So we're encouraged by the trends. It will be a long-term trend. We believe that will continue, which is more people will work from home, will live their life online and will need our products."

But as they come to a close, they will impact different areas of the P&L in different quarters, depending on the types of activities and how they end. And so as we've sort of been consistent in this message over the last couple of quarters, our reporting structure is complex. The stranded costs show up in different areas of the P&L depending on the types of activities. And so for that reason, though, we expect these activities to come to a close, they may be impacting a different area of the P&L. 
Having said that, our core business, we expect to operate at that 50% operating margin that we've discussed and have continued to discuss. And so we will, of course, make it clear next quarter when we report where those stranded costs showed up, but that is the reason for the guide of $0.18 to $0.22."

We also went back to what happened in 2008, look at the retention rate during that time. And actually, it was pretty resilient and sustainable even then. Now every environment or every crisis is unique, and this one brings something that is very different. It changes the way we operate our lives. It changes the way we work. It changes the way we interact, the way we shop. And I think there is an underlying acceleration of the need for more privacy, more security online. That's why you see companies like Logitech selling more video conferencing systems, and us with that selling more security products. And I think the trends of having more awareness of few lives moving online is a structural trend. Now it may be impacting in the short term here and there by different economic headwind, but I think we're well positioned from that. 
And we have the perfect solution, launching last year the Norton 360 membership, we saw an acceleration of the adoption rate through the last 2 quarters, and we're pretty pleased by that."

As a reminder, in connection with the sale of certain assets for our Enterprise Security business to Broadcom on November 4, 2019, we changed our corporate name from Symantec to NortonLifeLock. The results of our Enterprise Security business were classified as discontinued operations in our condensed consolidated statement of operations and thus, excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented.  
Starting in the second quarter of fiscal '20, we operate in 1 reportable segment. Revenues and associated costs of our ID Analytics solutions, which were formerly included in the Enterprise Security segment, are now included in our remaining reportable segment. On January 31, 2020, we completed the sale of our ID Analytics solutions.  
I'd like to remind everyone that all references to final metrics are non-GAAP, unless otherwise stated. Please refer to the supplemental materials posted on the Investor Relations website for further definitions of our non-GAAP metrics. 
Please note, non-GAAP financial measures referenced during this call are reconciled to their comparable GAAP financial measures in the press release and supplemental materials posted on our website. We believe our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating performance for reasons discussed below. Our management team uses these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our operating results as well as when planning and forecasting future periods. We believe our non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate comparisons of our performance to prior periods and that investors benefit from understanding our non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental and should not be considered as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP.  
Today's call contains forward-looking statements based on conditions we currently see. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the current date, and as such, involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. In particular, our statements regarding the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business and industry, our sale of our Enterprise Security assets to Broadcom, any anticipated benefits from such sale and cost reductions associated with this transaction are subject to a variety of risks. Please refer to the cautionary statement in our press release for more information. You will also find a detailed discussion of our risk factors in our filings with the SEC and in particular, our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 29, 2019, and recently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.

We generated $0.26 EPS, up $0.10 from a year ago, driven by strong execution and the elimination of stranded costs. In addition to year-over-year bookings growth of mid-single digits, we increased net customer count by 46,000 sequentially. We grew average revenue per users. We delivered industry-leading retention while maintaining our operating profit margin over 51% when you exclude the impact of stranded costs. This was our second sequential quarter of net customer growth, adding over 100,000 customers in the last 6 months. 
For the first time since 2014, we've had 2 consecutive quarters of net adds. Through the quarter, we saw a steady performance with a strong finish in the month of March. However, we're still in stabilization phase, especially in this current environment. The business is moving in the right direction, and we believe that our focused execution will deliver consistent, sustainable growth over time. The need for our products is more present than ever, driven by working from home, virtual meetings, online gaming, streaming, e-shopping, telemedicine and numerous other online transactions and interactions that put us all at risk from cyber criminals, looking to take advantage of this accelerated trend.  
As Samir will remind us all in a moment, our portfolio does a tremendous job protecting people from online threat, but it is not a static world. As the threats evolve with our behaviors and technology, we are focused on delivering a portfolio that protects each element of our customers' digital lives. That is our mission. And we will know that we are succeeding when these added products and features consistently deliver customer count growth. That is why it is our #1 measure of success.  
Let me mention a few of these highlights now. This quarter, we expanded our family offering. We offered free usage during the COVID-19 crisis. We received 3 awards from AV-TEST Institute for our device protection solutions, and we made numerous other improvements to our platform and products. In April, we expanded our international reach and capabilities with the launch of Norton 360 with LifeLock in Canada. We have a long history of innovation here at NortonLifelock, and we know that product innovation will be a cornerstone of our long-term success.  
Our fourth quarter performance not only reflects the strong execution of our team, but also demonstrate the resiliency and opportunity of our business model. We sell direct to consumers with minimal reliance on physical partners, delivering high-value at a relatively low ARPU, plus over 95% of our business is recurring.  
Considering these challenging times and the various requests from our investors, let me expand on each of these points, starting with recurring revenue. 90% of our revenue is direct to consumers. The vast majority of our bookings are annual subscriptions, which are paid upfront, while revenue is recognized ratably each quarter. Our indirect revenue, about 10% of our total, is also half recurring. Partners like telecom carriers and employee benefit providers pay us every month as they provide our products to their customer base. On the first day of the quarter, we have visibility on over 70% of our revenue coming off our balance sheet, and as I mentioned, over 95% of our total revenue is recurring.  
Secondly, we have minimal reliance on physical retail or OEM partners. The bookings generated by these channels represent about 5% of our total bookings and the revenues included in the indirect part of our business. This 5% might be impacted by a prolonged health crisis, and we will be conservative with our forecasting. However, we do not believe travel restrictions or supply chain disruptions have much impact on our distribution capabilities overall.  
Lastly, and most importantly, we are providing tremendous and relevant value for a monthly ARPU of $9. During this environment when consumers are spending almost all of their time at home and online, we're providing a round-the-clock protection for our members. We've all heard about increasing instances of online criminal activity. In April, our restoration team already started handling the first cases of identity theft related to COVID-19 subsidy payments. The opportunity for cyber crime has substantially increased, and we know that Norton 360 is helping our customers manage their online activities with more confidence knowing that Norton 360 is keeping them safe.  
In the back half of Q4 and during the month of April, we have seen this customer confidence in our products reflected in solid renewal rates and new bookings. So our mission to protect everyone's digital life is more relevant than ever. And our business and financial model is as resilient as any in these uncertain times.  
Now our balance sheet and cash position are equally strong. At the end of the quarter, after dividend payments and buyback, our cash balance was $2.3 billion. As a result of refinancing actions taken in Q3, we have addressed all debt maturities until the end of fiscal year 2022. Our various stress tests show that we are well capitalized with strong liquidity and plenty of financial flexibility to strategically invest in our business, make interest payments and continue to return cash to our shareholders. Our balance sheet and capital structure give us optionality to make accretive stocking acquisitions, return further capital through buybacks or both. Matt will provide you with more details about the financial and the liquidity strength in his section.  
So what about the stranded costs, you might ask. Well, if I only talk about it now it is because I consider the transition to be almost done with all decisions made to cross the finish line in August. We've run our transition to a pure-play consumer company at a rapid and decisive pace. 
As I stand in front of you today on May 14, essentially all transitions have been serviced and closed. All stranded job elimination notifications have been made, and our operational head count today is around 2,500. Q1 and the beginning of Q2 will reflect the last asset write-offs and other scheduled restructuring activities. By August, we will have spent a cumulative total of $750 million in cash stranded costs. The total proceeds from the sales of underutilized assets are still projected to be around $1.5 billion, and we have already realized half of it from the sales of DigiCert and ID Analytics, fully funding the cash stranded costs. The other half is made up of various properties that we put up for sale. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, we had multiple offers for each of the building we own. While some contract negotiations have been slowed down, we are confident in our ability to monetize this asset in the near future. We believe that our bargaining position is enhanced by our strong balance sheet and cash position. By the end of the summer, our transition should be completed, officially done in 9 months, which is 3 months faster than initially planned.  
In fiscal year 2020, we sold the Enterprise business for $11 billion and rightsized the infrastructure functions to be leaner and nimbler, taking out $1.5 billion in annual run rate cost out. In fiscal year '21, it is all about the productivity of our product innovation and selling motions for our consumer business. We can now focus all of our attention and energy on developing great products, taking a platform approach through upselling various levels of membership and optimizing our marketing in an environment where consumers might be increasingly receptive to our products and services.  
We are passionate about our mission to protect people's online activities. We are building a leadership team that is dedicated to fulfilling that consumer needs, and you will hear more about our progress in the future.  
I will now pass the call over to my business partner, Samir, for more details on our product initiatives, selling motions and our position going into fiscal year '21."

We're living through a generational event. A moment in history that I would say is bringing the world closer together despite the fact we have to stay physically apart. We have quickly evolved to a common purpose of focusing on health",1270,"Thank you, Vincent. We're living through a generational event. A moment in history that I would say is bringing the world closer together despite the fact we have to stay physically apart. We have quickly evolved to a common purpose of focusing on health and safety for our families, our friends and our communities. 
As cyber safety is at the forefront of this tidal wave of change, we're clearly seeing a rise in attackers taking advantage of the stay-at-home mode of life. We've seen new attacks focused on leveraging COVID-19 as a means to enable fraud and identity theft through tailored malware, phishing messages, online commerce scams and more. Hackers are preying on people's emotions, fear and panic to get them to click impulsively on various malicious links. We are seeing fake offers for masks and vaccines. We're seeing phishing e-mails purportedly coming from organizations like the World Health Organization and Center for Disease Control. Hackers are also targeting recipients of stimulus checks from various governments around the world. Instead of getting the help they're looking for, many consumers end up giving away personal identifiable information or downloading malware on their devices. 
Our mission is to keep customers aware as cyber safety has become more important than ever. As all households now spend more hours online, whether for school, work or in the community, protecting the home and family in a simple way is even more of a need. That's why we've strengthened our offering here. 
Norton Family brings the protection and security of our products to every member of the family across multiple devices and platforms. On top of that, we recently extended our time management capability for windows to include iOS and Android devices. With many kids spending more of their day on technology, the time management capability enables parents to easily manage the duration their children are on the Internet, akin to an online time allowance. When kids reach their allowance limit, they have the ability to simply request additional time, for example, to finish an online learning activity, and parents can add more time to their balance. Time extension is part of our continued commitment to go beyond supervision and blocking to also provide tools, which help parents keep the online safety conversation going on with their children, which leads to a deeper understanding of how to be safe online. 
In addition to being a stand-alone product, Norton Family is also included as parental control in our Norton 360 membership. Norton 360 is our full cyber safety platform, bringing together end-to-end security, privacy, identity, home and family capabilities to provide the best safety coverage available to our members. Norton 360 is now available in 43 countries as we completed its global rollout during Q4. This had been a major undertaking, and I would like to thank all of our team for accomplishing this transformative goal with precision in execution time. We can now focus on adding new areas of value to our membership and delighting our customers in new ways. No other safety company has the reach and scale of Norton 360 to help as many consumers as we do. 
Rounding out our cyber safety portfolio with the other 3 pillars of privacy, security and identity, here's a quick update on each of these areas. Our privacy offering has become even more relevant in the current environment as people are exchanging more sensitive information through digital channels, be it personal health care information to enable telehealth or financial information for personal accounting or even shopping for food. A VPN, or virtual private network, has become even more crucial. A VPN uses encryption to help block hackers from stealing personal information over the Internet. VPN has included in most tiers of our Norton 360 membership, and we're encouraging our members to use it more frequently to help prevent hackers from eavesdropping on their internet activity. 
While Norton is our flagship brand with end-to-end capabilities and premium positioning, we also started marketing another brand called SurfEasy to extend our reach into the value segment of the privacy market. SurfEasy provides VPN protection for 5 devices, unlimited bandwidth and ad tracker blocking technology for a very competitive price. We're currently marketing SurfEasy in the U.S., U.K. and India. As Vincent said earlier, growing our customer count is the #1 goal for our company, and we believe SurfEasy will be another way to bring in new customers within our product family. 
Security. Security is an integral part of the value we deliver for our members, and we have maintained consistent leadership in device security. During the quarter, we received 3 awards from the AV-TEST Institute for our device protection solutions. These included the Windows Home User Best Protection and Best Performance awards as well as the award for Best Android Protection. This represents NortonLifeLock's fifth consecutive Best Protection win for Norton Security. We are committed to building innovative technology that helps protect consumers' devices from ever-evolving cyber threats.
As people spend more time online to work and play in this environment, we believe securing devices is the foundation for security and will be more important than ever. Identity crossed a major milestone this last quarter with our first full-fledged LifeLock identity restoration suite to a country outside of the United States. Last quarter, we mentioned that we signed a partnership agreement with a large international telecom service provider. That partner is TELUS, the second largest telecom company in Canada. Creating a safer, friendlier world online is one of TELUS' pillars, aligning our 2 companies together very closely. 
Similar to the social security number of the United States, Canada has the social insurance number, which is the government's unique identifier for Canadian residents. It is used as a proof of identity for any and all types of credit, health insurance and education, amongst other things. This considers the most important piece of personal identifiable information in Canada and therefore, highly targeted by hackers. TELUS launched our Norton 360 with LifeLock in April, and we're looking forward to bringing the same level of protection and restoration capabilities to Canadians that our American customers have enjoyed for over a decade. Canada is a nascent market where identity theft protection products have not existed before. Currently, the market has been limited to just credit scores and alerts, which are a small features of an overall protection plan. We believe that Canada will grow to be an important market for us over time, akin to the U.S. years ago. It will take some time to educate the market about the benefits of identity protection. 
Partners like telcos, employee benefits, retailers and e-tailers are all an important part of our go-to-market strategy, and we continue to work to bring our products to more and more partners and their customers. Working with our partners helps broaden our audience, combine our capabilities and reach consumers closer to where they need cyber safety. Look out for more from us in this area in the near future. 
In the fourth quarter, average revenue per user, or ARPU, increased to $9.07 per month, up 1% sequentially and up 3% year-over-year. We also had another quarter of customer increase, adding 46,000 in the quarter. For the whole year, our retention rate was stable at 85%. These metrics demonstrate that customers appreciate the value we are providing. We have more enhancements with our membership programs for the future, and we look forward to updating you in coming quarters about our robust R&D pipeline of products. 
Let me now turn the call over to Matt to discuss the Q4 actual results in more detail."

Let me review our Q4 results in a bit more detail, focusing on non-GAAP results. Q4 revenue was better than expected at $614 million. And revenue, excluding ID Analytics, which was sold on January 31, was $610 million, up 1% year-over-year",1075,"Thanks, Samir. Let me review our Q4 results in a bit more detail, focusing on non-GAAP results. Q4 revenue was better than expected at $614 million. And revenue, excluding ID Analytics, which was sold on January 31, was $610 million, up 1% year-over-year in constant currency. Q4 reported billings, excluding ID Analytics, was up 3% year-over-year despite the FX headwinds, which reduced ending contract liabilities on our balance sheet. The reported billings growth was supported by our second consecutive quarter of net customer adds, adding 46,000 customers in Q4, along with a steady customer retention rate at 85% for the year. Diluted EPS was $0.26, up 63% year-over-year and exceeded our guidance range, driven by strong execution and better-than-expected stranded costs in our P&L.
As we stated in our prior quarter earnings calls, during this transition period, our reported cost structure will be complex and burdened with stranded costs. However, this is becoming less so as we progress through our accelerated transition. We expect Q1 to be the last quarter with significant transition-related moving pieces in our financials. In Q4, total company operating margin from continuing operations was burdened by approximately $60 million in stranded costs and reached 41.5% compared to 27.2% in the year ago period, an increase of more than 14 points, and 36.2% in the prior quarter. Our execution on eliminating stranded costs is evidenced by the steady operating margin growth, and we're well on our way to achieving the 50% post-transition operating margin for the total company. In addition, we continue to service and reduce our TSAs, and eliminate the positions that were linked to stranded activities. 
In Q4, ending head count was down to approximately 3,700 employees. And as Vincent mentioned, we finished substantially all remaining notifications at the end of April. Notified employees will remain on our books through Q1 in accordance with country-specific notice periods, such as one in the U.S. But operationally, we are now running the business with approximately 2,500 employees, achieving the long-term model we targeted when we sold the Enterprise business well ahead of schedule. 
On the topic of cash, and as we mentioned to you in last quarter's earnings call, Q4 cash flow from operating activities includes large onetime payments for divestiture-related tax amounts. And as a result of these payments as well as net cash outflows from stranded costs, our cash flow from operating activities in Q4 was materially negative as planned. However, absent the onetime payments and stranded costs, our business is operating in line with our long-term model of approximately $900 million in free cash flow on an annual basis. We ended the fourth quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.3 billion, giving us plenty of flexibility, driving our business for growth. 
This past quarter, we continued to return significant amounts of capital to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. We repurchased 29 million shares in the quarter for a total of $658 million, and we've utilized $1 billion, thus far, of the $1.6 billion share buyback authorization. In addition, we cash settled the principal and conversion rights of a $250 million convertible note, which lowered our overall debt level and reduced our diluted share count. We paid our regular dividend of $0.125 per share this quarter, and we remain committed to paying our annual dividend of $0.50 per share. And last, but certainly not least, we made good on our commitment to return 100% of the after-tax proceeds from the sale of the Enterprise business via the $12 per share special dividend at the end of January. 
I'd like to now spend a couple of minutes discussing how we're positioned amid the economic uncertainty caused by the recent COVID-19 crisis. In the early days of the COVID-19 crisis, we paused our share buyback with approximately $600 million left on the authorization to be flexible with any challenges and opportunities that may arise in the new economic environment. This was a prudent approach as our excess cash capacity affords us greater flexibility. However, we remain open to a number of options and plan to resume our buyback program opportunistically. 
Another impact of the COVID-19 crisis is the delay in the sales of our underutilized real estate assets as some potential buyers take a slower approach. However, we believe it is a temporary delay and remain confident we will be able to move forward with the sales in a reasonable time frame. Importantly, this slowdown does not impact our ability to achieve the post-transition operating margin outlook. And more importantly, we are not relying on that cash to run the business. 
As Vincent mentioned, the vast majority of our business is direct to our highly recurring diverse subscriber base. The ratable nature of our business helps minimize disruption in our financials from short-term economic headwinds. In addition, our balance sheet is strong with $2.3 billion in cash and short-term investments as of Q4 as well as access to our undrawn $1 billion revolver. And we have a capital-efficient model reflected in our low CapEx spending. We spent just $3 million in Q4 and expect our annual CapEx should be approximately $40 million, with depreciation expense to be in the range of our CapEx spending going forward. In addition, the maturities of our outstanding debt extend well into the future. Our $750 million senior note that's due in September is being replaced by the $750 million delayed draw term loan that we structured back in November and pushes that maturity out to fiscal year 2025. The next debt maturities don't occur until almost 2 years from now. In addition, we are well within our covenant limits. We ran a series of downturn scenarios to stress test the business. 
Even under severe downturn sensitivity scenarios, we have sufficient room in our financial covenants as well as minimum cash flow needed to operate the business and protect our regular cash dividend. For example, our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA would have to drop by almost 40% before triggering any issues with our covenants at the current debt levels. So we feel very good about our liquidity and capital structure. 
To recap, I'm very pleased with how we executed. We turned in a strong financial performance this quarter, delivering revenue and EPS growth, reducing debt, lowering our share count, accelerating our transition and maintaining strong liquidity heading into the COVID-19 economic environment. 
Let me now turn the call back to Vincent to provide our Q1 outlook."
35000,663837177,1992641,"NortonLifeLock Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, May 14, 2020",2020-05-14,"Earnings Calls","Gen Digital Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Matt.

Let me now provide our Q1 outlook and also discuss our long-term growth strategy for NortonLifeLock. 
March trends continued into April. Quarter-to-date, we generated slightly positive customer net adds and almost mid-single-digit booking growth overall. Direct-to-consumers booking grew high single digit in April as people continue to adapt to life working from home. This growth was partially offset by decline in our retail sales, impacting our overall indirect partner sales. Maintaining this net positive trend, we expect revenue in the range of $590 million to $605 million or 0% to 2% growth when normalizing for IDA and the extra week in Q1 fiscal year '20. This revenue outlook is supported by bookings growth in the low to mid-single-digit range. 
We expect Q1 non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.18 to $0.22 per share with the business operating at approximately 50% profit margin when excluding the stranded cost. As stranded activities are expected to be fully eliminated by August, although we will write off additional assets in Q1 with the goal to be over 90% done by the end of June. 
In fiscal year '20, we returned to previous marketing investment levels, primarily targeted at direct acquisition programs. And we will continue to invest in our distribution and product road map for long-term impact. While these initiatives take time to generate revenue, we are very encouraged to see 3 consecutive quarter of low to mid-single-digit bookings growth year-over-year. 
I also said that while we have a fantastic opportunity to define a simple and reliable path to cyber safety, it won't be a linear road by any means. Certainly, no one could have anticipated the world to go into a full lockdown only a month after we last gave guidance. While we will be cautious and agile in managing our business, our mission to protect and safely enable customer digital lives is more relevant than ever. 
And with that, Matt, Samir and I are now happy to take any questions. Operator?"

So let me first go back at the core. As we develop the cyber safety membership, Norton 360, we have underlying growth drivers, which is that more and more consumers are driving their operations, their lives online, and they want to do that in a safe environment. We have, since we became NortonLifelock in November, reinvested in marketing to make our products known out there. We had launched Norton 360 at the beginning of this fiscal year, as you know, and we pushed that rollout through. We were on a steady path, if you want, turning a situation where we had a declining customer count into bringing more and more new customers. It was passed through the quarter. We saw in the month of March, more demand and slow conversion or realization of that increased demand. We saw that through the month of April. And obviously, you can understand that all of the activities from working from home, not wanting to go into the shopping malls and all of those things, have only increased the need for better protection online. As you mentioned, that was offset partially by the fact that at physical stores, we couldn't go and buy a token or one of our products, but that was a mild offset. So we're encouraged by the trends. It will be a long-term trend. We believe that will continue, which is more people will work from home, will live their life online and will need our products."

We have great operational teams driving each 1 of those 3 areas and driving for growth. As I shared a quarter ago and shared with the team all the time, it's a balance between all those 3 drivers, but the #1 metric is increasing the customer count. Behind that, it is the marketing investment, it's the Net Promoter Scores and the customer satisfaction, and we're driving that. If you see our retention, it has improved in each one of the cohort by tenure. But you know that the first year of tenure is a lower retention and an increase as they've seen to our portfolio. And so the increased retention as they engage more and more on Norton 360 is slightly offset because we're returning to customer growth. Overall, though, it's all value for the business."

But as they come to a close, they will impact different areas of the P&L in different quarters, depending on the types of activities and how they end. And so as we've sort of been consistent in this message over the last couple of quarters, our reporting structure is complex. The stranded costs show up in different areas of the P&L depending on the types of activities. And so for that reason, though, we expect these activities to come to a close, they may be impacting a different area of the P&L. 
Having said that, our core business, we expect to operate at that 50% operating margin that we've discussed and have continued to discuss. And so we will, of course, make it clear next quarter when we report where those stranded costs showed up, but that is the reason for the guide of $0.18 to $0.22."

Now every environment or every crisis is unique, and this one brings something that is very different. It changes the way we operate our lives. It changes the way we work. It changes the way we interact, the way we shop. And I think there is an underlying acceleration of the need for more privacy, more security online. That's why you see companies like Logitech selling more video conferencing systems, and us with that selling more security products. And I think the trends of having more awareness of few lives moving online is a structural trend. Now it may be impacting in the short term here and there by different economic headwind, but I think we're well positioned from that. 
And we have the perfect solution, launching last year the Norton 360 membership, we saw an acceleration of the adoption rate through the last 2 quarters, and we're pretty pleased by that."

As a reminder, in connection with the sale of certain assets for our Enterprise Security business to Broadcom on November 4, 2019, we changed our corporate name from Symantec to NortonLifeLock. The results of our Enterprise Security business were classified as discontinued operations in our condensed consolidated statement of operations and thus, excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented.  
Starting in the second quarter of fiscal '20, we operate in 1 reportable segment. Revenues and associated costs of our ID Analytics solutions, which were formerly included in the Enterprise Security segment, are now included in our remaining reportable segment. On January 31, 2020, we completed the sale of our ID Analytics solutions.  
I'd like to remind everyone that all references to final metrics are non-GAAP, unless otherwise stated. Please refer to the supplemental materials posted on the Investor Relations website for further definitions of our non-GAAP metrics. 
Please note, non-GAAP financial measures referenced during this call are reconciled to their comparable GAAP financial measures in the press release and supplemental materials posted on our website. We believe our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating performance for reasons discussed below. Our management team uses these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our operating results as well as when planning and forecasting future periods. We believe our non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate comparisons of our performance to prior periods and that investors benefit from understanding our non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental and should not be considered as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP.  
Today's call contains forward-looking statements based on conditions we currently see. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the current date, and as such, involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. In particular, our statements regarding the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business and industry, our sale of our Enterprise Security assets to Broadcom, any anticipated benefits from such sale and cost reductions associated with this transaction are subject to a variety of risks. Please refer to the cautionary statement in our press release for more information. You will also find a detailed discussion of our risk factors in our filings with the SEC and in particular, our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 29, 2019, and recently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.

Each of you has persevered in driving our mission and supporting our customers while working from home and adjusting to this new reality. Our mission is to protect people's online activities, which has never been more relevant than today. And on behalf of all our employees, I also want to thank our customers for the trust you have placed in our products and in us. Our business is built around prevention, detection and restoration of potential damages caused by hackers. Managing and handling crisis is part of our DNA, and the entire NortonLifeLock team is rising to the occasion, adapting ourselves and our processes to help customers in need as well as communities by donating time and resources. There is no other company I would rather be part of as we navigate the challenges that the world is currently facing.  
We are pleased to report better-than-expected results in Q4, the second quarter of NortonLifeLock as a stand-alone company. Consumer revenue was up 1% year-over-year in constant currency, supported by bookings growth of 4%. We generated $0.26 EPS, up $0.10 from a year ago, driven by strong execution and the elimination of stranded costs. In addition to year-over-year bookings growth of mid-single digits, we increased net customer count by 46,000 sequentially. We grew average revenue per users. We delivered industry-leading retention while maintaining our operating profit margin over 51% when you exclude the impact of stranded costs. This was our second sequential quarter of net customer growth, adding over 100,000 customers in the last 6 months. 
For the first time since 2014, we've had 2 consecutive quarters of net adds. Through the quarter, we saw a steady performance with a strong finish in the month of March. However, we're still in stabilization phase, especially in this current environment. The business is moving in the right direction, and we believe that our focused execution will deliver consistent, sustainable growth over time. The need for our products is more present than ever, driven by working from home, virtual meetings, online gaming, streaming, e-shopping, telemedicine and numerous other online transactions and interactions that put us all at risk from cyber criminals, looking to take advantage of this accelerated trend.  
As Samir will remind us all in a moment, our portfolio does a tremendous job protecting people from online threat, but it is not a static world. As the threats evolve with our behaviors and technology, we are focused on delivering a portfolio that protects each element of our customers' digital lives. That is our mission. And we will know that we are succeeding when these added products and features consistently deliver customer count growth. That is why it is our #1 measure of success.  
Let me mention a few of these highlights now. This quarter, we expanded our family offering. We offered free usage during the COVID-19 crisis. We received 3 awards from AV-TEST Institute for our device protection solutions, and we made numerous other improvements to our platform and products. In April, we expanded our international reach and capabilities with the launch of Norton 360 with LifeLock in Canada. We have a long history of innovation here at NortonLifelock and we know that product innovation will be a cornerstone of our long-term success.  
Our fourth quarter performance not only reflects the strong execution of our team, but also demonstrate the resiliency and opportunity of our business model. We sell direct to consumers with minimal reliance on physical partners, delivering high-value at a relatively low ARPU, plus over 95% of our business is recurring.  
Considering these challenging times and the various requests from our investors, let me expand on each of these points, starting with recurring revenue. 90% of our revenue is direct to consumers. The vast majority of our bookings are annual subscriptions, which are paid upfront, while revenue is recognized ratably each quarter. Our indirect revenue, about 10% of our total, is also half recurring. Partners like telecom carriers and employee benefit providers pay us every month as they provide our products to their customer base. On the first day of the quarter, we have visibility on over 70% of our revenue coming off our balance sheet, and as I mentioned, over 95% of our total revenue is recurring.  
Secondly, we have minimal reliance on physical retail or OEM partners. The bookings generated by these channels represent about 5% of our total bookings and the revenues included in the indirect part of our business. This 5% might be impacted by a prolonged health crisis, and we will be conservative with our forecasting. However, we do not believe travel restrictions or supply chain disruptions have much impact on our distribution capabilities overall.  
Lastly, and most importantly, we are providing tremendous and relevant value for a monthly ARPU of $9. During this environment when consumers are spending almost all of their time at home and online, we're providing a round-the-clock protection for our members. We've all heard about increasing instances of online criminal activity. In April, our restoration team already started handling the first cases of identity theft related to COVID-19 subsidy payments. The opportunity for cybercrime has substantially increased, and we know that Norton 360 is helping our customers manage their online activities with more confidence knowing that Norton 360 is keeping them safe.  
In the back half of Q4 and during the month of April, we have seen this customer confidence in our products reflected in solid renewal rates and new bookings. So our mission to protect everyone's digital life is more relevant than ever. And our business and financial model is as resilient as any in these uncertain times.  
Now our balance sheet and cash position are equally strong. At the end of the quarter, after dividend payments and buyback, our cash balance was $2.3 billion. As a result of refinancing actions taken in Q3, we have addressed all debt maturities until the end of fiscal year 2022. Our various stress tests show that we are well capitalized with strong liquidity and plenty of financial flexibility to strategically invest in our business, make interest payments and continue to return cash to our shareholders. Our balance sheet and capital structure give us optionality to make accretive stocking acquisitions, return further capital through buybacks or both. Matt will provide you with more details about the financial and the liquidity strength in his section.  
So what about the stranded costs, you might ask. Well, if I only talk about it now it is because I consider the transition to be almost done with all decisions made to cross the finish line in August. We've run our transition to a pure-play consumer company at a rapid and decisive pace. 
As I stand in front of you today on May 14, essentially all transitions have been serviced and closed. All stranded job elimination notifications have been made, and our operational head count today is around 2,500. Q1 and the beginning of Q2 will reflect the last asset write-offs and other scheduled restructuring activities. By August, we will have spent a cumulative total of $750 million in cash stranded costs. The total proceeds from the sales of underutilized assets are still projected to be around $1.5 billion, and we have already realized half of it from the sales of DigiCert and ID Analytics, fully funding the cash stranded costs. The other half is made up of various properties that we put up for sale. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, we had multiple offers for each of the building we own. While some contract negotiations have been slowed down, we are confident in our ability to monetize this asset in the near future. We believe that our bargaining position is enhanced by our strong balance sheet and cash position. By the end of the summer, our transition should be completed, officially done in 9 months, which is 3 months faster than initially planned.  
In fiscal year 2020, we sold the Enterprise business for $11 billion and rightsized the infrastructure functions to be leaner and nimbler, taking out $1.5 billion in annual run rate cost out. In fiscal year '21, it is all about the productivity of our product innovation and selling motions for our consumer business. We can now focus all of our attention and energy on developing great products, taking a platform approach through upselling various levels of membership and optimizing our marketing in an environment where consumers might be increasingly receptive to our products and services.  
We are passionate about our mission to protect people's online activities. We are building a leadership team that is dedicated to fulfilling that consumer needs, and you will hear more about our progress in the future.  
I will now pass the call over to my business partner, Samir, for more details on our product initiatives, selling motions and our position going into fiscal year '21."

We're living through a generational event. A moment in history that I would say is bringing the world closer together despite the fact we have to stay physically apart. We have quickly evolved to a common purpose of focusing on health",1270,"Thank you, Vincent. We're living through a generational event. A moment in history that I would say is bringing the world closer together despite the fact we have to stay physically apart. We have quickly evolved to a common purpose of focusing on health and safety for our families, our friends and our communities. 
As cyber safety is at the forefront of this tidal wave of change, we're clearly seeing a rise in attackers taking advantage of the stay-at-home mode of life. We've seen new attacks focused on leveraging COVID-19 as a means to enable fraud and identity theft through tailored malware, phishing messages, online commerce scams and more. Hackers are preying on people's emotions, fear and panic to get them to click impulsively on various malicious links. We are seeing fake offers for masks and vaccines. We're seeing phishing e-mails purportedly coming from organizations like the World Health Organization and Center for Disease Control. Hackers are also targeting recipients of stimulus checks from various governments around the world. Instead of getting the help they're looking for, many consumers end up giving away personal identifiable information or downloading malware on their devices. 
Our mission is to keep customers aware as cyber safety has become more important than ever. As all households now spend more hours online, whether for school, work or in the community, protecting the home and family in a simple way is even more of a need. That's why we've strengthened our offering here. 
Norton Family brings the protection and security of our products to every member of the family across multiple devices and platforms. On top of that, we recently extended our time management capability for windows to include iOS and Android devices. With many kids spending more of their day on technology, the time management capability enables parents to easily manage the duration their children are on the Internet, akin to an online time allowance. When kids reach their allowance limit, they have the ability to simply request additional time, for example, to finish an online learning activity, and parents can add more time to their balance. Time extension is part of our continued commitment to go beyond supervision and blocking to also provide tools, which help parents keep the online safety conversation going on with their children, which leads to a deeper understanding of how to be safe online. 
In addition to being a stand-alone product, Norton Family is also included as parental control in our Norton 360 membership. Norton 360 is our full cyber safety platform, bringing together end-to-end security, privacy, identity, home and family capabilities to provide the best safety coverage available to our members. Norton 360 is now available in 43 countries as we completed its global rollout during Q4. This had been a major undertaking, and I would like to thank all of our team for accomplishing this transformative goal with precision in execution time. We can now focus on adding new areas of value to our membership and delighting our customers in new ways. No other safety company has the reach and scale of Norton 360 to help as many consumers as we do. 
Rounding out our cyber safety portfolio with the other 3 pillars of privacy, security and identity, here's a quick update on each of these areas. Our privacy offering has become even more relevant in the current environment as people are exchanging more sensitive information through digital channels, be it personal health care information to enable telehealth or financial information for personal accounting or even shopping for food. A VPN, or virtual private network, has become even more crucial. A VPN uses encryption to help block hackers from stealing personal information over the Internet. VPN has included in most tiers of our Norton 360 membership, and we're encouraging our members to use it more frequently to help prevent hackers from eavesdropping on their internet activity. 
While Norton is our flagship brand with end-to-end capabilities and premium positioning, we also started marketing another brand called SurfEasy to extend our reach into the value segment of the privacy market. SurfEasy provides VPN protection for 5 devices, unlimited bandwidth and ad tracker blocking technology for a very competitive price. We're currently marketing SurfEasy in the U.S., U.K. and India. As Vincent said earlier, growing our customer count is the #1 goal for our company, and we believe SurfEasy will be another way to bring in new customers within our product family. 
Security. Security is an integral part of the value we deliver for our members, and we have maintained consistent leadership in device security. During the quarter, we received 3 awards from the AV-TEST Institute for our device protection solutions. These included the Windows Home User Best Protection and Best Performance awards as well as the award for Best Android Protection. This represents NortonLifeLock's fifth consecutive Best Protection win for Norton Security. We are committed to building innovative technology that helps protect consumers' devices from ever-evolving cyber threats.
As people spend more time online to work and play in this environment, we believe securing devices is the foundation for security and will be more important than ever. Identity crossed a major milestone this last quarter with our first full-fledged LifeLock identity restoration suite to a country outside of the United States. Last quarter, we mentioned that we signed a partnership agreement with a large international telecom service provider. That partner is TELUS, the second largest telecom company in Canada. Creating a safer, friendlier world online is one of TELUS' pillars, aligning our 2 companies together very closely. 
Similar to the social security number of the United States, Canada has the social insurance number, which is the government's unique identifier for Canadian residents. It is used as a proof of identity for any and all types of credit, health insurance and education, amongst other things. This considers the most important piece of personal identifiable information in Canada and therefore, highly targeted by hackers. TELUS launched our Norton 360 with LifeLock in April, and we're looking forward to bringing the same level of protection and restoration capabilities to Canadians that our American customers have enjoyed for over a decade. Canada is a nascent market where identity theft protection products have not existed before. Currently, the market has been limited to just credit scores and alerts, which are a small features of an overall protection plan. We believe that Canada will grow to be an important market for us over time, akin to the U.S. years ago. It will take some time to educate the market about the benefits of identity protection. 
Partners like telcos, employee benefits, retailers and e-tailers are all an important part of our go-to-market strategy, and we continue to work to bring our products to more and more partners and their customers. Working with our partners helps broaden our audience, combine our capabilities and reach consumers closer to where they need cyber safety. Look out for more from us in this area in the near future. 
In the fourth quarter, average revenue per user, or ARPU, increased to $9.07 per month, up 1% sequentially and up 3% year-over-year. We also had another quarter of customer increase, adding 46,000 in the quarter. For the whole year, our retention rate was stable at 85%. These metrics demonstrate that customers appreciate the value we are providing. We have more enhancements with our membership programs for the future, and we look forward to updating you in coming quarters about our robust R&D pipeline of products. 
Let me now turn the call over to Matt to discuss the Q4 actual results in more detail."
35000,663837177,1992646,"NortonLifeLock Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, May 14, 2020",2020-05-14,"Earnings Calls","Gen Digital Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Samir. Let me review our Q4 results in a bit more detail, focusing on non-GAAP results. Q4 revenue was better than expected at $614 million. And revenue, excluding ID Analytics, which was sold on January 31, was $610 million, up 1% year-over-year",1075,"Thanks, Samir. Let me review our Q4 results in a bit more detail, focusing on non-GAAP results. Q4 revenue was better than expected at $614 million. And revenue, excluding ID Analytics, which was sold on January 31, was $610 million, up 1% year-over-year in constant currency. Q4 reported billings, excluding ID Analytics, was up 3% year-over-year despite the FX headwinds, which reduced ending contract liabilities on our balance sheet. The reported billings growth was supported by our second consecutive quarter of net customer adds, adding 46,000 customers in Q4, along with a steady customer retention rate at 85% for the year. Diluted EPS was $0.26, up 63% year-over-year and exceeded our guidance range, driven by strong execution and better-than-expected stranded costs in our P&L.
As we stated in our prior quarter earnings calls, during this transition period, our reported cost structure will be complex and burdened with stranded costs. However, this is becoming less so as we progress through our accelerated transition. We expect Q1 to be the last quarter with significant transition-related moving pieces in our financials. In Q4, total company operating margin from continuing operations was burdened by approximately $60 million in stranded costs and reached 41.5% compared to 27.2% in the year ago period, an increase of more than 14 points, and 36.2% in the prior quarter. Our execution on eliminating stranded costs is evidenced by the steady operating margin growth, and we're well on our way to achieving the 50% post-transition operating margin for the total company. In addition, we continue to service and reduce our TSAs, and eliminate the positions that were linked to stranded activities. 
In Q4, ending head count was down to approximately 3,700 employees. And as Vincent mentioned, we finished substantially all remaining notifications at the end of April. Notified employees will remain on our books through Q1 in accordance with country-specific notice periods, such as one in the U.S. But operationally, we are now running the business with approximately 2,500 employees, achieving the long-term model we targeted when we sold the Enterprise business well ahead of schedule. 
On the topic of cash, and as we mentioned to you in last quarter's earnings call, Q4 cash flow from operating activities includes large onetime payments for divestiture-related tax amounts. And as a result of these payments as well as net cash outflows from stranded costs, our cash flow from operating activities in Q4 was materially negative as planned. However, absent the onetime payments and stranded costs, our business is operating in line with our long-term model of approximately $900 million in free cash flow on an annual basis. We ended the fourth quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.3 billion, giving us plenty of flexibility, driving our business for growth. 
This past quarter, we continued to return significant amounts of capital to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. We repurchased 29 million shares in the quarter for a total of $658 million, and we've utilized $1 billion, thus far, of the $1.6 billion share buyback authorization. In addition, we cash settled the principal and conversion rights of a $250 million convertible note, which lowered our overall debt level and reduced our diluted share count. We paid our regular dividend of $0.125 per share this quarter, and we remain committed to paying our annual dividend of $0.50 per share. And last, but certainly not least, we made good on our commitment to return 100% of the after-tax proceeds from the sale of the Enterprise business via the $12 per share special dividend at the end of January. 
I'd like to now spend a couple of minutes discussing how we're positioned amid the economic uncertainty caused by the recent COVID-19 crisis. In the early days of the COVID-19 crisis, we paused our share buyback with approximately $600 million left on the authorization to be flexible with any challenges and opportunities that may arise in the new economic environment. This was a prudent approach as our excess cash capacity affords us greater flexibility. However, we remain open to a number of options and plan to resume our buyback program opportunistically. 
Another impact of the COVID-19 crisis is the delay in the sales of our underutilized real estate assets as some potential buyers take a slower approach. However, we believe it is a temporary delay and remain confident we will be able to move forward with the sales in a reasonable time frame. Importantly, this slowdown does not impact our ability to achieve the post-transition operating margin outlook. And more importantly, we are not relying on that cash to run the business. 
As Vincent mentioned, the vast majority of our business is direct to our highly recurring diverse subscriber base. The ratable nature of our business helps minimize disruption in our financials from short-term economic headwinds. In addition, our balance sheet is strong with $2.3 billion in cash and short-term investments as of Q4 as well as access to our undrawn $1 billion revolver. And we have a capital-efficient model reflected in our low CapEx spending. We spent just $3 million in Q4 and expect our annual CapEx should be approximately $40 million, with depreciation expense to be in the range of our CapEx spending going forward. In addition, the maturities of our outstanding debt extend well into the future. Our $750 million senior note that's due in September is being replaced by the $750 million delayed draw term loan that we structured back in November and pushes that maturity out to fiscal year 2025. The next debt maturities don't occur until almost 2 years from now. In addition, we are well within our covenant limits. We ran a series of downturn scenarios to stress test the business. 
Even under severe downturn sensitivity scenarios, we have sufficient room in our financial covenants as well as minimum cash flow needed to operate the business and protect our regular cash dividend. For example, our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA would have to drop by almost 40% before triggering any issues with our covenants at the current debt levels. So we feel very good about our liquidity and capital structure. 
To recap, I'm very pleased with how we executed. We turned in a strong financial performance this quarter, delivering revenue and EPS growth, reducing debt, lowering our share count, accelerating our transition and maintaining strong liquidity heading into the COVID-19 economic environment. 
Let me now turn the call back to Vincent to provide our Q1 outlook."
35000,663837177,1992646,"NortonLifeLock Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, May 14, 2020",2020-05-14,"Earnings Calls","Gen Digital Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Matt.

Let me now provide our Q1 outlook and also discuss our long-term growth strategy for NortonLifeLock. 
March trends continued into April. Quarter-to-date, we generated slightly positive customer net adds and almost mid-single-digit booking growth overall. Direct-to-consumers booking grew high single digit in April as people continue to adapt to life working from home. This growth was partially offset by decline in our retail sales, impacting our overall indirect partner sales. Maintaining this net positive trend, we expect revenue in the range of $590 million to $605 million or 0% to 2% growth when normalizing for IDA and the extra week in Q1 fiscal year '20. This revenue outlook is supported by bookings growth in the low to mid-single-digit range. 
We expect Q1 non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.18 to $0.22 per share with the business operating at approximately 50% profit margin when excluding the stranded cost. As stranded activities are expected to be fully eliminated by August, although we will write off additional assets in Q1 with the goal to be over 90% done by the end of June. 
In fiscal year '20, we returned to previous marketing investment levels, primarily targeted at direct acquisition programs. And we will continue to invest in our distribution and product road map for long-term impact. While these initiatives take time to generate revenue, we are very encouraged to see 3 consecutive quarter of low to mid-single-digit bookings growth year-over-year. 
I also said that while we have a fantastic opportunity to define a simple and reliable path to cyber safety, it won't be a linear road by any means. Certainly, no one could have anticipated the world to go into a full lockdown only a month after we last gave guidance. While we will be cautious and agile in managing our business, our mission to protect and safely enable customer digital lives is more relevant than ever. 
And with that, Matt, Samir and I are now happy to take any questions. Operator?"

As we develop the cyber safety membership, Norton 360, we have underlying growth drivers, which is that more and more consumers are driving their operations, their lives online, and they want to do that in a safe environment. We have, since we became NortonLifelock in November, reinvested in marketing to make our products known out there. We had launched Norton 360 at the beginning of this fiscal year, as you know, and we pushed that rollout through. We were on a steady path, if you want, turning a situation where we had a declining customer count into bringing more and more new customers. It was passed through the quarter. We saw in the month of March, more demand and slow conversion or realization of that increased demand. We saw that through the month of April. And obviously, you can understand that all of the activities from working from home, not wanting to go into the shopping malls and all of those things, have only increased the need for better protection online. As you mentioned, that was offset partially by the fact that at physical stores, we couldn't go and buy a token or one of our products, but that was a mild offset. So we're encouraged by the trends. It will be a long-term trend. We believe that will continue, which is more people will work from home, will live their life online and will need our products."

We now have about 25% of our installed base into Norton 360, and that increased engagement. And the third one is to increase retention. We have great operational teams driving each 1 of those 3 areas and driving for growth. As I shared a quarter ago and shared with the team all the time, it's a balance between all those 3 drivers, but the #1 metric is increasing the customer count. Behind that, it is the marketing investment, it's the Net Promoter Scores and the customer satisfaction, and we're driving that. If you see our retention, it has improved in each one of the cohort by tenure. But you know that the first year of tenure is a lower retention and an increase as they've seen to our portfolio. And so the increased retention as they engage more and more on Norton 360 is slightly offset because we're returning to customer growth. Overall, though, it's all value for the business."

But as they come to a close, they will impact different areas of the P&L in different quarters, depending on the types of activities and how they end.

The stranded costs show up in different areas of the P&L depending on the types of activities. And so for that reason, though, we expect these activities to come to a close, they may be impacting a different area of the P&L. 
Having said that, our core business, we expect to operate at that 50% operating margin that we've discussed and have continued to discuss. And so we will, of course, make it clear next quarter when we report where those stranded costs showed up, but that is the reason for the guide of $0.18 to $0.22."

We also went back to what happened in 2008, look at the retention rate during that time. And actually, it was pretty resilient and sustainable even then. Now every environment or every crisis is unique, and this one brings something that is very different. It changes the way we operate our lives. It changes the way we work. It changes the way we interact, the way we shop. And I think there is an underlying acceleration of the need for more privacy, more security online. That's why you see companies like Logitech selling more video conferencing systems, and us with that selling more security products. And I think the trends of having more awareness of few lives moving online is a structural trend. Now it may be impacting in the short term here and there by different economic headwind, but I think we're well positioned from that. 
And we have the perfect solution, launching last year the Norton 360 membership, we saw an acceleration of the adoption rate through the last 2 quarters, and we're pretty pleased by that."

Thanks for [Audio Gap] close the sales of the enterprise business. We committed to return to customer growth, drive sustainable revenue growth, completed overhaul of the cost structure and deliver a healthy profit. 
In just our second full quarter as NortonLifeLock, our first quarter of fiscal year [Audio Gap] delivered better-than-expected results, with strong reported billings growth of 9%, revenue growth of 4% and EPS growth of 48%. As we created NortonLifeLock, we believe in the potential of a business, solely focused on building personal cybersafety [Audio Gap] on our sites on sustainably and meaningfully growing customer count and delivering revenue growth in the mid-single digit [Audio Gap] we delivered both sequential and year-over-year 400,000 net new customers, a first since 2014. 
Revenue growth was 4%, meeting the long-term objective of mid-single-digit [Audio Gap] At the end of June, we eliminated 95% of the stranded costs, and we expect to be done this [ month ]. In Q1, included stranded costs, we reached 47% operating margin for the company, up 15 points year-over-year and expect to reach 50% by September, another one of our commitments [Audio Gap] the Consumer business has been running above 51%, better than our operating margin target of 50%. 
Our Q1 EPS was $0.31 [Audio Gap] impact from stranded costs and is up $0.10 year-over-year. By the end of this fiscal [Audio Gap] at our target of $1.50 annualized EPS, with mid-single-digit revenue growth, operating margin above 50% or utilizing our remaining $600 million share buyback program or some combination of any or all of them. 
Finally, we projected to run the company at $900 million annualized free cash [Audio Gap] While we have been and are running at that level in Q1, excluding cash [Audio Gap] tracking for those levels to be reflected in our cash flow statement, once our financials are clean of stranded costs in the second half of this [Audio Gap]. 
As we demonstrated the operational discipline with which we want to continue to operate, we made it a priority to build out our post-transition leadership team. This quarter, we welcomed new and accomplished leaders with deep experience in consumer technology [Audio Gap] in a minute, brings operational skills with a growth mindset. We added seasoned leaders from very successful consumer technology companies. These leaders are joining us for our mission to bring cybersafety to every consumer around the world. We believe the company is uniquely positioned to seize that tremendous growth opportunity. 
[Audio Gap] the growth was to increase our marketing spend, which, as you know, is our main way to reach new consumers, educate them on the benefits of our solutions. As we maintain a consistent messaging level in the market, we saw increased efficacy. Our overall customer acquisition costs continue to benefit not just from lower ad rates related to COVID, [Audio Gap] it is to shift marketing spend to new digital channels, including search, social media [Audio Gap] 
In terms of reach, despite the global strength of the Norton brand, we had not invested in international marketing in recent years. We reversed that in Q3 fiscal year '20 and we are beginning to see the results from those investments. The strategic shift in our marketing efforts have broadened our reach, and we are making steady progress in reaching younger and international customer cohorts. 
As of the end of Q1, we counted 20.6 million customers who buy our product [Audio Gap] commerce platform. This represents an increase in net customer by 379,000 sequentially and 416,000 year-over-year [Audio Gap] with growth across both the portfolio and the geographies. We grew both in the U.S. and internationally across all regions. The increase in international customer count outpaced that in the U.S., another first in a long time here. 
Supported by trends like work-from-home, virtual meetings and online shopping and transacting, we saw both our security and identity product categories grow sequentially and year-over-year, another first in a very long time. Our average revenue per user, or ARPU, remained strong at $9.03 per month even as we recorded strong net additions. Our retention remained very strong as well at around 85%, suggesting that customers recognize the value and stay with us for a long time. Accounts for about 90% of our revenue we also have a partner organization developing new ways of distributing our offering to individuals. 
In Q1, we grew our indirect revenue 11% year-over-year. In retail, our performance on Amazon and other e-tailers offset the weakness from traditional stores being shut down or operating with limited hours. Our indirect sales also benefited from the strong performance of employee benefit programs, our fastest-growing partner channel. We are seeing strong growth from new employer acquisitions and greater participation within existing employers. Furthermore, while we're still in the early stages, I'm also pleased to report progress in our long-time [ TELUS and AARP ]. Although it takes time to develop and ramp up new relationships, we believe in the long-term potential to expand our reach and continue to grow. 
Growing through new marketing channels and various forms of partnerships, and consistently messaging our value proposition to them is extremely important. Our new Chief Commercial Officer, Robert Clarkson, has significant experience building out global partners and platforms over his tenure at PayPal. His passion is around consistently delivering the customer experience throughout their customer journey and lifetime. That is the reason we regrouped our direct, indirect and renewal sales organization under his leadership. Our vision is to keep people around the world cyber safe. We believe it is our responsibility to provide everyone with innovative products and solutions to protect and control their digital lives. 
That vision was the impetus for creating the Norton 360 integrated platform and we believe customers are starting to see it. The vast majority of new customers are now coming directly to Norton 360. And as of the end of Q1, over 40% of our installed base was on Norton 360, up from approximately 25% at the end of Q4. This penetration is important as it enables us to offer comprehensive cybersafety and the one common experience to seamlessly upgrade our platform with new features like home title protection and to increase the engagement and with that, the retention of our customers. 
Some of our platform features might continue to be offered as stand-alone products where it makes sense for our customers and help accelerate the growth of our company. Last quarter, we talked about SurfEasy VPN as an example of a stand-alone product. This quarter, I want to share a new example that demonstrates how we constantly are looking at new ways to protect people and their highly dynamic digital lives. Some customers want help limiting the public availability of their own personal data. Surf the web, and you will likely see that a lot of your personal information that you may not want out there is readily available, such as name, age, addresses, phone numbers. 
Privacy Monitor, which is available as a feature with Norton 360 with LifeLock, scans for personally identifiable information or PII, accessible on the most popular people search websites. But taking control of this data is tedious at best and often too complex. Recognizing this consumer need, we developed and beta tested a product called privacy monitor assistant. It's a white glove service, where our agents assisted by software find and delete all your PII on this data broker website. Wouldn't you pay for a reasonable fee to secure your personal information? It's still early, but we have seen positive response so far, and we think this capability has tremendous value for our customers. This is a good example of how we can continue to fulfill our vision by protecting our customers and enhancing the control they have over their digital lives. 
It's also a good example of how our service capability, combined with software, can differentiate us from competitors. We have a large customer base that constantly uses our service and provide us with insights we can turn into new features or products. Growing through innovative products and solutions is key to fulfill our mission. That is why we have put product management and R&D under our new Chief Product Officer, [ Gagan Singh ]. [ Gagan ] has a passion for technology. And in particular, how artificial intelligence and machine learning can help build cutting-edge products. He was particularly interested in our internal research team and their capabilities. This June, our research team with this BOT side, which can be downloaded for free as a browser extension or iOS app in a targeted effort to enable people to identify disinformation on their Twitter feed.  BOT Side technology is based on machine learning and leading-edge algorithm, it looks at over 20 different distinguishing features such as age of the account and tweet frequency to detect Twitter bots and show them directly on feed in real time. We are now looking to advance this technology and extend this capability to other use cases and threat. 
Before I pass it to Natalie, let me take a minute to step back and talk about our vision to deliver cybersafety to every person across the globe. Even before the world was tossed into turmoil, our mission was relevant. At the digital world is taking over how we work, learn, shop and basically live our lives. Now with COVID-19, our mission is more important than ever. Clearly, this pandemic has accelerated people's reliance on technology, and we are seeing the impact of that increased activity online to the number and variety of attacks on consumers. 
Attackers have elevated their techniques on stealing information, disrupting sites and cascading malware through phishing attacks, camouflaged test tracing apps, social engineering for COVID vaccines, and poisoned website emulating stimulus benefits, all resulting in an increased need for security, identity protection and restoration and privacy solutions. These are just a few of examples of the many threats facing us now that more of our everyday activities are done digitally. 
So while there is a lot of uncertainty at the macro level, one thing is certain. There is a real need for cybersafety for individuals, families and homes through innovative products and expanding distribution channels. Our mission is to meet that need and provide cybersafety to everyone. And with that, let me pass it to Natalie to give you more details on our Q1 financials."
35000,676138338,2063919,"NortonLifeLock Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 06, 2020",2020-08-06,"Earnings Calls","Gen Digital Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Vincent. Before I dive into our results, let me first say how excited I am to join [Audio Gap] by our mission to bring cybersafety to consumers worldwide, and I'm energized to help drive that mission in my new role. Over the course of [Audio Gap",743,"Thanks, Vincent. Before I dive into our results, let me first say how excited I am to join [Audio Gap] by our mission to bring cybersafety to consumers worldwide, and I'm energized to help drive that mission in my new role. 
Over the course of [Audio Gap] these were the mission and the brand are focused on helping people in their everyday lives. From GE to Black & Decker to eBay and now NortonLifelock, albeit leaders in different industries, these brands were all built on establishing trust with and delivering intrinsic value to their customers. 
Here at NortonLifelock, we must continue to deliver on our commitment to keeping consumers safe and in control of their digital lives. This commitment, combined with our incredible business model and opportunity to drive accelerating growth is what drew me to NortonLifelock. I look forward to working with our team to achieve our strategic aspirations. 
Now let me share our Q1 performance, focusing on non-GAAP results. Q1 revenue was better-than-expected at $614 million, up 4% year-over-year. Q1 reported billings was up 9% year-over-year, with a 2-point positive impact from FX in our ending contract liability balance. Billings growth was supported by growth in customer count, increasing approximately 400,000, both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. This was our third consecutive quarter of net customer adds and our first quarter of year-over-year growth in customer count in over 5 years. 
Diluted EPS was $0.31, up 48% year-over-year and exceeded our guidance range, driven by strong execution on top line growth and removal of stranded costs. For the quarter, total company operating margin from continuing operations was 47%, burdened by approximately $30 million of stranded costs. Therefore, excluding stranded costs, the business is operating at over 51% operating margin, with headcount below 2,500. With approximately 95% of total stranded costs removed through Q1, we are lowering our estimate for cumulative cash stranded cost to $650 million, down from our $750 million projection last quarter. Q2 will be the last quarter with notable transition-related costs in our non-GAAP financials. 
When the company first started this process 8 months ago, we said cash sales proceeds will fund cash stranded costs. With strong execution on both costs and asset sales, we are now projecting to deliver over $1 billion more cash than initially forecasted. As for the remaining sale of underutilized assets, we remain confident in our ability to reach our goal of $1.5 billion total cash proceeds. We are pleased to announce the recent sale of our Culver City real estate which closed on July 27 for $120 million. As for our remaining underutilized assets, we remain focused yet patient on monetizing and realizing fair market value now. 
We had another strong quarter of operating cash flow. We generated $170 million of cash flow from operations and spent only $1 million in CapEx. Cash flow was burdened by some onetime items this quarter, most significantly, about $100 million of stranded cash costs, which were partially offset by the timing of certain tax payments. Adjusting for these nonrecurring items, the business is generating approximately $900 million of free cash flow on an annualized basis. We believe we are well capitalized with our Q1 ending cash balance at $1.1 billion and another $1 billion in our undrawn revolver. 
With our strong balance sheet and cash flow, we continued to return cash to shareholders this quarter. We cash settled the principal and conversion rates of our $625 million convertible note, which lowered our debt to $3.625 billion and reduced diluted share count by over 30 million shares based on our Q1 average stock price. As a reminder, we still have approximately $600 million left of our $1.6 billion share buyback authorization, and we'll continue to use it opportunistically. 
Now turning to our Q2 outlook. We expect Q2 non-GAAP revenue in the range of $615 million to $625 million, representing 3% to 5% growth after normalizing for the ID Analytics divestiture. We expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.31 to $0.35 per share, with the business operating at approximately 50% profit margin when excluding stranded cost. Finally, I would like to thank Matt Brown for his leadership through the interim period and thank the entire team for their execution over the past 8 months. I look forward to building on the strong financial foundation we have and delivering consistent results for our shareholders. 
Now let me turn the call back to Vincent for closing comments."

I am proud to say we have delivered on all of our initial commitments. But as we have increased our execution capabilities, our ambitions have also grown. 
We have our sights set on our mission. Consumers are beset by constantly evolving cyberthreats. Our current platform is just scratching the surface of what can be done, and we're now similarly focused on innovating on our consumer cybersafety vision. We have a large engaged customer base, terrific technology capabilities an innovation pipeline and significant financial resources, combine these things with recurring revenue, high margins and significant cash flow, and you can see why I'm super optimistic about our future and long-term growth potential.

And so maybe to start out with, can you help us understand, to a certain extent, is this just like the programmatic stuff that you guys put into place on the marketing side of the equation and particularly expanding to international? Or is this kind of like a delayed reaction from work from home? Because you guys would see it a little bit later than kind of other people because you don't do the sort of the bundling with the OEM, so it's more about getting sort of more PCs out there and you guys do your marketing against them.

When we broke out and decide to focus solely on the consumer business,  our thesis has been that cybersafety will become more and more important for everyone as we move more and",392,"Yes. And as I do that, we have to go back to where we're coming from, right? When we broke out and decide to focus solely on the consumer business,  our thesis has been that cybersafety will become more and more important for everyone as we move more and more of our activities online. And cybersafety doesn't just mean security, security for your device, security for your data, it also means privacy, protecting your identity and including services to restore when it can't be prevented. So it's an overall umbrella that we know we have -- well, we are building in long term. There a lot of applications and fields that we still need to fill in that portfolio and build up the category. So we believe the thesis, if you want, is a long structural one. So that's number one. 
Number two is the division at the time under Symantec had not invested in marketing, as we discussed in the past, and we reaccelerated marketing as a way to communicate our message to consumers. We raised our marketing envelope by $100 million on an annual basis. We also said that the efficacy of that marketing investment, if you want, has to shop over time as we consistently deliver and spend in market. And then we started to tweak that marketing investment, moving to new channels of marketing moving to new regions. And starting to market in Europe, for example, where we had not marketed in the past. So those are contributors, if you want, for the return to growth. 
Then we said, ""Hey, the most important is product."" In April 19, we launched the first version of Norton 360, an integrated platform, addressing 4 pillars: security, privacy, identity, protection and restoration and you entirely family and homes, if you want. And we still are in the process of bringing that out. I believe it's very attractive for consumer to adopt that overall umbrella for a membership fee, having access to all of those areas and having a peace of mind. 
And then the last one is -- then COVID-19 happened. And definitely, it changed the way people operate online. Is it a peak change? Or is it a step function? I don't know. But we believe in the long-term view of building up our portfolio and creating awareness to drive growth."

And good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Since we closed the sales of the enterprise business, we committed to return to customer growth, drive sustainable revenue growth, complete an overhaul of the cost structure and deliver a healthy profit.
In just our second full quarter as NortonLifeLock, our first quarter of fiscal year 2021, we delivered better-than-expected results with strong reported billings growth of 9%, revenue growth of 4% and EPS growth of 48% year-over-year.
As we created NortonLifeLock, we believe in the potential of a business solely focused on building personal cybersafety for consumers. We initially set our sights on sustainably and meaningfully growing customer count and delivering revenue growth in the mid-single digits.
In Q1, we delivered both sequential and year-over-year 400,000 net new customers, a first since 2014. Revenue growth was 4%, meeting the long-term objective of mid-single digits in just our second full quarter.
At the end of June, we eliminated 95% of the stranded costs, and we expect to be done this month, 1 quarter ahead of plan. In Q1, included stranded costs, we reached 47% operating margin for the company, up 15 points year-over-year, and expect to reach 50% by September, another one of our commitments.
If you exclude the stranded costs, the Consumer business has been running above 51%, better than our operating margin target of 50%.
Our Q1 EPS was $0.31, which included a $0.04 impact from stranded costs and is up $0.10 year-over-year. By the end of this fiscal year, we expect to run the business at our target of $1.50 annualized EPS, which can be achieved by virtue of mid-single-digit revenue growth, operating margin above 50% or utilizing our remaining $600 million share buyback program or some combination of any or all of them.
Finally, we projected to run the company at $900 million annualized free cash flow after the transition period. While we have been and are running at that level in Q1, excluding cash spent on stranded costs, we are tracking for those levels to be reflected in our cash flow statement once our financials are clean of stranded costs in the second half of this year.
As we demonstrated the operational discipline with which we want to continue to operate, we made it a priority to build out our post-transition leadership team. This quarter, we welcomed new and accomplished leaders with deep experience in consumer technology. Natalie, who you will hear from in a minute, brings operational skills with a growth mindset. Overall, we added seasoned leaders from very successful consumer technology companies. These leaders are joining us for our mission to bring cybersafety to every consumer around the world. We believe the company is uniquely positioned to seize that tremendous growth opportunity.
Our initial lever to restart the growth was to increase our marketing spend, which, as you know, is our main way to reach new consumers and educate them on the benefits of our solutions. As we maintain a consistent messaging level in the market, we saw increased efficacy.
Our overall customer acquisition costs continue to benefit not just from lower ad rates related to COVID but also from our own initiatives to shift marketing spend to new digital channels, including search, social media and digital video.
In terms of reach, despite the global strength of the Norton brand, we had not invested in international marketing in recent years. We reversed that in Q3 fiscal year '20, and we are beginning to see the results from those investments. The strategic shift in our marketing efforts have broadened our reach, and we are making steady progress in reaching younger and international customer cohorts.
As of the end of Q1, we counted 20.6 million customers who buy our products or services directly to our e-commerce platform. This represents an increase in net customer by 379,000 sequentially and 416,000 year-over-year.
Our Q1 growth was broad-based with growth across both the portfolio and the geographies. We grew both in the U.S. and internationally across all regions. The increase in international customer count outpaced that in the U.S., another first in a long time here.
Supported by trends like work from home, virtual meetings and online shopping and transacting, we saw both our security and identity product categories grow sequentially and year-over-year, another first in a very long time.
Our average revenue per user, or ARPU, remained strong at $9.03 per month even as we recorded strong net additions.
Our retention remained very strong as well at around 85%, suggesting that customers recognize the value and stay with us for a long time.
In addition to our direct business, which accounts for about 90% of our revenue, we also have a partner organization developing new ways of distributing our offering to individuals.
In Q1, we grew our indirect revenue 11% year-over-year. In retail, our performance on Amazon and other e-tailers offset the weakness from traditional stores being shut down or operating with limited hours. Our indirect sales also benefited from the strong performance of employee benefit programs, our fastest-growing partner channel. We are seeing strong growth from new employer acquisitions and greater participation within existing employers.
Furthermore, while we're still in the early stages, I'm also pleased to report progress in our long-term partnerships with organizations like TELUS and AARP. Although it takes time to develop and ramp up new relationships, we believe in the long-term potential to expand our reach and continue to grow.
Growing through new marketing channels and various forms of partnerships and consistently messaging our value proposition to them is extremely important. Our new Chief Commercial Officer, Robert Clarkson, has significant experience building out global partners and platforms over his tenure at PayPal. His passion is around consistently delivering the customer experience throughout the customer journey and lifetime. That is the reason we regrouped our direct, indirect and renewal sales organization under his leadership.
Our vision is to keep people around the world cyber safe. We believe it is our responsibility to provide everyone with innovative products and solutions to protect and control their digital lives. That vision was the impetus for creating the Norton 360 integrated platform, and we believe customers are starting to see it. The vast majority of new customers are now coming directly to Norton 360. And as of the end of Q1, over 40% of our installed base was on Norton 360, up from approximately 25% at the end of Q4.
This penetration is important as it enables us to offer comprehensive cybersafety and the one common experience to seamlessly upgrade our platform with new features like home title protection and to increase the engagement and with that, the retention of our customers.
Some of our platform features might continue to be offered as stand-alone products where it makes sense for our customers and helps accelerate the growth of our company. Last quarter, we talked about SurfEasy VPN as an example of a stand-alone product. This quarter, I want to share a new example that demonstrates how we constantly are looking at new ways to protect people and their highly dynamic digital lives.
Some customers want help limiting the public availability of their own personal data. Surf the web, and you will likely see that a lot of your personal information that you may not want out there is readily available, such as name, age, addresses, phone numbers.
Privacy Monitor, which is available as a feature with Norton 360 with Lifelock, scans for personally identifiable information, or PII, accessible on the most popular people search websites. But taking control of this data is tedious at best and often too complex. Recognizing this consumer need, we developed and beta-tested a product called Privacy Monitor Assistant. It's a white glove service where our agents, assisted by software, find and delete all your PII on this data broker website. Wouldn't you pay for a reasonable fee to secure your personal information?
It's still early, but we have seen positive response so far, and we think this capability has tremendous value for our customers. This is a good example of how we can continue to fulfill our vision by protecting our customers and enhancing the control they have over their digital lives. It's also a good example of how our service capability, combined with software, can differentiate us from competitors. We have a large customer base that constantly uses our service and provide us with insights we can turn into new features or products.
Growing through innovative products and solutions is key to fulfill our mission. That is why we have put product management and R&D under our new Chief Product Officer, Gagan Singh. Gagan has a passion for technology and, in particular, how artificial intelligence and machine learning can help build cutting-edge products. He was particularly interested in our internal research team and their capabilities.
This June, our research team released BotSight, which can be downloaded for free as a browser extension or iOS app in a targeted effort to enable people to identify disinformation on their Twitter feed. BotSight's technology is based on machine learning and leading-edge algorithm. It looks at over 20 different distinguishing features such as age of the account and tweet frequency to detect Twitter bots and show them directly on feed in real time. We are now looking to advance this technology and extend this capability to other use cases and threats.
Before I pass it to Natalie, let me take a minute to step back and talk about our vision to deliver cybersafety to every person across the globe. Even before the world was tossed into turmoil, our mission was relevant as the digital world is taking over how we work, learn, shop and basically live our lives. Now with COVID-19, our mission is more important than ever. Clearly, this pandemic has accelerated people's reliance on technology, and we are seeing the impact of that increased activity online to the number and variety of attacks on consumers.
Attackers have elevated their techniques on stealing information, disrupting sites and cascading malware through phishing attacks, camouflaged test tracing apps, social engineering for trained COVID vaccines and poisoned websites emulating stimulus benefits, all resulting in an increased need for security, identity protection and restoration and privacy solutions. These are just a few of examples of the many threats facing us now that more of our everyday activities are done digitally.
So while there is a lot of uncertainty at the macro level, one thing is certain: There is a real need for cybersafety for individuals, families and homes. Through innovative products and expanding distribution channels, our mission is to meet that need and provide cybersafety to everyone.
And with that, let me pass it to Natalie to give you more details on our Q1 financials."

Before I dive into our results, let me first say how excited I am to join NortonLifeLock. I am inspired by our mission to bring cybersafety to consumers worldwide, and I'm energized to help drive that mission in my new role.
Over the course of my career, I've chosen to join companies where the mission and the brand are focused on helping people in their everyday lives. From GE to Black & Decker to eBay and now NortonLifelock, albeit leaders in different industries, these brands were all built on establishing trust with and delivering intrinsic value to their customers.
Here at NortonLifelock, we must continue to deliver on our commitment to keeping consumers safe and in control of their digital lives. This commitment, combined with our incredible business model and opportunity to drive accelerating growth, is what drew me to NortonLifelock. I look forward to working with our team to achieve our strategic aspirations.
Now let me share our Q1 performance, focusing on non-GAAP results. Q1 revenue was better than expected at $614 million, up 4% year-over-year. Q1 reported billings was up 9% year-over-year, with a 2-point positive impact from FX in our ending contract liability balance. Billings growth was supported by growth in customer count, increasing approximately $400,000, both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. This was our third consecutive quarter of net customer adds and our first quarter of year-over-year growth in customer count in over 5 years.
Diluted EPS was $0.31, up 48% year-over-year and exceeded our guidance range driven by strong execution on top line growth and removal of stranded costs.
For the quarter, total company operating margin from continuing operations was 47%, burdened by approximately $30 million of stranded costs. Therefore, excluding stranded costs, the business is operating at over 51% operating margin with headcount below 2,500.
With approximately 95% of total stranded costs removed through Q1, we are lowering our estimate for cumulative cash stranded costs to $650 million, down from our $750 million projection last quarter. Q2 will be the last quarter with notable transition-related costs in our non-GAAP financials.
When the company first started this process 8 months ago, we said cash sales proceeds will fund the cash stranded costs. With strong execution on both costs and asset sales, we are now projecting to deliver over $1 billion more cash than initially forecasted.
As for the remaining sale of underutilized assets, we remain confident in our ability to reach our goal of $1.5 billion total cash proceeds. We are pleased to announce the recent sale of our Culver City real estate, which closed on July 27 for $120 million. As for our remaining underutilized assets, we remain focused, yet patient, on monetizing and realizing fair market value.
We had another strong quarter of operating cash flow. We generated $170 million of cash flow from operations and spent only $1 million in CapEx. Cash flow was burdened by some onetime items this quarter, most significantly about $100 million of stranded cash costs, which were partially offset by the timing of certain tax payments.
Adjusting for these nonrecurring items, the business is generating approximately $900 million of free cash flow on an annualized basis. We believe we are well capitalized with our Q1 ending cash balance at $1.1 billion and another $1 billion in our undrawn revolver.
With our strong balance sheet and cash flow, we continued to return cash to shareholders this quarter. We cash settled the principal and conversion rates of our $625 million convertible note, which lowered our debt to $3.625 billion and reduced diluted share count by over 30 million shares based on our Q1 average stock price. As a reminder, we still have approximately $600 million left of our $1.6 billion share buyback authorization, and we'll continue to use it opportunistically.
Now turning to our Q2 outlook. We expect Q2 non-GAAP revenue in the range of $615 million to $625 million, representing 3% to 5% growth after normalizing for the ID Analytics divestiture. We expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.31 to $0.35 per share, with the business operating at approximately 50% profit margin when excluding stranded costs.
Finally, I would like to thank Matt Brown for his leadership through the interim period and thank the entire team for their execution over the past 8 months. I look forward to building on the strong financial foundation we have and delivering consistent results for our shareholders.
Now let me turn the call back to Vincent for closing comments."

Or is this kind of like a delayed reaction from work from home?
Because you guys would see it a little bit later than kind of other people because you don't do the -- sort of the bundling with the OEM. So it's more about getting sort of more PCs out there and you guys do your marketing against them. Can you kind of help us understand kind of where that strength came from? And how much of it do you guys think is going to be durable on a go-forward basis in terms of just adding customers to the platform?"

And as I do that, we have to go back to where we're coming from, right? When we broke out and decided to focus solely on the consumer business,  our thesis has been that cybersafety will become more and more important for everyone as we move more and more of our activities online. And cybersafety doesn't just mean security, security for your device, security for your data. It also means privacy, protecting your identity and including services to restore it when it can't be prevented. So it's an overall umbrella that we know we have -- well, we are building in the long term. There are a lot of applications and fields that we still need to fill in that portfolio and build up the category. So we believe the thesis, if you want, is a long structural one. So that's number one.
Number two is the division at the time under Symantec had not invested in marketing, as we discussed in the past, and we reaccelerated marketing as a way to communicate our message to consumers. We raised our marketing envelope by $100 million on an annual basis. We also said that the efficacy of that marketing investment, if you want, has to swap over time as we consistently deliver and spend in market. And then we started to tweak that marketing investment, moving to new channels of marketing, moving to new regions, and starting to market in Europe, for example, where we had not marketed in the past. So those are contributors, if you want, for the return to growth.
Then we said, ""Hey, the most important is product."" In April 19, we launched the first version of Norton 360, an integrated platform addressing 4 pillars: security, privacy, identity, protection and restoration and you entirely, family and homes, if you want. And we still are in the process of rolling that out. I believe it's very attractive for consumer to adopt that overall umbrella for a membership fee having access to all of those areas and having a peace of mind.
And then the last one is -- then COVID-19 happened. And definitely, it changed the way people operate online. Is it a peak change? Or is it a step function? I don't know. But we believe in the long-term view of building up our portfolio and creating awareness to drive growth."

I think we've proven we can operate at these levels. We reduced the headcount from the Symantec company, 12,000 people, to today where our business model should be around 2,500. And for this first time in a long time, we shifted from restructuring to hiring talent where it makes sense. And I can tell you, it's definitely energizing for the entire company to talk about hiring the right talent, the right skill set.
We are hiring engineers in Dublin, where we're trying to create a prototype lab over there. We're hiring in threat analytics. So we definitely are building up the functions. We have a few new leaders. I mentioned Gagan and his passion around machine learning. Robert came in and has a passion around the customer life cycle.

And then in terms of demography and reaching out, we're moving from traditional form of marketing into newer forms, social media, digital videos. I was looking obviously at quarter in, quarter out. You cannot always map it. But I was looking at the long trend, 2 years trend. If you look at 2018, our Gen X plus baby boomers were over 70% of our total customers.

And good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Since we closed the sales of the enterprise business, we committed to return to customer growth, drive sustainable revenue growth, complete an overhaul of the cost structure and deliver a healthy profit.
In just our second full quarter as NortonLifeLock, our first quarter of fiscal year 2021, we delivered better-than-expected results with strong reported billings growth of 9%, revenue growth of 4% and EPS growth of 48% year-over-year.
As we created NortonLifeLock, we believe in the potential of a business solely focused on building personal cybersafety for consumers. We initially set our sights on sustainably and meaningfully growing customer count and delivering revenue growth in the mid-single digits.
In Q1, we delivered both sequential and year-over-year 400,000 net new customers, a first since 2014. Revenue growth was 4%, meeting the long-term objective of mid-single digits in just our second full quarter.
At the end of June, we eliminated 95% of the stranded costs, and we expect to be done this month, 1 quarter ahead of plan. In Q1, included stranded costs, we reached 47% operating margin for the company, up 15 points year-over-year, and expect to reach 50% by September, another one of our commitments.
If you exclude the stranded costs, the Consumer business has been running above 51%, better than our operating margin target of 50%.
Our Q1 EPS was $0.31, which included a $0.04 impact from stranded costs and is up $0.10 year-over-year. By the end of this fiscal year, we expect to run the business at our target of $1.50 annualized EPS, which can be achieved by virtue of mid-single-digit revenue growth, operating margin above 50% or utilizing our remaining $600 million share buyback program or some combination of any or all of them.
Finally, we projected to run the company at $900 million annualized free cash flow after the transition period. While we have been and are running at that level in Q1, excluding cash spent on stranded costs, we are tracking for those levels to be reflected in our cash flow statement once our financials are clean of stranded costs in the second half of this year.
As we demonstrated the operational discipline with which we want to continue to operate, we made it a priority to build out our post-transition leadership team. This quarter, we welcomed new and accomplished leaders with deep experience in consumer technology. Natalie, who you will hear from in a minute, brings operational skills with a growth mindset. Overall, we added seasoned leaders from very successful consumer technology companies. These leaders are joining us for our mission to bring cybersafety to every consumer around the world. We believe the company is uniquely positioned to seize that tremendous growth opportunity.
Our initial lever to restart the growth was to increase our marketing spend, which, as you know, is our main way to reach new consumers and educate them on the benefits of our solutions. As we maintain a consistent messaging level in the market, we saw increased efficacy.
Our overall customer acquisition costs continue to benefit not just from lower ad rates related to COVID but also from our own initiatives to shift marketing spend to new digital channels, including search, social media and digital video.
In terms of reach, despite the global strength of the Norton brand, we had not invested in international marketing in recent years. We reversed that in Q3 fiscal year '20, and we are beginning to see the results from those investments. The strategic shift in our marketing efforts have broadened our reach, and we are making steady progress in reaching younger and international customer cohorts.
As of the end of Q1, we counted 20.6 million customers who buy our products or services directly to our e-commerce platform. This represents an increase in net customer by 379,000 sequentially and 416,000 year-over-year.
Our Q1 growth was broad-based with growth across both the portfolio and the geographies. We grew both in the U.S. and internationally across all regions. The increase in international customer count outpaced that in the U.S., another first in a long time here.
Supported by trends like work from home, virtual meetings and online shopping and transacting, we saw both our security and identity product categories grow sequentially and year-over-year, another first in a very long time.
Our average revenue per user, or ARPU, remained strong at $9.03 per month even as we recorded strong net additions.
Our retention remained very strong as well at around 85%, suggesting that customers recognize the value and stay with us for a long time.
In addition to our direct business, which accounts for about 90% of our revenue, we also have a partner organization developing new ways of distributing our offering to individuals.
In Q1, we grew our indirect revenue 11% year-over-year. In retail, our performance on Amazon and other e-tailers offset the weakness from traditional stores being shut down or operating with limited hours. Our indirect sales also benefited from the strong performance of employee benefit programs, our fastest-growing partner channel. We are seeing strong growth from new employer acquisitions and greater participation within existing employers.
Furthermore, while we're still in the early stages, I'm also pleased to report progress in our long-term partnerships with organizations like TELUS and AARP. Although it takes time to develop and ramp up new relationships, we believe in the long-term potential to expand our reach and continue to grow.
Growing through new marketing channels and various forms of partnerships and consistently messaging our value proposition to them is extremely important. Our new Chief Commercial Officer, Robert Clarkson, has significant experience building out global partners and platforms over his tenure at PayPal. His passion is around consistently delivering the customer experience throughout the customer journey and lifetime. That is the reason we regrouped our direct, indirect and renewal sales organization under his leadership.
Our vision is to keep people around the world cyber safe. We believe it is our responsibility to provide everyone with innovative products and solutions to protect and control their digital lives. That vision was the impetus for creating the Norton 360 integrated platform, and we believe customers are starting to see it. The vast majority of new customers are now coming directly to Norton 360. And as of the end of Q1, over 40% of our installed base was on Norton 360, up from approximately 25% at the end of Q4.
This penetration is important as it enables us to offer comprehensive cybersafety and the one common experience to seamlessly upgrade our platform with new features like home title protection and to increase the engagement and with that, the retention of our customers.
Some of our platform features might continue to be offered as stand-alone products where it makes sense for our customers and helps accelerate the growth of our company. Last quarter, we talked about SurfEasy VPN as an example of a stand-alone product. This quarter, I want to share a new example that demonstrates how we constantly are looking at new ways to protect people and their highly dynamic digital lives.
Some customers want help limiting the public availability of their own personal data. Surf the web, and you will likely see that a lot of your personal information that you may not want out there is readily available, such as name, age, addresses, phone numbers.
Privacy Monitor, which is available as a feature with Norton 360 with LifeLock, scans for personally identifiable information, or PII, accessible on the most popular people search websites. But taking control of this data is tedious at best and often too complex. Recognizing this consumer need, we developed and beta-tested a product called Privacy Monitor Assistant. It's a white glove service where our agents, assisted by software, find and delete all your PII on this data broker website. Wouldn't you pay for a reasonable fee to secure your personal information?
It's still early, but we have seen positive response so far, and we think this capability has tremendous value for our customers. This is a good example of how we can continue to fulfill our vision by protecting our customers and enhancing the control they have over their digital lives. It's also a good example of how our service capability, combined with software, can differentiate us from competitors. We have a large customer base that constantly uses our service and provide us with insights we can turn into new features or products.
Growing through innovative products and solutions is key to fulfill our mission. That is why we have put product management and R&D under our new Chief Product Officer, Gagan Singh. Gagan has a passion for technology and, in particular, how artificial intelligence and machine learning can help build cutting-edge products. He was particularly interested in our internal research team and their capabilities.
This June, our research team released BotSight, which can be downloaded for free as a browser extension or iOS app in a targeted effort to enable people to identify disinformation on their Twitter feed. BotSight's technology is based on machine learning and leading-edge algorithm. It looks at over 20 different distinguishing features such as age of the account and tweet frequency to detect Twitter bots and show them directly on feed in real time. We are now looking to advance this technology and extend this capability to other use cases and threats.
Before I pass it to Natalie, let me take a minute to step back and talk about our vision to deliver cybersafety to every person across the globe. Even before the world was tossed into turmoil, our mission was relevant as the digital world is taking over how we work, learn, shop and basically live our lives. Now with COVID-19, our mission is more important than ever. Clearly, this pandemic has accelerated people's reliance on technology, and we are seeing the impact of that increased activity online to the number and variety of attacks on consumers.
Attackers have elevated their techniques on stealing information, disrupting sites and cascading malware through phishing attacks, camouflaged test tracing apps, social engineering for trained COVID vaccines and poisoned websites emulating stimulus benefits, all resulting in an increased need for security, identity protection and restoration and privacy solutions. These are just a few of examples of the many threats facing us now that more of our everyday activities are done digitally.
So while there is a lot of uncertainty at the macro level, one thing is certain: There is a real need for cybersafety for individuals, families and homes. Through innovative products and expanding distribution channels, our mission is to meet that need and provide cybersafety to everyone.
And with that, let me pass it to Natalie to give you more details on our Q1 financials."

Before I dive into our results, let me first say how excited I am to join NortonLifeLock. I am inspired by our mission to bring cybersafety to consumers worldwide, and I'm energized to help drive that mission in my new role.
Over the course of my career, I've chosen to join companies where the mission and the brand are focused on helping people in their everyday lives. From GE to Black & Decker to eBay and now NortonLifeLock, albeit leaders in different industries, these brands were all built on establishing trust with and delivering intrinsic value to their customers.
Here at NortonLifeLock, we must continue to deliver on our commitment to keeping consumers safe and in control of their digital lives. This commitment, combined with our incredible business model and opportunity to drive accelerating growth, is what drew me to NortonLifeLock. I look forward to working with our team to achieve our strategic aspirations.
Now let me share our Q1 performance, focusing on non-GAAP results. Q1 revenue was better than expected at $614 million, up 4% year-over-year. Q1 reported billings was up 9% year-over-year, with a 2-point positive impact from FX in our ending contract liability balance. Billings growth was supported by growth in customer count, increasing approximately $400,000, both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. This was our third consecutive quarter of net customer adds and our first quarter of year-over-year growth in customer count in over 5 years.
Diluted EPS was $0.31, up 48% year-over-year and exceeded our guidance range driven by strong execution on top line growth and removal of stranded costs.
For the quarter, total company operating margin from continuing operations was 47%, burdened by approximately $30 million of stranded costs. Therefore, excluding stranded costs, the business is operating at over 51% operating margin with headcount below 2,500.
With approximately 95% of total stranded costs removed through Q1, we are lowering our estimate for cumulative cash stranded costs to $650 million, down from our $750 million projection last quarter. Q2 will be the last quarter with notable transition-related costs in our non-GAAP financials.
When the company first started this process 8 months ago, we said cash sales proceeds will fund the cash stranded costs. With strong execution on both costs and asset sales, we are now projecting to deliver over $1 billion more cash than initially forecasted.
As for the remaining sale of underutilized assets, we remain confident in our ability to reach our goal of $1.5 billion total cash proceeds. We are pleased to announce the recent sale of our Culver City real estate, which closed on July 27 for $120 million. As for our remaining underutilized assets, we remain focused, yet patient, on monetizing and realizing fair market value.
We had another strong quarter of operating cash flow. We generated $170 million of cash flow from operations and spent only $1 million in CapEx. Cash flow was burdened by some onetime items this quarter, most significantly about $100 million of stranded cash costs, which were partially offset by the timing of certain tax payments.
Adjusting for these nonrecurring items, the business is generating approximately $900 million of free cash flow on an annualized basis. We believe we are well capitalized with our Q1 ending cash balance at $1.1 billion and another $1 billion in our undrawn revolver.
With our strong balance sheet and cash flow, we continued to return cash to shareholders this quarter. We cash settled the principal and conversion rates of our $625 million convertible note, which lowered our debt to $3.625 billion and reduced diluted share count by over 30 million shares based on our Q1 average stock price. As a reminder, we still have approximately $600 million left of our $1.6 billion share buyback authorization, and we'll continue to use it opportunistically.
Now turning to our Q2 outlook. We expect Q2 non-GAAP revenue in the range of $615 million to $625 million, representing 3% to 5% growth after normalizing for the ID Analytics divestiture. We expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.31 to $0.35 per share, with the business operating at approximately 50% profit margin when excluding stranded costs.
Finally, I would like to thank Matt Brown for his leadership through the interim period and thank the entire team for their execution over the past 8 months. I look forward to building on the strong financial foundation we have and delivering consistent results for our shareholders.
Now let me turn the call back to Vincent for closing comments."

I am proud to say we have delivered on all of our initial commitments.
But as we have increased our execution capabilities, our ambitions have also grown. We have our sights set on our mission. Consumers are beset by constantly evolving cyber threats. Our current platform is just scratching the surface of what can be done, and we're now singularly focused on innovating on our consumer cybersafety vision.
We have a large engaged customer base, terrific technology capabilities an innovation pipeline and significant financial resources.

Or is this kind of like a delayed reaction from work from home?
Because you guys would see it a little bit later than kind of other people because you don't do the -- sort of the bundling with the OEM. So it's more about getting sort of more PCs out there and you guys do your marketing against them. Can you kind of help us understand kind of where that strength came from?

And as I do that, we have to go back to where we're coming from, right? When we broke out and decided to focus solely on the consumer business, our thesis has been that cybersafety will become more and more important for everyone as we move more and more of our activities online. And cybersafety doesn't just mean security, security for your device, security for your data. It also means privacy, protecting your identity and including services to restore it when it can't be prevented. So it's an overall umbrella that we know we have -- well, we are building in the long term. There are a lot of applications and fields that we still need to fill in that portfolio and build up the category. So we believe the thesis, if you want, is a long structural one. So that's number one.
Number two is the division at the time under Symantec had not invested in marketing, as we discussed in the past, and we reaccelerated marketing as a way to communicate our message to consumers. We raised our marketing envelope by $100 million on an annual basis. We also said that the efficacy of that marketing investment, if you want, has to swap over time as we consistently deliver and spend in market. And then we started to tweak that marketing investment, moving to new channels of marketing, moving to new regions, and starting to market in Europe, for example, where we had not marketed in the past. So those are contributors, if you want, for the return to growth.
Then we said, ""Hey, the most important is product."" In April 19, we launched the first version of Norton 360, an integrated platform addressing 4 pillars: security, privacy, identity, protection and restoration and you entirely, family and homes, if you want. And we still are in the process of rolling that out. I believe it's very attractive for consumer to adopt that overall umbrella for a membership fee having access to all of those areas and having a peace of mind.
And then the last one is -- then COVID-19 happened. And definitely, it changed the way people operate online. Is it a peak change? Or is it a step function? I don't know. But we believe in the long-term view of building up our portfolio and creating awareness to drive growth."

And for this first time in a long time, we shifted from restructuring to hiring talent where it makes sense. And I can tell you, it's definitely energizing for the entire company to talk about hiring the right talent, the right skill set.
We are hiring engineers in Dublin, where we're trying to create a prototype lab over there. We're hiring in threat analytics. So we definitely are building up the functions.

And good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Since we closed the sales of the enterprise business, we committed to return to customer growth, drive sustainable revenue growth, complete an overhaul of the cost structure and deliver a healthy profit.
In just our second full quarter as NortonLifeLock, our first quarter of fiscal year 2021, we delivered better-than-expected results with strong reported billings growth of 9%, revenue growth of 4% and EPS growth of 48% year-over-year.
As we created NortonLifeLock, we believe in the potential of a business solely focused on building personal cybersafety for consumers. We initially set our sights on sustainably and meaningfully growing customer count and delivering revenue growth in the mid-single digits.
In Q1, we delivered both sequential and year-over-year 400,000 net new customers, a first since 2014. Revenue growth was 4%, meeting the long-term objective of mid-single digits in just our second full quarter.
At the end of June, we eliminated 95% of the stranded costs, and we expect to be done this month, 1 quarter ahead of plan. In Q1, included stranded costs, we reached 47% operating margin for the company, up 15 points year-over-year, and expect to reach 50% by September, another one of our commitments.
If you exclude the stranded costs, the Consumer business has been running above 51%, better than our operating margin target of 50%.
Our Q1 EPS was $0.31, which included a $0.04 impact from stranded costs and is up $0.10 year-over-year. By the end of this fiscal year, we expect to run the business at our target of $1.50 annualized EPS, which can be achieved by virtue of mid-single-digit revenue growth, operating margin above 50% or utilizing our remaining $600 million share buyback program or some combination of any or all of them.
Finally, we projected to run the company at $900 million annualized free cash flow after the transition period. While we have been and are running at that level in Q1, excluding cash spent on stranded costs, we are tracking for those levels to be reflected in our cash flow statement once our financials are clean of stranded costs in the second half of this year.
As we demonstrated the operational discipline with which we want to continue to operate, we made it a priority to build out our post-transition leadership team. This quarter, we welcomed new and accomplished leaders with deep experience in consumer technology. Natalie, who you will hear from in a minute, brings operational skills with a growth mindset. Overall, we added seasoned leaders from very successful consumer technology companies. These leaders are joining us for our mission to bring cybersafety to every consumer around the world. We believe the company is uniquely positioned to seize that tremendous growth opportunity.
Our initial lever to restart the growth was to increase our marketing spend, which, as you know, is our main way to reach new consumers and educate them on the benefits of our solutions. As we maintain a consistent messaging level in the market, we saw increased efficacy.
Our overall customer acquisition costs continue to benefit not just from lower ad rates related to COVID but also from our own initiatives to shift marketing spend to new digital channels, including search, social media and digital video.
In terms of reach, despite the global strength of the Norton brand, we had not invested in international marketing in recent years. We reversed that in Q3 fiscal year '20, and we are beginning to see the results from those investments. The strategic shift in our marketing efforts have broadened our reach, and we are making steady progress in reaching younger and international customer cohorts.
As of the end of Q1, we counted 20.6 million customers who buy our products or services directly to our e-commerce platform. This represents an increase in net customer by 379,000 sequentially and 416,000 year-over-year.
Our Q1 growth was broad-based with growth across both the portfolio and the geographies. We grew both in the U.S. and internationally across all regions. The increase in international customer count outpaced that in the U.S., another first in a long time here.
Supported by trends like work from home, virtual meetings and online shopping and transacting, we saw both our security and identity product categories grow sequentially and year-over-year, another first in a very long time.
Our average revenue per user, or ARPU, remained strong at $9.03 per month even as we recorded strong net additions.
Our retention remained very strong as well at around 85%, suggesting that customers recognize the value and stay with us for a long time.
In addition to our direct business, which accounts for about 90% of our revenue, we also have a partner organization developing new ways of distributing our offering to individuals.
In Q1, we grew our indirect revenue 11% year-over-year. In retail, our performance on Amazon and other e-tailers offset the weakness from traditional stores being shut down or operating with limited hours. Our indirect sales also benefited from the strong performance of employee benefit programs, our fastest-growing partner channel. We are seeing strong growth from new employer acquisitions and greater participation within existing employers.
Furthermore, while we're still in the early stages, I'm also pleased to report progress in our long-term partnerships with organizations like TELUS and AARP. Although it takes time to develop and ramp up new relationships, we believe in the long-term potential to expand our reach and continue to grow.
Growing through new marketing channels and various forms of partnerships and consistently messaging our value proposition to them is extremely important. Our new Chief Commercial Officer, Robert Clarkson, has significant experience building out global partners and platforms over his tenure at PayPal. His passion is around consistently delivering the customer experience throughout the customer journey and lifetime. That is the reason we regrouped our direct, indirect and renewal sales organization under his leadership.
Our vision is to keep people around the world cyber safe. We believe it is our responsibility to provide everyone with innovative products and solutions to protect and control their digital lives. That vision was the impetus for creating the Norton 360 integrated platform, and we believe customers are starting to see it. The vast majority of new customers are now coming directly to Norton 360. And as of the end of Q1, over 40% of our installed base was on Norton 360, up from approximately 25% at the end of Q4.
This penetration is important as it enables us to offer comprehensive cybersafety and the one common experience to seamlessly upgrade our platform with new features like home title protection and to increase the engagement and with that, the retention of our customers.
Some of our platform features might continue to be offered as stand-alone products where it makes sense for our customers and helps accelerate the growth of our company. Last quarter, we talked about SurfEasy VPN as an example of a stand-alone product. This quarter, I want to share a new example that demonstrates how we constantly are looking at new ways to protect people and their highly dynamic digital lives.
Some customers want help limiting the public availability of their own personal data. Surf the web, and you will likely see that a lot of your personal information that you may not want out there is readily available, such as name, age, addresses, phone numbers.
Privacy Monitor, which is available as a feature with Norton 360 with LifeLock, scans for personally identifiable information, or PII, accessible on the most popular people search websites. But taking control of this data is tedious at best and often too complex. Recognizing this consumer need, we developed and beta-tested a product called Privacy Monitor Assistant. It's a white glove service where our agents, assisted by software, find and delete all your PII on this data broker website. Wouldn't you pay for a reasonable fee to secure your personal information?
It's still early, but we have seen positive response so far, and we think this capability has tremendous value for our customers. This is a good example of how we can continue to fulfill our vision by protecting our customers and enhancing the control they have over their digital lives. It's also a good example of how our service capability, combined with software, can differentiate us from competitors. We have a large customer base that constantly uses our service and provide us with insights we can turn into new features or products.
Growing through innovative products and solutions is key to fulfill our mission. That is why we have put product management and R&D under our new Chief Product Officer, Gagan Singh. Gagan has a passion for technology and, in particular, how artificial intelligence and machine learning can help build cutting-edge products. He was particularly interested in our internal research team and their capabilities.
This June, our research team released BotSight, which can be downloaded for free as a browser extension or iOS app in a targeted effort to enable people to identify disinformation on their Twitter feed. BotSight's technology is based on machine learning and leading-edge algorithm. It looks at over 20 different distinguishing features such as age of the account and tweet frequency to detect Twitter bots and show them directly on feed in real time. We are now looking to advance this technology and extend this capability to other use cases and threats.
Before I pass it to Natalie, let me take a minute to step back and talk about our vision to deliver cybersafety to every person across the globe. Even before the world was tossed into turmoil, our mission was relevant as the digital world is taking over how we work, learn, shop and basically live our lives. Now with COVID-19, our mission is more important than ever. Clearly, this pandemic has accelerated people's reliance on technology, and we are seeing the impact of that increased activity online to the number and variety of attacks on consumers.
Attackers have elevated their techniques on stealing information, disrupting sites and cascading malware through phishing attacks, camouflaged test tracing apps, social engineering for trained COVID vaccines and poisoned websites emulating stimulus benefits, all resulting in an increased need for security, identity protection and restoration and privacy solutions. These are just a few of examples of the many threats facing us now that more of our everyday activities are done digitally.
So while there is a lot of uncertainty at the macro level, one thing is certain: There is a real need for cybersafety for individuals, families and homes. Through innovative products and expanding distribution channels, our mission is to meet that need and provide cybersafety to everyone.
And with that, let me pass it to Natalie to give you more details on our Q1 financials."

Before I dive into our results, let me first say how excited I am to join NortonLifeLock. I am inspired by our mission to bring cybersafety to consumers worldwide, and I'm energized to help drive that mission in my new role.
Over the course of my career, I've chosen to join companies where the mission and the brand are focused on helping people in their everyday lives. From GE to Black & Decker to eBay and now NortonLifeLock, albeit leaders in different industries, these brands were all built on establishing trust with and delivering intrinsic value to their customers.
Here at NortonLifeLock, we must continue to deliver on our commitment to keeping consumers safe and in control of their digital lives. This commitment, combined with our incredible business model and opportunity to drive accelerating growth, is what drew me to NortonLifeLock. I look forward to working with our team to achieve our strategic aspirations.
Now let me share our Q1 performance, focusing on non-GAAP results. Q1 revenue was better than expected at $614 million, up 4% year-over-year. Q1 reported billings was up 9% year-over-year, with a 2-point positive impact from FX in our ending contract liability balance. Billings growth was supported by growth in customer count, increasing approximately $400,000, both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. This was our third consecutive quarter of net customer adds and our first quarter of year-over-year growth in customer count in over 5 years.
Diluted EPS was $0.31, up 48% year-over-year and exceeded our guidance range driven by strong execution on top line growth and removal of stranded costs.
For the quarter, total company operating margin from continuing operations was 47%, burdened by approximately $30 million of stranded costs. Therefore, excluding stranded costs, the business is operating at over 51% operating margin with headcount below 2,500.
With approximately 95% of total stranded costs removed through Q1, we are lowering our estimate for cumulative cash stranded costs to $650 million, down from our $750 million projection last quarter. Q2 will be the last quarter with notable transition-related costs in our non-GAAP financials.
When the company first started this process 8 months ago, we said cash sales proceeds will fund the cash stranded costs. With strong execution on both costs and asset sales, we are now projecting to deliver over $1 billion more cash than initially forecasted.
As for the remaining sale of underutilized assets, we remain confident in our ability to reach our goal of $1.5 billion total cash proceeds. We are pleased to announce the recent sale of our Culver City real estate, which closed on July 27 for $120 million. As for our remaining underutilized assets, we remain focused, yet patient, on monetizing and realizing fair market value.
We had another strong quarter of operating cash flow. We generated $170 million of cash flow from operations and spent only $1 million in CapEx. Cash flow was burdened by some onetime items this quarter, most significantly about $100 million of stranded cash costs, which were partially offset by the timing of certain tax payments.
Adjusting for these nonrecurring items, the business is generating approximately $900 million of free cash flow on an annualized basis. We believe we are well capitalized with our Q1 ending cash balance at $1.1 billion and another $1 billion in our undrawn revolver.
With our strong balance sheet and cash flow, we continued to return cash to shareholders this quarter. We cash settled the principal and conversion rates of our $625 million convertible note, which lowered our debt to $3.625 billion and reduced diluted share count by over 30 million shares based on our Q1 average stock price. As a reminder, we still have approximately $600 million left of our $1.6 billion share buyback authorization, and we'll continue to use it opportunistically.
Now turning to our Q2 outlook. We expect Q2 non-GAAP revenue in the range of $615 million to $625 million, representing 3% to 5% growth after normalizing for the ID Analytics divestiture. We expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.31 to $0.35 per share, with the business operating at approximately 50% profit margin when excluding stranded costs.
Finally, I would like to thank Matt Brown for his leadership through the interim period and thank the entire team for their execution over the past 8 months. I look forward to building on the strong financial foundation we have and delivering consistent results for our shareholders.
Now let me turn the call back to Vincent for closing comments."

I am proud to say we have delivered on all of our initial commitments.
But as we have increased our execution capabilities, our ambitions have also grown. We have our sights set on our mission. Consumers are beset by constantly evolving cyber threats. Our current platform is just scratching the surface of what can be done, and we're now singularly focused on innovating on our consumer cybersafety vision.
We have a large engaged customer base, terrific technology capabilities an innovation pipeline and significant financial resources. Combine these things with recurring revenue, high margins and significant cash flow, and you can see why I'm super optimistic about our future and long-term growth potential.

Because you guys would see it a little bit later than kind of other people because you don't do the -- sort of the bundling with the OEM.

And as I do that, we have to go back to where we're coming from, right? When we broke out and decided to focus solely on the consumer business, our thesis has been that cybersafety will become more and more important for everyone as we move more and more of our activities online. And cybersafety doesn't just mean security, security for your device, security for your data. It also means privacy, protecting your identity and including services to restore it when it can't be prevented. So it's an overall umbrella that we know we have -- well, we are building in the long term. There are a lot of applications and fields that we still need to fill in that portfolio and build up the category. So we believe the thesis, if you want, is a long structural one. So that's number one.
Number two is the division at the time under Symantec had not invested in marketing, as we discussed in the past, and we reaccelerated marketing as a way to communicate our message to consumers. We raised our marketing envelope by $100 million on an annual basis. We also said that the efficacy of that marketing investment, if you want, has to swap over time as we consistently deliver and spend in market. And then we started to tweak that marketing investment, moving to new channels of marketing, moving to new regions, and starting to market in Europe, for example, where we had not marketed in the past. So those are contributors, if you want, for the return to growth.
Then we said, ""Hey, the most important is product."" In April 19, we launched the first version of Norton 360, an integrated platform addressing 4 pillars: security, privacy, identity, protection and restoration and you entirely, family and homes, if you want. And we still are in the process of rolling that out. I believe it's very attractive for consumer to adopt that overall umbrella for a membership fee having access to all of those areas and having a peace of mind.
And then the last one is -- then COVID-19 happened. And definitely, it changed the way people operate online. Is it a peak change? Or is it a step function? I don't know. But we believe in the long-term view of building up our portfolio and creating awareness to drive growth."

I think we've proven we can operate at these levels. We reduced the headcount from the Symantec company, 12,000 people, to today where our business model should be around 2,500. And for this first time in a long time, we shifted from restructuring to hiring talent where it makes sense. And I can tell you, it's definitely energizing for the entire company to talk about hiring the right talent, the right skill set.
We are hiring engineers in Dublin, where we're trying to create a prototype lab over there. We're hiring in threat analytics. So we definitely are building up the functions.

And then in terms of demography and reaching out, we're moving from traditional form of marketing into newer forms, social media, digital videos. I was looking obviously at quarter in, quarter out. You cannot always map it. But I was looking at the long trend, 2 years trend. If you look at 2018, our Gen X plus baby boomers were over 70% of our total customers.

Good afternoon, everyone. I hope you are all safe and well. Before we begin, I want to thank our employees and our partners for their hard work and dedication to help protect consumers as more and more of our everyday lives move online. We know that cyber criminals are taking advantage of this shift, and I'm proud of our team for continuing to design products and release features that support our vision of cyber safety for everyone. And to our loyal 50 million customers, thank you for trusting us to secure a growing portion of your digital activities. 
In Q2, we delivered reported billings growth of 7%, revenue growth of 5% and EPS growth of 100%, closing out a strong first half of FY '21. 
Our revenue now exceeds $2.5 billion in annualized run rate, and we are beginning to string together strong quarters where we meet our target of mid- single-digit revenue growth while at the same time, delivering solid operating leverage. 
Let me unpack a little bit on the top line. Our direct-to-consumer business, which represents 90% of our business, was up 5% in Q2, with broad-based growth across the entire portfolio. We now have over half of our installed base on Norton 360, and we will continue to release new products, such as Dark Web Monitoring or Privacy Monitor Assistant, either as add-on features or stand alone products. Our goal is to constantly bring new value to our subscribers around the globe and keep them cyber safe across their growing digital activities. We also continue to invest and expand internationally with international growth slightly ahead of the Americas. Direct acquisition grew double digits in many countries such as the U.K., Italy and Spain and Europe, and Australia and Japan in APG, just to name a few. 
With less than 30% of our revenues outside North America, we remain relatively underpenetrated in many countries offering us an opportunity to broaden our reach. Partner revenue, which represent 10% of our business and includes relationships with telcos, retailers and employee benefits brokers, grew 7% in Q2. While retail remained weak during this period, we delivered double-digit growth in the employee benefits program with strong signings of new employers and strong retention rates across broad sectors. Overall, we continue to develop our partner relationships to increase the reach of our solutions to all consumers. We are currently working on rolling out and expanding our solutions with some of our more recently announced partners like ARP in U.S. or TELUS in Canada. Internationally, this quarter, we also signed a telco deal in Europe and had a key retail win in Japan. These relationships take time to build, but they are an important part of our long-term growth opportunity. 
As you all know, we've put a lot of focus on growing our direct customer count, which now totals 20.7 million. This quarter marks our fourth consecutive quarter of net customer adds sequentially and and the second consecutive quarter of net adds year-over-year. Since we became a stand-alone consumer company a year ago, we have welcomed over 3.5 million new customers. While we know this is just a drop in the bucket compared to the opportunity to bring cyber safety to everyone, it is a meaningful change from the years of declining customer count when we were part of Symantec. Our customer retention rate, a unit retention metric, remained stable at 85%, and a monthly average revenue per user remained strong at over $9. 
Our integrated platform, Norton 360, resonates well with consumers who face multiple challenges to their digitalized and preferred comprehensive protection plans. We will continue to drive customer acquisition and engagement through marketing investments, partnerships and more importantly, product innovation. We are focused on both developing great products and bringing an integrated platform to consumers to provide cyber safety while we work, learn, shop or socialize online. 
For example, with the rise of gaming and e-sports, we saw an opportunity to help gamers protect and control their accounts, the personals and digital goods. We developed a customized solution, Norton 360, for gamers designed by fellow gamers at NortonLifeLock. We know gamers prefer to focus on playing, not worrying about cyber criminals, so we felt there was a real need to bring comprehensive cyber safety to the gaming world. While our solution delivers many of the features you would expect like threat detection, firewall and password manager, we've gone further and included Dark Web Monitoring for gamer tags a first for the industry. With this feature, we will monitor and notify you if we find your personal information on the dark web, including new game attacks, user IDs or passwords, protecting new virtual boots acquired in games. 
Another dramatic change in our everyday lives has been in how kids learn, whether it be for school or other educational activities, so much more of this is now done online. Our recent study shows that the majority of pans say they kid screen time is skyrocketed during the COVID-19 pandemic. And unfortunately, over half of the parents said that they now just accept risks to their child's online safety. To help make life a bit easier for parents, this quarter, we introduced Norton 360 with Lifelock for family, an all-in 1 plan to help protect the entire families, devices, identities and online privacy through 1 subscription fee. 
This family plan also includes a new feature all-school time, which helps children stay focused on school work, while remote learning by managing access to the broader web. So sorry to kids, no gaming during school hours. 
While the threat posed by the availability of your personal information online is not new, the shift of more and more of our lives online makes privacy as important as ever. Recently, we've expanded our privacy offering with Privacy Monitor Assistant and made it easier for consumers to reclaim control of their personal information and defend against identity test. Data brokers collect and profit from all your data, they compile such as home address, phone number, employment information and social media profiles. Privacy Monitor Assistant helps automate and take the guess work out of removing new personal information from the Internet. 
These are just a few examples of how our innovations are keeping consumer cyber safe. And there's definitely more to come as we build cyber safety for everyone. Growth and innovation are our primary focus. But it's worth noting that as of the end of August, we had removed all stranded costs related to the sales of our enterprise business. This was 4 months ahead of plan. I want to thank our transition team for making it possible and we're now building operational execution into our DNA. And with the transition behind us, we have reaffirmed our partnership with Broadcom by licensing the Symantec enterprise software and security engines as well as continued sharing threat telemetry and analytics. We are very well positioned for the future. 
Before I pass it to Nathalie, I also want to recognize our responsibility to help create a safe and sustainable future. Yesterday, we released our first corporate responsibility report as NortonLifeLock. We encourage you to read the report and learn about how we view corporate responsibility and support our communities. Those efforts were just recognized last month by Forbes and Just Capital. It is an honor to be named 1 of America's most just companies and be recognized for our commitment to serve all stakeholders with integrity, and accountability. 
We also know we have so much more we can do in this area, and we will stay committed to corporate responsibility and contributing to building a cyber safe world. 
And now let me turn the call over to Nathalie for more details on the financial results. Natalie?"

For today's discussion, I will focus on non GAAP financials, starting with our Q2 results and then provide our outlook for Q3. Q2 performance was better than expected.

For today's discussion, I will focus on non GAAP financials, starting with our Q2 results and then provide our outlook for Q3. Q2 performance was better than expected. We delivered growth year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter on many key metrics. Our Q2 revenue was $626 million, up 5% year-over-year, excluding ID analytics. Q2 reported billings was up 7% year-over-year, including a 2-point positive impact from FX in our ending contract liability balance. We continue to gain momentum in both our direct and partner business. This was our fifth consecutive quarter of mid-single-digit billings growth, another step in building our consistent and sustainable track record as a stand-alone company. We increased our total direct customer count to 20.7 million, adding 117,000 customers sequentially quarter-over-quarter and adding 608,000 customers year-over-year. 
We saw customer expansion across our regions and key product categories within security and identity. Overall, our customer count growth is highly correlated with our go-to-market efforts, including our increased marketing investment. Our priority is to invest for sustainable growth, and we have seen record customer acquisition these past couple of quarters. 
We are still in the early innings of evaluating changes in our customer cohort dynamics, but we remain committed to our marketing investments, so long as we continue to see the opportunity for growth. We will not take our foot off the gas pedal. We will continue to invest in developing our product offering portfolio and drive awareness and demand efficiency through our marketing and sales channels. 
In our partner business, revenue grew 7% year-over-year, largely driven by the continued momentum in our employee benefits channel that Vincent alluded to earlier. We are also continued to make progress on some of our more recently announced partnerships. For example, TELUS is starting to roll out our solutions nationally across Canada, expanding beyond the provinces of Alberta and British Columbia. Remember, these partner sales cycles are much longer, taking 1 to 2 years or more to realize. These relationships are ones that we foster over the long-term with the potential to scale meaningfully as we grow with our partners. 
Q2 total company operating margin from continuing operations was 50%, including approximately $10 million of stranded costs. Excluding stranded cost, the consumer business margin was above 51%, and Q2 headcount was below 2,500. While we have been operating at 50%, excluding stranded costs since the divestiture, this quarter marked the first time we have met our long-term target of 50% margin on a total company basis. We will continue to operate in a disciplined manner and expect to maintain similar levels going forward. 
We are pleased to
 report that at the end of Q2, we have fully eliminated all stranded costs. Since the divestiture, we have eliminated $1 billion of costs and rightsized the company. This quarter, we have also closed out all outstanding payments and claims with Broadcom, including TSA activities. And as Vincent mentioned, we entered into a licensing agreement with Broadcom. 
Looking forward, our financials will be clean of stranded costs and transition-related items. Q2 net income was $215 million, up almost $100 million and up 85% year-over-year. Diluted EPS of $0.36 was better than expected, up 100% year-over-year, driven by solid execution on top line growth, the removal of our final stranded costs and favorable effects. 
Before turning to cash flow, let me give you an update on the remaining sale of underutilized assets. We remain confident in our efforts to reach our goal of $1.5 billion total cash proceeds which is up from the initial $800 million target. So far, we have realized approximately $875 million of total cash proceeds, including the sale of our [ Culver ] city real estate in July for $120 million. Our remaining underutilized assets are comprised of our real estate assets in Tucson, Dublin and Mountain View. We continue to be an active discussion with interested parties for those properties and will remain disciplined in our approach to achieve fair value. 
Net operating cash usage was $113 million in the quarter. Impacting cash flow this quarter were the last of the stranded costs, the closeout of transition-related items, the licensing agreement with Broadcom and the timing of certain tax payments. Adjusting for these nonrecurring items, the business continues to operate at a level of $900 million in free cash flow on an annualized basis. 
Turning to our balance sheet. We continue to have a strong liquidity position. We ended the second quarter with over $2 billion in total liquidity with a cash balance of approximately $1 billion and another $1 billion of undrawn revolver capacity. 
Let me spend a few minutes on capital allocation. In Q2, we returned approximately $80 million to shareholders, predominantly in the form of our regular quarterly dividend. We have $573 million remaining of our $1.6 billion share buyback authorization, which we will deploy opportunistically. In addition, as described in the press release, the Board of Directors approved a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.125 per common share to be paid on December 16, 2020, for all shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 23, 2020. 
Looking ahead, our commitment to deliver long-term shareholder value remains unchanged. Our resilient and highly recurring business model will afford us the flexibility to be nimble when it comes to investing for growth. We are continuously evaluating opportunities to drive profitable and sustainable growth whether it's through product or technology innovation, entering adjacent markets, geographic and channel expansion or consolidation. We will have a disciplined and strategic approach with our capital allocation as well as with our investments. 
Now turning to our Q3 outlook. We expect Q3 non-GAAP revenue in the range of $625 million to $635 million, which translates to approximately 4% to 5% growth after normalizing for the ID Analytics divestiture. We anticipate the non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 50% and and expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.36 to $0.38 per share, assuming stable currency rates and share count sequentially.

So as it pertains to annualizing into that increased marketing spend and the customer growth that we've seen now for a few quarters now. What we're seeing, the early indicators look very, very positive, very consistent. When I look at and step back as to let's talk about 5 quarters ago when we made the decision to increase the level of marketing spend, up from a $200 million annualized level to about a $300 million annualized level, we're now spending roughly about $75 million a quarter. As we ramped up that spend, we not only spent more we chose to reallocate to more efficient channels, more spend in digital, more spend deployed international. We've had expansion in affiliates. And along the way, less and less in TV and radio. We saw a lot of growth in our customer acquisition units and bookings in exchange for the spend, which you would expect. 
But now that we're fully anniversaried into that spend level, now it's time to, as you're saying, really look at the customer cohorts and the behavior attributes and how they differ from what we historically have been used to on an ongoing basis. We obviously will spend a lot of time doing that. But what I would say here on the call today would be, as we move forward, we will continue to fund and invest for growth with the expectation that we will expand even further internationally and have our dollars work even harder for us. We will focus on acquiring, attracting new customers to our products and solutions that we have in those markets. And along the way, we definitely will have biomarkers to assess the cohorts of the customers that we got, how much it costs to acquire those and how we can navigate those new customers through our experience in the funnel."

But I think the realization that we are very user-centric and that maybe is a unique view that we have with lifelog, but users centering there's more and more of applications we can address, and the market is a vast growing market. If you sum up today in the industry, the consumers that pay for stand-alone cyber safety, you get less than [ 100 million ]. Yet we have billion of people using the Internet to live the digital lives, and that's a growing market. So I think positioning this as a growing market was the right call.

We're building our capabilities. We're increasing the velocity of our innovation. You've seen us launching new products at a more frequent rate. Some are good learnings, other we doubled down in investments, and we continue to tweak our portfolio to address those opportunities.

And as I also mentioned to you guys, the first year price is a promotional price and the second year renewal price get to the full value. And so normally, when you grow your custom count, you definitely also have headwind on that first year ARPU. Despite that growth, we're able to maintain very good ARPU overall, and that's a testimony of the team. We've seen broad-based growth this quarter across the more security angle of our membership, but also across identity, which, as you know, is coming at had a strong ARPU. We've been very disciplined on almost every metric, driving solid retention, not marketing with promotion, but marketing with the message and the value we deliver to consumers. 
And so -- and so that's the result you've seen, very solid retention and ARPU despite the fact that we're growing overall. Now with that said, I do want to say that the focus for us is really to build innovative product. We're not looking at a single price for the product in relationship to the ARPU. We looked at how much value we can add to the customer's basket to build that overall cyber safety umbrella."

When you look at the overall umbrella today of cyber safety, it includes the basic securities, but it also includes your privacy angle, it includes your identity protection and restoration, include how you connect with your family and protect that family. So we are around 4 pillars. And we're looking almost at all 3 levers. How do we add value across the pillars we have, how do we look at different business model to go and deliver to those consumers and how do we make sure that we reach and retain locally while we have a global business model, it's really important to drive our message on a local level.

I hope you are all safe and well.

W",1294,"Thank you, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. I hope you are all safe and well. Before we begin, I want to thank our employees and our partners for their hard work and dedication to help protect consumers as more and more of our everyday lives move online. We know that cybercriminals are taking advantage of this shift, and I'm proud of our team for continuing to design products and release features that support our vision of cyber safety for everyone. And to our loyal 50 million customers, thank you for trusting us to secure a growing portion of your digital activities.
In Q2, we delivered reported billings growth of 7%, revenue growth of 5%, and EPS growth of 100%, closing out a strong first half of fiscal year '21.
Our revenue now exceeds $2.5 billion in annualized run rate, and we are beginning to string together strong quarters where we meet our target of mid-single-digit revenue growth while at the same time, delivering solid operating leverage.
Let me unpack a little bit on the top-line. Our direct-to-consumer business, which represents 90% of our business, was up 5% in Q2, with broad-based growth across the entire portfolio. We now have over half of our installed base on Norton 360, and we will continue to release new products, such as Dark Web Monitoring or Privacy Monitor Assistant, either as add-on features or stand-alone products. 
Our goal is to constantly bring new value to our subscribers around the globe and keep them cyber safe across their growing digital activities. We also continued to invest and expand internationally with international growth slightly ahead of the Americas. 
Direct acquisition grew double digits in many countries such as the U.K., Italy, and Spain, and Europe, and Australia, and Japan in APJ, just to name a few. 
With less than 30% of our revenues outside North America, we remain relatively underpenetrated in many countries offering us an opportunity to broaden our reach. Partner revenue, which represent 10% of our business and includes relationships with telcos, retailers, and employee benefits brokers, grew 7% in Q2. While retail remained weak during this period, we delivered double-digit growth in the employee benefits program with strong signings of new employers and strong retention rates across broad sectors. 
Overall, we continue to develop our partner relationships to increase the reach of our solutions to all consumers. We are currently working on rolling out and expanding our solutions with some of our more recently announced partners like ARP in U.S. or TELUS in Canada. 
Internationally, this quarter, we also signed a telco deal in Europe and had a key retail win in Japan. These relationships take time to build, but they are an important part of our long-term growth opportunity. 
As you all know, we've put a lot of focus on growing our direct customer count, which now totals 20.7 million. This quarter marks our fourth consecutive quarter of net customer adds sequentially and the second consecutive quarter of net adds year-over-year. 
Since we became a stand-alone consumer company a year ago, we have welcomed over 3.5 million new customers. While we know this is just a drop in the bucket compared to the opportunity to bring cyber safety to everyone, it is a meaningful change from the years of declining customer count when we were part of Symantec. Our customer retention rate, a unit retention metric, remained stable at 85%, and our monthly average revenue per user remained strong at over $9.
Our integrated platform, Norton 360, resonates well with consumers who face multiple challenges to their digitalized and preferred comprehensive protection plans. We will continue to drive customer acquisition and engagement through marketing investments, partnerships, and more importantly, product innovation. 
We are focused on both developing great products, and bringing an integrated platform to consumers to provide cyber safety while we work, learn, shop, or socialize online.
For example, with the rise of gaming and e-sports, we saw an opportunity to help gamers protect and control their accounts, their personals, and digital goods. We developed a customized solution, Norton 360 for gamers designed by fellow gamers at NortonLifeLock. We know gamers prefer to focus on playing, not worrying about cybercriminals, so we felt there was a real need to bring comprehensive cyber safety to the gaming world. 
While our solution delivers many of the features you would expect like threat detection, firewall, and password manager, we've gone further and included Dark Web Monitoring for gamer tags a first for the industry. With this feature, we will monitor and notify you if we find your personal information on the dark web, including new game attacks, user IDs or passwords, protecting your virtual goods acquired in games.
Another dramatic change in our everyday lives has been in how our kids learn, whether it be for school or other educational activities, so much more of this is now done online. Our recent study shows that the majority of parents say their kids screen time is skyrocketed during the COVID-19 pandemic. And unfortunately, over half of the parents said that they now just accept certain risks to their child's online safety. 
To help make life a bit easier for parents, this quarter, we introduced Norton 360 with LifeLock for family, an all-in 1 plan to help protect the entire families devices, identities, and online privacy through 1 subscription fee.
This family plan also includes a new feature called school time, which helps children stay focused on schoolwork, while remote learning by managing access to the broader web. So sorry to kids, no gaming during school hours.
While the threat posed by the availability of your personal information online is not new, the shift of more and more of our lives online makes privacy as important as ever. Recently, we've expanded our privacy offering with Privacy Monitor Assistant and made it easier for consumers to reclaim control of their personal information and defend against identity test. 
Data brokers collect and profit from all your data, they compile such as your home address, phone number, employment information, and social media profiles. Privacy Monitor Assistant helps automate and take the guess word out of removing new personal information from the Internet.
These are just a few examples of how our innovations are keeping consumer cyber safe. And there's definitely more to come as we build cyber safety for everyone. 
Growth and innovation are our primary focus. But it's worth noting that as of the end of August, we had removed all stranded costs related to the sales of our enterprise business. This was 4 months ahead of plan. I want to thank our transition team for making it possible and we're now building operational execution into our DNA. 
And with the transition behind us, we have reaffirmed our partnership with Broadcom by licensing the Symantec enterprise software and security engines as well as continued sharing threat telemetry and analytics. We are very well positioned for the future.
Before I pass it to Natalie, I also want to recognize our responsibility to help create a safe and sustainable future. Yesterday, we released our first corporate responsibility report as NortonLifeLock. We encourage you to read the report and learn about how we view corporate responsibility and support our communities. Those efforts were just recognized last month by Forbes and JUST Capital. It is an honor to be named 1 of America's most JUST companies and be recognized for our commitment to serve all stakeholders with integrity, and accountability.
We also know we have so much more we can do in this area, and we will stay committed to corporate responsibility, and contributing to building a cyber-safe world.
And now let me turn the call over to Natalie for more details on the financial results. Natalie?"

For today's discussion, I will focus on non-GAAP financials, starting with our Q2 results and then provide our outlook for Q3. Q2 performance was better than expected. We delivered growth year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter on many key metrics. Our Q2 revenue was $626 million, up 5% year-over-year, excluding ID Analytics. Q2 reported billings was up 7% year-over-year, including a 2-point positive impact from FX in our ending contract liability balance. 
We continue to gain momentum in both our direct and partner business. This was our fifth consecutive quarter of mid-single-digit billings growth, another step in building our consistent and sustainable track record as a stand-alone company. We increased our total direct customer count to 20.7 million, adding 117,000 customers sequentially quarter-over-quarter and adding 608,000 customers year-over-year. We saw customer expansion across our regions and key product categories within security and identity. 
Overall, our customer count growth is highly correlated with our go-to-market efforts, including our increased marketing investment. Our priority is to invest for sustainable growth, and we have seen record customer acquisition these past couple of quarters.
We are still in the early innings of evaluating changes in our customer cohort dynamics, but we remain committed to our marketing investments, so long as we continue to see the opportunity for growth. We will not take our foot off the gas pedal. We will continue to invest in developing our product offering portfolio and drive awareness and demand efficiency through our marketing and sales channels.
In our partner business, revenue grew 7% year-over-year, largely driven by the continued momentum in our employee benefits channel that Vincent alluded to earlier. We are also continued to make progress on some of our more recently announced partnerships. For example, TELUS is starting to roll out our solutions nationally across Canada, expanding beyond the provinces of Alberta and British Columbia. Remember, these partner sales cycles are much longer, taking 1 to 2 years or more to realize. These relationships are ones that we foster over the long-term with the potential to scale meaningfully as we grow with our partners.
Q2 total company operating margin from continuing operations was 50%, including approximately $10 million of stranded costs. Excluding stranded cost, the consumer business margin was above 51%, and Q2 headcount was below 2,500. While we have been operating at 50%, excluding stranded costs since the divestiture, this quarter marked the first time we have met our long-term target of 50% margin on a total company basis. We will continue to operate in a disciplined manner and expect to maintain similar levels going forward.
We are pleased to report that at the end of Q2, we have fully eliminated all stranded costs. Since the divestiture, we have eliminated $1 billion of costs and rightsized the company. This quarter, we have also closed out all outstanding payments and claims with Broadcom, including TSA activities. And as Vincent mentioned, we entered into a licensing agreement with Broadcom.
Looking forward, our financials will be clean of stranded costs and transition-related items. Q2 net income was $215 million, up almost $100 million and up 85% year-over-year. Diluted EPS of $0.36 was better than expected, up 100% year-over-year, driven by solid execution on top-line growth, the removal of our final stranded costs, and favorable effects. 
Before turning to cash flow, let me give you an update on the remaining sale of underutilized assets. We remain confident in our efforts to reach our goal of $1.5 billion total cash proceeds which is up from the initial $800 million target. 
So far, we have realized approximately $875 million of total cash proceeds, including the sale of our Culver City real estate in July for $120 million. 
Our remaining underutilized assets are comprised of our real estate assets in Tucson, Dublin, and Mountain View. We continued to be in active discussion with interested parties for those properties and will remain disciplined in our approach to achieve fair value.
Net operating cash usage was $113 million in the quarter. Impacting cash flow this quarter were the last of the stranded costs, the closeout of transition-related items, the licensing agreement with Broadcom, and the timing of certain tax payments. Adjusting for these nonrecurring items, the business continues to operate at a level of $900 million in free cash flow on an annualized basis.
Turning to our balance sheet. We continue to have a strong liquidity position. We ended the second quarter with over $2 billion in total liquidity with a cash balance of approximately $1 billion and another $1 billion of undrawn revolver capacity.
Let me spend a few minutes on capital allocation. In Q2, we returned approximately $80 million to shareholders, predominantly in the form of our regular quarterly dividend. We have $573 million remaining of our $1.6 billion share buyback authorization, which we will deploy opportunistically. 
In addition, as described in the press release, the Board of Directors approved a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.125 per common share to be paid on December 16, 2020, for all shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 23, 2020.
Looking ahead, our commitment to deliver long-term shareholder value remains unchanged. Our resilient and highly recurring business model will afford us the flexibility to be nimble when it comes to investing for growth. 
We are continuously evaluating opportunities to drive profitable and sustainable growth whether it's through product or technology innovation, entering adjacent markets, geographic and channel expansion, or consolidation. We will have a disciplined and strategic approach with our capital allocation as well as with our investments.
Now turning to our Q3 outlook. We expect Q3 non-GAAP revenue in the range of $625 million to $635 million, which translates to approximately 4% to 5% growth after normalizing for the ID Analytics divestiture. We anticipate the non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 50% and expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.36 to $0.38 per share, assuming stable currency rates and share count sequentially.
 I will now turn the call back to the operator to take your questions. Operator?"

So as it pertains to annualizing into that increased marketing spend and the customer growth that we've seen now for a few quarters now.  We're seeing, the early indicators look very, very positive, very consistent. When I look at and step back as to let's talk about 5 quarters ago when we made the decision to increase the level of marketing spend, up from a $200 million annualized level to about a $300 million annualized level, we're now spending roughly about $75 million a quarter. 
As we ramped up that spend, we not only spent more we chose to reallocate to more efficient channels, more spend in digital, more spend deployed international. We've had expansion in affiliates. And along the way, less and less in TV and radio. We saw a lot of growth in our customer acquisition units and bookings in exchange for the spend, which you would expect.
But now that we're fully anniversaried into that spend level, now it's time to, as you're saying, really look at the customer cohorts and the behavior attributes and how they differ from what we historically have been used to on an ongoing basis. 
We obviously will spend a lot of time doing that. But what I would say here on the call today would be, as we move forward, we will continue to fund and invest for growth with the expectation that we will expand even further internationally and have our dollars work even harder for us. 
We will focus on acquiring, attracting new customers to our products and solutions that we have in those markets. And along the way, we definitely will have biomarkers to assess the cohorts of the customers that we got, how much it costs to acquire those, and how we can navigate those new customers through our experience in the funnel."

No, it makes total sense. I think there is 1 very positive news with McAfee making their numbers public, is that everyone starts to realize that protecting consumer as they move more and more of their lives into the digital world is actually a growing market.

But I think the realization that we are very user-centric and that may be so unique view that we have with LifeLock, but users centering there's more and more of applications we can address, and the market is a vast growing market. If you sum up today in the industry, the consumers that pay for stand-alone cyber safety, you get less than $100 million. Yet we have billion of people using the Internet to live their digital lives, and that's a growing market. 
So I think positioning this as a growing market was the right call. You've seen us changing the momentum as we're busy with the focus of transitioning out the enterprise activities if you want.

I think the opportunity, again, to address all of the challenges linked to the fact that our lives move online, and it's not just the number of devices, it's not just the basic activities of shopping, it's now, as I mentioned and as you recognize, the whole set of education, it's about gaming, it's about socializing. All of those activities are moving online, creating new opportunities for cybercriminals to take advantage of your data and your virtual assets. 
So that's a huge growing opportunity. We always had that as the investment, as I said, as you recall a year ago when we sold the enterprise business, which there's a huge opportunity to focus solely on the consumer aspect. We're building our capabilities. We're increasing the velocity of our innovation. You've seen us launching new products at a more frequent rate. Some are good learnings, other we doubled down in investments, and we continue to tweak our portfolio to address those opportunities. 
I think in the long-run, we feel really, really confident. We moved from, frankly, a division that was focused on maximizing cash to now focusing on growth. We return to mid-single-digit growth. Let's build a sustainable machine, if you want, to then be able to really provide -- again, I'll repeat it cyber safety to everyone, right?

And it will combine, and I would also say the introduction of Norton 360, the first integrated platform, making cyber safety as kind of 1 umbrella protection reality. 
Look, if you step back a year ago, we said we're going to grow mid-single digit. And it's going to be a balanced approach. It's going to come from new subscribers, improve retention, and then the cross-sell and upsell opportunities. And you've seen a very balanced results, if you want, turning positive new customer -- more new customer coming than those leaving improved retention rate now on a unit basis, reaching 85% and an ARPU that continued to be solid and growing.
I think achieving that structurally, mid-single-digit growth rate, in our mind, was always a balanced view. Last quarter, we definitely had a little boost from COVID-19, but the underlying structural change in everybody's life, moving more and more of our activities online is a reality that's here to last. 
And as you know, cybercriminals adapt fast and will find new opportunities to steal your assets, steal your data, and I think people need to realize, they need to be protected when they're online."

Of course, from an annual tax perspective, we usually see a bump when the income tax are due. But honestly, as we look back and some of the breaches that we've had and now with COVID, largely speaking, the seasonality has been kind of muted out in combination with the fact of with the ratable business model that we've got from a revenue guide perspective, I would say it's very muted from a seasonality perspective."

Despite that growth, we're able to maintain very good ARPU overall, and that's a testimony of the team. We've seen broad-based growth this quarter across the more security angle of our membership, but also across identity, which, as you know, is coming at a strong ARPU. We've been very disciplined on almost every metric, driving solid retention, not marketing with promotion, but marketing with the message and the value we deliver to consumers.
And so that is the result you've seen, very solid retention and ARPU despite the fact that we're growing overall. Now with that said, I do want to say that the focus for us is really to build innovative product. We're not looking at a single price for the product in relationship to the ARPU. We looked at how much value we can add to the customer's basket to build that overall cyber safety umbrella."

When you look at the overall umbrella today of cyber safety, it includes the basic securities, but it also includes your privacy angle, it includes your identity protection and restoration, it include how you connect with your family and protect that family. So we are around 4 pillars. And we're looking almost at all 3 levers. 
How do we add value across the pillars we have, how do we look at different business model to go and deliver to those consumers, and how do we make sure that we reach and retain locally while we have a global business model, it's really important to drive our message on a local level.

Before we begin, I want to thank our employees and our partners for their hard work and dedication to help protect consumers as more and more of our everyday lives move online.",1293,"Thank you, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. I hope you are all safe and well. 
Before we begin, I want to thank our employees and our partners for their hard work and dedication to help protect consumers as more and more of our everyday lives move online. We know that cybercriminals are taking advantage of this shift, and I'm proud of our team for continuing to design products and release features that support our vision of cyber safety for everyone. And to our loyal 50 million customers, thank you for trusting us to secure a growing portion of your digital activities.
In Q2, we delivered reported billings growth of 7%, revenue growth of 5% and EPS growth of 100%, closing out a strong first half of fiscal year '21. Our revenue now exceeds $2.5 billion in annualized run rate, and we are beginning to string together strong quarters where we meet our target of mid-single-digit revenue growth while at the same time, delivering solid operating leverage.
Let me unpack a little bit on the top line. Our direct-to-consumer business, which represents 90% of our business, was up 5% in Q2, with broad-based growth across the entire portfolio. We now have over half of our installed base on Norton 360, and we will continue to release new products, such as Dark Web Monitoring or Privacy Monitor Assistant, either as add-on features or stand-alone products. Our goal is to constantly bring new value to our subscribers around the globe and keep them cyber safe across their growing digital activities. 
We also continued to invest and expand internationally with international growth slightly ahead of the Americas. Direct acquisition grew double digits in many countries such as the U.K., Italy, and Spain in Europe and Australia and Japan in APJ, just to name a few. With less than 30% of our revenues outside North America, we remain relatively underpenetrated in many countries, offering us an opportunity to broaden our reach. 
Partner revenue, which represent 10% of our business and includes relationships with telcos, retailers, and employee benefits brokers, grew 7% in Q2. While retail remained weak during this period, we delivered double-digit growth in the employee benefits program with strong signings of new employers and strong retention rates across broad sectors. 
Overall, we continue to develop our partner relationships to increase the reach of our solutions to all consumers. We are currently working on rolling out and expanding our solutions with some of our more recently announced partners like AARP in U.S. or TELUS in Canada. Internationally, this quarter, we also signed a telco deal in Europe and had a key retail win in Japan. These relationships take time to build, but they are an important part of our long-term growth opportunity. 
As you all know, we've put a lot of focus on growing our direct customer count, which now totals 20.7 million. This quarter marks our fourth consecutive quarter of net customer adds sequentially and the second consecutive quarter of net adds year-over-year. 
Since we became a stand-alone consumer company a year ago, we have welcomed over 3.5 million new customers. While we know this is just a drop in the bucket compared to the opportunity to bring cyber safety to everyone, it is a meaningful change from the years of declining customer count when we were part of Symantec. 
Our customer retention rate, a unit retention metric, remained stable at 85%, and our monthly average revenue per user remained strong at over $9.
Our integrated platform, Norton 360, resonates well with consumers who face multiple challenges to their digitalized and preferred comprehensive protection plans. We will continue to drive customer acquisition and engagement through marketing investments, partnerships, and more importantly, product innovation. 
We are focused on both developing great products and bringing an integrated platform to consumers to provide cyber safety while we work, learn, shop or socialize online.
For example, with the rise of gaming and e-sports, we saw an opportunity to help gamers protect and control their accounts, their personas and digital goods. We developed a customized solution, Norton 360 for Gamers designed by fellow gamers at NortonLifeLock. We know gamers prefer to focus on playing, not worrying about cybercriminals, so we felt there was a real need to bring comprehensive cyber safety to the gaming world. 
While our solution delivers many of the features you would expect like threat detection, firewall and password manager, we've gone further and included Dark Web Monitoring for gamer tags, a first for the industry. With this feature, we will monitor and notify you if we find your personal information on the dark web, including your gamer tags, user IDs or passwords, protecting your virtual goods acquired in games.
Another dramatic change in our everyday lives has been in how our kids learn. Whether it be for school or other educational activities, so much more of this is now done online. Our recent study shows that the majority of parents say their kid's screen time has skyrocketed during the COVID-19 pandemic. And unfortunately, over half of the parents said that they now just accept certain risks to their child's online safety. 
To help make life a bit easier for parents, this quarter, we introduced Norton 360 with LifeLock for Family, an all-in-one plan to help protect the entire family's devices, identities and online privacy through one subscription fee. This family plan also includes a new feature called School Time, which helps children stay focused on schoolwork while remote learning by managing access to the broader web. So sorry to kids, no gaming during school hours.
While the threat posed by the availability of your personal information online is not new, the shift of more and more of our lives online makes privacy as important as ever. Recently, we've expanded our privacy offering with Privacy Monitor Assistant and made it easier for consumers to reclaim control of their personal information and defend against identity theft. 
Data brokers collect and profit from all your data they compile, such as your home address, phone number, employment information and social media profiles. Privacy Monitor Assistant helps automate and take the guesswork out of removing your personal information from the Internet.
These are just a few examples of how our innovations are keeping consumer cyber safe. And there's definitely more to come as we build cyber safety for everyone. 
Growth and innovation are our primary focus. But it's worth noting that as of the end of August, we had removed all stranded costs related to the sales of our enterprise business. This was 4 months ahead of plan. I want to thank our transition team for making it possible, and we're now building operational execution into our DNA. 
And with the transition behind us, we have reaffirmed our partnership with Broadcom by licensing the Symantec enterprise software and security engines as well as continued sharing threat telemetry and analytics. We are very well positioned for the future.
Before I pass it to Natalie, I also want to recognize our responsibility to help create a safe and sustainable future. Yesterday, we released our first corporate responsibility report as NortonLifeLock. We encourage you to read the report and learn about how we view corporate responsibility and support our communities. Those efforts were just recognized last month by Forbes and JUST Capital. It is an honor to be named one of America's most JUST companies and be recognized for our commitment to serve all stakeholders with integrity and accountability.
We also know we have so much more we can do in this area, and we will stay committed to corporate responsibility and contributing to building a cyber-safe world.
And now let me turn the call over to Natalie for more details on the financial results. Natalie?"

For today's discussion, I will focus on non-GAAP financials, starting with our Q2 results and then provide our outlook for Q3. 
Q2 performance was better than expected. We delivered growth year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter on many key metrics. Our Q2 revenue was $626 million, up 5% year-over-year, excluding ID Analytics. Q2 reported billings was up 7% year-over-year, including a 2-point positive impact from FX in our ending contract liability balance. 
We continue to gain momentum in both our direct and partner business. This was our fifth consecutive quarter of mid-single-digit billings growth, another step in building our consistent and sustainable track record as a stand-alone company. We increased our total direct customer count to 20.7 million, adding 117,000 customers sequentially quarter-over-quarter and adding 608,000 customers year-over-year. We saw customer expansion across our regions and key product categories within security and identity. 
Overall, our customer count growth is highly correlated with our go-to-market efforts, including our increased marketing investment. Our priority is to invest for sustainable growth, and we have seen record customer acquisition these past couple of quarters.
We are still in the early innings of evaluating changes in our customer cohort dynamics, but we remain committed to our marketing investments so long as we continue to see the opportunity for growth. We will not take our foot off the gas pedal. We will continue to invest in developing our product offering portfolio and drive awareness and demand efficiency through our marketing and sales channels.
In our partner business, revenue grew 7% year-over-year, largely driven by the continued momentum in our employee benefits channel that Vincent alluded to earlier. We are -- also continued to make progress on some of our more recently announced partnerships. For example, TELUS is starting to roll out our solutions nationally across Canada, expanding beyond the provinces of Alberta and British Columbia. Remember, these partner sales cycles are much longer, taking 1 to 2 years or more to realize. These relationships are ones that we foster over the long term with the potential to scale meaningfully as we grow with our partners.
Q2 total company operating margin from continuing operations was 50%, including approximately $10 million of stranded costs. Excluding stranded cost, the consumer business margin was above 51%, and Q2 head count was below 2,500. While we have been operating at 50% excluding stranded costs since the divestiture, this quarter marked the first time we have met our long-term target of 50% margin on a total company basis. We will continue to operate in a disciplined manner and expect to maintain similar levels going forward.
We are pleased to report that at the end of Q2, we have fully eliminated all stranded costs. Since the divestiture, we have eliminated $1 billion of costs and rightsized the company. This quarter, we have also closed out all outstanding payments and claims with Broadcom, including TSA activities. And as Vincent mentioned, we entered into a licensing agreement with Broadcom. Looking forward, our financials will be clean of stranded costs and transition-related items. 
Q2 net income was $215 million, up almost $100 million and up 85% year-over-year. Diluted EPS of $0.36 was better than expected, up 100% year-over-year, driven by solid execution on top line growth, the removal of our final stranded costs and favorable effects. 
Before turning to cash flow, let me give you an update on the remaining sale of underutilized assets. We remain confident in our efforts to reach our goal of $1.5 billion total cash proceeds, which is up from the initial $800 million target. 
So far, we have realized approximately $875 million of total cash proceeds, including the sale of our Culver City real estate in July for $120 million. 
Our remaining underutilized assets are comprised of our real estate assets in Tucson, Dublin and Mountain View. We continue to be in active discussion with interested parties for those properties and will remain disciplined in our approach to achieve fair value.
Net operating cash usage was $113 million in the quarter. Impacting cash flow this quarter were the last of the stranded costs, the closeout of transition-related items, the licensing agreement with Broadcom and the timing of certain tax payments. Adjusting for these nonrecurring items, the business continues to operate at a level of $900 million in free cash flow on an annualized basis.
Turning to our balance sheet. We continue to have a strong liquidity position. We ended the second quarter with over $2 billion in total liquidity with a cash balance of approximately $1 billion and another $1 billion of undrawn revolver capacity.
Let me spend a few minutes on capital allocation. In Q2, we returned approximately $80 million to shareholders, predominantly in the form of our regular quarterly dividend. We have $573 million remaining of our $1.6 billion share buyback authorization, which we will deploy opportunistically. 
In addition, as described in the press release, the Board of Directors approved a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.125 per common share to be paid on December 16, 2020, for all shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 23, 2020.
Looking ahead, our commitment to deliver long-term shareholder value remains unchanged. Our resilient and highly recurring business model will afford us the flexibility to be nimble when it comes to investing for growth. 
We are continuously evaluating opportunities to drive profitable and sustainable growth, whether it's through product or technology innovation, entering adjacent markets, geographic and channel expansion or consolidation. We will have a disciplined and strategic approach with our capital allocation as well as with our investments.
Now turning to our Q3 outlook. We expect Q3 non-GAAP revenue in the range of $625 million to $635 million, which translates to approximately 4% to 5% growth after normalizing for the ID Analytics divestiture. We anticipate the non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 50% and expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.36 to $0.38 per share, assuming stable currency rates and share count sequentially.

So as it pertains to annualizing into that increased marketing spend and the customer growth that we've seen now for a few quarters now, we're seeing the early indicators look very, very positive, very consistent. When I look",311,"Yes. Thanks for the question. So as it pertains to annualizing into that increased marketing spend and the customer growth that we've seen now for a few quarters now, we're seeing the early indicators look very, very positive, very consistent. When I look at and step back as to let's talk about 5 quarters ago when we made the decision to increase the level of marketing spend, up from a $200 million annualized level to about a $300 million annualized level, we're now spending roughly about $75 million a quarter. 
As we ramped up that spend, we not only spent more. We chose to reallocate to more efficient channels, more spend in digital, more spend deployed international. We've had expansion in affiliates. And along the way, less and less in TV and radio. We saw a lot of growth in our customer acquisition units and bookings in exchange for the spend, which you would expect.
But now that we're fully anniversaried into that spend level, now it's time to, as you're saying, really look at the customer cohorts and the behavior attributes and how they differ from what we historically have been used to on an ongoing basis. 
We obviously will spend a lot of time doing that. But what I would say here on the call today would be, as we move forward, we will continue to fund and invest for growth with the expectation that we will expand even further internationally and have our dollars work even harder for us. 
We will focus on acquiring, attracting new customers to our products and solutions that we have in those markets. And along the way, we definitely will have biomarkers to assess the cohorts of the customers that we got, how much it costs to acquire those, and how we can navigate those new customers through our experience in the funnel."

No, it makes total sense. I think there is one very positive news with McAfee making their numbers public, is that everyone starts to realize that protecting consumer as they move more and more of their lives into the digital world is actually a growing market. Up to now, I think there was still this conception that maybe we're coming from an old technology and a PC-driven environment. 
I think the realization that we are very user-centric -- and that maybe is a unique view that we have with LifeLock, but user-centric, there's more and more of applications we can address, and the market is a vast growing market. If you sum up today in the industry, the consumers that pay for stand-alone cyber safety, you get less than $100 million. Yet we have billion of people using the Internet to live their digital lives, and that's a growing market. 
So I think positioning this as a growing market was the right call. You've seen us changing the momentum as we're busy with the focus of transitioning out the enterprise activities if you want. We're now fully dedicated to that market, invest for growth. And we look forward to accelerate our growth in the long term. Our goal is to, as I mentioned, reach everyone."

It's not just the basic activities of shopping. It's now, as I mentioned and as you recognize, the whole set of education, it's about gaming, it's about socializing. All of those activities are moving online, creating new opportunities for cybercriminals to take advantage of your data and your virtual assets. 
So that's a huge growing opportunity. We always had that as the investment thesis. As you recall a year ago when we sold the enterprise business, we said there's a huge opportunity to focus solely on the consumer aspect. We're building our capabilities. We're increasing the velocity of our innovation. You've seen us launching new products at a more frequent rate. Some are good learnings, other we doubled down in investments, and we continue to tweak our portfolio to address those opportunities. 
I think in the long run, we feel really, really confident. We moved from, frankly, a division that was focused on maximizing cash to now focusing on growth. We return to mid-single-digit growth. Let's build a sustainable machine, if you want, to then be able to really provide -- again, I'll repeat it, cyber safety to everyone, right?

Look, if you step back a year ago, we said we're going to grow mid-single digit. And it's going to be a balanced approach. It's going to come from new subscribers, improved retention and then the cross-sell and upsell opportunities. And you've seen a very balanced result, if you want, turning positive new customer -- more new customer coming than those leaving, improved retention rate now on a unit basis, reaching 85% and an ARPU that continued to be solid and growing. 
I think achieving that structurally, mid-single-digit growth rate, in our mind, was always a balanced view. Last quarter, we definitely had a little boost from COVID-19, but the underlying structural change in everybody's life, moving more and more of our activities online is a reality that's here to last. And as you know, cybercriminals adapt fast and will find new opportunities to steal your assets, steal your data, and I think people need to realize, they need to be protected when they're online."

But honestly, as we look back and some of the breaches that we've had and now with COVID, largely speaking, the seasonality has been kind of muted out in combination with the fact of with the ratable business model that we've got from a revenue guide perspective, I would say it's very muted from a seasonality perspective."

Despite that growth, we're able to maintain very good ARPU overall, and that's a testimony of the team. We've seen broad-based growth this quarter across the more security angle of our membership but also across identity, which, as you know, is coming at a strong ARPU. We've been very disciplined on almost every metric, driving solid retention, not marketing with promotion but marketing with the message and the value we deliver to consumers.
And so that is the result you've seen, very solid retention and ARPU despite the fact that we're growing overall. Now with that said, I do want to say that the focus for us is really to build innovative product. We're not looking at a single price for the product in relationship to the ARPU.

When you look at the overall umbrella today of cyber safety, it includes the basic securities, but it also includes your privacy angle. It includes your identity protection and restorations. It include how you connect with your family and protect that family. So we are around 4 pillars. 
And we're looking almost at all 3 levers. How do we add value across the pillars we have? How do we look at different business model to go and deliver to those consumers? And how do we make sure that we reach and retain locally? While we have a global business model, it's really important to drive our message on a local level.
