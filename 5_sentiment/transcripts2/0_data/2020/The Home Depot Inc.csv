Diluted earnings per",1015,"Thank you, Isabel, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal 2019 was another record year for our business as we achieved the highest sales in company history. Excluding the extra week in 2018, fiscal 2019 sales grew 3.5% to $110.2 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $10.25. As expected, we finished the year with our strongest comp performance in the fourth quarter. Comp sales were up 5.2% from last year, and our U.S. comps were positive 5.3%. Sales for the fourth quarter were $25.8 billion and diluted earnings per share were $2.28. W
e saw broad-based growth across all geographies and merchandising departments in the quarter. All 19 of our U.S. regions posted positive comps. And internationally, both Canada and Mexico reported positive comps in the fourth quarter. As Ted will detail, both comp ticket and transactions grew in the quarter, and we saw growth with both our Pro and DIY customers. We have a strong holiday season with record-setting sales on Black Friday and during cyber week. These results reflect solid execution by our stores, our merchants, our supply chain teams as well as our vendor partners and demonstrate the overall health of the consumer. 
I'm proud of our results in fiscal 2019 as the team successfully navigated a number of external headwinds by maintaining our relentless focus on our customer. 2019 was also a pivotal year in our transformation to create the One Home Depot experience. We are now 2 years into our multiyear investment and are realizing benefits. We have more conviction than ever that these strategic initiatives are creating a value proposition that is unique to the marketplace and will extend our leadership position for years to come. 
The majority of our U.S. stores have a new look and feel, and we addressed customer pain points around navigation and checkout. Our enhanced signage and store refresh package, along with investments in the front end of our stores, have improved the customer experience and driven associate productivity. These store investments are driving higher customer satisfaction scores, which we believe is translating into market share gains. 
As a complement to our store investments, we're investing to strengthen the competitive advantages that we have built through the blending of our physical and digital platforms into a more seamless interconnected experience. For example, our chain-wide rollout of digital appliance labels, connecting ratings from the digital world to the circa world, enhancing the in-store shopping experience. Additionally, homedepot.com continues to be an engine for growth for our overall business, driving increased traffic online and additional footsteps to our stores. Because of this, we continue to invest in search functionality, category presentations, product content and enhanced fulfillment options to remove friction from the online shopping experience. 
Excluding the extra week last year, online sales grew 20.8% in the quarter and 21.4% for the year. And over 50% of the time our customers choose to pick up their order in a store. This is the power of the interconnected retail strategy. 
We have also expanded our digital capabilities by investing in a B2B website experience tailored specifically for the needs of our Pro customers. We have now onboarded over 1 million Pro customers. Additionally, during the quarter, we completed the integration of a third-party best-in-class CRM system for all of our Pro sales and services teams. This enhances our visibility, enabling us to better serve our customers. I'm excited about the opportunities ahead as we continue to build capabilities to engage with the Pro, no matter when, where or how they want to interact. 
Another key component of the best-in-class interconnected shopping experience centers on the enhanced delivery and fulfillment options. In 2019, we continued our multiyear journey to create the fastest, most efficient delivery network and home improvement. We are now live with at least one of each type of facility that we are building. Though it is early days, we are pleased with the initial results. For example, we have opened a dozen market delivery operations, or MDOs, that have enabled us to transition 20% of our clients' deliveries from an outsourced model to one in which we control more of the customer experience. This has translated to meaningful improvements in our customer satisfaction scores for appliance deliveries. 
Our supply chain build-off will continue to ramp from here with the largest number of new facilities coming online in 2021 and 2022. 
Turning to 2020. Richard will take you through the details, but we expect another year of growth, with both sales and comp growth ranging from approximately 3.5% to 4%, and diluted earnings per share of approximately $10.45. Today, our board approved a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend to $1.50 per share, which equates to an annual dividend of $6 per share. We remain committed to maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation to create value for our shareholders. 
I'm incredibly proud of the progress our teams made as we transform ourselves into the One Home depot of the future. While we define our sales growth in percentage terms, we capture share in dollar terms. And through the second year of our One Home Depot investment program we have grown sales by over $9 billion, the level of growth unmatched in our market. As we look forward to 2020, I am more excited than ever about the opportunities ahead. We are investing to unlock the power of a truly interconnected customer experience by enhancing our already strong foundation to further extend our leadership position into the marketplace. 
As with any transformation, the work we are doing is complex, and I'm proud of the where our associates continue to execute at high levels and focus on what's most important in our business, our customers. I want to close by thanking our associates for their hard work and dedication in the fourth quarter and throughout the year. For the second half of the year, 100% of our stores will receive success sharing, our bonus program for our Ally associates. We look forward to continuing our momentum in 2020. And with that, let me turn the call over to Ted."

We saw growth across historic both our Pro and DIY customers. All of our merchandising departments posted positive comps, led by our appliance department, which posted double-digit comps in the quarter. Comps in decor and storage and tools were also above the company average. All other merchandising departments were positive but below the company comp of 5.2%. 
In the fourth quarter, comp average ticket increased 4.4% and transactions increased 0.8%. The strength in our comp was partially driven by a shift in our event timing, which Richard will talk through in a moment. In addition, we had an excellent response to our Black Friday and holiday events, and our customers continue to trade up to new and innovative items. 
After experiencing significant deflation in lumber and copper during the first 3 quarters of 2019, commodity prices had a more neutral impact in the fourth quarter. 
During the fourth quarter, big-ticket comp transactions, or those over $1,000 which represent approximately 20% of U.S. sales, were up double digits. The strength in our big-ticket sales was driven in part by the shift in our event timing. As well as strong performance in a number of other big-ticket categories. During the fourth quarter, big-ticket categories like appliances, vinyl plank flooring and our installation services business, all posted comps above the company average. 
Consumer demand is strong, and this was evident during our annual Black Friday gift center and decorative holiday events. The partnership and collaboration between our merchants and supplier partners, helping a fantastic lineup of great deals and special buys in categories like smart home, power tools, hand tools and decorative holiday. Our unique assortment, together with excellent customer service and execution, led to incredible results. Black Friday was a record sales day for our company and our gift center event grew double digits versus last year. 
We also saw our customers tackle a variety of projects around the house. During the fourth quarter, we saw comps above the company average in several kitchen and bath categories, special or window coverings, cleaning and exterior paint. We also saw significant growth in our online-only home decor categories, which we call HD Home, as we build awareness around these high-quality style forward assortments. 
Sales to our Pro customers were healthy, driven by strength in categories like pneumatics, concrete, hand tools and costs, all of which grew faster than the company average. 
Looking back at 2019, our team continued their unwavering commitment to serve our customers with great everyday values and innovative products. And we did this while investing in a customer back store and interconnected experience to ensure that we continue to be the product authority in home improvement for years to come. 
At our Investors conference back in December, we talked about investments we are making across our business. We also shared our new ad campaign and tagline, How Doers Get More Done, that we launched to highlight our investments into these new experiences and capabilities. We believe it is important to signal to our customers that the Home Depot is evolving as their needs change. While it's still early in our campaign, we see customers responding to our enhanced capabilities, giving us credit for saving them time and helping them complete their projects. 
In response to our campaign, we saw one of our largest single-day downloads of our award-winning mobile app and double-digit growth in usage of mobile tools like product locator and image search. As we look forward to 2020, we will continue our investments to better meet our customers' needs and drive a great shopping experience. One of the investments you will see in the first half of the year is a reset to our outdoor power equipment phase. We know the marketplace for outdoor power tools is transitioning to cordless technology. And we learned in our tools department that once a customer adopts the battery platform, they see tremendous value in sticking with that platform. Similar to what we have done in our tools department, we are in the process of resetting our outdoor power equipment base to showcase our assortment by brand, highlighting EGO, Toro, Milwaukee, RYOBI, DEWALT and Makita, many of which can only be found at The Home Depot. Through this new presentation, customers can clearly see and easily shop the value proposition that these cordless platforms spring including being more environmentally friendly, safer and easier to use, all with the power and run time to get the job done. 
These powerful brands now have the lion's share of batteries in the marketplace, with hundreds of millions of batteries in customers' homes and job sites day. We currently offer over 1,000 cordless power tools and that number will continue to grow as our supplier partners are introducing innovative product all the time. Our comprehensive and unique assortment of outdoor power equipment, resulting in double-digit comps in fiscal 2019. 
With spring right around the corner, we are gearing up for another busy season. Our stores are stocked with new and innovative products, and we just recently announced, we are hiring 80,000 new associates to help us serve our customers during our spring selling season. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard."

Before we begin, let me take a quick moment to remind everyone that fiscal 2019 consisted of 52 weeks, while fiscal 2018 consisted of 53 weeks. This extra week added approximately $1.7 billion in sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. When we report our comparable sales or comps, we report them on a 52-week to 52-week basis by comparing weeks 1 through 52 of fiscal 2019 with weeks 2 through 53 of fiscal 2018. 
In the fourth quarter of 2019, total sales were $25.8 billion, a 2.7% decrease from last year, reflecting the compare against the extra week in 2018. Our total company comp sales in the fourth quarter increased 5.2% and comps in the U.S. increased 5.3%. Because of last year's 53rd week and the resulting calendar shift, our monthly comps are distorted due to the timing of our annual Black Friday and Cyber Monday events this year versus last year. Our reported monthly comps for the total company were positive 1.2% in November, 9.9% in December and 5.7% in January. Our monthly comps in the U.S. were positive 1.1% in November, 10.4% in December and 5.8% in January. Given the distortion in our monthly comps caused by the calendar shifts, we believe it is more appropriate to look at November and December on a combined basis. For the combined 2 months of November and December, our total company comp was 5%, followed by 5.7% in January. 
For the year, our sales totaled a record $110.2 billion. If we exclude the sales from the 53rd week in fiscal 2018, we grew sales by approximately $3.7 billion in fiscal 2019, a level of growth unmatched in our market. For the year, total company comp sales increased 3.5%, and U.S. comp sales increased 3.8%. 
In the fourth quarter, our gross margin was 33.9%, a decrease of 20 basis points from last year. Similar to last quarter, the change in our gross margin was primarily driven by higher shrink and a mix of products sold compared to last year. For the year, our gross margin was 34.1%, slightly higher than our guidance at the beginning of the year. 
In the fourth quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 64 basis points to 20.7%, slightly better than our plan. During the quarter, we saw approximately 77 basis points of leverage as we lapped the fiscal 2018 impairment of certain trade names and the 53rd week last year. This leverage was partially offset by expenses related to our strategic investment plan of approximately $280 million, which increased approximately $25 million from last year and cost 12 basis points of deleverage. Fiscal 2019 operating expense as a percent of sales was 19.7%, a decrease of 28 basis points from last year. Our fiscal 2019 expense performance was better than our initial expectations driven by productivity initiatives in our core business. During the year, we spent approximately $1 billion of investment expenses related to our strategic initiatives in line with our plan. Our operating margin for the fourth quarter was approximately 13.2% and for the year, was approximately 14.4%. Interest and other expense for the fourth quarter grew by $27 million to $292 million, due primarily to higher long-term debt levels than 1 year ago. 
In the fourth quarter, our effective tax rate was 20.3%, and fiscal 2019 was 23.6%. The lower than effective tax rate in the fourth quarter and for fiscal 2019 was driven primarily by several discrete tax items. Our diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $2.28, an increase of 9.1% from last year. For fiscal 2019, diluted earnings per share were $10.25, an increase of 5.3% compared to fiscal 2018. 
Moving on to some additional highlights. We ended the year with a store count of 2,291, while retail selling square footage was approximately 238 million square feet. For the fiscal year, total sales per retail square foot were $455, the highest in our company's history. At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories grew $606 million to $14.5 billion, and inventory turns were 4.9x, down slightly versus last year. The growth in our inventory versus last year reflects the investments we are making to accelerate merchandising resets and higher in-stock levels than we had 1 year ago. 
Moving on to capital allocation. In fiscal 2019, we generated approximately $13.7 billion of cash from operations and used that cash as well as the proceeds from $2.4 billion of net debt issuances to invest in our business, pay dividends to our shareholders and repurchase our shares. During the year, we invested approximately $2.7 billion back into the business through capital expenditures. Further, we paid $6 billion in dividends to our shareholders. Finally, during the year, we repurchased approximately $7 billion or about 32.8 million of our outstanding shares, including roughly $3.25 billion or 14.5 million shares in the fourth quarter. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 45.4%, 60 basis points higher than the end of fiscal 2018. 
Today's press release includes our guidance for fiscal 2020, and I want to take a few moments to comment on the highlights. Remember that we guide off of GAAP, so fiscal 2020 guidance will launch from our reported results for fiscal 2019. At our investor conference in December of 2019, we shared with you some preliminary thoughts for 2020, and we are reiterating that guidance today. The economy is strong and the U.S. consumer is healthy. The foundation of our sales plan starts with GDP, and our 2020 sales guidance assumes U.S. GDP growth of slightly less than 2% in 2020. To GDP, we add the impact that we think we will see from the housing environment, including demand driven by home price appreciation, housing turnover, household formation and the age of the housing stock. As we look at these metrics, we see an environment that is healthy and stable. Our 2020 sales guidance also assumes that we will continue to gain share in the marketplace. For fiscal 2020, we expect both sales growth and total company comp sales growth of approximately 3.5% to 4%. Fiscal 2020 represents the peak year of our investment program. And as a result, we expect our fiscal 2020 operating expenses to grow at 1.2x the rate of our expected sales growth. 
For the year, we expect to grow operating profit dollars to $16 billion, giving us an operating margin of approximately 14%. For fiscal 2020, we assume our effective tax rate will be approximately 24%. We expect fiscal 2020 diluted earnings per share to grow approximately 2% to $10.45. For the year, we project cash flow from operations of approximately $13.5 billion. We plan to invest $2.8 billion of this cash back into the business in the form of capital expenditures. We also plan to use this cash to pay $6.4 billion of dividends and repurchased at least $5 billion of outstanding shares. 
Before I close, I would like to update you on how we're thinking about one of our capital allocation principles. With regards to our dividend, in lieu of using a 55% payout ratio, we will look to grow our dividend every year as we grow earnings, as we have for the last 11 years. This morning, we announced that our board increased our quarterly dividend by 10%, which equates to an annual dividend of $6 per share. With that, I want to thank you for your participation in today's call. And Christine, we are now ready for questions."

Diluted earnings per",1015,"Thank you, Isabel, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal 2019 was another record year for our business as we achieved the highest sales in company history. Excluding the extra week in 2018, fiscal 2019 sales grew 3.5% to $110.2 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $10.25.
As expected, we finished the year with our strongest comp performance in the fourth quarter. Comp sales were up 5.2% from last year, and our U.S. comps were positive 5.3%. Sales for the fourth quarter were $25.8 billion, and diluted earnings per share were $2.28.
We saw broad-based growth across all geographies and merchandising departments in the quarter. All 19 of our U.S. regions posted positive comps. And internationally, both Canada and Mexico reported positive comps in the fourth quarter.
As Ted will detail, both comp ticket and transactions grew in the quarter, and we saw growth with both our Pro and DIY customers. We have a strong holiday season with record-setting sales on Black Friday and during cyber week. These results reflect solid execution by our stores, our merchants, our supply chain teams as well as our vendor partners and demonstrate the overall health of the consumer.
I'm proud of our results in fiscal 2019 as the team successfully navigated a number of external headwinds by maintaining a relentless focus on our customer. 2019 was also a pivotal year in our transformation to create the One Home Depot experience. We are now 2 years into our multiyear investment and are realizing benefits. We have more conviction than ever that these strategic initiatives are creating a value proposition that is unique to the marketplace and will extend our leadership position for years to come. 
The majority of our U.S. stores have a new look and feel, and we addressed customer pain points around navigation and checkout. Our enhanced signage and store refresh package, along with investments in the front end of our stores, have improved the customer experience and driven associate productivity. These store investments are driving higher customer satisfaction scores, which we believe is translating into market share gains. 
As a complement to our store investments, we are investing to strengthen the competitive advantages that we have built through the blending of our physical and digital platforms into a more seamless interconnected experience. For example, our chain-wide rollout of digital appliance labels, connecting ratings from the digital world to the physical world, enhancing the in-store shopping experience.
Additionally, homedepot.com continues to be an engine for growth for our overall business, driving increased traffic online and additional footsteps to our stores. Because of this, we continue to invest in search functionality, category presentations, product content and enhanced fulfillment options to remove friction from the online shopping experience. 
Excluding the extra week last year, online sales grew 20.8% in the quarter and 21.4% for the year. And over 50% of the time, our customers choose to pick up their order in a store. This is the power of the interconnected retail strategy. 
We have also expanded our digital capabilities by investing in a B2B website experience tailored specifically for the needs of our Pro customers. We have now onboarded over 1 million Pro customers. Additionally, during the quarter, we completed the integration of a third-party, best-in-class CRM system for all of our Pro sales and services teams. This enhances our visibility, enabling us to better serve our customers. I'm excited about the opportunities ahead as we continue to build capabilities to engage with the Pro, no matter when, where or how they want to interact. 
Another key component of the best-in-class interconnected shopping experience centers on the enhanced delivery and fulfillment options. In 2019, we continued our multiyear journey to create the fastest, most efficient delivery network in home improvement. We are now live with at least one of each type of facility that we are building. Though it is early days, we are pleased with the initial results.
For example, we have opened a dozen market delivery operations, or MDOs, that have enabled us to transition 20% of our clients' deliveries from an outsourced model to one in which we control more of the customer experience. This has translated to meaningful improvements in our customer satisfaction scores for appliance deliveries. Our supply chain build-off will continue to ramp from here, with the largest number of new facilities coming online in 2021 and 2022. 
Turning to 2020, Richard will take you through the details, but we expect another year of growth with both sales and comp growth ranging from approximately 3.5% to 4% and diluted earnings per share of approximately $10.45. Today, our Board approved a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend to $1.50 per share, which equates to an annual dividend of $6 per share. We remain committed to maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation to create value for our shareholders. 
I'm incredibly proud of the progress our teams made as we transform ourselves into the One Home Depot of the future. While we define our sales growth in percentage terms, we capture share in dollar terms. And through the second year of our One Home Depot investment program, we have grown sales by over $9 billion, a level of growth unmatched in our market.
As we look forward to 2020, I am more excited than ever about the opportunities ahead. We are investing to unlock the power of a truly interconnected customer experience by enhancing our already strong foundation to further extend our leadership position into the marketplace. As with any transformation, the work we are doing is complex, and I'm proud of the way our associates continue to execute at high levels and focus on what's most important in our business, our customers.
I want to close by thanking our associates for their hard work and dedication in the fourth quarter and throughout the year. For the second half of the year, 100% of our stores will receive Success Sharing, our bonus program for our hourly associates. We look forward to continuing our momentum in 2020.
And with that, let me turn the call over to Ted."

We saw growth across the store at both our Pro and DIY customers. All of our merchandising departments posted positive comps, led by our appliance department, which posted double-digit comps in the quarter. Comps in decor and storage and tools were also above the company average. All other merchandising departments were positive, but below the company comp of 5.2%. 
In the fourth quarter, comp average ticket increased 4.4%, and comp transactions increased 0.8%. The strength in our comp was partially driven by a shift in our event timing, which Richard will talk through in a moment. In addition, we had an excellent response to our Black Friday and holiday events, and our customers continue to trade up to new and innovative items. After experiencing significant deflation in lumber and copper during the first 3 quarters of 2019, commodity prices had a more neutral impact in the fourth quarter. 
During the fourth quarter, big-ticket comp transactions or those over $1,000, which represent approximately 20% of U.S. sales, were up double digits. The strength in our big-ticket sales was driven in part by the shift in our event timing as well as strong performance in a number of other big-ticket categories. During the fourth quarter, big-ticket categories like appliances, vinyl plank flooring and our installation services business, all posted comps above the company average. 
Consumer demand is strong, and this was evident during our annual Black Friday, gift center and decorative holiday events. The partnership and collaboration between our merchants and supplier partners helped in the fantastic lineup of great deals and special buys in categories like smart home, power tools, hand tools and decorative holiday. Our unique assortment, together with excellent customer service and execution, led to incredible results. Black Friday was a record sales day for our company, and our gift center event grew double digits versus last year. 
We also saw our customers tackle a variety of projects around the house. During the fourth quarter, we saw comps above the company average in several kitchen and bath categories, special or window coverings, cleaning and exterior paint. We also saw significant growth in our online-only home decor categories, which we call HD Home, as we build awareness around these high-quality, style-forward assortments. Sales to our Pro customers were healthy, driven by strength in categories like pneumatics, concrete, hand tools and COGS, all of which grew faster than the company average. 
Looking back at 2019, our team continued their unwavering commitment to serve our customers with great everyday values and innovative products. And we did this while investing in a customer-backed store and interconnected experience to ensure that we continue to be the product authority in home improvement for years to come. 
At our investors conference back in December, we talked about investments we are making across our business. We also shared our new ad campaign and tagline, How Doers Get More Done, that we launched to highlight our investments into these new experiences and capabilities. We believe it is important to signal to our customers that The Home Depot is evolving as their needs change. While it's still early in our campaign, we see customers responding to our enhanced capabilities, giving us credit for saving them time and helping them complete their projects. In response to our campaign, we saw one of our largest single days of downloads of our award-winning mobile app and double-digit growth in usage of mobile tools like product locator and image search.
As we look forward to 2020, we will continue our investments to better meet our customers' needs and drive a great shopping experience. One of the investments you will see in the first half of the year is a reset to our outdoor power equipment base. We know the marketplace for outdoor power tools is transitioning to cordless technology. And we learned in our tools department that once a customer adopts the battery platform, they see tremendous value in sticking with that platform.
Similar to what we have done in our tools department, we are in the process of resetting our outdoor power equipment base to showcase our assortment by brand, highlighting EGO, Toro, Milwaukee, RYOBI, DEWALT and Makita, many of which can only be found at The Home Depot. Through this new presentation, customers can clearly see and easily shop the value proposition that these cordless platforms bring, including being more environmentally friendly, safer and easier to use, all with the power and run time to get the job done. 
These powerful brands now have the lion's share of batteries in the marketplace with hundreds of millions of batteries in customers' homes and job sites today. We currently offer over 1,000 cordless power tools, and that number will continue to grow as our supplier partners are introducing innovative product all the time. Our comprehensive and unique assortment of outdoor power equipment resulted in double-digit comps in fiscal 2019. 
With spring right around the corner, we are gearing up for another busy season. Our stores are stocked with new and innovative product, and we just recently announced that we are hiring 80,000 new associates to help us serve our customers during our spring selling season.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard."
278679,654358946,1920635,"The Home Depot, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2020",2020-02-25,"Earnings Calls","The Home Depot, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone.

Before we begin, let me take a quick moment to remind everyone that fiscal 2019 consisted of 52 weeks, while fiscal 2018 consisted of 53 weeks. This extra week added approximately $1.7 billion in sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. When we report our comparable sales or comps, we report them on a 52-week to 52-week basis by comparing weeks 1 through 52 of fiscal 2019 with weeks 2 through 53 of fiscal 2018. 
In the fourth quarter of 2019, total sales were $25.8 billion, a 2.7% decrease from last year, reflecting the compare against the extra week in 2018. Our total company comp sales in the fourth quarter increased 5.2%, and comps in the U.S. increased 5.3%. Because of last year's 53rd week and the resulting calendar shift, our monthly comps are distorted due to the timing of our annual Black Friday and Cyber Monday events this year versus last year.
Our reported monthly comps for the total company were positive 1.2% in November, 9.9% in December and 5.7% in January. Our monthly comps in the U.S. were positive 1.1% in November, 10.4% in December and 5.8% in January. Given the distortion in our monthly comps caused by the calendar shift, we believe it is more appropriate to look at November and December on a combined basis. For the combined 2 months of November and December, our total company comp was 5%, followed by 5.7% in January. 
For the year, our sales totaled a record $110.2 billion. If we exclude the sales from the 53rd week in fiscal 2018, we grew sales by approximately $3.7 billion in fiscal 2019, a level of growth unmatched in our market. For the year, total company comp sales increased 3.5%, and U.S. comp sales increased 3.8%.
In the fourth quarter, our gross margin was 33.9%, a decrease of 20 basis points from last year. Similar to last quarter, the change in our gross margin was primarily driven by higher shrink and a mix of products sold compared to last year. For the year, our gross margin was 34.1%, slightly higher than our guidance at the beginning of the year. 
In the fourth quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 64 basis points to 20.7%, slightly better than our plan. During the quarter, we saw approximately 77 basis points of leverage as we lapped the fiscal 2018 impairment of certain trade names and the 53rd week last year. This leverage was partially offset by expenses related to our strategic investment plan of approximately $280 million, which increased approximately $25 million from last year and caused 12 basis points of deleverage.
Fiscal 2019 operating expense as a percent of sales was 19.7%, a decrease of 28 basis points from last year. Our fiscal 2019 expense performance was better than our initial expectations, driven by productivity initiatives in our core business. During the year, we spent approximately $1 billion of investment expenses related to our strategic initiatives, in line with our plan.
Our operating margin for the fourth quarter was approximately 13.2% and for the year was approximately 14.4%. Interest and other expense for the fourth quarter grew by $27 million to $292 million due primarily to higher long-term debt levels than 1 year ago. 
In the fourth quarter, our effective tax rate was 20.3%, and from fiscal 2019 was 23.6%. The lower-than-expected effective tax rate in the fourth quarter and for fiscal 2019 was driven primarily by several discrete tax items. Our diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $2.28, an increase of 9.1% from last year. For fiscal 2019, diluted earnings per share were $10.25, an increase of 5.3% compared to fiscal 2018. 
Moving on to some additional highlights. We ended the year with a store count of 2,291, while retail selling square footage was approximately 238 million square feet. For the fiscal year, total sales per retail square foot were $455, the highest in our company's history.
At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories grew $606 million to $14.5 billion. And inventory turns were 4.9x, down slightly versus last year. The growth in our inventory versus last year reflects the investments we are making to accelerate merchandising resets and higher in-stock levels than we had 1 year ago. 
Moving on to capital allocation. In fiscal 2019, we generated approximately $13.7 billion of cash from operations and used that cash as well as the proceeds from $2.4 billion of net debt issuances to invest in our business, pay dividends to our shareholders and repurchase our shares. During the year, we invested approximately $2.7 billion back into the business through capital expenditures. Further, we paid $6 billion in dividends to our shareholders.
Finally, during the year, we repurchased approximately $7 billion or about 32.8 million of our outstanding shares, including roughly $3.25 billion or 14.5 million shares in the fourth quarter. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 45.4%, 60 basis points higher than the end of fiscal 2018. 
Today's press release includes our guidance for fiscal 2020, and I want to take a few moments to comment on the highlights. Remember that we guide off of GAAP, so fiscal 2020 guidance will launch from our reported results for fiscal 2019.
At our investor conference in December of 2019, we shared with you some preliminary thoughts for 2020, and we are reiterating that guidance today. The economy is strong and the U.S. consumer is healthy. The foundation of our sales plan starts with GDP, and our 2020 sales guidance assumes U.S. GDP growth of slightly less than 2% in 2020. To GDP, we add the impact that we think we will see from the housing environment, including demand driven by home price appreciation, housing turnover, household formation and the age of the housing stock. As we look at these metrics, we see an environment that is healthy and stable.
Our 2020 sales guidance also assumes that we will continue to gain share in the marketplace. For fiscal 2020, we expect both sales growth and total company comp sales growth of approximately 3.5% to 4%. Fiscal 2020 represents the peak year of our investment program. And as a result, we expect our fiscal 2020 operating expenses to grow at 1.2x the rate of our expected sales growth. 
For the year, we expect to grow operating profit dollars to $16 billion, giving us an operating margin of approximately 14%. For fiscal 2020, we assume our effective tax rate will be approximately 24%. We expect fiscal 2020 diluted earnings per share to grow approximately 2% to $10.45.
For the year, we project cash flow from operations of approximately $13.5 billion. We plan to invest $2.8 billion of this cash back into the business in the form of capital expenditures. We also plan to use this cash to pay $6.4 billion of dividends and repurchase at least $5 billion of outstanding shares. 
Before I close, I would like to update you on how we're thinking about one of our capital allocation principles. With regards to our dividend, in lieu of using a 55% payout ratio, we will look to grow our dividend every year as we grow earnings, as we have for the last 11 years. This morning, we announced that our Board increased our quarterly dividend by 10%, which equates to an annual dividend of $6 per share.
With that, I want to thank you for your participation in today's call. And Christine, we are now ready for questions."

Same thing would hold true for what Ted referenced as it relates to the lithium technology and the average ticket growth we've seen in power tools and now in outdoor power equipment.
So I think there's some innovation and investment factors that have helped drive ticket, maybe even above and beyond as we took share in those categories. But we've been pretty pleased with the consistency of our traffic growth over time. And like I said, we'll work to balance traffic and ticket.

It's all those things coming together that actually delivered on this quarter.
So yes, we're pleased with the continued growth that we see in the initiatives. But at the same time, really proud of the team. The execution by our stores was outstanding. The supply chain team did a great job. Our suppliers gave us outstanding products and values. And the customer's ability to start that shopping experience in the digital world and research product and/or purchase product there, all of that is leading to the kind of performance that we saw in the fourth quarter."

Fiscal 2019 was another record year for our business as we achieved the highest sales in company history. Excluding the extra week in 2018, fiscal 2019 sales grew 3.5% to $110.2 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $10.25.
As expected, we finished the year with our strongest comp performance in the fourth quarter. Comp sales were up 5.2% from last year, and our U.S. comps were positive 5.3%. Sales for the fourth quarter were $25.8 billion, and diluted earnings per share were $2.28.
We saw broad-based growth across all geographies and merchandising departments in the quarter. All 19 of our U.S. regions posted positive comps. And internationally, both Canada and Mexico reported positive comps in the fourth quarter.
As Ted will detail, both comp ticket and transactions grew in the quarter, and we saw growth with both our Pro and DIY customers. We had a strong holiday season with record-setting sales on Black Friday and during Cyber Week. These results reflect solid execution by our stores, our merchants, our supply chain teams as well as our vendor partners and demonstrate the overall health of the consumer.
I'm proud of our results in fiscal 2019 as the team successfully navigated a number of external headwinds by maintaining a relentless focus on our customer. 2019 was also a pivotal year in our transformation to create the One Home Depot experience. We are now 2 years into our multiyear investment and are realizing benefits. We have more conviction than ever that these strategic initiatives are creating a value proposition that is unique to the marketplace and will extend our leadership position for years to come. 
The majority of our U.S. stores have a new look and feel, and we addressed customer pain points around navigation and checkout. Our enhanced signage and store refresh package, along with investments in the front end of our stores, have improved the customer experience and driven associate productivity. These store investments are driving higher customer satisfaction scores, which we believe is translating into market share gains. 
As a complement to our store investments, we are investing to strengthen the competitive advantages that we have built through the blending of our physical and digital platforms into a more seamless interconnected experience. For example, our chain-wide rollout of digital appliance labels, connecting ratings from the digital world to the physical world, enhancing the in-store shopping experience.
Additionally, homedepot.com continues to be an engine for growth for our overall business, driving increased traffic online and additional footsteps to our stores. Because of this, we continue to invest in search functionality, category presentations, product content and enhanced fulfillment options to remove friction from the online shopping experience. 
Excluding the extra week last year, online sales grew 20.8% in the quarter and 21.4% for the year. And over 50% of the time, our customers choose to pick up their order in a store. This is the power of the interconnected retail strategy. 
We have also expanded our digital capabilities by investing in a B2B website experience tailored specifically for the needs of our Pro customers. We have now onboarded over 1 million Pro customers. Additionally, during the quarter, we completed the integration of a third-party, best-in-class CRM system for all of our Pro sales and services teams. This enhances our visibility, enabling us to better serve our customers. I'm excited about the opportunities ahead as we continue to build capabilities to engage with the Pro, no matter when, where or how they want to interact. 
Another key component of the best-in-class interconnected shopping experience centers on the enhanced delivery and fulfillment options. In 2019, we continued our multiyear journey to create the fastest, most efficient delivery network in home improvement. We are now live with at least one of each type of facility that we are building. Though it is early days, we are pleased with the initial results.
For example, we have opened a dozen market delivery operations, or MDOs, that have enabled us to transition 20% of our appliance deliveries from an outsourced model to one in which we control more of the customer experience. This has translated to meaningful improvements in our customer satisfaction scores for appliance deliveries. Our supply chain build-out will continue to ramp from here, with the largest number of new facilities coming online in 2021 and 2022. 
Turning to 2020, Richard will take you through the details, but we expect another year of growth with both sales and comp growth ranging from approximately 3.5% to 4% and diluted earnings per share of approximately $10.45. Today, our Board approved a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend to $1.50 per share, which equates to an annual dividend of $6 per share. We remain committed to maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation to create value for our shareholders. 
I'm incredibly proud of the progress our teams made as we transform ourselves into the One Home Depot of the future. While we define our sales growth in percentage terms, we capture share in dollar terms. And through the second year of our One Home Depot investment program, we have grown sales by over $9 billion, a level of growth unmatched in our market.
As we look forward to 2020, I am more excited than ever about the opportunities ahead. We are investing to unlock the power of a truly interconnected customer experience by enhancing our already strong foundation to further extend our leadership position into the marketplace. As with any transformation, the work we are doing is complex, and I'm proud of the way our associates continue to execute at high levels and focus on what's most important in our business, our customers.
I want to close by thanking our associates for their hard work and dedication in the fourth quarter and throughout the year. For the second half of the year, 100% of our stores will receive Success Sharing, our bonus program for our hourly associates. We look forward to continuing our momentum in 2020.
And with that, let me turn the call over to Ted."

We saw growth across the store at both our Pro and DIY customers. All of our merchandising departments posted positive comps, led by our appliance department, which posted double-digit comps in the quarter. Comps in decor and storage and tools were also above the company average. All other merchandising departments were positive, but below the company comp of 5.2%. 
In the fourth quarter, comp average ticket increased 4.4%, and comp transactions increased 0.8%. The strength in our comp was partially driven by a shift in our event timing, which Richard will talk through in a moment. In addition, we had an excellent response to our Black Friday and holiday events, and our customers continue to trade up to new and innovative items. After experiencing significant deflation in lumber and copper during the first 3 quarters of 2019, commodity prices had a more neutral impact in the fourth quarter. 
During the fourth quarter, big-ticket comp transactions or those over $1,000, which represent approximately 20% of U.S. sales, were up double digits. The strength in our big-ticket sales was driven in part by the shift in our event timing as well as strong performance in a number of other big-ticket categories. During the fourth quarter, big-ticket categories like appliances, vinyl plank flooring and our installation services business, all posted comps above the company average. 
Consumer demand is strong, and this was evident during our annual Black Friday, gift center and decorative holiday events. The partnership and collaboration between our merchants and supplier partners helped in the fantastic lineup of great deals and special buys in categories like smart home, power tools, hand tools and decorative holiday. Our unique assortment, together with excellent customer service and execution, led to incredible results. Black Friday was a record sales day for our company, and our gift center event grew double digits versus last year. 
We also saw our customers tackle a variety of projects around the house. During the fourth quarter, we saw comps above the company average in several kitchen and bath categories, special or window coverings, cleaning and exterior paint. We also saw significant growth in our online-only home decor categories, which we call HD Home, as we build awareness around these high-quality, style-forward assortments. Sales to our Pro customers were healthy, driven by strength in categories like pneumatics, concrete, hand tools and caulks, all of which grew faster than the company average. 
Looking back at 2019, our team continued their unwavering commitment to serve our customers with great everyday values and innovative products. And we did this while investing in a customer-backed store and interconnected experience to ensure that we continue to be the product authority in home improvement for years to come. 
At our investors' conference back in December, we talked about investments we were making across our business. We also shared our new ad campaign and tagline, How Doers Get More Done, that we launched to highlight our investments into these new experiences and capabilities. We believe it is important to signal to our customers that The Home Depot is evolving as their needs change. While it is still early in our campaign, we see customers responding to our enhanced capabilities, giving us credit for saving them time and helping them complete their projects. In response to our campaign, we saw one of our largest single days of downloads of our award-winning mobile app and double-digit growth in usage of mobile tools like product locator and image search.
As we look forward to 2020, we will continue our investments to better meet our customers' needs and drive a great shopping experience. One of the investments you will see in the first half of the year is a reset to our outdoor power equipment bays. We know the marketplace for outdoor power tools is transitioning to cordless technology. And we learned in our tools department that once a customer adopts a battery platform, they see tremendous value in sticking with that platform.
Similar to what we have done in our tools department, we are in the process of resetting our outdoor power equipment bays to showcase our assortment by brand, highlighting EGO, Toro, Milwaukee, RYOBI, DEWALT and Makita, many of which can only be found at The Home Depot. Through this new presentation, customers can clearly see and easily shop the value proposition that these cordless platforms bring, including being more environmentally friendly, safer and easier to use, all with the power and run time to get the job done. 
These powerful brands now have the lion's share of batteries in the marketplace with hundreds of millions of batteries in customers' homes and job sites today. We currently offer over 1,000 cordless power tools, and that number will continue to grow as our supplier partners are introducing innovative product all the time. Our comprehensive and unique assortment of outdoor power equipment resulted in double-digit comps in fiscal 2019. 
With spring right around the corner, we are gearing up for another busy season. Our stores are stocked with new and innovative product, and we just recently announced that we are hiring 80,000 new associates to help us serve our customers during our spring selling season.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard."

Before we begin, let me take a quick moment to remind everyone that fiscal 2019 consisted of 52 weeks, while fiscal 2018 consisted of 53 weeks. This extra week added approximately $1.7 billion in sales for the f",1270,"Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, let me take a quick moment to remind everyone that fiscal 2019 consisted of 52 weeks, while fiscal 2018 consisted of 53 weeks. This extra week added approximately $1.7 billion in sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. When we report our comparable sales or comps, we report them on a 52-week-to-52-week basis by comparing weeks 1 through 52 of fiscal 2019 with weeks 2 through 53 of fiscal 2018. 
In the fourth quarter of 2019, total sales were $25.8 billion, a 2.7% decrease from last year, reflecting the compare against the extra week in 2018. Our total company comp sales in the fourth quarter increased 5.2%, and comps in the U.S. increased 5.3%. Because of last year's 53rd week and the resulting calendar shift, our monthly comps are distorted due to the timing of our annual Black Friday and Cyber Monday events this year versus last year.
Our reported monthly comps for the total company were positive 1.2% in November, 9.9% in December and 5.7% in January. Our monthly comps in the U.S. were positive 1.1% in November, 10.4% in December and 5.8% in January. Given the distortion in our monthly comps caused by the calendar shift, we believe it is more appropriate to look at November and December on a combined basis. For the combined 2 months of November and December, our total company comp was 5%, followed by 5.7% in January. 
For the year, our sales totaled a record $110.2 billion. If we exclude the sales from the 53rd week in fiscal 2018, we grew sales by approximately $3.7 billion in fiscal 2019, a level of growth unmatched in our market. For the year, total company comp sales increased 3.5%, and U.S. comp sales increased 3.8%.
In the fourth quarter, our gross margin was 33.9%, a decrease of 20 basis points from last year. Similar to last quarter, the change in our gross margin was primarily driven by higher shrink and a mix of products sold compared to last year. For the year, our gross margin was 34.1%, slightly higher than our guidance at the beginning of the year. 
In the fourth quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 64 basis points to 20.7%, slightly better than our plan. During the quarter, we saw approximately 77 basis points of leverage as we lapped the fiscal 2018 impairment of certain trade names and the 53rd week last year. This leverage was partially offset by expenses related to our strategic investment plan of approximately $280 million, which increased approximately $25 million from last year and caused 12 basis points of deleverage.
Fiscal 2019 operating expense as a percent of sales was 19.7%, a decrease of 28 basis points from last year. Our fiscal 2019 expense performance was better than our initial expectations, driven by productivity initiatives in our core business. During the year, we spent approximately $1 billion of investment expenses related to our strategic initiatives, in line with our plan.
Our operating margin for the fourth quarter was approximately 13.2% and for the year was approximately 14.4%. Interest and other expense for the fourth quarter grew by $27 million to $292 million due primarily to higher long-term debt levels than 1 year ago. 
In the fourth quarter, our effective tax rate was 20.3%, and from fiscal 2019 was 23.6%. The lower-than-expected effective tax rate in the fourth quarter and for fiscal 2019 was driven primarily by several discrete tax items. Our diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $2.28, an increase of 9.1% from last year. For fiscal 2019, diluted earnings per share were $10.25, an increase of 5.3% compared to fiscal 2018. 
Moving on to some additional highlights. We ended the year with a store count of 2,291, while retail selling square footage was approximately 238 million square feet. For the fiscal year, total sales per retail square foot were $455, the highest in our company's history.
At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories grew $606 million to $14.5 billion. And inventory turns were 4.9x, down slightly versus last year. The growth in our inventory versus last year reflects the investments we are making to accelerate merchandising resets and higher in-stock levels than we had 1 year ago. 
Moving on to capital allocation. In fiscal 2019, we generated approximately $13.7 billion of cash from operations and used that cash as well as the proceeds from $2.4 billion of net debt issuances to invest in our business, pay dividends to our shareholders and repurchase our shares. During the year, we invested approximately $2.7 billion back into the business through capital expenditures. Further, we paid $6 billion in dividends to our shareholders.
Finally, during the year, we repurchased approximately $7 billion or about 32.8 million of our outstanding shares, including roughly $3.25 billion or 14.5 million shares in the fourth quarter. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 45.4%, 60 basis points higher than the end of fiscal 2018. 
Today's press release includes our guidance for fiscal 2020, and I want to take a few moments to comment on the highlights. Remember that we guide off of GAAP, so fiscal 2020 guidance will launch from our reported results for fiscal 2019.
At our investor conference in December of 2019, we shared with you some preliminary thoughts for 2020, and we are reiterating that guidance today. The economy is strong and the U.S. consumer is healthy. The foundation of our sales plan starts with GDP, and our 2020 sales guidance assumes U.S. GDP growth of slightly less than 2% in 2020. To GDP, we add the impact that we think we will see from the housing environment, including demand driven by home price appreciation, housing turnover, household formation and the age of the housing stock. As we look at these metrics, we see an environment that is healthy and stable.
Our 2020 sales guidance also assumes that we will continue to gain share in the marketplace. For fiscal 2020, we expect both sales growth and total company comp sales growth of approximately 3.5% to 4%. Fiscal 2020 represents the peak year of our investment program. And as a result, we expect our fiscal 2020 operating expenses to grow at 1.2x the rate of our expected sales growth. 
For the year, we expect to grow operating profit dollars to $16 billion, giving us an operating margin of approximately 14%. For fiscal 2020, we assume our effective tax rate will be approximately 24%. We expect fiscal 2020 diluted earnings per share to grow approximately 2% to $10.45.
For the year, we project cash flow from operations of approximately $13.5 billion. We plan to invest $2.8 billion of this cash back into the business in the form of capital expenditures. We also plan to use this cash to pay $6.4 billion of dividends and repurchase at least $5 billion of outstanding shares. 
Before I close, I would like to update you on how we're thinking about one of our capital allocation principles. With regards to our dividend, in lieu of using a 55% payout ratio, we will look to grow our dividend every year as we grow earnings, as we have for the last 11 years. This morning, we announced that our Board increased our quarterly dividend by 10%, which equates to an annual dividend of $6 per share.
With that, I want to thank you for your participation in today's call. And Christine, we are now ready for questions."

So I think there's some innovation and investment factors that have helped drive ticket, maybe even above and beyond as we took share in those categories. But we've been pretty pleased with the consistency of our traffic growth over time. And like I said, we'll work to balance traffic and ticket.

Excluding the extra week in 2018, fiscal 2019 sales grew 3.5% to $110.2 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $10.25.
As expected, we finished the year with our strongest comp performance in the fourth quarter. Comp sales were up 5.2% from last year, and our U.S. comps were positive 5.3%. Sales for the fourth quarter were $25.8 billion, and diluted earnings per share were $2.28.
We saw broad-based growth across all geographies and merchandising departments in the quarter. All 19 of our U.S. regions posted positive comps. And internationally, both Canada and Mexico reported positive comps in the fourth quarter.
As Ted will detail, both comp ticket and transactions grew in the quarter, and we saw growth with both our Pro and DIY customers. We had a strong holiday season with record-setting sales on Black Friday and during Cyber Week. These results reflect solid execution by our stores, our merchants, our supply chain teams as well as our vendor partners and demonstrate the overall health of the consumer.
I'm proud of our results in fiscal 2019 as the team successfully navigated a number of external headwinds by maintaining a relentless focus on our customer. 2019 was also a pivotal year in our transformation to create the One Home Depot experience. We are now 2 years into our multiyear investment and are realizing benefits. We have more conviction than ever that these strategic initiatives are creating a value proposition that is unique to the marketplace and will extend our leadership position for years to come. 
The majority of our U.S. stores have a new look and feel, and we addressed customer pain points around navigation and checkout. Our enhanced signage and store refresh package, along with investments in the front end of our stores, have improved the customer experience and driven associate productivity. These store investments are driving higher customer satisfaction scores, which we believe is translating into market share gains. 
As a complement to our store investments, we are investing to strengthen the competitive advantages that we have built through the blending of our physical and digital platforms into a more seamless interconnected experience. For example, our chain-wide rollout of digital appliance labels, connecting ratings from the digital world to the physical world, enhancing the in-store shopping experience.
Additionally, homedepot.com continues to be an engine for growth for our overall business, driving increased traffic online and additional footsteps to our stores. Because of this, we continue to invest in search functionality, category presentations, product content and enhanced fulfillment options to remove friction from the online shopping experience. 
Excluding the extra week last year, online sales grew 20.8% in the quarter and 21.4% for the year. And over 50% of the time, our customers choose to pick up their order in a store. This is the power of the interconnected retail strategy. 
We have also expanded our digital capabilities by investing in a B2B website experience tailored specifically for the needs of our Pro customers. We have now onboarded over 1 million Pro customers. Additionally, during the quarter, we completed the integration of a third-party, best-in-class CRM system for all of our Pro sales and services teams. This enhances our visibility, enabling us to better serve our customers. I'm excited about the opportunities ahead as we continue to build capabilities to engage with the Pro, no matter when, where or how they want to interact. 
Another key component of the best-in-class interconnected shopping experience centers on the enhanced delivery and fulfillment options. In 2019, we continued our multiyear journey to create the fastest, most efficient delivery network in home improvement. We are now live with at least one of each type of facility that we are building. Though it is early days, we are pleased with the initial results.
For example, we have opened a dozen market delivery operations, or MDOs, that have enabled us to transition 20% of our appliance deliveries from an outsourced model to one in which we control more of the customer experience. This has translated to meaningful improvements in our customer satisfaction scores for appliance deliveries. Our supply chain build-out will continue to ramp from here, with the largest number of new facilities coming online in 2021 and 2022. 
Turning to 2020. Richard will take you through the details, but we expect another year of growth with both sales and comp growth ranging from approximately 3.5% to 4% and diluted earnings per share of approximately $10.45. Today, our Board approved a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend to $1.50 per share, which equates to an annual dividend of $6 per share. We remain committed to maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation to create value for our shareholders. 
I'm incredibly proud of the progress our teams made as we transform ourselves into the One Home Depot of the future. While we define our sales growth in percentage terms, we capture share in dollar terms. And through the second year of our One Home Depot investment program, we have grown sales by over $9 billion, a level of growth unmatched in our market.
As we look forward to 2020, I am more excited than ever about the opportunities ahead. We are investing to unlock the power of a truly interconnected customer experience by enhancing our already strong foundation to further extend our leadership position into the marketplace. As with any transformation, the work we are doing is complex, and I'm proud of the way our associates continue to execute at high levels and focus on what's most important in our business, our customers.
I want to close by thanking our associates for their hard work and dedication in the fourth quarter and throughout the year. For the second half of the year, 100% of our stores will receive Success Sharing, our bonus program for our hourly associates. We look forward to continuing our momentum in 2020.
And with that, let me turn the call over to Ted."

We saw growth across the store at both our Pro and DIY customers. All of our merchandising departments posted positive comps, led by our appliance department, which posted double-digit comps in the quarter. Comps in decor and storage and tools were also above the company average. All other merchandising departments were positive, but below the company comp of 5.2%. 
In the fourth quarter, comp average ticket increased 4.4%, and comp transactions increased 0.8%. The strength in our comp was partially driven by a shift in our event timing, which Richard will talk through in a moment. In addition, we had an excellent response to our Black Friday and holiday events, and our customers continue to trade up to new and innovative items. After experiencing significant deflation in lumber and copper during the first 3 quarters of 2019, commodity prices had a more neutral impact in the fourth quarter. 
During the fourth quarter, big-ticket comp transactions or those over $1,000, which represent approximately 20% of U.S. sales, were up double digits. The strength in our big-ticket sales was driven in part by the shift in our event timing as well as strong performance in a number of other big-ticket categories. During the fourth quarter, big-ticket categories like appliances, vinyl plank flooring and our installation services business, all posted comps above the company average. 
Consumer demand is strong, and this was evident during our annual Black Friday, gift center and decorative holiday events. The partnership and collaboration between our merchants and supplier partners helped in the fantastic lineup of great deals and special buys in categories like smart home, power tools, hand tools and decorative holiday. Our unique assortment, together with excellent customer service and execution, led to incredible results. Black Friday was a record sales day for our company, and our gift center event grew double digits versus last year. 
We also saw our customers tackle a variety of projects around the house. During the fourth quarter, we saw comps above the company average in several kitchen and bath categories, special or window coverings, cleaning and exterior paint. We also saw significant growth in our online-only home decor categories, which we call HD Home, as we build awareness around these high-quality, style-forward assortments. Sales to our Pro customers were healthy, driven by strength in categories like pneumatics, concrete, hand tools and caulks, all of which grew faster than the company average. 
Looking back at 2019, our team continued their unwavering commitment to serve our customers with great everyday values and innovative products. And we did this while investing in a customer-backed store and interconnected experience to ensure that we continue to be the product authority in home improvement for years to come. 
At our investors' conference back in December, we talked about investments we were making across our business. We also shared our new ad campaign and tagline, How Doers Get More Done, that we launched to highlight our investments into these new experiences and capabilities. We believe it is important to signal to our customers that The Home Depot is evolving as their needs change. While it is still early in our campaign, we see customers responding to our enhanced capabilities, giving us credit for saving them time and helping them complete their projects. In response to our campaign, we saw one of our largest single days of downloads of our award-winning mobile app and double-digit growth in usage of mobile tools like product locator and image search.
As we look forward to 2020, we will continue our investments to better meet our customers' needs and drive a great shopping experience. One of the investments you will see in the first half of the year is a reset to our outdoor power equipment bays. We know the marketplace for outdoor power tools is transitioning to cordless technology. And we learned in our tools department that once a customer adopts a battery platform, they see tremendous value in sticking with that platform.
Similar to what we have done in our tools department, we are in the process of resetting our outdoor power equipment bays to showcase our assortment by brand, highlighting EGO, Toro, Milwaukee, RYOBI, DEWALT and Makita, many of which can only be found at The Home Depot. Through this new presentation, customers can clearly see and easily shop the value proposition that these cordless platforms bring, including being more environmentally friendly, safer and easier to use, all with the power and run time to get the job done. 
These powerful brands now have the lion's share of batteries in the marketplace with hundreds of millions of batteries in customers' homes and job sites today. We currently offer over 1,000 cordless power tools, and that number will continue to grow as our supplier partners are introducing innovative product all the time. Our comprehensive and unique assortment of outdoor power equipment resulted in double-digit comps in fiscal 2019. 
With spring right around the corner, we are gearing up for another busy season. Our stores are stocked with new and innovative product, and we just recently announced that we are hiring 80,000 new associates to help us serve our customers during our spring selling season.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard."
278679,654358946,1931679,"The Home Depot, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2020",2020-02-25,"Earnings Calls","The Home Depot, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, let me take a quick moment to remind everyone that fiscal 2019 consisted of 52 weeks, while fiscal 2018 consisted of 53 weeks. This extra week added approximately $1.7 billion in sales for the f",1270,"Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, let me take a quick moment to remind everyone that fiscal 2019 consisted of 52 weeks, while fiscal 2018 consisted of 53 weeks. This extra week added approximately $1.7 billion in sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. When we report our comparable sales or comps, we report them on a 52-week-to-52-week basis by comparing weeks 1 through 52 of fiscal 2019 with weeks 2 through 53 of fiscal 2018. 
In the fourth quarter of 2019, total sales were $25.8 billion, a 2.7% decrease from last year, reflecting the compare against the extra week in 2018. Our total company comp sales in the fourth quarter increased 5.2%, and comps in the U.S. increased 5.3%. Because of last year's 53rd week and the resulting calendar shift, our monthly comps are distorted due to the timing of our annual Black Friday and Cyber Monday events this year versus last year.
Our reported monthly comps for the total company were positive 1.2% in November, 9.9% in December and 5.7% in January. Our monthly comps in the U.S. were positive 1.1% in November, 10.4% in December and 5.8% in January. Given the distortion in our monthly comps caused by the calendar shift, we believe it is more appropriate to look at November and December on a combined basis. For the combined 2 months of November and December, our total company comp was 5%, followed by 5.7% in January. 
For the year, our sales totaled a record $110.2 billion. If we exclude the sales from the 53rd week in fiscal 2018, we grew sales by approximately $3.7 billion in fiscal 2019, a level of growth unmatched in our market. For the year, total company comp sales increased 3.5%, and U.S. comp sales increased 3.8%.
In the fourth quarter, our gross margin was 33.9%, a decrease of 20 basis points from last year. Similar to last quarter, the change in our gross margin was primarily driven by higher shrink and a mix of products sold compared to last year. For the year, our gross margin was 34.1%, slightly higher than our guidance at the beginning of the year. 
In the fourth quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 64 basis points to 20.7%, slightly better than our plan. During the quarter, we saw approximately 77 basis points of leverage as we lapped the fiscal 2018 impairment of certain trade names and the 53rd week last year. This leverage was partially offset by expenses related to our strategic investment plan of approximately $280 million, which increased approximately $25 million from last year and caused 12 basis points of deleverage.
Fiscal 2019 operating expense as a percent of sales was 19.7%, a decrease of 28 basis points from last year. Our fiscal 2019 expense performance was better than our initial expectations, driven by productivity initiatives in our core business. During the year, we spent approximately $1 billion of investment expenses related to our strategic initiatives, in line with our plan.
Our operating margin for the fourth quarter was approximately 13.2% and for the year was approximately 14.4%. Interest and other expense for the fourth quarter grew by $27 million to $292 million due primarily to higher long-term debt levels than 1 year ago. 
In the fourth quarter, our effective tax rate was 20.3%, and from fiscal 2019 was 23.6%. The lower-than-expected effective tax rate in the fourth quarter and for fiscal 2019 was driven primarily by several discrete tax items. Our diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $2.28, an increase of 9.1% from last year. For fiscal 2019, diluted earnings per share were $10.25, an increase of 5.3% compared to fiscal 2018. 
Moving on to some additional highlights. We ended the year with a store count of 2,291, while retail selling square footage was approximately 238 million square feet. For the fiscal year, total sales per retail square foot were $455, the highest in our company's history.
At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories grew $606 million to $14.5 billion. And inventory turns were 4.9x, down slightly versus last year. The growth in our inventory versus last year reflects the investments we are making to accelerate merchandising resets and higher in-stock levels than we had 1 year ago. 
Moving on to capital allocation. In fiscal 2019, we generated approximately $13.7 billion of cash from operations and used that cash as well as the proceeds from $2.4 billion of net debt issuances to invest in our business, pay dividends to our shareholders and repurchase our shares. During the year, we invested approximately $2.7 billion back into the business through capital expenditures. Further, we paid $6 billion in dividends to our shareholders.
Finally, during the year, we repurchased approximately $7 billion or about 32.8 million of our outstanding shares, including roughly $3.25 billion or 14.5 million shares in the fourth quarter. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 45.4%, 60 basis points higher than the end of fiscal 2018. 
Today's press release includes our guidance for fiscal 2020, and I want to take a few moments to comment on the highlights. Remember that we guide off of GAAP, so fiscal 2020 guidance will launch from our reported results for fiscal 2019.
At our investor conference in December of 2019, we shared with you some preliminary thoughts for 2020, and we are reiterating that guidance today. The economy is strong and the U.S. consumer is healthy. The foundation of our sales plan starts with GDP, and our 2020 sales guidance assumes U.S. GDP growth of slightly less than 2% in 2020. To GDP, we add the impact that we think we will see from the housing environment, including demand driven by home price appreciation, housing turnover, household formation and the age of the housing stock. As we look at these metrics, we see an environment that is healthy and stable.
Our 2020 sales guidance also assumes that we will continue to gain share in the marketplace. For fiscal 2020, we expect both sales growth and total company comp sales growth of approximately 3.5% to 4%. Fiscal 2020 represents the peak year of our investment program. And as a result, we expect our fiscal 2020 operating expenses to grow at 1.2x the rate of our expected sales growth. 
For the year, we expect to grow operating profit dollars to $16 billion, giving us an operating margin of approximately 14%. For fiscal 2020, we assume our effective tax rate will be approximately 24%. We expect fiscal 2020 diluted earnings per share to grow approximately 2% to $10.45.
For the year, we project cash flow from operations of approximately $13.5 billion. We plan to invest $2.8 billion of this cash back into the business in the form of capital expenditures. We also plan to use this cash to pay $6.4 billion of dividends and repurchase at least $5 billion of outstanding shares. 
Before I close, I would like to update you on how we're thinking about one of our capital allocation principles. With regards to our dividend, in lieu of using a 55% payout ratio, we will look to grow our dividend every year as we grow earnings, as we have for the last 11 years. This morning, we announced that our Board increased our quarterly dividend by 10%, which equates to an annual dividend of $6 per share.
With that, I want to thank you for your participation in today's call. And Christine, we are now ready for questions."

Same thing would hold true for what Ted referenced as it relates to the lithium technology and the average ticket growth we've seen in power tools and now in outdoor power equipment.
So I think there's some innovation and investment factors that have helped drive ticket, maybe even above and beyond as we took share in those categories. But we've been pretty pleased with the consistency of our traffic growth over time. And like I said, we'll work to balance traffic and ticket.

We hope that you and your loved ones are safe and healthy, and our thoughts and prayers are with all of those who have been directly impacted by COVID-19. I also want to thank all of our incredible associates and supplier partners for their hard work and dedication to serving our customers and communities in this time of need. And while the purpose of the call today is to update you on our first quarter results, I thought it would be helpful to explain how we are thinking about and making decisions at the Home Depot. 
When our founder started the company over 40 years ago, they did so by first defining the type of culture and value system that they wanted to promote. These values are the foundation for our business and provide the lens through which we evaluate our decisions. Anchoring to these values in this time of crisis has never been more critical. Our decisions and actions are rooted in a commitment to do the right thing, to take care of our people and be there for our customers and communities. To that end, as the situation around COVID-19 has evolved, our focus has been and continues to be on 2 key priorities: the safety and well-being of our associates and customers and providing our customers and communities with essential products and services. The team's alignment around these 2 objectives has enabled critical speed and flexibility when making decisions and implementing a number of changes across the business in a rapidly evolving and incredibly fluid environment. 
I'd like to briefly touch on just a few of the early and decisive actions that we took in support of these primary objectives. To promote a safe environment for associates and customers, we implemented a number of operational changes starting in mid-March. We have adjusted our store hours. Closing earlier than usual to give our associates more time to properly clean and sanitize and restock our shelves. We took a proactive and early stance on limiting customer traffic in our stores to better maintain physical and social distancing protocols. At the height of our spring selling season, we also made the decision to cancel our annual spring events, including Spring Black Friday. This was not a decision that we took lightly. And yet, we made it confidently, given our belief that having this event would drive footsteps to our stores and directly undermine our commitment to prioritizing safety. 
To take care of our associates, we expanded our paid time off for all hourly associates that can be used at their discretion and will be paid out at year-end, if unused. We also are offering additional paid time off for associates who are 65 or older or deemed to be at higher risk by the CDC guidelines. We have instituted weekly bonuses for our hourly associates in our stores and distribution centers. We are providing double pay for overtime work, and we have extended dependent care benefits in the wave-related co-pays. Our more than 400,000 orange-blended associates are the heartbeat of the Home Depot and supporting them as a core value of our company. Beyond the grounding that our culture and values provides and the actions we have taken to support them, we believe that the Home Depot is uniquely positioned to weather COVID-19. Nobody could have predicted what has unfolded since we spoke with you 3 months ago on our earnings call in February. And yet the distinct competitive advantages and overarching benefits of an interacted One Home Depot strategy that were reinforced then are perhaps even more in focus and relevant today. Investments we have made over the years in our stores, market-leading digital assets, flexible supply chain and a world-class merchandising organization have allowed us to quickly adapt to shifts in customer needs preferences and behaviors. Our interconnected retail strategy and underlying technology infrastructure have supported record level web traffic for several weeks without disruption. Sales leveraging our digital platforms increased approximately 80% in the quarter. And more than 60% of the time, our customers opted to pick up their orders at a store. We were able to extend our in-store focus capabilities to curbside pickup in the U.S. in a matter of days, offering customers an additional choice with the respect to fulfillment. In the case of our Ontario stores in Canada, this curbside capability was turned on essentially overnight when it became the only option to remain open and operational, with those stores operating under these circumstances for more than a month. The flexibility and agility of our business model, coupled with our focus on execution and strong partnership with our suppliers, helped deliver solid results in the quarter and gave the board the confidence to declare a $1.50 per share quarterly dividend. Sales for the first quarter were $28.3 billion, up 7.1% from last year. Comp sales were up 6.4% from last year, with U.S. comps of positive 7.5%. Diluted earnings per share were $2.08 in the first quarter. Richard will walk you through the details in a moment. But I want to stress that while we were pleased with the results in the quarter, and we see an engaged customer, there was significant volatility. Month-to-month and even week-to-week, we saw extreme ups and downs across different categories and geographies. As a result, we are cautious to extrapolate trends from the first quarter into a forecast for the remaining of the year, particularly given the tremendous amount of uncertainty we face with regards to the duration and continued impacts of the virus. 
Despite the many unknowns of the current environment, we are confident that we have taken the steps to ensure that we will emerge from this crisis stronger and even better positioned for the future. Though this crisis is unparalleled in size and scope, we have built a reputation through our history of doing whatever it takes to be there for our associates, customers and communities in the most critical times, and this situation is no different. Once again, I want to thank our incredible associates and express how grateful and proud I am of the resiliency and strength that our teams have demonstrated as we navigate these extraordinary circumstances together. This reminds me of the words of our founder, Bernie Marcus, that have never resonated more deeply than they do today. If you take care of our associates, they take care of the customers and everything else takes care of itself. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ted."

I also want to start by thanking all of our associates and supplier partners for the incredible collaboration over the last several months. Supplier relationships and partnerships matter, and during times of crisis is when they matter the most. One of the actions we took early on when COVID-19 was impacting the supply chain in China was to establish regular and frequent contact with our suppliers, both internationally and domestically. As cases increased in the U.S., our suppliers help source the essential products our customers and communities needed. We established an effective plan, shifted resources as needed and worked on getting the right products to the right stores across the country. While in-stock levels vary from store to store and region to region, our focus remains on replenishing and restocking high-demand products as quickly as possible. 
We are grateful for our strong strategic partnerships. Our supplier partners are helping us in many ways, including supplying essential products for our own use. Let me give you an example. Very early on in the pandemic, we reached out to PPG, one of our key paint suppliers for health. We asked PPG if they could help supply hand sanitizer for our store associates. They quickly converted several of their manufacturing lines. And within a few short weeks, they produced an initial order of approximately 100,000 gallons of hand sanitizer. They are planning to produce 3x that amount for future in-store use that will help our associates for the remainder of the year. This is just one of many examples, and I want to thank PPG and all of the other supplier partners that have stepped up to help us prioritize the safety and well-being of our associates and customers. 
The challenges we face as a result of COVID-19, including the most fluid operating environment we've ever experienced, have further reinforced our strategy of the One Home Depot interconnected shopping experience. As a direct result of our investments across the business over the last decade, our teams were able to make decisions quickly and adapt to changing local government mandates and customer behavior. And as you heard from Craig, we did this while focusing on 2 priorities: keeping our associates and customers safe, and continuing to serve our communities with the essential products and services they need for their homes and places of work. Our continued investment in our interconnected capabilities has positioned us well as customers turn online for their shopping needs. The shelter-in-place orders were rolled out across the country in mid-to-late March. We saw our digital businesses accelerate from approximately 30% growth in early March to triple-digit growth by the end of April. In fact, daily traffic to homedepot.com reached new records toward the end of the quarter. During the last 3 weeks of the quarter, traffic to homedepot.com was consistently above Black Friday levels. And as a result of our continued investment in our digital infrastructure, and with the great work of our technology teams, we provide a continuous service to our customers, and our conversion rate continued to increase. 
During the quarter, we continued to leverage our different fulfillment capabilities like buy online, pick up in-store and our enhanced delivery capabilities, whether it be on a flatbed truck, a box truck for our car and van service. Our BOPUS and delivery from store fulfillment options saw triple-digit growth in the first quarter. In fact, the flexibility that we have built into our systems allowed us to quickly roll out the new fulfillment option for our customers to buy online and pick up at our stores through a contactless curbside pickup option. 
Looking at the first quarter in total, we saw positive comps in 11 of our 14 merchandising departments, comps on kitchen and bath, flooring and millwork, departments with a heavy reliance on in-home installation were negative during the quarter. During the first quarter, we saw 3 distinct phases of sales performance. The first phase covered the first 7 weeks of the quarter. During this phase, we saw strong sales across the store with all departments showing mid-single to double-digit comps. As customers prepared to shelter-in-place, we saw particularly strong growth with certain categories like cleaning and safety and security, but we also saw growth above our expectations in other core categories. The second phase of our sales performance relates to the last week of March and the first 2 weeks of April. During this phase, as the number of shelter-in-place orders were issued across the country we are among the first essential retailers to take immediate and decisive action geared at limiting customer traffic in our stores. These actions included reducing store hours, limiting the number of customers in our stores and canceling our annual spring events, including Spring Black Friday. In addition, we made the decision to suspend certain nonessential installation services such as kitchen remodels. During these 3 weeks, we saw negative comps in most departments. 
Finally, during the last 3 weeks of the quarter, while maintaining safety protocols around distancing and proactively restricting customer traffic in stores, we saw strong comps across most of our departments as customers focused on a number of home improvement projects. We continue to see significant pressure in products requiring installation services like kitchen and bath and flooring. During the first quarter, comp average ticket increased 11.1%, and comp transactions decreased 4%, reflecting the lower traffic that we just discussed. The strength in our comp average ticket was driven by a notable increase in basket size. Core commodity categories like lumber and copper did not have a material inflationary impact on our comp average ticket during the first quarter. 
During the first quarter, big ticket comp transactions or those over $1,000 were up 2.5%. And we saw strong performance in big ticket categories like appliances and riding lawnmowers. However, this strength was offset by pressure in categories like specialistic kitchens, countertops and flooring where we intentionally limited these installation services in customers' homes. Sales of both our DIY and Pro customers grew during the quarter, with DIY sales growing faster than Pro sales. We continue to have a high level engagement with the Pro. However, certain states and municipalities restricted in-home activity, which had a direct impact on some of our Pro customers. In addition, certain social distancing actions we took during the first quarter also served as a headwind to productivity. As we look ahead, we are focused on continuing to provide essential products and services to our customers and communities in a safe and responsible way. The investments we have made across our business have helped us be flexible and agile in this fluid and dynamic situation. We will continue to adapt and improve the ways in which we serve customers in this new environment. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard."

This was certainly a unique quarter with COVID-19 dramatically changing our operating environment, but it",1490,"Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate everyone joining the call today, and we hope you and your loved ones are safe and healthy. This was certainly a unique quarter with COVID-19 dramatically changing our operating environment, but it has also reinforced that the investments we have made in the business over the last decade have been the right ones. They have allowed us to be more flexible and agile than ever before. And we've taken unprecedented actions to respond to the virus, primarily focused on supporting our associates, keeping them and our customers safe, while providing essential products to our communities. 
Today, I'll review our consolidated results for the first quarter, and we'll provide some color in the context of the 3 distinct periods that Ted mentioned we observed. I'll also review some of the direct actions we took as a company to support our associates and further strengthen our capital structure. In the first quarter, total sales were $28.3 billion, a 7.1% increase from last year. Our total company comps were positive 6.4% for the quarter, with positive comps of 9.3% in February, 7.1% in March and 4.2% in April. Comps in the U.S. were positive 7.5% for the quarter with positive comps of 9.7% in February, 7.5% in March and 6.4% in April. From a geographic perspective, all 3 of our U.S. divisions posted positive comps and 17 of our 19 U.S. regions had positive comps in the first quarter. The 2 exceptions were our New York Metro and South Florida regions. New York and its surrounding areas were negatively impacted given the outsized impact that the virus had on the region. And our South Florida region was negatively impacted by our stores in Puerto Rico being closed for a period of time in accordance with local mandates. 
During the pre-COVID period in February and stretching into mid-March, comps were double-digit positive in the U.S. with relatively uniform strength across all regions. As we moved into late March and early April, we experienced peak shelter-in-place mandates across the country. During this time, we implemented early and decisive measures to restrict customer traffic in our stores, which had a direct negative impact to our sales. Most acutely felt in higher volume stores in densely populated urban areas. Over the course of these 3 weeks, shelter-in-place mandates and self-imposed limitations on traffic pressured our weekly performance to double-digit negative comp sales with higher volume stores underperforming lower volume stores by over 30 percentage points in certain areas. And finally, during the last 3 weeks of April and continuing into the first 2 weeks of the second quarter, we have seen a significant acceleration to double-digit comp sales growth with strong performance across most of the store as customers turn to repairs and home improvement projects. 
As a result of ongoing measures to promote social distancing practices in our stores, customer limits continue to constrain sales in our higher volume stores. But we have flexed our operating model to improve our ability to serve these strong levels of demand. In the first quarter, our gross margin was 34.1%, a decrease of 12 basis points from last year. This decrease was primarily driven by changes in the mix of products sold and continued pressure from shrink. This pressure was offset in part by favorability in supply chain expenses and by the cancellation of our annual Spring Black Friday event this year. 
During the first quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales increased approximately 190 basis points to 22.5%. This increase primarily reflects our decision to extend enhanced benefits for our associates, totaling $850 million in incurred and accrued expense, reflecting the provision of additional paid time-off for all our hourly associates, which can be used anytime during the year and will be paid out at year-end if our associates choose not to use it. The provision of incremental additional paid time-off for associates considered to be at higher risk-based on CDC guidelines; weekly bonuses for our hourly associates; double pay for overtime hours worked and other benefits. These enhanced benefits created approximately 300 basis points of expense deleverage during the quarter. 
In addition, we recorded expenses related to our strategic investment plan of approximately $270 million, a slight increase versus last year, creating 10 basis points of expense deleverage. Finally, we showed strong expense control in all other areas of the business as we navigated the quarter and drove approximately 120 basis points of expense leverage on that basis. 
Our operating margin for the first quarter was 11.6%, and compared to 13.6% in the first quarter of 2019. If we were to exclude the 300 basis points of deleverage related to the COVID-19 expenses to support our associates, our operating margin would have been approximately 14.6%. Interest and other expense for the first quarter grew by $34 million to $307 million due primarily to higher long-term debt levels than 1 year ago. 
In the first quarter, our effective tax rate was 24.4%, flat with the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Our diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $2.08 compared to $2.27 in the first quarter of 2019. The $850 million of expense related to enhancements we made in support of our associates, negatively impacted our first quarter diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.60. During the quarter, we opened one new store in Mexico and one in Puerto Rico, bringing our store count -- our total store count to 2,293. Selling square footage at the end of the quarter was 238 million square feet. At the end of the quarter, inventory turns were 5x, up from 4.7x last year. 
Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 40.8%, down from 45.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. This decrease primarily reflects higher long-term debt balances than 1 year ago, as we took steps to enhance our liquidity position during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and I'll take a moment to comment on those actions in a little more detail. 
We began the first quarter with a very strong liquidity position, and we moved early in the quarter to strengthen that position. In mid-March, we suspended our share repurchase program indefinitely. Prior to that suspension, we had repurchased approximately $600 million or 2.5 million shares of outstanding stock. In late March, we upsized our A1P1 commercial paper program from $3 billion to $6 billion. In conjunction with upsizing our commercial paper program, we expanded our revolving credit facility capacity from $3 billion to $6.5 billion. As of today, we have no commercial paper outstanding, and our credit facilities are undrawn.  And finally, on March 30, we we raised $5 billion of staggered maturity long-term debt with an average coupon of approximately 3%. This average coupon is below the average coupon of our overall debt portfolio. These actions were important to ensure we had more than adequate liquidity during this period of uncertainty. 
In addition, we took actions to reduce nonessential activity in our stores. And as a result, postponed some of our strategic investments that touch our stores directly, including changes to our front-end and resets of our merchandising base. While these actions reflect our focus on social distancing, we remain committed to our One Home Depot strategy. Fiscal 2020 marks the third year of our strategic investment plan to create a seamless and frictionless interconnected experience. These investments are designed to leverage and extend our competitive advantage and have already begun to prove their value as we pivot to serve our customers in new ways. 
Now I'll comment on how we're thinking about guidance. Recall that the fiscal 2020 guidance that we provided on our fourth quarter call in February excluded any impacts from COVID-19. Our performance to date has surpassed our initial expectations and it is also disconnected from traditional metrics like GDP, which we have historically used as a foundational element of our sales guidance. As a result of this, in the level of uncertainty that exists with respect to the impact of COVID-19 on future economic activity and customer demand, we are suspending our fiscal 2020 guidance until further notice. Our stance is not a reflection of current demand for home improvement, but rather a reflection of the broad range of potential outcomes for the economy and our business. Our strategic investments have positioned us well to continue to serve our customers with the essential products they need for their homes and places of work. Our company is in a strong financial position, and we have taken steps to further strengthen that position. We will continue to invest to strengthen our competitive advantages, and we believe we will emerge from this COVID-19 environment, a stronger team and a stronger company. Thank you for your participation in today's call, and we are now ready for questions."

So Chuck, we saw more sale impact in the highly shelter-in-place regions or zones versus the states that had moderated or no actions in place. So the Pros definitely faced some headwinds from the state mandates. We also had some restrictions in the form of inability to get permits issued or job site inspections completed so they can move on with their projects. And finally, there were some headwinds there with homeowners just having the reluctance to have crews working in their home when they were sheltered in place. As Craig said, high-spend Pros were more impacted. That makes sense if you think about them being more concentrated in metro areas likely are to have some of those mandates impact the business. But also larger jobs and more crews, more likely to be impacted from the inability to get permits or job inspections. I would give you one additional point of reference though, and I would draw that parallel to our services business. If you look at job cancellations, they're running at historic trends, which really means that more customers have just pushed their jobs and haven't canceled the work. So as these mandates are lifted, we're seeing the Pros come back to work. It's just a slower recovery than what we've seen from consumers."

But maybe if I gave you some color around the $850 million, that would give you clarity on how to think about it. So they're really, really kind of 2 categories of that spend. The vast majority of the $850 million reflects expense related to the extension of paid leave. So in mid-March, we extended additional paid leave to all of our hourly associates and subsequently extended paid leave for associates who would have been deemed at risk. For both those groups, if leave is not taken, we fully committed to pay it out during the year. A portion of the paid leave has already been taken, but we have fully accrued for all of the remaining leave eligible to be taken. So the vast majority of that $850 million has already been accrued. Then we have expenses that are paid as earned by our associates. This bucket of expenses was about $150 million of the $850 million. And so these are really in the form of the weekly bonuses we're paying to our associates as well as the enhanced overtime rates that we're paying. We began payment of those benefits roughly halfway into the quarter. So that $150 million was paid over roughly half a quarter. We are continuing the payment of those benefits into June and we will continue to review the continuation of those payments as the situation develops. Does that help?"

We hope that you and your loved ones are safe and healthy, and our thoughts and prayers are with all of those who have been directly impacted by COVID-19. I also want to thank all of our incredible associates and supplier partners for their hard work and dedication to serving our customers and communities in this time of need. 
And while the purpose of the call today is to update you on our first quarter results, I thought it would be helpful to explain how we are thinking about and making decisions at The Home Depot. When our founders started the company over 40 years ago, they did so by first defining the type of culture and value system that they wanted to promote. These values are the foundation for our business and provide the limbs through which we evaluate our decisions. Anchoring to these values in this time of crisis has never been more critical. Our decisions and actions are rooted in a commitment to do the right thing, to take care of our people and be there for our customers and communities.  
To that end, as the situation around COVID-19 has evolved, our focus has been and continues to be on 2 key priorities, the safety and well-being of our associates and customers and providing our customers and communities with essential products and services. The team's alignment around this 2 objectives has enabled critical speed and flexibility when making decisions in implementing a number of changes across the business in a rapidly evolving and incredibly fluid environment. 
I'd like to briefly touch on just a few of the early and decisive actions that we took in support of these primary objectives. To promote a safe environment for associates and customers, we implemented a number of operational changes starting in mid-March.  We have adjusted our store hours, closing earlier than usual to give our associates more time to properly clean and sanitize and restock our shelves.  We took a proactive and early stance on limiting customer traffic in our stores to better maintain physical and social distancing protocols. At the height of our spring selling season, we also made the decision to cancel our annual spring event, including Spring Black Friday. This was not a decision that we took lightly, and yet we made it confidently given our belief that having this event would footsteps to our stores and directly undermine our commitment to prioritizing safety. 
To take care of our associates, we expanded our paid time off for all hourly associates that can be used at their discretion and will be paid out at year-end if unused. We also are offering additional paid time off for associates who are 65 or older or deemed to be at higher risk by the CDC guidelines. We have instituted weekly bonuses for our hourly associates in our stores and distribution centers.  We are providing double pay for overtime work, and we have extended dependent care benefits and waived related co-pays. Our more than 400,000 orange-blended associates are the heartbeat of The Home Depot, and supporting them is a core value of our company. 
Beyond the grounding that our culture and values 
provides and the actions we have taken to support them, we believe that The Home Depot is uniquely positioned to weather COVID-19. Nobody could have predicted what has unfolded since we spoke with you 3 months ago on our earnings call in February, and yet the distinct competitive advantages and overarching benefits of an interconnected One Home Depot strategy that were reinforced then are perhaps even more in focus and relevant today. Investments we have made over the years in our stores, market-leading digital assets, flexible supply chain and a world-class merchandising organization have allowed us to quickly adapt to shifts in customer needs, preferences and behaviors. 
Our interconnected retail strategy and underlying technology infrastructure have supported record-level web traffic for several weeks without disruption. Sales leveraging our digital platforms increased approximately 80% in the quarter. And more than 60% of the time, our customers opted to pick up their orders at a store. We were able to extend our in-store focus capabilities to curbside pickup in the U.S. in a matter of days, offering customers an additional choice with respect to fulfillment. In the case of our Ontario stores in Canada, this curbside capability was turned on essentially overnight when it became the only option to remain open and operational with those stores operating under these circumstances for more than a month. 
The flexibility and agility of our business model, coupled with our focus on execution and strong partnership with our suppliers, helped deliver solid results in the quarter and gave the Board the confidence to declare a $1.50 per share quarterly dividend. Sales for the first quarter were $28.3 billion, up 7.1% from last year. Comp sales were up 6.4% from last year with U.S. comps of positive 7.5%. Diluted earnings per share were $2.08 in the first quarter. Richard will walk you through the details in a moment, but I want to stress that while we were pleased with the results in the quarter and we see an engaged customer, there was significant volatility. Month-to-month and even week-to-week, we saw extreme ups and downs across different categories and geographies. As a result, we are cautious to extrapolate trends from the first quarter into a forecast for the remaining of the year, particularly given the tremendous amount of uncertainty we face with regards to the duration and continued impacts of the virus.  
Despite the many unknowns of the current environment, we are confident that we have taken the steps to ensure that we will emerge from this crisis stronger and even better positioned for the future. Though this crisis is unparalleled in size and scope, we have built a reputation through our history of doing whatever it takes to be there for our associates, customers and communities in the most critical times, and this situation is no different. 
Once again, I want to thank our incredible associates and express how grateful and proud I am of the resiliency and strength that our teams have demonstrated as we navigate these extraordinary circumstances together. This reminds me of the words of our founder, Bernie Marcus, that have never resonated more deeply than they do today, ""If you take care of our associates, they take care of the customers and everything else takes care of itself."" 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ted."

I also want to start by thanking all of our associates and supplier partners for the incredible collaboration over the last several months. 
Supplier relationships and partnerships matter, and during times of crisis is when they matter the most. One of the actions we took early on when COVID-19 was impacting the supply chain in China was to establish regular and frequent contact with our suppliers, both internationally and domestically. As cases increased in the U.S., our   
our suppliers helped source the essential products our customers and communities needed. We established an effective plan, shifted resources as needed and worked on getting the right products to the right stores across the country. While in-stock levels vary from store-to-store and region-to-region, our focus remains on replenishing and restocking high-demand products as quickly as possible.  
We are grateful for our strong strategic partnerships. Our supplier partners are helping us in many ways, including supplying essential products for our own use. Let me give you an example. Very early on in the pandemic, we reached out to PPG, one of our key paint suppliers, for help. We asked PPG if they could help supply hand sanitizer for our store associates. They quickly converted several of their manufacturing lines and within a few short weeks, they produced an initial order of approximately 100,000 gallons of hand sanitizer. They are planning to produce 3x that amount for future in-store use that will help our associates for the remainder of the year. This is just one of many examples, and I want to thank PPG and all of the other supplier partners that have stepped up to help us prioritize the safety and well-being of our associates and customers.  
The challenges we face as a result of COVID-19, including the most fluid operating environment we've ever experienced, have further reinforced our strategy of the One Home Depot interconnected shopping experience. As a direct result of our investments across the business over the last decade, our teams were able to make decisions quickly and adapt to changing local government mandates and customer behavior. And as you heard from Craig, we did this while focusing on 2 priorities: keeping our associates and customers safe and continuing to serve our communities with the essential products and services they need for their homes and places of work. 
Our continued investment in our interconnected capabilities has positioned us well as customers turned online for their shopping needs. The shelter-in-place orders were rolled out across the country in mid-to-late March. We saw our digital businesses accelerate from approximately 30% growth in early March to triple-digit growth by the end of April. In fact, daily traffic to homedepot.com reached new records toward the end of the quarter. During the last 3 weeks of the quarter, traffic to homedepot.com was consistently above Black Friday levels. And as a result of our continued investment in our digital infrastructure and with the great work of our technology teams, we provided continuous service to our customers and our conversion rate continued to increase.  
During the quarter, we continued to leverage our different fulfillment capabilities like Buy Online, Pick-Up In store and our enhanced delivery capabilities, whether it be on a flatbed truck, a box truck or our car and van service. Our BOPUS and Deliver From Store fulfillment options saw triple-digit growth in the first quarter. In fact, the flexibility that we have built into our systems allowed us to quickly roll out the fulfillment option for our customers to buy online and pick up at our stores through a contactless curbside pickup option.  
Looking at the first quarter in total, we saw positive comps in 11 of our 14 merchandising departments. Comps in kitchen and bath, flooring and millwork, departments with a heavy reliance on in-home installation, were negative during the quarter. During the first quarter, we saw 3 distinct phases of sales performance. The first phase covered the first 7 weeks of the quarter. During this phase, we saw strong sales across the store with all departments showing mid-single to double-digit comps. As customers prepared to shelter in place, we saw particularly strong growth with certain categories like cleaning and safety and security, but we also saw growth above our expectations in other core categories. 
The second phase of our sales performance relates to the last week of March and the first 2 weeks of April. During this phase, as the number of shelter-in-place orders were issued across the country, we are among the first essential retailers to take immediate and decisive action geared at limiting customer traffic in our stores. These actions included reducing store hours, limiting the number of customers in our stores and canceling our annual spring events, including Spring Black Friday. In addition, we made the decision to suspend certain nonessential installation services, such as kitchen remodels. During these 3 weeks, we saw negative comps in most departments.  
Finally, during the last 3 weeks of the quarter, while maintaining safety protocols around distancing and proactively restricting customer traffic in stores, we saw strong comps across most of our departments as customers focused on a number of home improvement projects. We continue to see significant pressure in products requiring installation services like kitchen and bath and flooring. During the first quarter, comp average ticket increased 11.1% and comp transactions decreased 4%, reflecting the lower traffic that we just discussed. The strength in our comp average ticket was driven by a notable increase in basket size. Core commodity categories like lumber and copper did not have a material inflationary impact on our comp average ticket during the first quarter.  
During the first quarter, big ticket comp transactions or those over $1,000 were up 2.5%. We saw strong performance in big ticket categories like appliances and riding lawnmowers. However, this strength was offset by pressure in categories like special-order kitchens, countertops and flooring where we intentionally limited these installation services in customers' homes. Sales of both our DIY and Pro customers grew during the quarter with DIY sales growing faster than Pro sales. We continue to have a high-level engagement with the Pro. However, certain states and municipalities restricted in-home activity, which had a direct impact on some of our Pro customers. In addition, certain social distancing actions we took during the first quarter also served as a headwind to Pro activity. 
As we look ahead, we are focused on continuing to provide essential products and services to our customers and communities in a safe and responsible way. The investments we have made across our business have helped us be flexible and agile in this fluid and dynamic situation. We will continue to adapt and improve the ways in which we serve customers in this new environment. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard."

We appreciate everyone joining the call today, and we hope you and your loved ones are safe and healthy. 
This was certainly a unique quarter with COVID-19 dramatically changing our operating environment, but it has also reinforced that the investments we have made in the business over the last decade have been the right ones. They have allowed us to be more flexible and agile than ever before. And we've taken unprecedented actions to respond to the virus primarily focused on supporting our associates, keeping them and our customers safe while providing essential products to our communities.  
Today, I'll review our consolidated results for the first quarter and will provide some color in the context of the 3 distinct periods that Ted mentioned we observed. I'll also review some of the direct actions we took as a company to support our associates and further strengthen our capital structure. In the first quarter, total sales were $28.3 billion, a 7.1% increase from last year. Our total company comps were positive 6.4% for the quarter with positive comps of 9.3% in February, 7.1% in March and 4.2% in April. Comps in the U.S. were positive 7.5% for the quarter with positive comps of 9.7% in February, 7.5% in March and 6.4% in April. From a geographic perspective, all 3 of our U.S. divisions posted positive comps and 17 of our 19 U.S. regions had positive comps in the first quarter. The 2 exceptions were our New York Metro and South Florida regions. New York and its surrounding areas were negatively impacted given the outsized impact that the virus had on the region. And our South Florida region was negatively impacted by our stores in Puerto Rico being closed for a period of time in accordance with local mandates.  
During the pre-COVID period in February and stretching into mid-March, comps were double-digit positive in the U.S. with relatively uniform strength across all regions. As we moved into late March and early April, we experienced peak shelter-in-place mandates across the country. During this time, we implemented early and decisive measures to restrict customer traffic in our stores, which had a direct negative impact to our sales, most acutely felt in higher-volume stores in densely populated urban areas. Over the course of these 3 weeks, shelter-in-place mandates and self-imposed limitations on traffic pressured our weekly performance to double-digit negative comp sales with higher-volume stores underperforming lower-volume stores by over 30 percentage points in certain areas.  And finally, during the last 3 weeks of April and continuing into the first 2 weeks of the second quarter, we have seen a significant acceleration to double-digit comp sales growth with strong performance across most of the store as customers turn to repairs and home improvement projects.  
As a result of ongoing measures to promote social distancing practices in our stores, customer limits continue to constrain sales in our higher-volume stores. But we have flexed our operating model to improve our ability to serve these strong levels of demand. In the first quarter, our gross margin was 34.1%, a decrease of 12 basis points from last year. This decrease was primarily driven by changes in the mix of products sold and continued pressure from shrink. This pressure was offset in part by favorability in supply chain expenses and by the cancellation of our annual Spring Black Friday event this year.  
During the first quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales increased approximately 190 basis points to 22.5%. This increase primarily reflects our decision to extend enhanced benefits for our associates, totaling $850 million in incurred and accrued expense, reflecting the provision of additional paid time off for all our hourly associates, which can be used anytime during the year and will be paid out at year-end if our associates choose not to use it; the provision of incremental additional paid time off for associates considered to be at higher risk based on CDC guidelines; weekly bonuses for our hourly associates; double pay for overtime hours worked and other benefits. These enhanced benefits created approximately 300 basis points of expense deleverage during the quarter.  
In addition, we recorded expenses related to our strategic investment plan of approximately $270 million, a slight increase versus last year, creating 10 basis points of expense deleverage.  Finally, we showed strong expense control in all other areas of the business as we navigated the quarter and drove approximately 120 basis points of expense leverage on that basis.  
Our operating margin for the first quarter was 11.6% compared to 13.6% in the first quarter of 2019. If we were to exclude the 300 basis points of deleverage related to the COVID-19 expenses to support our associates, our operating margin would have been approximately 14.6%. Interest and other expense for the first quarter grew by $34 million to $307 million due primarily to higher long-term debt levels than 1 year ago.  
In the first quarter, our effective tax rate was 24.4%, flat with the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Our diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $2.08 compared to $2.27 in the first quarter of 2019. The $850 million of expense related to enhancements we made in support of our associates negatively impacted our first quarter diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.60. During the quarter, we opened 1 new store in Mexico and 1 in Puerto Rico, bringing our store count -- our total store count to 2,293. Selling square footage at the end of the quarter was 238 million square feet. At the end of the quarter, inventory turns were 5x, up from 4.7x last year.  
Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 40.8%, down from 45.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. This decrease primarily reflects higher long-term debt balances than 1 year ago as we took steps to enhance our liquidity position during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and I'll take a moment to comment on those actions in a little more detail.  
We began the first quarter with a very strong liquidity position, and we moved early in the quarter to strengthen that position. In mid-March, we suspended our share repurchase program indefinitely. Prior to that suspension, we had repurchased approximately $600 million or 2.5 million shares of outstanding stock. In late March, we upsized our A1/P1 commercial paper program from $3 billion to $6 billion. In conjunction with upsizing our commercial paper program, we expanded our revolving credit facility capacity from $3 billion to $6.5 billion. As of today, we have no commercial paper outstanding and our credit facilities are undrawn.  And finally, on March 30, we raised $5 billion of staggered maturity long-term debt with an average coupon of approximately 3%. This average coupon is below the average coupon of our overall debt portfolio. These actions were important to ensure we had more than adequate liquidity during this period of uncertainty.  In addition, we took actions to reduce nonessential activity in our stores. And as a result, postponed some of our strategic investments that touch our stores directly, including changes to our front-end and resets of our merchandising base. 
While these actions reflect our focus on social distancing, we remain committed to our One Home Depot strategy. Fiscal 2020 marks the third year of our strategic investment plan to create a seamless and frictionless interconnected experience. These investments are designed to leverage and extend our competitive advantage and have already begun to prove their value as we pivot to serve our customers in new ways.  
Now I'll comment on how we're thinking about guidance. Recall that the fiscal 2020 guidance that we provided on our fourth quarter call in February excluded any impacts from COVID-19. Our performance to date has surpassed our initial expectations and it is also disconnected from traditional metrics like GDP, which we have historically used as a foundational element of our sales guidance. As a result of this and the level of uncertainty that exists with respect to the impact of COVID-19 on future economic activity and customer demand, we are suspending our fiscal 2020 guidance until further notice. Our stance is not a reflection of current demand for home improvement, but rather a reflection of the broad range of potential outcomes for the economy and our business. Our strategic investments have positioned us well to continue to serve our customers with the essential products they need for their homes and places of work. Our company is in a strong financial position, and we have taken steps to further strengthen that position. We will continue to invest to strengthen our competitive advantages, and we believe we will emerge from this COVID-19 environment a stronger team and a stronger company.

So the Pros definitely faced some headwinds from the state mandates. We also had some restrictions in the form of inability to get permits issued or job site inspections completed so they can move on with their projects. And finally, there were some headwinds there with homeowners just having the reluctance to have crews working in their home when they were sheltered in place. As Craig said, high-spend Pros were more impacted. That makes sense if you think about them being more concentrated in metro areas likely or they have some of those mandates impact their business, but also larger jobs and more crews, more likely to be impacted from the inability to get permits or job inspections. I would give you one additional point of reference though, and I would draw that parallel to our services business. If you look at job cancellations, they're running at historic trends, which really means that more customers have just pushed their jobs and haven't canceled the work. So as these mandates are lifted, we're seeing the Pros come back to work. It's just a slower recovery than what we've seen from consumers."

But maybe if I gave you some color around the $850 million, that would give you clarity on how to think about it. So there are really, really kind of 2 categories of that spend. The vast majority of the $850 million reflects expense related to the extension of paid leave. So in mid-March, we extended additional paid leave to all of our hourly associates and subsequently extended paid leave for associates who would have been deemed at risk. For both those groups, if leave is not taken, we fully committed to pay it out during the year. A portion of the paid leave has already been taken, but we have fully accrued for all of the remaining leave eligible to be taken. So the vast majority of that $850 million has already been accrued. Then we have expenses that are paid as earned by our associates. This bucket of expenses was about $150 million of the $850 million. And so these are really in the form of the weekly bonuses we're paying to our associates as well as the enhanced overtime rates that we're paying. We began payment of those benefits roughly halfway into the quarter. So that $150 million was paid over roughly half a quarter.

We hope that you and your loved ones are safe and healthy, and our thoughts and prayers are with all of those who have been directly impacted by COVID-19. I also want to thank all of our incredible associates and supplier partners for their hard work and dedication to serving our customers and communities in this time of need. 
And while the purpose of the call today is to update you on our first quarter results, I thought it would be helpful to explain how we are thinking about and making decisions at The Home Depot. When our founders started the company over 40 years ago, they did so by first defining the type of culture and value system that they wanted to promote. These values are the foundation for our business and provide the lens through which we evaluate our decisions. Anchoring to these values in this time of crisis has never been more critical. Our decisions and actions are rooted in a commitment to do the right thing, to take care of our people and be there for our customers and communities.  
To that end, as the situation around COVID-19 has evolved, our focus has been and continues to be on 2 key priorities, the safety and well-being of our associates and customers and providing our customers and communities with essential products and services. The team's alignment around these 2 objectives has enabled critical speed and flexibility when making decisions in implementing a number of changes across the business in a rapidly evolving and incredibly fluid environment. 
I'd like to briefly touch on just a few of the early and decisive actions that we took in support of these primary objectives. 
To promote a safe environment for associates and customers, we implemented a number of operational changes starting in mid-March. We have adjusted our store hours, closing earlier than usual to give our associates more time to properly clean and sanitize and restock our shelves. We took a proactive and early stance on limiting customer traffic in our stores to better maintain physical and social distancing protocols. At the height of our spring selling season, we also made the decision to cancel our annual spring event, including Spring Black Friday. This was not a decision that we took lightly, and yet we made it confidently given our belief that having this event would footsteps to our stores and directly undermine our commitment to prioritizing safety. 
To take care of our associates, we expanded our paid time off for all hourly associates that can be used at their discretion and will be paid out at year-end if unused. We also are offering additional paid time off for associates who are 65 or older or deemed to be at higher risk by the CDC guidelines. We have instituted weekly bonuses for our hourly associates in our stores and distribution centers. We are providing double pay for overtime work, and we have extended dependent care benefits and waived related co-pays. Our more than 400,000 orange-blended associates are the heartbeat of The Home Depot, and supporting them is a core value of our company. 
Beyond the grounding that our culture and values provides and the actions we have taken to support them, we believe that The Home Depot is uniquely positioned to weather COVID-19. Nobody could have predicted what has unfolded since we spoke with you 3 months ago on our earnings call in February, and yet the distinct competitive advantages and overarching benefits of an interconnected One Home Depot strategy that were reinforced then are perhaps even more in focus and relevant today. Investments we have made over the years in our stores, market-leading digital assets, flexible supply chain and a world-class merchandising organization have allowed us to quickly adapt to shifts in customer needs, preferences and behaviors. 
Our interconnected retail strategy and underlying technology infrastructure have supported record-level web traffic for several weeks without disruption. Sales leveraging our digital platforms increased approximately 80% in the quarter. And more than 60% of the time, our customers opted to pick up their orders at a store. We were able to extend our in-store focus capabilities to curbside pickup in the U.S. in a matter of days, offering customers an additional choice with respect to fulfillment. In the case of our Ontario stores in Canada, this curbside capability was turned on essentially overnight when it became the only option to remain open and operational with those stores operating under these circumstances for more than a month. 
The flexibility and agility of our business model, coupled with our focus on execution and strong partnership with our suppliers, helped deliver solid results in the quarter and gave the Board the confidence to declare a $1.50 per share quarterly dividend. Sales for the first quarter were $28.3 billion, up 7.1% from last year. Comp sales were up 6.4% from last year with U.S. comps of positive 7.5%. Diluted earnings per share were $2.08 in the first quarter. 
Richard will walk you through the details in a moment, but I want to stress that while we were pleased with the results in the quarter and we see an engaged customer, there was significant volatility. Month-to-month and even week-to-week, we saw extreme ups and downs across different categories and geographies. As a result, we are cautious to extrapolate trends from the first quarter into a forecast for the remaining of the year, particularly given the tremendous amount of uncertainty we face with regards to the duration and continued impacts of the virus.  
Despite the many unknowns of the current environment, we are confident that we have taken the steps to ensure that we will emerge from this crisis stronger and even better positioned for the future. Though this crisis is unparalleled in size and scope, we have built a reputation through our history of doing whatever it takes to be there for our associates, customers and communities in the most critical times, and this situation is no different. 
Once again, I want to thank our incredible associates and express how grateful and proud I am of the resiliency and strength that our teams have demonstrated as we navigate these extraordinary circumstances together. This reminds me of the words of our founder, Bernie Marcus, that have never resonated more deeply than they do today, ""If you take care of our associates, they take care of the customers and everything else takes care of itself."" 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ted."

I also want to start by thanking all of our associates and supplier partners for the incredible collaboration over the last several months. Supplier relationships and partnerships matter, and during times of cr",1140,"Thanks, Craig, and good morning, everyone. I also want to start by thanking all of our associates and supplier partners for the incredible collaboration over the last several months. 
Supplier relationships and partnerships matter, and during times of crisis is when they matter the most. One of the actions we took early on when COVID-19 was impacting the supply chain in China was to establish regular and frequent contact with our suppliers, both internationally and domestically. As cases increased in the U.S., our suppliers helped source the essential products our customers and communities needed. We established an effective plan, shifted resources as needed and worked on getting the right products to the right stores across the country. While in-stock levels vary from store-to-store and region-to-region, our focus remains on replenishing and restocking high-demand products as quickly as possible.  
We are grateful for our strong strategic partnerships. Our supplier partners are helping us in many ways, including supplying essential products for our own use. Let me give you an example. Very early on in the pandemic, we reached out to PPG, one of our key paint suppliers, for help. We asked PPG if they could help supply hand sanitizer for our store associates. They quickly converted several of their manufacturing lines and within a few short weeks, they produced an initial order of approximately 100,000 gallons of hand sanitizer. They are planning to produce 3x that amount for future in-store use that will help our associates for the remainder of the year. This is just one of many examples, and I want to thank PPG and all of the other supplier partners that have stepped up to help us prioritize the safety and well-being of our associates and customers.  
The challenges we face as a result of COVID-19, including the most fluid operating environment we've ever experienced, have further reinforced our strategy of the One Home Depot interconnected shopping experience. As a direct result of our investments across the business over the last decade, our teams were able to make decisions quickly and adapt to changing local government mandates and customer behavior. And as you heard from Craig, we did this while focusing on 2 priorities: keeping our associates and customers safe and continuing to serve our communities with the essential products and services they need for their homes and places of work. 
Our continued investment in our interconnected capabilities has positioned us well as customers turned online for their shopping needs. The shelter-in-place orders were rolled out across the country in mid-to-late March. We saw our digital businesses accelerate from approximately 30% growth in early March to triple-digit growth by the end of April. In fact, daily traffic to homedepot.com reached new records toward the end of the quarter. During the last 3 weeks of the quarter, traffic to homedepot.com was consistently above Black Friday levels. And as a result of our continued investment in our digital infrastructure and with the great work of our technology teams, we provided continuous service to our customers and our conversion rate continued to increase.  
During the quarter, we continued to leverage our different fulfillment capabilities like Buy Online, Pick-Up In Store and our enhanced delivery capabilities, whether it be on a flatbed truck, a box truck or our car and van service. Our BOPUS and Deliver From Store fulfillment options saw triple-digit growth in the first quarter. In fact, the flexibility that we have built into our systems allowed us to quickly roll out the fulfillment option for our customers to buy online and pick up at our stores through a contactless curbside pickup option.  
Looking at the first quarter in total, we saw positive comps in 11 of our 14 merchandising departments. Comps in kitchen and bath, flooring and millwork, departments with a heavy reliance on in-home installation, were negative during the quarter. During the first quarter, we saw 3 distinct phases of sales performance. The first phase covered the first 7 weeks of the quarter. During this phase, we saw strong sales across the store with all departments showing mid-single to double-digit comps. As customers prepared to shelter in place, we saw particularly strong growth with certain categories like cleaning and safety and security, but we also saw growth above our expectations in other core categories. 
The second phase of our sales performance relates to the last week of March and the first 2 weeks of April. During this phase, as the number of shelter-in-place orders were issued across the country, we were among the first essential retailers to take immediate and decisive action geared at limiting customer traffic in our stores. These actions included reducing store hours, limiting the number of customers in our stores and canceling our annual spring events, including Spring Black Friday. In addition, we made the decision to suspend certain nonessential installation services, such as kitchen remodels. During these 3 weeks, we saw negative comps in most departments.  
Finally, during the last 3 weeks of the quarter, while maintaining safety protocols around distancing and proactively restricting customer traffic in stores, we saw strong comps across most of our departments as customers focused on a number of home improvement projects. We continue to see significant pressure in products requiring installation services like kitchen and bath and flooring. 
During the first quarter, comp average ticket increased 11.1%, and comp transactions decreased 4%, reflecting the lower traffic that we just discussed. The strength in our comp average ticket was driven by a notable increase in basket size. Core commodity categories like lumber and copper did not have a material inflationary impact on our comp average ticket during the first quarter.  
During the first quarter, big ticket comp transactions or those over $1,000 were up 2.5%. We saw strong performance in big ticket categories like appliances and riding lawnmowers. However, this strength was offset by pressure in categories like special-order kitchens, countertops and flooring where we intentionally limited these installation services in customers' homes. Sales of both our DIY and Pro customers grew during the quarter with DIY sales growing faster than Pro sales. We continue to have a high-level engagement with the Pro. However, certain states and municipalities restricted in-home activity, which had a direct impact on some of our Pro customers. In addition, certain social distancing actions we took during the first quarter also served as a headwind to Pro activity. 
As we look ahead, we are focused on continuing to provide essential products and services to our customers and communities in a safe and responsible way. The investments we have made across our business have helped us be flexible and agile in this fluid and dynamic situation. We will continue to adapt and improve the ways in which we serve customers in this new environment. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard."

We appreciate everyone joining the call today, and we hope you and your loved ones are safe and healthy. This was certainly a unique quarter with COVID-19 dramatically changing our operating environment, but i",1487,"Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate everyone joining the call today, and we hope you and your loved ones are safe and healthy. 
This was certainly a unique quarter with COVID-19 dramatically changing our operating environment, but it has also reinforced that the investments we have made in the business over the last decade have been the right ones. They have allowed us to be more flexible and agile than ever before. And we've taken unprecedented actions to respond to the virus primarily focused on supporting our associates, keeping them and our customers safe while providing essential products to our communities.  
Today, I'll review our consolidated results for the first quarter and will provide some color in the context of the 3 distinct periods that Ted mentioned we observed. I'll also review some of the direct actions we took as a company to support our associates and further strengthen our capital structure. In the first quarter, total sales were $28.3 billion, a 7.1% increase from last year. Our total company comps were positive 6.4% for the quarter with positive comps of 9.3% in February, 7.1% in March and 4.2% in April. Comps in the U.S. were positive 7.5% for the quarter with positive comps of 9.7% in February, 7.5% in March and 6.4% in April. 
From a geographic perspective, all 3 of our U.S. divisions posted positive comps and 17 of our 19 U.S. regions had positive comps in the first quarter. The 2 exceptions were our New York Metro and South Florida regions. New York and its surrounding areas were negatively impacted given the outsized impact that the virus had on the region. And our South Florida region was negatively impacted by our stores in Puerto Rico being closed for a period of time in accordance with local mandates.  
During the pre-COVID period in February and stretching into mid-March, comps were double-digit positive in the U.S. with relatively uniform strength across all regions. As we moved into late March and early April, we experienced peak shelter-in-place mandates across the country. During this time, we implemented early and decisive measures to restrict customer traffic in our stores, which had a direct negative impact to our sales, most acutely felt in higher-volume stores in densely populated urban areas. Over the course of these 3 weeks, shelter-in-place mandates and self-imposed limitations on traffic pressured our weekly performance to double-digit negative comp sales with higher-volume stores underperforming lower-volume stores by over 30 percentage points in certain areas. 
And finally, during the last 3 weeks of April and continuing into the first 2 weeks of the second quarter, we have seen a significant acceleration to double-digit comp sales growth with strong performance across most of the store as customers turn to repairs and home improvement projects.  
As a result of ongoing measures to promote social distancing practices in our stores, customer limits continue to constrain sales in our higher-volume stores. But we have flexed our operating model to improve our ability to serve these strong levels of demand. 
In the first quarter, our gross margin was 34.1%, a decrease of 12 basis points from last year. This decrease was primarily driven by changes in the mix of products sold and continued pressure from shrink. This pressure was offset in part by favorability in supply chain expenses and by the cancellation of our annual Spring Black Friday event this year.  
During the first quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales increased approximately 190 basis points to 22.5%. This increase primarily reflects our decision to extend enhanced benefits for our associates, totaling $850 million in incurred and accrued expense, reflecting the provision of additional paid time off for all our hourly associates, which can be used anytime during the year and will be paid out at year-end if our associates choose not to use it; the provision of incremental additional paid time off for associates considered to be at higher risk based on CDC guidelines; weekly bonuses for our hourly associates; double pay for overtime hours worked and other benefits. These enhanced benefits created approximately 300 basis points of expense deleverage during the quarter.  
In addition, we recorded expenses related to our strategic investment plan of approximately $270 million, a slight increase versus last year, creating 10 basis points of expense deleverage.  Finally, we showed strong expense control in all other areas of the business as we navigated the quarter and drove approximately 120 basis points of expense leverage on that basis.  
Our operating margin for the first quarter was 11.6% compared to 13.6% in the first quarter of 2019. If we were to exclude the 300 basis points of deleverage related to the COVID-19 expenses to support our associates, our operating margin would have been approximately 14.6%. 
Interest and other expense for the first quarter grew by $34 million to $307 million due primarily to higher long-term debt levels than 1 year ago.  
In the first quarter, our effective tax rate was 24.4%, flat with the first quarter of fiscal 2019. 
Our diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $2.08 compared to $2.27 in the first quarter of 2019. The $850 million of expense related to enhancements we made in support of our associates negatively impacted our first quarter diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.60. 
During the quarter, we opened 1 new store in Mexico and 1 in Puerto Rico, bringing our store count -- our total store count to 2,293. Selling square footage at the end of the quarter was 238 million square feet. At the end of the quarter, inventory turns were 5x, up from 4.7x last year.  
Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 40.8%, down from 45.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. This decrease primarily reflects higher long-term debt balances than 1 year ago as we took steps to enhance our liquidity position during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and I'll take a moment to comment on those actions in a little more detail.  
We began the first quarter with a very strong liquidity position, and we moved early in the quarter to strengthen that position. In mid-March, we suspended our share repurchase program indefinitely. Prior to that suspension, we had repurchased approximately $600 million or 2.5 million shares of outstanding stock. In late March, we upsized our A1/P1 commercial paper program from $3 billion to $6 billion. In conjunction with upsizing our commercial paper program, we expanded our revolving credit facility capacity from $3 billion to $6.5 billion. As of today, we have no commercial paper outstanding and our credit facilities are undrawn. And finally, on March 30, we raised $5 billion of staggered maturity long-term debt with an average coupon of approximately 3%. This average coupon is below the average coupon of our overall debt portfolio. These actions were important to ensure we had more than adequate liquidity during this period of uncertainty. In addition, we took actions to reduce nonessential activity in our stores. And as a result, postponed some of our strategic investments that touch our stores directly, including changes to our front-end and resets of our merchandising base. 
While these actions reflect our focus on social distancing, we remain committed to our One Home Depot strategy. Fiscal 2020 marks the third year of our strategic investment plan to create a seamless and frictionless interconnected experience. These investments are designed to leverage and extend our competitive advantage and have already begun to prove their value as we pivot to serve our customers in new ways.  
Now I'll comment on how we're thinking about guidance. Recall that the fiscal 2020 guidance that we provided on our fourth quarter call in February excluded any impacts from COVID-19. Our performance to date has surpassed our initial expectations and it is also disconnected from traditional metrics like GDP, which we have historically used as a foundational element of our sales guidance. As a result of this and the level of uncertainty that exists with respect to the impact of COVID-19 on future economic activity and customer demand, we are suspending our fiscal 2020 guidance until further notice. Our stance is not a reflection of current demand for home improvement, but rather a reflection of the broad range of potential outcomes for the economy and our business. Our strategic investments have positioned us well to continue to serve our customers with the essential products they need for their homes and places of work. Our company is in a strong financial position, and we have taken steps to further strengthen that position. We will continue to invest to strengthen our competitive advantages, and we believe we will emerge from this COVID-19 environment a stronger team and a stronger company. 
Thank you for your participation in today's call, and we are now ready for questions."

So Chuck, we saw more sale impact in the highly shelter-in-place regions or zones versus the states that had moderated or no actions in place. So the Pros definitely faced some headwinds from the state mandates. We also had some restrictions in the form of inability to get permits issued or job site inspections completed so they can move on with their projects. And finally, there were some headwinds there with homeowners just having the reluctance to have crews working in their home when they were sheltered in place. As Craig said, high-spend Pros were more impacted. That makes sense if you think about them being more concentrated in metro areas likely or they have some of those mandates impact their business, but also larger jobs and more crews, more likely to be impacted from the inability to get permits or job inspections. I would give you one additional point of reference though, and I would draw that parallel to our services business. If you look at job cancellations, they're running at historic trends, which really means that more customers have just pushed their jobs and haven't canceled the work. So as these mandates are lifted, we're seeing the Pros come back to work. It's just a slower recovery than what we've seen from consumers."

But maybe if I gave you some color around the $850 million, that would give you clarity on how to think about it. So there are really, really kind of 2 categories of that spend. The vast majority of the $850 million reflects expense related to the extension of paid leave. So in mid-March, we extended additional paid leave to all of our hourly associates and subsequently extended paid leave for associates who would have been deemed at risk. For both those groups, if leave is not taken, we fully committed to pay it out during the year. A portion of the paid leave has already been taken, but we have fully accrued for all of the remaining leave eligible to be taken. So the vast majority of that $850 million has already been accrued. Then we have expenses that are paid as earned by our associates. This bucket of expenses was about $150 million of the $850 million. And so these are really in the form of the weekly bonuses we're paying to our associates as well as the enhanced overtime rates that we're paying. We began payment of those benefits roughly halfway into the quarter. So that $150 million was paid over roughly half a quarter. We are continuing the payment of those benefits into June and we will continue to review the continuation of those payments as the situation develops. Does that help?"

We hope that you and your loved ones are safe and healthy, and our thoughts and prayers are with all of those who have been directly impacted by COVID-19. I also want to thank all of our incredible associates and supplier partners for their hard work and dedication to serving our customers and communities in this time of need. 
And while the purpose of the call today is to update you on our first quarter results, I thought it would be helpful to explain how we are thinking about and making decisions at The Home Depot. When our founders started the company over 40 years ago, they did so by first defining the type of culture and value system that they wanted to promote. These values are the foundation for our business and provide the lens through which we evaluate our decisions. Anchoring to these values in this time of crisis has never been more critical. Our decisions and actions are rooted in a commitment to do the right thing, to take care of our people and be there for our customers and communities. 
To that end, as the situation around COVID-19 has evolved, our focus has been and continues to be on 2 key priorities, the safety and well-being of our associates and customers and providing our customers and communities with essential products and services. The team's alignment around these 2 objectives has enabled critical speed and flexibility when making decisions in implementing a number of changes across the business in a rapidly evolving and incredibly fluid environment. 
I'd like to briefly touch on just a few of the early and decisive actions that we took in support of these primary objectives. 
To promote a safe environment for associates and customers, we implemented a number of operational changes starting in mid-March. We have adjusted our store hours, closing earlier than usual to give our associates more time to properly clean and sanitize and restock our shelves. We took a proactive and early stance on limiting customer traffic in our stores to better maintain physical and social distancing protocols. At the height of our spring selling season, we also made the decision to cancel our annual spring event, including Spring Black Friday. This was not a decision that we took lightly, and yet we made it confidently given our belief that having this event would footsteps to our stores and directly undermine our commitment to prioritizing safety. 
To take care of our associates, we expanded our paid time off for all hourly associates that can be used at their discretion and will be paid out at year-end if unused. We also are offering additional paid time off for associates who are 65 or older or deemed to be at higher risk by the CDC guidelines. We have instituted weekly bonuses for our hourly associates in our stores and distribution centers. We are providing double pay for overtime work, and we have extended dependent care benefits and waived related co-pays. Our more than 400,000 orange-blended associates are the heartbeat of The Home Depot, and supporting them is a core value of our company. 
Beyond the grounding that our culture and values provides and the actions we have taken to support them, we believe that The Home Depot is uniquely positioned to weather COVID-19. Nobody could have predicted what has unfolded since we spoke with you 3 months ago on our earnings call in February, and yet the distinct competitive advantages and overarching benefits of an interconnected One Home Depot strategy that were reinforced then are perhaps even more in focus and relevant today. Investments we have made over the years in our stores, market-leading digital assets, flexible supply chain and a world-class merchandising organization have allowed us to quickly adapt to shifts in customer needs, preferences and behaviors. 
Our interconnected retail strategy and underlying technology infrastructure have supported record-level web traffic for several weeks without disruption. Sales leveraging our digital platforms increased approximately 80% in the quarter. And more than 60% of the time, our customers opted to pick up their orders at a store. We were able to extend our in-store focus capabilities to curbside pickup in the U.S. in a matter of days, offering customers an additional choice with respect to fulfillment. In the case of our Ontario stores in Canada, this curbside capability was turned on essentially overnight when it became the only option to remain open and operational with those stores operating under these circumstances for more than a month. 
The flexibility and agility of our business model, coupled with our focus on execution and strong partnership with our suppliers, helped deliver solid results in the quarter and gave the Board the confidence to declare a $1.50 per share quarterly dividend. Sales for the first quarter were $28.3 billion, up 7.1% from last year. Comp sales were up 6.4% from last year with U.S. comps of positive 7.5%. Diluted earnings per share were $2.08 in the first quarter. 
Richard will walk you through the details in a moment, but I want to stress that while we were pleased with the results in the quarter and we see an engaged customer, there was significant volatility. Month-to-month and even week-to-week, we saw extreme ups and downs across different categories and geographies. As a result, we are cautious to extrapolate trends from the first quarter into a forecast for the remaining of the year, particularly given the tremendous amount of uncertainty we face with regards to the duration and continued impacts of the virus. 
Despite the many unknowns of the current environment, we are confident that we have taken the steps to ensure that we will emerge from this crisis stronger and even better positioned for the future. Though this crisis is unparalleled in size and scope, we have built a reputation through our history of doing whatever it takes to be there for our associates, customers and communities in the most critical times, and this situation is no different. 
Once again, I want to thank our incredible associates and express how grateful and proud I am of the resiliency and strength that our teams have demonstrated as we navigate these extraordinary circumstances together. This reminds me of the words of our founder, Bernie Marcus, that have never resonated more deeply than they do today, ""If you take care of our associates, they take care of the customers and everything else takes care of itself."" 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ted."

I also want to start by thanking all of our associates and supplier partners for the incredible collaboration over the last several months.

I also want to start by thanking all of our associates and supplier partners for the incredible collaboration over the last several months. 
Supplier relationships and partnerships matter, and during times of crisis is when they matter the most. One of the actions we took early on when COVID-19 was impacting the supply chain in China was to establish regular and frequent contact with our suppliers, both internationally and domestically. As cases increased in the U.S., our suppliers helped source the essential products our customers and communities needed. We established an effective plan, shifted resources as needed and worked on getting the right products to the right stores across the country. While in-stock levels vary from store-to-store and region-to-region, our focus remains on replenishing and restocking high-demand products as quickly as possible. 
We are grateful for our strong strategic partnerships. Our supplier partners are helping us in many ways, including supplying essential products for our own use. Let me give you an example. Very early on in the pandemic, we reached out to PPG, one of our key paint suppliers, for help. We asked PPG if they could help supply hand sanitizer for our store associates. They quickly converted several of their manufacturing lines and within a few short weeks, they produced an initial order of approximately 100,000 gallons of hand sanitizer. They are planning to produce 3x that amount for future in-store use that will help our associates for the remainder of the year. This is just one of many examples, and I want to thank PPG and all of the other supplier partners that have stepped up to help us prioritize the safety and well-being of our associates and customers. 
The challenges we face as a result of COVID-19, including the most fluid operating environment we've ever experienced, have further reinforced our strategy of the One Home Depot interconnected shopping experience. As a direct result of our investments across the business over the last decade, our teams were able to make decisions quickly and adapt to changing local government mandates and customer behavior. And as you heard from Craig, we did this while focusing on 2 priorities: keeping our associates and customers safe and continuing to serve our communities with the essential products and services they need for their homes and places of work. 
Our continued investment in our interconnected capabilities has positioned us well as customers turned online for their shopping needs. The shelter-in-place orders were rolled out across the country in mid-to-late March. We saw our digital businesses accelerate from approximately 30% growth in early March to triple-digit growth by the end of April. In fact, daily traffic to homedepot.com reached new records toward the end of the quarter. During the last 3 weeks of the quarter, traffic to homedepot.com was consistently above Black Friday levels. And as a result of our continued investment in our digital infrastructure and with the great work of our technology teams, we provided continuous service to our customers and our conversion rate continued to increase. 
During the quarter, we continued to leverage our different fulfillment capabilities like Buy Online, Pick-Up In Store and our enhanced delivery capabilities, whether it be on a flatbed truck, a box truck or our car and van service. Our BOPUS and Deliver From Store fulfillment options saw triple-digit growth in the first quarter. In fact, the flexibility that we have built into our systems allowed us to quickly roll out the fulfillment option for our customers to buy online and pick up at our stores through a contactless curbside pickup option. 
Looking at the first quarter in total, we saw positive comps in 11 of our 14 merchandising departments. Comps in kitchen and bath, flooring and millwork, departments with a heavy reliance on in-home installation, were negative during the quarter. During the first quarter, we saw 3 distinct phases of sales performance. The first phase covered the first 7 weeks of the quarter. During this phase, we saw strong sales across the store with all departments showing mid-single to double-digit comps. As customers prepared to shelter in place, we saw particularly strong growth with certain categories like cleaning and safety and security, but we also saw growth above our expectations in other core categories. 
The second phase of our sales performance relates to the last week of March and the first 2 weeks of April. During this phase, as the number of shelter-in-place orders were issued across the country, we were among the first essential retailers to take immediate and decisive action geared at limiting customer traffic in our stores. These actions included reducing store hours, limiting the number of customers in our stores and canceling our annual spring events, including Spring Black Friday. In addition, we made the decision to suspend certain nonessential installation services, such as kitchen remodels. During these 3 weeks, we saw negative comps in most departments. 
Finally, during the last 3 weeks of the quarter, while maintaining safety protocols around distancing and proactively restricting customer traffic in stores, we saw strong comps across most of our departments as customers focused on a number of home improvement projects. We continue to see significant pressure in products requiring installation services like kitchen and bath and flooring. 
During the first quarter, comp average ticket increased 11.1%, and comp transactions decreased 4%, reflecting the lower traffic that we just discussed. The strength in our comp average ticket was driven by a notable increase in basket size. Core commodity categories like lumber and copper did not have a material inflationary impact on our comp average ticket during the first quarter. 
During the first quarter, big ticket comp transactions or those over $1,000 were up 2.5%. We saw strong performance in big ticket categories like appliances and riding lawnmowers. However, this strength was offset by pressure in categories like special-order kitchens, countertops and flooring where we intentionally limited these installation services in customers' homes. Sales of both our DIY and Pro customers grew during the quarter with DIY sales growing faster than Pro sales. We continue to have a high-level engagement with the Pro. However, certain states and municipalities restricted in-home activity, which had a direct impact on some of our Pro customers. In addition, certain social distancing actions we took during the first quarter also served as a headwind to Pro activity. 
As we look ahead, we are focused on continuing to provide essential products and services to our customers and communities in a safe and responsible way. The investments we have made across our business have helped us be flexible and agile in this fluid and dynamic situation. We will continue to adapt and improve the ways in which we serve customers in this new environment. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard."

We appreciate everyone joining the call today, and we hope you and your loved ones are safe and healthy. 
This was certainly a unique quarter with COVID-19 dramatically changing our operating environment, but it has also reinforced that the investments we have made in the business over the last decade have been the right ones. They have allowed us to be more flexible and agile than ever before. And we've taken unprecedented actions to respond to the virus primarily focused on supporting our associates, keeping them and our customers safe while providing essential products to our communities. 
Today, I'll review our consolidated results for the first quarter and will provide some color in the context of the 3 distinct periods that Ted mentioned we observed. I'll also review some of the direct actions we took as a company to support our associates and further strengthen our capital structure. In the first quarter, total sales were $28.3 billion, a 7.1% increase from last year. Our total company comps were positive 6.4% for the quarter with positive comps of 9.3% in February, 7.1% in March and 4.2% in April. Comps in the U.S. were positive 7.5% for the quarter with positive comps of 9.7% in February, 7.5% in March and 6.4% in April. 
From a geographic perspective, all 3 of our U.S. divisions posted positive comps and 17 of our 19 U.S. regions had positive comps in the first quarter. The 2 exceptions were our New York Metro and South Florida regions. New York and its surrounding areas were negatively impacted given the outsized impact that the virus had on the region. And our South Florida region was negatively impacted by our stores in Puerto Rico being closed for a period of time in accordance with local mandates. 
During the pre-COVID period in February and stretching into mid-March, comps were double-digit positive in the U.S. with relatively uniform strength across all regions. As we moved into late March and early April, we experienced peak shelter-in-place mandates across the country. During this time, we implemented early and decisive measures to restrict customer traffic in our stores, which had a direct negative impact to our sales, most acutely felt in higher-volume stores in densely populated urban areas. Over the course of these 3 weeks, shelter-in-place mandates and self-imposed limitations on traffic pressured our weekly performance to double-digit negative comp sales with higher-volume stores underperforming lower-volume stores by over 30 percentage points in certain areas. 
And finally, during the last 3 weeks of April and continuing into the first 2 weeks of the second quarter, we have seen a significant acceleration to double-digit comp sales growth with strong performance across most of the store as customers turn to repairs and home improvement projects. 
As a result of ongoing measures to promote social distancing practices in our stores, customer limits continue to constrain sales in our higher-volume stores. But we have flexed our operating model to improve our ability to serve these strong levels of demand. 
In the first quarter, our gross margin was 34.1%, a decrease of 12 basis points from last year. This decrease was primarily driven by changes in the mix of products sold and continued pressure from shrink. This pressure was offset in part by favorability in supply chain expenses and by the cancellation of our annual Spring Black Friday event this year. 
During the first quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales increased approximately 190 basis points to 22.5%. This increase primarily reflects our decision to extend enhanced benefits for our associates, totaling $850 million in incurred and accrued expense, reflecting the provision of additional paid time off for all our hourly associates, which can be used anytime during the year and will be paid out at year-end if our associates choose not to use it; the provision of incremental additional paid time off for associates considered to be at higher risk based on CDC guidelines; weekly bonuses for our hourly associates; double pay for overtime hours worked and other benefits. These enhanced benefits created approximately 300 basis points of expense deleverage during the quarter. 
In addition, we recorded expenses related to our strategic investment plan of approximately $270 million, a slight increase versus last year, creating 10 basis points of expense deleverage. Finally, we showed strong expense control in all other areas of the business as we navigated the quarter and drove approximately 120 basis points of expense leverage on that basis. 
Our operating margin for the first quarter was 11.6% compared to 13.6% in the first quarter of 2019. If we were to exclude the 300 basis points of deleverage related to the COVID-19 expenses to support our associates, our operating margin would have been approximately 14.6%. 
Interest and other expense for the first quarter grew by $34 million to $307 million due primarily to higher long-term debt levels than 1 year ago. 
In the first quarter, our effective tax rate was 24.4%, flat with the first quarter of fiscal 2019. 
Our diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $2.08 compared to $2.27 in the first quarter of 2019. The $850 million of expense related to enhancements we made in support of our associates negatively impacted our first quarter diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.60. 
During the quarter, we opened 1 new store in Mexico and 1 in Puerto Rico, bringing our store count -- our total store count to 2,293. Selling square footage at the end of the quarter was 238 million square feet. At the end of the quarter, inventory turns were 5x, up from 4.7x last year. 
Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 40.8%, down from 45.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. This decrease primarily reflects higher long-term debt balances than 1 year ago as we took steps to enhance our liquidity position during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and I'll take a moment to comment on those actions in a little more detail. 
We began the first quarter with a very strong liquidity position, and we moved early in the quarter to strengthen that position. In mid-March, we suspended our share repurchase program indefinitely. Prior to that suspension, we had repurchased approximately $600 million or 2.5 million shares of outstanding stock. In late March, we upsized our A1/P1 commercial paper program from $3 billion to $6 billion. In conjunction with upsizing our commercial paper program, we expanded our revolving credit facility capacity from $3 billion to $6.5 billion. As of today, we have no commercial paper outstanding and our credit facilities are undrawn. And finally, on March 30, we raised $5 billion of staggered maturity long-term debt with an average coupon of approximately 3%. This average coupon is below the average coupon of our overall debt portfolio. These actions were important to ensure we had more than adequate liquidity during this period of uncertainty. In addition, we took actions to reduce nonessential activity in our stores. And as a result, postponed some of our strategic investments that touch our stores directly, including changes to our front-end and resets of our merchandising base. 
While these actions reflect our focus on social distancing, we remain committed to our One Home Depot strategy. Fiscal 2020 marks the third year of our strategic investment plan to create a seamless and frictionless interconnected experience. These investments are designed to leverage and extend our competitive advantage and have already begun to prove their value as we pivot to serve our customers in new ways. 
Now I'll comment on how we're thinking about guidance. Recall that the fiscal 2020 guidance that we provided on our fourth quarter call in February excluded any impacts from COVID-19. Our performance to date has surpassed our initial expectations and it is also disconnected from traditional metrics like GDP, which we have historically used as a foundational element of our sales guidance. As a result of this and the level of uncertainty that exists with respect to the impact of COVID-19 on future economic activity and customer demand, we are suspending our fiscal 2020 guidance until further notice. Our stance is not a reflection of current demand for home improvement, but rather a reflection of the broad range of potential outcomes for the economy and our business. Our strategic investments have positioned us well to continue to serve our customers with the essential products they need for their homes and places of work. Our company is in a strong financial position, and we have taken steps to further strengthen that position. We will continue to invest to strengthen our competitive advantages, and we believe we will emerge from this COVID-19 environment a stronger team and a stronger company.

So Chuck, we saw more sale impact in the highly shelter-in-place regions or zones versus the states that had moderated or no actions in place. So the Pros definitely faced some headwinds from the state mandates. We also had some restrictions in the form of inability to get permits issued or job site inspections completed so they can move on with their projects. And finally, there were some headwinds there with homeowners just having the reluctance to have crews working in their home when they were sheltered in place. As Craig said, high-spend Pros were more impacted. That makes sense if you think about them being more concentrated in metro areas likely or they have some of those mandates impact their business, but also larger jobs and more crews, more likely to be impacted from the inability to get permits or job inspections. I would give you one additional point of reference though, and I would draw that parallel to our services business. If you look at job cancellations, they're running at historic trends, which really means that more customers have just pushed their jobs and haven't canceled the work. So as these mandates are lifted, we're seeing the Pros come back to work. It's just a slower recovery than what we've seen from consumers."

But maybe if I gave you some color around the $850 million, that would give you clarity on how to think about it. So there are really, really kind of 2 categories of that spend. The vast majority of the $850 million reflects expense related to the extension of paid leave. So in mid-March, we extended additional paid leave to all of our hourly associates and subsequently extended paid leave for associates who would have been deemed at risk. For both those groups, if leave is not taken, we fully committed to pay it out during the year. A portion of the paid leave has already been taken, but we have fully accrued for all of the remaining leave eligible to be taken. So the vast majority of that $850 million has already been accrued. Then we have expenses that are paid as earned by our associates. This bucket of expenses was about $150 million of the $850 million. And so these are really in the form of the weekly bonuses we're paying to our associates as well as the enhanced overtime rates that we're paying. We began payment of those benefits roughly halfway into the quarter. So that $150 million was paid over roughly half a quarter.

We hope that you and your loved ones are safe and healthy, and our thoughts and prayers continue to be with all of those that have been directly impacted by COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic and its impact have forced us to change the way we live, work and interact with each other. Though these tough times have been unquestionably challenging, as we mentioned in the first quarter, we have navigated this crisis by aligning our decisions and actions to some of our most important values: do the right thing and take care of our people. Our focus has been and continues to be on 2 key priorities: the safety and well-being of our associates and customers and providing our customers with the products and services they need at this time. 
In the first quarter, we had to adjust our stores to an environment that promoted social and physical distancing, and we did this by implementing a change to store hours, limiting the number of customers in store and eliminating traffic-driving and events as well as operational changes like floor marking, signage and Plexiglass shields. In the second quarter, we continued to adapt based on our learnings and ever-changing environment. Our team continues to work to promote a safe shopping environment. 
We made several adjustments in the quarter to our operating approach. First, we expanded our operating hours from 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. This action was taken to relieve the end-of-day bottlenecks we observed in some stores while we are operating under more restrictive hours. Second, we modified the national approach that we had in the first quarter to limit the number of customers in stores. And now are taking a more localized approach by relying on our store managers and field teams to closely monitor safety and implement customer limits as needed. Third, we announced that mask or facial coverings are required for all associates and customers in our U.S. stores and other facilities. 
Given the ongoing demands and complexity of the current environment, we have continued to focus on taking care of our people by extending weekly bonuses for hourly associates in our stores and distribution centers. Through the second quarter, we have spent approximately $1.3 billion on enhanced associate pay and benefits in response to COVID-19. Additionally, the company's first half performance resulted in a record payout for Success Sharing, our profit sharing program for our hourly associates. I'm incredibly proud of our associates for the many ways that they have lived our values by serving our customers, communities and each other during this unprecedented time. Our team has demonstrated ongoing flexibility to effectively operate in this dynamic environment, while also executing to deliver record-breaking sales. 
Sales for the second quarter were $38.1 billion, up 23.4% from last year. Comp sales were up 23.4% from last year with U.S. comps of positive 25%. Diluted earnings per share were $4.02 in the second quarter. These record results were driven by broad-based strength across our stores and geographies. As Ted will detail, both ticket and transactions were up double-digit in the quarter, and we saw healthy growth from both our Pro and DIY customers. During the quarter, we saw customers take on projects throughout their homes, from deck building to painting projects, landscape work and home repairs due to increased wear and tear. Clearly, our customers engaged with home improvement in a meaningful way. 
That being said, as we discussed in the first quarter, we are cautious to extrapolate trends from the first half of the year into a forecast for the remaining of the year, particularly given the tremendous amount of uncertainty we face with regards to the duration and continued impacts of the virus. So while we can't predict the sales trajectory for the back half of the year, we do know that for many of our customers, the home has never been more important. Our recent customer survey work tells us that customers have a continued willingness to take on both indoor and outdoor projects in the near term. Customers are consolidating the number of retailers they visit and are blending the physical and digital elements of the shopping experience more than ever before. As a result, the distinct competitive advantages and overarching benefits of an interconnected One Home Depot strategy have never been more relevant. 
Our interconnected retail strategy and underlying technology infrastructures have supported record web traffic on a consistent basis for the past several months. Sales leveraging our digital platforms increased approximately 100% in the quarter and more than 60% of the time, our customers opted to pick up their order at a store. The accelerated growth of our interconnected and digital offerings has given us the opportunity to showcase, in a very condensed time frame, new capabilities in different ways to engage with a Home depot, that customers may not have been fully aware of. The rate at which customers are authenticating with us has also accelerated, which provides us with a unique opportunity to know our customers even better. This is critical as we continue on our journey to offer a deeper level of personalization and further enhance the interconnected shopping experience. 
That being said, the step change in demand across our digital platforms is not without its challenges, particularly from a delivery and fulfillment standpoint. We have been able to leverage investments we have made in the scale and flexibility of our supply chain network to relieve some of the pressure. This is exactly what we did during the quarter when we temporarily transitioned one of our recently opened market delivery centers for MDCs to a direct fulfillment center, or DFC, which primarily fulfills online orders. The investments that we have made in the underlying infrastructure and systems supporting the MDC, coupled with a strong cross-functional alignment across the organization, enabled us to make this conversion in just a few short weeks. The net result for our customers was the reduction in lead times for orders flowing from our direct fulfillment network. 
We are focused on continuing the momentum of our strategic investments to enhance the interconnected shopping experience and position ourselves for continued share capture over the long term. At the same time, we know that we must remain agile and flexible to execute against the demands of the current environment. Through it all, we will continue to lead with our values. And I could not be more proud of the resiliency and strength that the team has demonstrated as we navigate these extraordinary circumstances together. I want to thank our incredible associates and supplier partners for their hard work and dedication to serve our customers and communities. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ted."

I, too, want to thank all our associates and supplier partners for their relentless focus on serving our customers. During the second quarter, we saw unprecedented levels of engagement from both our DIY and Pro customers. Our team satisfied the strong demand by working together in a flexible and agile manner while also prioritizing safety. As an example, we decided to cancel our annual Memorial Day event and adjust other Spring events as we didn't want to drive even more traffic into already crowded areas of our store like garden and paint. We also removed most of our off-shelf merchandising displays in order to support social distancing. Our teams were incredibly flexible and worked in a cross-functional manner to coordinate changes. We altered marketing plans, social media, product flow, product selection and space allocation. Our merchants, suppliers, marketers, supply chain, merchandising execution and store teams remained agile throughout the quarter and focused on our customers. 
We are fortunate to have the best supplier partners in the business. Leveraging our tools and analytics, we work together to make real-time adjustments to our assortments. In many instances, we introduced alternative products and reduced assortments to the highest demand SKUs that our partners could supply most effectively. As an example to support in-stock levels for high-demand items such as cleaning products, we work with suppliers to streamline production on key products, sizes and fragrances. And as you heard from Craig, the investments we've made in our supply chain over the last decade allowed us to be more flexible than ever in flowing product to the right geographies. 
During the second quarter, 13 of our 14 merchandising departments posted double-digit comps in the quarter, led by our lumber department, our kitchen and bath department posted high single-digit comps. During the quarter, comp average ticket increased 10.1%, and comp transactions increased 12.3%. The growth in our comp average ticket was driven by both an increase in basket size, as well as customers trading up to new and innovative items. In addition, inflation in core commodity categories, like lumber, positively impacted our average ticket growth by approximately 61 basis points. The strength of our comp transaction growth was driven by consistently strong in-store and online transactions. 
During the second quarter, big ticket comp transactions or those over $1,000 were up approximately 16%. We saw very strong performance across a number of big-ticket categories like appliances, riding lawnmowers and patio furniture. However, this strength was partially offset by softer performance in certain indoor installation-heavy categories like special kitchens and countertops. We saw strong sales growth with both our Pro and DIY customers, with DIY sales growing faster than Pro sales. Sales to our Pro customers accelerated meaningfully compared to the first quarter and grew double digits compared to the second quarter of last year. Looking deeper into our Pro sales, we saw notable strength with our smaller Pro customer. As markets continue to reopen, we see increasing demand from all our Pro customer cohorts. 
We continue to lean into our strategic investments to create a Pro ecosystem that encompasses professional grade product, exclusive brands, enhanced delivery, credit, digital capabilities, field sales support, HD rental and more. We believe our differentiated ecosystem will continue to drive deeper engagement with our Pro customers. 
Turning to our DIY customers. Our DIY customers are reengaging with their home and with The Home Depot in a meaningful way and they are engaging across the store. While we have seen strong demand with exterior projects like building decks, sheds, fences and gardens, we've also seen strong growth with interior projects like hard surface flooring, interior lighting and painting, to name a few. We firmly believe that our One Home Depot strategy is creating a best-in-class interconnected shopping experience. We are building unique capabilities that let our customers engage across our digital platforms, our updated physical stores and our enhanced delivery experience. And our confidence in these new capabilities led us to change our tagline and marketing efforts to How Doers Get More Done. 
During the second quarter, new and existing customers set record levels of engagement across our new capabilities. The rate at which our existing customers are adopting new channels to engage with The Home Depot, more than doubled year-to-date. And we also saw 1/3 of recently acquired customers reengaged with The Home Depot for another purchase in a different department. During the second quarter, our mobile app saw a record number of downloads, and we saw significant growth in conversion rates across all digital platforms. These results confirm our belief that we have been making investments in the right areas of our business and that those investments are resonating with our customers. 
Let me give you an example to help illustrate our enhanced capabilities and options for customers. Over the last couple of years, we have enabled multiple fulfillment options, including Buy Online, Pick Up In-Store with convenient pickup lockers; buy online, Deliver From Store with our express car and van delivery; and most recently, our curbside pick-up option. As customers accelerate their adoption of an interconnected shopping experience, we have seen increased usage of these different fulfillment options. During the second quarter, we saw triple-digit growth across all these platforms. 
Another example is our HD Home business. As part of our strategic investments over the last 3 years, we have been leaning into several home decor categories. As consumers shop fewer and fewer retailers, our research showed that our customers were increasingly looking to homedepot.com to help project completers like room decor and textiles. We are investing to create a better, frictionless online shopping experience for decor. We are showcasing our collections, enabling shop by room and highlighting our capabilities and product offerings with HD Home. With record levels of traffic on homedepot.com, we have seen significant outsized sales growth with our HD Home assortment. 
All the investments across the business make us more flexible as we continue to navigate this fluid and dynamic situation. As we look to the back half of the year, we will be working with our supplier partners as well as our cross-functional teams to satisfy our customers' evolving home improvement needs. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard."

In the second quarter, total sales were $38.1 billion, a 23.4% increase from last year. Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted total sales growth by approximately $200 million. Our total company comps were positive 23.4% for the quarter, with positive comps of 24.6% in May, 25.7% in June, and 20.4% in July. Comps in the U.S. were positive 25% for the quarter with positive comps of 27.3% in May, 27.3% in June and 21% in July. 
As you heard from Craig and Ted, the strong demand we saw was broad-based with a high degree of performance uniformity among our 3 U.S. divisions in Canada. All 19 of our U.S. regions posted double-digit positive comps, and our Canadian business reported record sales. Mexico's performance was impacted by a lag in COVID-19 cases relative to the U.S. and Canada. And as a result, Mexico's performance was negative in the beginning of the quarter, before turning to positive growth at the end of the quarter. 
In the second quarter, our gross margin was 34%, an increase of approximately 20 basis points from last year. The change in our gross margin was driven by several factors, including a benefit from a reduction of annual events during the quarter. This benefit was partially offset by the mix of products sold and pressure from shrink. 
During the second quarter, operating expense, as a percent of sales of approximately 18.1%, increased approximately 10 basis points compared to last year. Let me take a moment to comment on a few of our expense items. First, during the quarter, we continue to support our associates with enhanced benefits, which totaled approximately $480 million in the second quarter, resulting in 125 basis points of expense deleverage. Second, we incurred approximately $110 million of operational COVID-related expenses, including personal protective equipment for our associates and customers; and enhanced cleaning of our stores, resulting in approximately 30 basis points of operating expense deleverage. Third, we recorded expenses related to our strategic investment plan of approximately $280 million, an increase of approximately $40 million compared to last year. 
We are committed to completing our strategic investments. However, given the priority around safety and the complexities of the operating environment we find ourselves in, we are deferring certain in-store investments and now expect some of the projects we initially earmarked for fiscal 2020 to be completed in fiscal 2021. 
And finally, during the second quarter, we showed strong expense control in all areas of the business and drove approximately 145 basis points of expense leverage. Included in this 145 basis points of leverage, is approximately 90 basis points of pressure, driven by accrued bonus expense related to our significant outperformance for our biannual store Success Sharing program in-store and field-based management bonuses for the first half. Our operating margin for the second quarter was approximately 15.9%, an increase of approximately 10 basis points from last year. Interest and other expense for the second quarter grew by $54 million to $337 million due primarily to higher long-term debt levels than 1 year ago. 
In the second quarter, our effective tax rate was 24.4%, compared to 24.6% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Our diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $4.02, an increase of 26.8%, compared to the second quarter of 2019. At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories declined $1.2 billion to $13.5 billion, driven by the significant and steady demand we saw during the quarter. Inventory turns were 6.1x, up from 5.1x last year. 
Moving on to capital allocation. While our long-term principle of returning excess capital to shareholders remains intact, we believe that in this unprecedented environment, it is appropriate for us to maintain a strong liquidity position. During the quarter, we invested approximately $445 million back into our business in the form of capital expenditures, and we repaid approximately $1.75 billion of long-term debt. We also paid $1.6 billion in dividends to our shareholders. Computed on the average beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 41.1%, down from 43.7% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. This decrease primarily reflects our decision to temporarily enhance our liquidity position, including the suspension of our share repurchase program back in March. 
Looking ahead, through the first 2 weeks of August, comparable sales growth remains at levels similar to total company's second quarter comp sales. Our customers tell us that they plan to continue to invest in a wide variety of projects to maintain and enhance their homes. However, given the degree of uncertainty in our external environment, we cannot extrapolate current observations to predict future performance. As a result, we are focused on operating with discipline and flexibility in order to grow market share regardless of what demand patterns emerge. And despite the significant uncertainty in the current environment, we do believe in the resilience of home improvement demand over the long term. The home typically represents our customers' largest asset.

The environment now is pretty fluid, and I'm sure you'd describe it as still competitive. When you put out the one HD plan, most of the plan was recouping some of the margin that you would be making to make investments. But you never really baked in sales upside. And by default, you never really promised or committed to more margin. Can you talk about -- does that change? And it's not about does margin go up over time, but does it create the potential for margins to trickle up over time? Or are you going to be steadfast on reinvesting and maintaining a certain margin level going forward?"

They were less impacted with the downturn in Q1, but continue to rebound and accelerate in Q2. The high-spend Pro also continued to rebound and would see that as being an outcome of permitting and job inspections coming back online. And there are areas where homeowners are becoming more comfortable with having pros and service providers in their homes. There are some end markets that haven't totally recovered. I'll give you one example, and that would be multifamily property managers. Obviously, there are slower turns on the units. They have less access to the properties, and they still remain in more of a break-fix mode holding back on major rehabs and capital projects.

So if you take a look at the approximately $480 million that we invested in enhanced benefits in the quarter.

The remainder of that, the remaining $120 million that we expensed in Q2, represent benefits like enhanced overtime pay that have not continued into the third quarter. So again, of that second quarter, about $360 million continues in the third quarter. It's worth pointing out that in a 23% comp environment, there are more hours, there are more associates eligible for those weekly bonuses. We certainly were not planning, at the beginning of the quarter for a 25% -- or 23% comp environment. So that number is going to naturally be a little bit higher in Q2 because of that. So that's the breakdown of our associate expense. And it's something that we review on a continuous basis.

Each of framing and panel are over $700, they're up essentially about 115% DIY. But I would say a big piece of that was when COVID started, none of us knew where this was going to go and the mills took a conservative approach and largely backed off harvesting trees and cutting logs. That product started up again about mid-quarter of Q2, and we're starting to see much better flow in lumber. So I'm not going to predict lumber prices, but with more supply coming into the marketplace, hopefully, we're going to obtain these $700 levels, although we do have substantial support with housing and all the projects that Craig referred to. Certainly in pressure treated decking, just a robust decking boom. But we should see some moderation, but the unit demand, even with these higher prices, has remained double-digit and incredibly strong.

What we're seeing is that all generations are engaging in Gen X and millennial. And when you start with that first DIY project, it may be a garden, it may be painting. Painting has traditionally been the #1 DIY project. And once you accomplish that first more modest task, you gain confidence and you take on the next task and the next task and they become bigger, and then you need more sophisticated in broader breadth of tools to continue the more ambitious projects you're taking on.

We hope that you and your loved ones are safe and healthy, and our thoughts and prayers continue to be with all of those that have been directly impacted by COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic and its impact have forced us to change the way we live, work and interact with each other. Though these tough times have been unquestionably challenging, as we mentioned in the first quarter, we have navigated this crisis by aligning our decisions and actions to some of our most important values: do the right thing and take care of our people. Our focus has been and continues to be on 2 key priorities: the safety and well-being of our associates and customers and providing our customers with the products and services they need at this time.
In the first quarter, we had to adjust our stores to an environment that promoted social and physical distancing, and we did this by implementing a change to store hours, limiting the number of customers in-store and eliminating traffic-driving events as well as operational changes like floor marking, signage and Plexiglas shields. In the second quarter, we continued to adapt based on our learnings and ever-changing environment. Our team continues to work to promote a safe shopping environment.  
We made several adjustments in the quarter to our operating approach. First, we expanded our operating hours from 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. This action was taken to relieve the end-of-day bottlenecks we observed in some stores while were operating under more restrictive hours. Second, we modified the national approach that we had in the first quarter to limit the number of customers in stores and now are taking a more localized approach by relying on our store managers and field teams to closely monitor safety and implement customer limits as needed. Third, we announced that mask or facial coverings are required for all associates and customers in our U.S. stores and other facilities.  
Given the ongoing demands and complexity of the current environment, we have continued to focus on taking care of our people by extending weekly bonuses for hourly associates in our stores and distribution centers. Through the second quarter, we have spent approximately $1.3 billion on enhanced associate pay and benefits in response to COVID-19. Additionally, the company's first half performance resulted in a record payout for Success Sharing, our profit-sharing program for our hourly associates. I'm incredibly proud of our associates for the many ways that they have lived our values by serving our customers, communities and each other during this unprecedented time. Our team has demonstrated ongoing flexibility to effectively operate in this dynamic environment, while also executing to deliver record-breaking sales.  
Sales for the second quarter were $38.1 billion, up 23.4% from last year. Comp sales were up 23.4% from last year with U.S. comps of positive 25%. Diluted earnings per share were $4.02 in the second quarter. These record results were driven by broad-based strength across our stores and geographies. As Ted will detail, both ticket and transactions were up double digit in the quarter, and we saw healthy growth from both our Pro and DIY customers. During the quarter, we saw customers take on projects throughout their homes, from deck building to painting projects, landscape work and home repairs due to increased wear and tear. Clearly, our customers engaged with home improvement in a meaningful way.  
That being said, as we discussed in the first quarter, we are cautious to extrapolate trends from the first half of the year into a forecast for the remaining of the year, particularly given the tremendous amount of uncertainty we face with regards to the duration and continued impacts of the virus. So while we can't predict the sales trajectory for the back half of the year, we do know that for many of our customers, the home has never been more important. Our recent customer survey work tells us that customers have a continued willingness to take on both indoor and outdoor projects in the near term. Customers are consolidating the number of retailers they visit and are blending the physical and digital elements of the shopping experience more than ever before. As a result, the distinct competitive advantages and overarching benefits of an interconnected One Home Depot strategy have never been more relevant.  
Our interconnected retail strategy and underlying technology infrastructures have supported record web traffic on a consistent basis for the past several months. Sales leveraging our digital platforms increased approximately 100% in the quarter and more than 60% of the time, our customers opted to pick up their order at a store. The accelerated growth of our interconnected and digital offerings has given us the opportunity to showcase, in a very condensed time frame, new capabilities in different ways to engage with The Home Depot that customers may not have been fully aware of. The rate at which customers are authenticating with us has also accelerated, which provides us with a unique opportunity to know our customers even better. This is critical as we continue on our journey to offer a deeper level of personalization and further enhance the interconnected shopping experience.  
That being said, the step change in demand across our digital platforms is not without its challenges, particularly from a delivery and fulfillment standpoint. We have been able to leverage investments we have made in the scale and flexibility of our supply chain network to relieve some of the pressure. This is exactly what we did during the quarter when we temporarily transitioned one of our recently opened market delivery centers, or MDCs, to a direct fulfillment center, or DFC, which primarily fulfills online orders. The investments that we have made in the underlying infrastructure and systems supporting the MDC, coupled with a strong cross-functional alignment across the organization, enabled us to make this conversion in just a few short weeks. The net result for our customers was the reduction in lead times for orders flowing from our direct fulfillment network.  
We are focused on continuing the momentum of our strategic investments to enhance the interconnected shopping experience and position ourselves for continued share capture over the long term. At the same time, we know that we must remain agile and flexible to execute against the demands of the current environment. Through it all, we will continue to lead with our values. And I could not be more proud of the resiliency and strength that the team has demonstrated as we navigate these extraordinary circumstances together. I want to thank our incredible associates and supplier partners for their hard work and dedication to serve our customers and communities. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ted."

Our team satisfied the strong demand by working together in a flexible and agile manner while also prioritizing safety. 
As an example, we decided to cancel our annual Memorial Day event and adjust other spring events as we didn't want to drive even more traffic into already crowded areas of our store like garden and paint. We also removed most of our off-shelf merchandising displays in order to support social distancing. Our teams were incredibly flexible and worked in a cross-functional manner to coordinate changes. We altered marketing plans, social media, product flow, product selection and space allocation. Our merchants, suppliers, marketers, supply chain, merchandising execution and store teams remained agile throughout the quarter and focused on our customers.  
We are fortunate to have the best supplier partners in the business. Leveraging our tools and analytics, we work together to make real-time adjustments to our assortments. In many instances, we introduced alternative products and reduced assortments to the highest demand SKUs that our partners could supply most effectively. As an example to support in-stock levels for high-demand items such as cleaning products, we worked with suppliers to streamline production on key products, sizes and fragrances. And as you heard from Craig, the investments we've made in our supply chain over the last decade allowed us to be more flexible than ever in flowing product to the right geographies.  
During the second quarter, 13 of our 14 merchandising departments posted double-digit comps in the quarter, led by our lumber department. Our kitchen and bath department posted high single-digit comps. During the quarter, comp average ticket increased 10.1%, and comp transactions increased 12.3%. The growth in our comp average ticket was driven by both an increase in basket size as well as customers trading up to new and innovative items. 
In addition, inflation in core commodity categories, like lumber, positively impacted our average ticket growth by approximately 61 basis points. The strength of our comp transaction growth was driven by consistently strong in-store and online transactions.  
During the second quarter, big-ticket comp transactions, or those over $1,000, were up approximately 16%. We saw very strong performance across a number of big-ticket categories like appliances, riding lawnmowers and patio furniture. However, this strength was partially offset by softer performance in certain indoor installation-heavy categories like special order kitchens and countertops. We saw strong sales growth with both our Pro and DIY customers, with DIY sales growing faster than Pro sales. Sales to our Pro customers accelerated meaningfully compared to the first quarter and grew double digits compared to the second quarter of last year. Looking deeper into our Pro sales, we saw notable strength with our smaller Pro customer. As markets continue to reopen, we see increasing demand from all our Pro customer cohorts.  
We continue to lean into our strategic investments to create a Pro ecosystem that encompasses professional-grade product, exclusive brands, enhanced delivery, credit, digital capabilities, field sales, support, HD Rental and more. We believe our differentiated ecosystem will continue to drive deeper engagement with our Pro customers.  
Turning to our DIY customers. Our DIY customers are reengaging with their home and with The Home Depot in a meaningful way, and they are engaging across the store. While we have seen strong demand with exterior projects like building decks, sheds, fences and gardens, we've also seen strong growth with interior projects like hard surface flooring, interior lighting and painting, to name a few. We firmly believe that our One Home Depot strategy is creating a best-in-class, interconnected shopping experience. We are building unique capabilities that let our customers engage across our digital platforms, our updated physical stores and our enhanced delivery experience. And our confidence in these new capabilities led us to change our tagline and marketing efforts to How Doers Get More Done.  
During the second quarter, new and existing customers set record levels of engagement across our new capabilities. The rate at which our existing customers are adopting new channels to engage with The Home Depot more than doubled year-to-date. And we also saw 1/3 of recently acquired customers reengage with The Home Depot for another purchase in a different department. During the second quarter, our mobile app saw a record number of downloads, and we saw significant growth in conversion rates across all digital platforms. These results confirm our belief that we have been making investments in the right areas of our business and that those investments are resonating with our customers.  
Let me give you an example to help illustrate our enhanced capabilities and options for customers. Over the last couple of years, we have enabled multiple fulfillment options, including Buy Online, Pick-up in Store with convenient pickup lockers; Buy Online, Deliver From Store with our express car and van delivery; and most recently, our curbside pick-up option. As customers accelerate their adoption of an interconnected shopping experience, we have seen increased usage of these different fulfillment options. During the second quarter, we saw triple-digit growth across all these platforms.  
Another example is our HD Home business. As part of our strategic investments over the last 3 years, we have been leaning into several home decor categories. As consumers shop fewer and fewer retailers, our research showed that our customers were increasingly looking to homedepot.com to help with project completers like room decor and textiles. We are investing to create a better, frictionless online shopping experience for decor. We are showcasing our collections, enabling shop by room and highlighting our capabilities and product offerings with HD Home. With record levels of traffic on homedepot.com, we have seen significant outsized sales growth with our HD Home assortment.  
All the investments across the business make us more flexible as we continue to navigate this fluid and dynamic situation. As we look to the back half of the year, we will be working with our supplier partners as well as our cross-functional teams to satisfy our customers' evolving home improvement needs. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard."

We appreciate everyone joining the call today, and we hope you and your loved ones are safe and healthy. In the second quarter, total sales were $38.1 billion, a 23.4% increase from last year. Foreign exchange r",904,"Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate everyone joining the call today, and we hope you and your loved ones are safe and healthy. In the second quarter, total sales were $38.1 billion, a 23.4% increase from last year. Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted total sales growth by approximately $200 million. Our total company comps were positive 23.4% for the quarter, with positive comps of 24.6% in May, 25.7% in June, and 20.4% in July. Comps in the U.S. were positive 25% for the quarter with positive comps of 27.3% in May, 27.3% in June and 21% in July.  
As you heard from Craig and Ted, the strong demand we saw was broad-based with a high degree of performance uniformity among our 3 U.S. divisions and Canada. All 19 of our U.S. regions posted double-digit positive comps, and our Canadian business reported record sales. Mexico's performance was impacted by a lag in COVID-19 cases relative to the U.S. and Canada. And as a result, Mexico's performance was negative in the beginning of the quarter before turning to positive growth at the end of the quarter.  
In the second quarter, our gross margin was 34%, an increase of approximately 20 basis points from last year. The change in our gross margin was driven by several factors, including a benefit from a reduction of annual events during the quarter. This benefit was partially offset by the mix of products sold and pressure from shrink.  
During the second quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales of approximately 18.1% increased approximately 10 basis points compared to last year. Let me take a moment to comment on a few of our expense items. First, during the quarter, we continued to support our associates with enhanced benefits, which totaled approximately $480 million in the second quarter, resulting in 125 basis points of expense deleverage. Second, we incurred approximately $110 million of operational COVID-related expenses, including personal protective equipment for our associates and customers and enhanced cleaning of our stores, resulting in approximately 30 basis points of operating expense deleverage. Third, we recorded expenses related to our strategic investment plan of approximately $280 million, an increase of approximately $40 million compared to last year.  
We are committed to completing our strategic investments. However, given the priority around safety and the complexities of the operating environment we find ourselves in, we are deferring certain in-store investments and now expect some of the projects we initially earmarked for fiscal 2020 to be completed in fiscal 2021.  
And finally, during the second quarter, we showed strong expense control in all areas of the business and drove approximately 145 basis points of expense leverage. Included in this 145 basis points of leverage is approximately 90 basis points of pressure, driven by accrued bonus expense related to our significant outperformance for our biannual store Success Sharing program and store and field-based management bonuses for the first half. Our operating margin for the second quarter was approximately 15.9%, an increase of approximately 10 basis points from last year. Interest and other expense for the second quarter grew by $54 million to $337 million due primarily to higher long-term debt levels than 1 year ago.  
In the second quarter, our effective tax rate was 24.4% compared to 24.6% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Our diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $4.02, an increase of 26.8% compared to the second quarter of 2019. At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories declined $1.2 billion to $13.5 billion, driven by the significant and steady demand we saw during the quarter. Inventory turns were 6.1x, up from 5.1x last year.  
Moving on to capital allocation. While our long-term principle of returning excess capital to shareholders remains intact, we believe that in this unprecedented environment, it is appropriate for us to maintain a strong liquidity position. During the quarter, we invested approximately $445 million back into our business in the form of capital expenditures, and we repaid approximately $1.75 billion of long-term debt. We also paid $1.6 billion in dividends to our shareholders. 
Computed on the average beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 41.1%, down from 43.7% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. This decrease primarily reflects our decision to temporarily enhance our liquidity position, including the suspension of our share repurchase program back in March. Looking ahead through the first 2 weeks of August, comparable sales growth remains at levels similar to total company second quarter comp sales. 
Our customers tell us that they plan to continue to invest in a wide variety of projects to maintain and enhance their homes. However, given the degree of uncertainty in our external environment, we cannot extrapolate current observations to predict future performance. As a result, we are focused on operating with discipline and flexibility in order to grow market share regardless of what demand patterns emerge. And despite the significant uncertainty in the current environment, we do believe in the resilience of home improvement demand over the long term. The home typically represents our customers' largest asset. The housing stock is aging, and we believe the capabilities we are investing in across our interconnect platform will position us well to continue capturing market share in any environment. 
Thank you for your participation in today's call, and we are now ready for questions."

The environment now is pretty fluid, and I'm sure you'd describe it as still competitive. When you laid out the One HD plan, most of the plan was recouping some of the margin that you would be making to make investments. But you never really baked in the sales upside and by default, you never really promised or committed to more margin. Can you talk about -- does that change? And it's not about does margin go up over time, but does it create the potential for margins to trickle up over time? Or are you going to be steadfast on reinvesting and maintaining a certain margin level going forward?"

They were less impacted with the downturn in Q1 but continued to rebound and accelerate in Q2. The high-spend Pro also continued to rebound, and I would see that as being an outcome of permitting and job inspections coming back online. There are areas where homeowners are becoming more comfortable with having Pros and service providers in their homes. There are some end markets that haven't totally recovered. I'll give you one example, and that would be multifamily property managers. Obviously, there are slower turns on the units. They have less access to the properties, and they still remain in more of a break-fix mode, holding back on major rehabs and capital projects. But with that said, even in multifamily Pro customers, we've seen upturn and a rebound in sales to those cohorts."

So if you take a look at the approximately $480 million that we invested in enhanced benefits in the quarter, you take a look at that and say about $360 million of it would represent spend on benefits that continue into the third quarter, with the vast majority of that $360 million being in the form of weekly bonuses to associates. The remainder of that, the remaining $120 million that we expensed in Q2 represented benefits like enhanced overtime pay that have not continued into the third quarter. So again, of that second quarter, about $360 million continues in the third quarter. 
It's worth pointing out that in a 23% comp environment, there are more hours, there are more associates eligible for those weekly bonuses. We certainly were not planning at the beginning of the quarter for a 25% -- or 23% comp environment. So that number is going to naturally be a little bit higher in Q2 because of that. So that's the breakdown of our associate expense. And it's something that we review on a continuous basis.

They're up essentially about 115% [ DIY ]. 
But I would say a big piece of that was when COVID started, none of us knew where this was going to go, and the mills took a conservative approach and largely backed off harvesting trees and cutting logs. That product started up again about mid-quarter of Q2, and we're starting to see much better flow in lumber. So I'm not going to predict lumber prices, but with more supply coming into the marketplace, hopefully, we're going to obtain these $700 levels, although we do have substantial support with housing and all the projects that Craig referred to. Certainly in pressure-treated decking, just a robust decking boom. But we should see some moderation, but the unit demand, even with these higher prices, has remained double digit and incredibly strong. So we see strength into Q3, certainly right now.

The traffic across all our properties, the active customers, the app downloads, the conversion rates, all very, very strong. Our actual active customers, the number of active customers also doubled. So as Craig said, our job going forward now is to just not reap the benefit of this activity in Q2. 
But with all these new customers engaging across all The Home Depot capabilities, we're very closely watching reengagement rates. And I mentioned a couple statistics in my prepared remarks, but we're seeing people shopping across departments. Are they engaging in other capabilities? What is their duration before there's a repeat engagement with a capability or indeed a purchase? And the name of the game for us is engagement, and that is really what's all behind How Doers Get More Done. The more our customers engage with our capabilities, whether it's in the store, self-checkout, app downloads, delivery, search, tool rental, using our lockers, using our calculators, every time our customer engages in another capability that we've built out, that's stickiness, that's repeat business, and that's customer loyalty. And a quarter like this has just been terrific in advancing our initiatives, and we're working very hard to keep that momentum going."

What we're seeing is that all generations are engaging, in Gen X and millennial. And when you start with that first DIY project, it may be a garden, it may be painting. Painting has traditionally been the #1 DIY project. And once you accomplish that first, more modest task, you gain confidence and you take on the next task and the next task and they become bigger.

We hope that you and your loved ones are safe and healthy, and our thoughts and prayers continue to be with all of those that have been directly impacted by COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic and its impact have forced us to change the way we live, work and interact with each other. Though these tough times have been unquestionably challenging, as we mentioned in the first quarter, we have navigated this crisis by aligning our decisions and actions to some of our most important values: do the right thing and take care of our people. Our focus has been and continues to be on 2 key priorities: the safety and well-being of our associates and customers and providing our customers with the products and services they need at this time.
In the first quarter, we had to adjust our stores to an environment that promoted social and physical distancing, and we did this by implementing a change to store hours, limiting the number of customers in-store and eliminating traffic-driving events as well as operational changes like floor marking, signage and plexiglass shields. 
In the second quarter, we continued to adapt based on our learnings and ever-changing environment. Our team continues to work to promote a safe shopping environment. We made several adjustments in the quarter to our operating approach. First, we expanded our operating hours from 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. This action was taken to relieve the end-of-day bottlenecks we observed in some stores while we're operating under more restrictive hours. Second, we modified the national approach that we had in the first quarter to limit the number of customers in stores and now are taking a more localized approach by relying on our store managers and field teams to closely monitor safety and implement customer limits as needed. Third, we announced that mask or facial coverings are required for all associates and customers in our U.S. stores and other facilities. 
Given the ongoing demands and complexity of the current environment, we have continued to focus on taking care of our people by extending weekly bonuses for hourly associates in our stores and distribution centers. Through the second quarter, we have spent approximately $1.3 billion on enhanced associate pay and benefits in response to COVID-19. Additionally, the company's first half performance resulted in a record payout for Success Sharing, our profit-sharing program for our hourly associates. I'm incredibly proud of our associates for the many ways that they have lived our values by serving our customers, communities and each other during this unprecedented time. Our team has demonstrated ongoing flexibility to effectively operate in this dynamic environment, while also executing to deliver record-breaking sales. 
Sales for the second quarter were $38.1 billion, up 23.4% from last year. Comp sales were up 23.4% from last year with U.S. comps of positive 25%. Diluted earnings per share were $4.02 in the second quarter. These record results were driven by broad-based strength across our stores and geographies. As Ted will detail, both ticket and transactions were up double digit in the quarter, and we saw healthy growth from both our Pro and DIY customers. During the quarter, we saw customers take on projects throughout their homes, from deck building to painting projects, landscape work and home repairs due to increased wear and tear. Clearly, our customers engaged with home improvement in a meaningful way. 
That being said, as we discussed in the first quarter, we are cautious to extrapolate trends from the first half of the year into a forecast for the remaining of the year, particularly given the tremendous amount of uncertainty we face with regards to the duration and continued impacts of the virus. So while we can't predict the sales trajectory for the back half of the year, we do know that for many of our customers, the home has never been more important. 
Our recent customer survey work tells us that customers have a continued willingness to take on both indoor and outdoor projects in the near term. Customers are consolidating the number of retailers they visit and are blending the physical and digital elements of the shopping experience more than ever before. As a result, the distinct competitive advantages and overarching benefits of an interconnected One Home Depot strategy have never been more relevant. 
Our interconnected retail strategy and underlying technology infrastructures have supported record web traffic on a consistent basis for the past several months. Sales leveraging our digital platforms increased approximately 100% in the quarter, and more than 60% of the time our customers opted to pick up their order at a store. 
The accelerated growth of our interconnected and digital offerings has given us the opportunity to showcase, in a very condensed time frame, new capabilities in different ways to engage with The Home Depot that customers may not have been fully aware of. The rate at which customers are authenticating with us has also accelerated, which provides us with a unique opportunity to know our customers even better. This is critical as we continue on our journey to offer a deeper level of personalization and further enhance the interconnected shopping experience. 
That being said, the step change in demand across our digital platforms is not without its challenges, particularly from a delivery and fulfillment standpoint. We have been able to leverage investments we have made in the scale and flexibility of our supply chain network to relieve some of the pressure. This is exactly what we did during the quarter when we temporarily transitioned one of our recently opened market delivery centers, or MDCs, to a direct fulfillment center, or DFC, which primarily fulfills online orders. The investments that we have made in the underlying infrastructure and systems supporting the MDC, coupled with a strong cross-functional alignment across the organization, enabled us to make this conversion in just a few short weeks. The net result for our customers was the reduction in lead times for orders flowing from our direct fulfillment network. 
We are focused on continuing the momentum of our strategic investments to enhance the interconnected shopping experience and position ourselves for continued share capture over the long term. At the same time, we know that we must remain agile and flexible to execute against the demands of the current environment. Through it all, we will continue to lead with our values. And I could not be more proud of the resiliency and strength that the team has demonstrated as we navigate these extraordinary circumstances together. I want to thank our incredible associates and supplier partners for their hard work and dedication to serve our customers and communities. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ted."

I, too, want to thank all our associates and supplier partners for their relentless focus on serving our customers. During the second quarter, we saw unprecedented levels of engagement from both our DIY and Pro customers. Our team satisfied the strong demand by working together in a flexible and agile manner while also prioritizing safety. 
As an example, we decided to cancel our annual Memorial Day event and adjust other spring events as we didn't want to drive even more traffic into already crowded areas of our store like garden and paint. We also removed most of our off-shelf merchandising displays in order to support social distancing. Our teams were incredibly flexible and worked in a cross-functional manner to coordinate changes. We altered marketing plans, social media, product flow, product selection and space allocation. Our merchants, suppliers, marketers, supply chain, merchandising execution and store teams remained agile throughout the quarter and focused on our customers. 
We are fortunate to have the best supplier partners in the business. Leveraging our tools and analytics, we worked together to make real-time adjustments to our assortments. In many instances, we introduced alternative products and reduced assortments to the highest demand SKUs that our partners could supply most effectively. As an example to support in-stock levels for high-demand items such as cleaning products, we worked with suppliers to streamline production on key products, sizes and fragrances. And as you heard from Craig, the investments we've made in our supply chain over the last decade allowed us to be more flexible than ever in flowing product to the right geographies. 
During the second quarter, 13 of our 14 merchandising departments posted double-digit comps in the quarter, led by our lumber department. Our kitchen and bath department posted high single-digit comps. During the quarter, comp average ticket increased 10.1%, and comp transactions increased 12.3%. The growth in our comp average ticket was driven by both an increase in basket size as well as customers trading up to new and innovative items. In addition, inflation in core commodity categories, like lumber, positively impacted our average ticket growth by approximately 61 basis points. The strength of our comp transaction growth was driven by consistently strong in-store and online transactions. 
During the second quarter, big-ticket comp transactions, or those over $1,000, were up approximately 16%. We saw very strong performance across a number of big-ticket categories like appliances, riding lawnmowers and patio furniture. However, this strength was partially offset by softer performance in certain indoor installation-heavy categories like special order kitchens and countertops. We saw strong sales growth with both our Pro and DIY customers, with DIY sales growing faster than Pro sales. Sales to our Pro customers accelerated meaningfully compared to the first quarter and grew double digits compared to the second quarter of last year. Looking deeper into our Pro sales, we saw notable strength with our smaller Pro customer. As markets continue to reopen, we see increasing demand from all our Pro customer cohorts. 
We continue to lean into our strategic investments to create a Pro ecosystem that encompasses professional-grade product, exclusive brands, enhanced delivery, credit, digital capabilities, field sales support, HD rental and more. We believe our differentiated ecosystem will continue to drive deeper engagement with our Pro customers. 
Turning to our DIY customers. Our DIY customers are reengaging with their home and with The Home Depot in a meaningful way, and they are engaging across the store. While we have seen strong demand with exterior projects like building decks, sheds, fences and gardens, we've also seen strong growth with interior projects like hard surface flooring, interior lighting and painting, to name a few. We firmly believe that our One Home Depot strategy is creating a best-in-class, interconnected shopping experience. We are building unique capabilities that let our customers engage across our digital platforms, our updated physical stores and our enhanced delivery experience. And our confidence in these new capabilities led us to change our tagline and marketing efforts to How Doers Get More Done. 
During the second quarter, new and existing customers set record levels of engagement across our new capabilities. The rate at which our existing customers are adopting new channels to engage with The Home Depot more than doubled year-to-date. And we also saw 1/3 of recently acquired customers reengage with The Home Depot for another purchase in a different department. During the second quarter, our mobile app saw a record number of downloads, and we saw significant growth in conversion rates across all digital platforms. These results confirm our belief that we have been making investments in the right areas of our business and that those investments are resonating with our customers. 
Let me give you an example to help illustrate our enhanced capabilities and options for customers. Over the last couple of years, we have enabled multiple fulfillment options, including Buy Online, Pick-up In Store with convenient pickup lockers; Buy Online, Deliver From Store with our express car and van delivery; and most recently, our curbside pick-up option. As customers accelerate their adoption of an interconnected shopping experience, we have seen increased usage of these different fulfillment options. During the second quarter, we saw triple-digit growth across all these platforms. 
Another example is our HD Home business. As part of our strategic investments over the last 3 years, we have been leaning into several home decor categories. As consumers shop fewer and fewer retailers, our research showed that our customers were increasingly looking to homedepot.com to help with project completers like room decor and textiles. We are investing to create a better, frictionless online shopping experience for decor. We are showcasing our collections, enabling shop-by-room and highlighting our capabilities and product offerings with HD Home. With record levels of traffic on homedepot.com, we have seen significant outsized sales growth with our HD Home assortment. 
All the investments across the business make us more flexible as we continue to navigate this fluid and dynamic situation. As we look to the back half of the year, we will be working with our supplier partners as well as our cross-functional teams to satisfy our customers' evolving home improvement needs. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard."

In the second quarter, total sales were $38.1 billion, a 23.4% increase from last year. Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted total sales growth by approximately $200 million. Our total company comps were positive 23.4% for the quarter, with positive comps of 24.6% in May, 25.7% in June, and 20.4% in July. Comps in the U.S. were positive 25% for the quarter with positive comps of 27.3% in May, 27.3% in June and 21% in July. 
As you heard from Craig and Ted, the strong demand we saw was broad-based with a high degree of performance uniformity among our 3 U.S. divisions and Canada. All 19 of our U.S. regions posted double-digit positive comps, and our Canadian business reported record sales. Mexico's performance was impacted by a lag in COVID-19 cases relative to the U.S. and Canada. And as a result, Mexico's performance was negative in the beginning of the quarter before turning to positive growth at the end of the quarter. 
In the second quarter, our gross margin was 34%, an increase of approximately 20 basis points from last year. The change in our gross margin was driven by several factors, including a benefit from a reduction of annual events during the quarter. This benefit was partially offset by the mix of products sold and pressure from shrink. 
During the second quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales of approximately 18.1% increased approximately 10 basis points compared to last year. Let me take a moment to comment on a few of our expense items. First, during the quarter, we continued to support our associates with enhanced benefits, which totaled approximately $480 million in the second quarter, resulting in 125 basis points of expense deleverage. Second, we incurred approximately $110 million of operational COVID-related expenses, including personal protective equipment for our associates and customers and enhanced cleaning of our stores, resulting in approximately 30 basis points of operating expense deleverage. Third, we recorded expenses related to our strategic investment plan of approximately $280 million, an increase of approximately $40 million compared to last year. 
We are committed to completing our strategic investments. However, given the priority around safety and the complexities of the operating environment we find ourselves in, we are deferring certain in-store investments and now expect some of the projects we initially earmarked for fiscal 2020 to be completed in fiscal 2021. 
And finally, during the second quarter, we showed strong expense control in all areas of the business and drove approximately 145 basis points of expense leverage. Included in this 145 basis points of leverage is approximately 90 basis points of pressure, driven by accrued bonus expense related to our significant outperformance for our biannual store Success Sharing program and store and field-based management bonuses for the first half. Our operating margin for the second quarter was approximately 15.9%, an increase of approximately 10 basis points from last year. Interest and other expense for the second quarter grew by $54 million to $337 million due primarily to higher long-term debt levels than 1 year ago. 
In the second quarter, our effective tax rate was 24.4% compared to 24.6% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Our diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $4.02, an increase of 26.8% compared to the second quarter of 2019. At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories declined $1.2 billion to $13.5 billion, driven by the significant and steady demand we saw during the quarter. Inventory turns were 6.1x, up from 5.1x last year. 
Moving on to capital allocation. While our long-term principle of returning excess capital to shareholders remains intact, we believe that in this unprecedented environment, it is appropriate for us to maintain a strong liquidity position. During the quarter, we invested approximately $445 million back into our business in the form of capital expenditures, and we repaid approximately $1.75 billion of long-term debt. We also paid $1.6 billion in dividends to our shareholders. 
Computed on the average beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 41.1%, down from 43.7% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. This decrease primarily reflects our decision to temporarily enhance our liquidity position, including the suspension of our share repurchase program back in March. Looking ahead through the first 2 weeks of August, comparable sales growth remains at levels similar to total company second quarter comp sales. 
Our customers tell us that they plan to continue to invest in a wide variety of projects to maintain and enhance their homes. However, given the degree of uncertainty in our external environment, we cannot extrapolate current observations to predict future performance. As a result, we are focused on operating with discipline and flexibility in order to grow market share regardless of what demand patterns emerge. And despite the significant uncertainty in the current environment, we do believe in the resilience of home improvement demand over the long term. The home typically represents our customers' largest asset. The housing stock is aging, and we believe the capabilities we are investing in across our interconnected platform will position us well to continue capturing market share in any environment.

The environment now is pretty fluid, and I'm sure you'd describe it as still competitive.

But you never really baked in the sales upside and by default, you never really promised or committed to more margin. Can you talk about -- does that change? And it's not about does margin go up over time, but does it create the potential for margins to trickle up over time?

So if you take a look at the approximately $480 million that we invested in enhanced benefits in the quarter, you take a look at that and say about $360 million of it would represent spend on benefits that continue into the third quarter, with the vast majority of that $360 million being in the form of weekly bonuses to associates. The remainder of that, the remaining $120 million that we expensed in Q2 represented benefits like enhanced overtime pay that have not continued into the third quarter. So again, of that second quarter, about $360 million continues in the third quarter. 
It's worth pointing out that in a 23% comp environment, there are more hours, there are more associates eligible for those weekly bonuses. We certainly were not planning at the beginning of the quarter for a 25% -- or 23% comp environment. So that number is going to naturally be a little bit higher in Q2 because of that. So that's the breakdown of our associate expense. And it's something that we review on a continuous basis. We think that, that expense was prudent and appropriate in the second quarter, and we'll continue to review it as circumstances develop."

They're up essentially about 115% vLY. 
But I would say a big piece of that was when COVID started, none of us knew where this was going to go, and the mills took a conservative approach and largely backed off harvesting trees and cutting logs. That product started up again about mid-quarter of Q2, and we're starting to see much better flow in lumber. So I'm not going to predict lumber prices, but with more supply coming into the marketplace, hopefully, we're going to obtain these $700 levels, although we do have substantial support with housing and all the projects that Craig referred to. Certainly in pressure-treated decking, just a robust decking boom. But we should see some moderation, but the unit demand, even with these higher prices, has remained double digit and incredibly strong. So we see strength into Q3, certainly right now.

But with all these new customers engaging across all The Home Depot capabilities, we're very closely watching reengagement rates.

What is their duration before there's a repeat engagement with a capability or indeed a purchase?

What we're seeing is that all generations are engaging, in Gen X and millennial. And when you start with that first DIY project, it may be a garden, it may be painting. Painting has traditionally been the #1 DIY project. And once you accomplish that first, more modest task, you gain confidence and you take on the next task and the next task and they become bigger. And then you need more sophisticated and broader breadth of tools to continue the more ambitious projects you're taking on. So this is what we saw with the baby boomer and the growth and the establishment of this industry. And the -- one of the -- the bigger medium and long-term benefits of this is we know that this next very, very large generation is a very active home improver."

That expense became material in the second quarter as we mandated them for our associates and our customers.

We hope that you and your loved ones are safe and healthy, and our thoughts and prayers continue to be with all of those that have been directly impacted by COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic and its impact have forced us to change the way we live, work and interact with each other. Though these tough times have been unquestionably challenging, as we mentioned in the first quarter, we have navigated this crisis by aligning our decisions and actions to some of our most important values: do the right thing and take care of our people. Our focus has been and continues to be on 2 key priorities: the safety and well-being of our associates and customers and providing our customers with the products and services they need at this time.
In the first quarter, we had to adjust our stores to an environment that promoted social and physical distancing, and we did this by implementing a change to store hours, limiting the number of customers in-store and eliminating traffic-driving events as well as operational changes like floor marking, signage and plexiglass shields. 
In the second quarter, we continued to adapt based on our learnings and ever-changing environment. Our team continues to work to promote a safe shopping environment. We made several adjustments in the quarter to our operating approach. First, we expanded our operating hours from 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. This action was taken to relieve the end-of-day bottlenecks we observed in some stores while we're operating under more restrictive hours. Second, we modified the national approach that we had in the first quarter to limit the number of customers in stores and now are taking a more localized approach by relying on our store managers and field teams to closely monitor safety and implement customer limits as needed. Third, we announced that mask or facial coverings are required for all associates and customers in our U.S. stores and other facilities. 
Given the ongoing demands and complexity of the current environment, we have continued to focus on taking care of our people by extending weekly bonuses for hourly associates in our stores and distribution centers. Through the second quarter, we have spent approximately $1.3 billion on enhanced associate pay and benefits in response to COVID-19. Additionally, the company's first half performance resulted in a record payout for Success Sharing, our profit-sharing program for our hourly associates. I'm incredibly proud of our associates for the many ways that they have lived our values by serving our customers, communities and each other during this unprecedented time. Our team has demonstrated ongoing flexibility to effectively operate in this dynamic environment, while also executing to deliver record-breaking sales. 
Sales for the second quarter were $38.1 billion, up 23.4% from last year. Comp sales were up 23.4% from last year with U.S. comps of positive 25%. Diluted earnings per share were $4.02 in the second quarter. These record results were driven by broad-based strength across our stores and geographies. As Ted will detail, both ticket and transactions were up double digit in the quarter, and we saw healthy growth from both our Pro and DIY customers. During the quarter, we saw customers take on projects throughout their homes, from deck building to painting projects, landscape work and home repairs due to increased wear and tear. Clearly, our customers engaged with home improvement in a meaningful way. 
That being said, as we discussed in the first quarter, we are cautious to extrapolate trends from the first half of the year into a forecast for the remaining of the year, particularly given the tremendous amount of uncertainty we face with regards to the duration and continued impacts of the virus. So while we can't predict the sales trajectory for the back half of the year, we do know that for many of our customers, the home has never been more important. 
Our recent customer survey work tells us that customers have a continued willingness to take on both indoor and outdoor projects in the near term. Customers are consolidating the number of retailers they visit and are blending the physical and digital elements of the shopping experience more than ever before. As a result, the distinct competitive advantages and overarching benefits of an interconnected One Home Depot strategy have never been more relevant. 
Our interconnected retail strategy and underlying technology infrastructures have supported record web traffic on a consistent basis for the past several months. Sales leveraging our digital platforms increased approximately 100% in the quarter, and more than 60% of the time our customers opted to pick up their order at a store. 
The accelerated growth of our interconnected and digital offerings has given us the opportunity to showcase, in a very condensed time frame, new capabilities in different ways to engage with The Home Depot that customers may not have been fully aware of. The rate at which customers are authenticating with us has also accelerated, which provides us with a unique opportunity to know our customers even better. This is critical as we continue on our journey to offer a deeper level of personalization and further enhance the interconnected shopping experience. 
That being said, the step change in demand across our digital platforms is not without its challenges, particularly from a delivery and fulfillment standpoint. We have been able to leverage investments we have made in the scale and flexibility of our supply chain network to relieve some of the pressure. This is exactly what we did during the quarter when we temporarily transitioned one of our recently opened market delivery centers, or MDCs, to a direct fulfillment center, or DFC, which primarily fulfills online orders. The investments that we have made in the underlying infrastructure and systems supporting the MDC, coupled with a strong cross-functional alignment across the organization, enabled us to make this conversion in just a few short weeks. The net result for our customers was the reduction in lead times for orders flowing from our direct fulfillment network. 
We are focused on continuing the momentum of our strategic investments to enhance the interconnected shopping experience and position ourselves for continued share capture over the long term. At the same time, we know that we must remain agile and flexible to execute against the demands of the current environment. Through it all, we will continue to lead with our values. And I could not be more proud of the resiliency and strength that the team has demonstrated as we navigate these extraordinary circumstances together. I want to thank our incredible associates and supplier partners for their hard work and dedication to serve our customers and communities. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ted."

I, too, want to thank all our associates and supplier partners for their relentless focus on serving our customers. During the second quarter, we saw unprecedented levels of engagement from both our DIY and Pro customers. Our team satisfied the strong demand by working together in a flexible and agile manner while also prioritizing safety. 
As an example, we decided to cancel our annual Memorial Day event and adjust other spring events as we didn't want to drive even more traffic into already crowded areas of our store like garden and paint. We also removed most of our off-shelf merchandising displays in order to support social distancing. Our teams were incredibly flexible and worked in a cross-functional manner to coordinate changes. We altered marketing plans, social media, product flow, product selection and space allocation. Our merchants, suppliers, marketers, supply chain, merchandising execution and store teams remained agile throughout the quarter and focused on our customers. 
We are fortunate to have the best supplier partners in the business. Leveraging our tools and analytics, we worked together to make real-time adjustments to our assortments. In many instances, we introduced alternative products and reduced assortments to the highest demand SKUs that our partners could supply most effectively. As an example to support in-stock levels for high-demand items such as cleaning products, we worked with suppliers to streamline production on key products, sizes and fragrances. And as you heard from Craig, the investments we've made in our supply chain over the last decade allowed us to be more flexible than ever in flowing product to the right geographies. 
During the second quarter, 13 of our 14 merchandising departments posted double-digit comps in the quarter, led by our lumber department. Our kitchen and bath department posted high single-digit comps. During the quarter, comp average ticket increased 10.1%, and comp transactions increased 12.3%. The growth in our comp average ticket was driven by both an increase in basket size as well as customers trading up to new and innovative items. In addition, inflation in core commodity categories, like lumber, positively impacted our average ticket growth by approximately 61 basis points. The strength of our comp transaction growth was driven by consistently strong in-store and online transactions. 
During the second quarter, big-ticket comp transactions, or those over $1,000, were up approximately 16%. We saw very strong performance across a number of big-ticket categories like appliances, riding lawnmowers and patio furniture. However, this strength was partially offset by softer performance in certain indoor installation-heavy categories like special order kitchens and countertops. We saw strong sales growth with both our Pro and DIY customers, with DIY sales growing faster than Pro sales. Sales to our Pro customers accelerated meaningfully compared to the first quarter and grew double digits compared to the second quarter of last year. Looking deeper into our Pro sales, we saw notable strength with our smaller Pro customer. As markets continue to reopen, we see increasing demand from all our Pro customer cohorts. 
We continue to lean into our strategic investments to create a Pro ecosystem that encompasses professional-grade product, exclusive brands, enhanced delivery, credit, digital capabilities, field sales support, HD rental and more. We believe our differentiated ecosystem will continue to drive deeper engagement with our Pro customers. 
Turning to our DIY customers. Our DIY customers are reengaging with their home and with The Home Depot in a meaningful way, and they are engaging across the store. While we have seen strong demand with exterior projects like building decks, sheds, fences and gardens, we've also seen strong growth with interior projects like hard surface flooring, interior lighting and painting, to name a few. We firmly believe that our One Home Depot strategy is creating a best-in-class, interconnected shopping experience. We are building unique capabilities that let our customers engage across our digital platforms, our updated physical stores and our enhanced delivery experience. And our confidence in these new capabilities led us to change our tagline and marketing efforts to How Doers Get More Done. 
During the second quarter, new and existing customers set record levels of engagement across our new capabilities. The rate at which our existing customers are adopting new channels to engage with The Home Depot more than doubled year-to-date. And we also saw 1/3 of recently acquired customers reengage with The Home Depot for another purchase in a different department. During the second quarter, our mobile app saw a record number of downloads, and we saw significant growth in conversion rates across all digital platforms. These results confirm our belief that we have been making investments in the right areas of our business and that those investments are resonating with our customers. 
Let me give you an example to help illustrate our enhanced capabilities and options for customers. Over the last couple of years, we have enabled multiple fulfillment options, including Buy Online, Pick-up In Store with convenient pickup lockers; Buy Online, Deliver From Store with our express car and van delivery; and most recently, our curbside pick-up option. As customers accelerate their adoption of an interconnected shopping experience, we have seen increased usage of these different fulfillment options. During the second quarter, we saw triple-digit growth across all these platforms. 
Another example is our HD Home business. As part of our strategic investments over the last 3 years, we have been leaning into several home decor categories. As consumers shop fewer and fewer retailers, our research showed that our customers were increasingly looking to homedepot.com to help with project completers like room decor and textiles. We are investing to create a better, frictionless online shopping experience for decor. We are showcasing our collections, enabling shop-by-room and highlighting our capabilities and product offerings with HD Home. With record levels of traffic on homedepot.com, we have seen significant outsized sales growth with our HD Home assortment. 
All the investments across the business make us more flexible as we continue to navigate this fluid and dynamic situation. As we look to the back half of the year, we will be working with our supplier partners as well as our cross-functional teams to satisfy our customers' evolving home improvement needs. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard."

In the second quarter, total sales were $38.1 billion, a 23.4% increase from last year. Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted total sales growth by approximately $200 million. Our total company comps were positive 23.4% for the quarter, with positive comps of 24.6% in May, 25.7% in June, and 20.4% in July. Comps in the U.S. were positive 25% for the quarter with positive comps of 27.3% in May, 27.3% in June and 21% in July. 
As you heard from Craig and Ted, the strong demand we saw was broad-based with a high degree of performance uniformity among our 3 U.S. divisions and Canada. All 19 of our U.S. regions posted double-digit positive comps, and our Canadian business reported record sales. Mexico's performance was impacted by a lag in COVID-19 cases relative to the U.S. and Canada. And as a result, Mexico's performance was negative in the beginning of the quarter before turning to positive growth at the end of the quarter. 
In the second quarter, our gross margin was 34%, an increase of approximately 20 basis points from last year. The change in our gross margin was driven by several factors, including a benefit from a reduction of annual events during the quarter. This benefit was partially offset by the mix of products sold and pressure from shrink. 
During the second quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales of approximately 18.1% increased approximately 10 basis points compared to last year. Let me take a moment to comment on a few of our expense items. First, during the quarter, we continued to support our associates with enhanced benefits, which totaled approximately $480 million in the second quarter, resulting in 125 basis points of expense deleverage. Second, we incurred approximately $110 million of operational COVID-related expenses, including personal protective equipment for our associates and customers and enhanced cleaning of our stores, resulting in approximately 30 basis points of operating expense deleverage. Third, we recorded expenses related to our strategic investment plan of approximately $280 million, an increase of approximately $40 million compared to last year. 
We are committed to completing our strategic investments. However, given the priority around safety and the complexities of the operating environment we find ourselves in, we are deferring certain in-store investments and now expect some of the projects we initially earmarked for fiscal 2020 to be completed in fiscal 2021. 
And finally, during the second quarter, we showed strong expense control in all areas of the business and drove approximately 145 basis points of expense leverage. Included in this 145 basis points of leverage is approximately 90 basis points of pressure, driven by accrued bonus expense related to our significant outperformance for our biannual store Success Sharing program and store and field-based management bonuses for the first half. Our operating margin for the second quarter was approximately 15.9%, an increase of approximately 10 basis points from last year. Interest and other expense for the second quarter grew by $54 million to $337 million due primarily to higher long-term debt levels than 1 year ago. 
In the second quarter, our effective tax rate was 24.4% compared to 24.6% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Our diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $4.02, an increase of 26.8% compared to the second quarter of 2019. At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories declined $1.2 billion to $13.5 billion, driven by the significant and steady demand we saw during the quarter. Inventory turns were 6.1x, up from 5.1x last year. 
Moving on to capital allocation. While our long-term principle of returning excess capital to shareholders remains intact, we believe that in this unprecedented environment, it is appropriate for us to maintain a strong liquidity position. During the quarter, we invested approximately $445 million back into our business in the form of capital expenditures, and we repaid approximately $1.75 billion of long-term debt. We also paid $1.6 billion in dividends to our shareholders. 
Computed on the average beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 41.1%, down from 43.7% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. This decrease primarily reflects our decision to temporarily enhance our liquidity position, including the suspension of our share repurchase program back in March. Looking ahead through the first 2 weeks of August, comparable sales growth remains at levels similar to total company second quarter comp sales. 
Our customers tell us that they plan to continue to invest in a wide variety of projects to maintain and enhance their homes. However, given the degree of uncertainty in our external environment, we cannot extrapolate current observations to predict future performance. As a result, we are focused on operating with discipline and flexibility in order to grow market share regardless of what demand patterns emerge. And despite the significant uncertainty in the current environment, we do believe in the resilience of home improvement demand over the long term. The home typically represents our customers' largest asset. The housing stock is aging, and we believe the capabilities we are investing in across our interconnected platform will position us well to continue capturing market share in any environment.

The environment now is pretty fluid, and I'm sure you'd describe it as still competitive. When you laid out the One HD plan, most of the plan was recouping some of the margin that you would be making to make investments.

They were less impacted with the downturn in Q1 but continued to rebound and accelerate in Q2. The high-spend Pro also continued to rebound, and I would see that as being an outcome of permitting and job inspections coming back online. There are areas where homeowners are becoming more comfortable with having Pros and service providers in their homes. 
There are some end markets that haven't totally recovered. I'll give you one example, and that would be multifamily property managers. Obviously, there are slower turns on the units. They have less access to the properties, and they still remain in more of a break-fix mode, holding back on major rehabs and capital projects.

So if you take a look at the approximately $480 million that we invested in enhanced benefits in the quarter, you take a look at that and say about $360 million of it would represent spend on benefits that continue into the third quarter, with the vast majority of that $360 million being in the form of weekly bonuses to associates. The remainder of that, the remaining $120 million that we expensed in Q2 represented benefits like enhanced overtime pay that have not continued into the third quarter. So again, of that second quarter, about $360 million continues in the third quarter. 
It's worth pointing out that in a 23% comp environment, there are more hours, there are more associates eligible for those weekly bonuses. We certainly were not planning at the beginning of the quarter for a 25% -- or 23% comp environment. So that number is going to naturally be a little bit higher in Q2 because of that. So that's the breakdown of our associate expense. And it's something that we review on a continuous basis.

But I would say a big piece of that was when COVID started, none of us knew where this was going to go, and the mills took a conservative approach and largely backed off harvesting trees and cutting logs. That product started up again about mid-quarter of Q2, and we're starting to see much better flow in lumber. So I'm not going to predict lumber prices, but with more supply coming into the marketplace, hopefully, we're going to obtain these $700 levels, although we do have substantial support with housing and all the projects that Craig referred to. Certainly in pressure-treated decking, just a robust decking boom. But we should see some moderation, but the unit demand, even with these higher prices, has remained double digit and incredibly strong. So we see strength into Q3, certainly right now.

So there were some comp benefit in categories like ACs and fans in June versus July when you do the year-over-year compare.

Because there have been questions for years now, would the Gen X and millennial engage to the same level of home improvement when you think The Home Depot had a big part in teaching the baby boomer to gain confidence and take on DIY. What we're seeing is that all generations are engaging, in Gen X and millennial. And when you start with that first DIY project, it may be a garden, it may be painting. Painting has traditionally been the #1 DIY project. And once you accomplish that first, more modest task, you gain confidence and you take on the next task and the next task and they become bigger. And then you need more sophisticated and broader breadth of tools to continue the more ambitious projects you're taking on. So this is what we saw with the baby boomer and the growth and the establishment of this industry. And the -- one of the -- the bigger medium and long-term benefits of this is we know that this next very, very large generation is a very active home improver."

We hope that you and your loved ones are safe and healthy. 
As we announced yesterday, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire HD Supply, a leading national distributor of maintenance, repair and operations products in the multifamily and hospitality end markets. Before moving to the results of the quarter, I want to take a moment to discuss how HD Supply fits into our strategic framework. 
As you know, the MRO customer is an important Pro customer for the Home Depot. We are committed to better serving the MRO customer and growing in this space. The success we've had with our existing MRO business makes us confident in our ability to accelerate sales growth in a highly fragmented $55 billion MRO marketplace. While the transaction is subject to customary regulatory approvals, I look forward to welcoming the HD Supply associates to The Home Depot. Richard will take you through the financial details shortly. 
Now let's discuss our third quarter results. Sales for the third quarter grew $6.3 billion to $33.5 billion, up 23.2% from last year. Comp sales were up 24.1% from last year, with U.S. comps of positive 24.6%. Diluted earnings per share were $3.18 in the third quarter. 
The third quarter was another exceptional quarter for The Home Depot as we saw the continuation of outsized demand for home improvement projects. Our results were driven by broad-based strength across the store and geographies. All of our top 40 markets posted double-digit comps while Canada posted comps above the company average, and Mexico posted its best performance since the onset of the pandemic with double-digit comps in local currency. As Ted will detail, both tickets and transactions were up double-digit in the quarter, and we saw strong double-digit growth from both the Pro and DIY customers. 
As we mentioned last quarter, the step change in volume of business that we have witnessed over the last 6 months is not without its challenges, but our strategic investments, coupled with our near-term actions taken, have allowed us to better serve our customers. Our third quarter performance is a reflection of this and as we continue to learn and adapt to meet the unprecedented level of demand we are seeing in the market. 
Actions we have taken across our supply chain, in our stores and in partnership with our suppliers have helped us to improve in-stock levels, reduce lead times, better manage in-store replenishment and improve fulfillment options and delivery times. All of this has ultimately translated to over 300 basis points of sequential improvement in customer satisfaction scores for the third quarter. 
Our interconnected retail strategy and underlying technology infrastructure has continued to support record-level web traffic on a consistent basis for over 6 months. Sales leveraging our digital platforms increased approximately 80% versus the third quarter last year, and approximately 60% of online orders were fulfilled through a store. 
We continue to invest in our digital assets, introducing new capabilities in different ways to engage with The Home Depot. Over the past several months, we have refreshed the digital experience in key categories and are extremely pleased with the customer response. In decorative lighting, for example, we enhanced the category experience to offer improved visual imaging and more lifestyle photos of our on-trend lighting assortment. As a result of these changes and increased marketing effort to better highlight our offering, we have seen significantly higher customer engagement with the category online, which helped to drive sales growth above the company average in the quarter. 
We also found new ways to leverage our online platform to better showcase our assortment for events. For our Halloween event, we increased our digital offering and enhanced our presentation, which resonated with our customers, resulting in the strongest customer response we've had to these events. 
We are focused on continuing the momentum of our strategic investments to enhance the interconnected shopping experience and position ourselves for continued share capture over the long term. Key components of our One Home Depot strategy such as opening various supply chain facilities, technology investments and enhancements to the digital experience remain on track. And we have now restarted many of the store investments that were paused at the onset of the pandemic. 
Our results through the first 9 months of the year clearly indicate that for many customers, the home has never been more important. And we hear from them that they will continue to invest in home improvement through a multitude of different projects and plan to embrace the upcoming holiday season. 
As customers engage with The Home Depot, we see a continued blend of both the physical and digital worlds. As a result, the distinct competitive advantages and overarching benefits of an interconnected One Home Depot strategy have never been more relevant. 
I'm incredibly proud of our associates for the many ways that they have lived our values by serving our customers, communities and each other during these unquestionably challenging times. Our ability to grow the business by more than $15 billion through the first 9 months of the year while navigating the global pandemic and supporting our communities through multiple natural disasters is a direct result of our associates' extraordinary efforts. 
Given the ongoing demands and complexity of the current environment, we continue to focus on taking care of our people, in part by extending weekly bonuses for hourly associates in our stores and distribution centers for the duration of the third quarter. Through the end of the third quarter, we have spent approximately $1.7 billion on temporary pay and benefits in response to COVID-19. 
As Richard will discuss, we have now made the decision to transition from our temporary weekly bonus program to invest in permanent compensation enhancements for our frontline hourly associates. This will result in approximately $1 billion of incremental compensation expense on an annualized basis. Our orange-aproned associates are the heartbeat of The Home Depot, and supporting them through this time of uncertainty and beyond continues to be a key priority. 
We know that we must remain agile and flexible to execute against the demands of the current environment. And our third quarter performance highlights key progress that we have made as we continue to learn and adapt. I could not be more proud of the resilience and strength that our associates have continued to demonstrate. And I want to thank them and our supplier partners for their hard work and dedication to serving our customers and communities. 
And finally, I want to take a quick moment to congratulate Ted, Ann-Marie and Jeff, who are on the call with me today, on their recent promotions and expanded responsibilities. Their new roles are among a number of leadership development moves that we have made as we continue to invest and grow the deep bench of talent that we are fortunate to have here at The Home Depot. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ted."

I want to thank all of our associates and supplier partners for their incredible effort to serve our customers in this unprecedented environment. The consistently strong demand we've seen over the last 6 months",1140,"Thanks, Craig, and good morning, everyone. I want to thank all of our associates and supplier partners for their incredible effort to serve our customers in this unprecedented environment. 
The consistently strong demand we've seen over the last 6 months has been remarkable. For the last 2 quarters, we have seen comps north of 20% for 25 of the 26 weeks. The strong demand has pressured supply chains. We partnered with our supplier partners to make various improvements. As we mentioned last quarter, the actions we took include adjusting our assortments and planograms, introducing alternative products and in some cases, reducing the number of SKUs in certain categories to focus on the highest demand products. 
In addition, we are further recognizing our rapid deployment center network that now implemented mechanized floor loading in 2/3 of our facilities, meaningfully improving our productivity in those buildings. As a result of all these actions, we have seen reduced product lead times and continued improvement in our in-stock positions. The in-stock level in our U.S. stores has improved for 12 straight weeks. 
While we are pleased with these results, we are not at prepandemic levels. We have also revisited customer fulfillment choices, some of which we paused earlier in the year. As a result, we are starting to reestablish premium delivery windows and express car and van delivery service that covers over 70% of the U.S. population. 
During the third quarter, each of our merchandising departments posted double-digit comps led by our lumber and decor and storage departments. Our comp average ticket increased 10%, and comp transactions increased 13%. The growth in our comp average ticket was driven primarily by the continuation of project demand we saw in the second quarter, customers trading up to new and innovative items as well as inflation in certain commodity categories like lumber. 
Over the last 4 months, we've seen significant volatility in the pricing of lumber as the industry works to balance supply and demand. During the third quarter, the average price of framing lumber was approximately 130% higher than the same period last year. 
As we exited the quarter, pricing for certain lumber categories had fallen from the peaks we saw mid-quarter but still sit well above the levels we saw this time last year. Despite this significant inflation, we saw strong double-digit comps in lumber in the third quarter. 
During the third quarter, inflation from core commodity categories positively impacted our average ticket growth by approximately 260 basis points. Additionally, the strength of our comp transaction growth was driven by consistently strong in-store and online transactions, continuing the same trends we saw in the second quarter. 
During the third quarter, big-ticket comp transactions or those over $1,000 were up approximately 23%. We saw strong performance across a number of big-ticket categories like appliances, vinyl plank flooring and lumber. 
During the third quarter, we saw double-digit growth with both our Pro and DIY customers. And while DIY sales grew faster than Pro sales, our Pro business posted the strongest growth we've seen all year. 
As we look at our different Pro cohorts, growth with our smaller Pro customers has been consistent with strong double-digit growth every month of the year. Growth with our larger Pro customers is healthy and accelerated from the second quarter. However, some large Pros still face headwinds related to the current operating environment, including some customers being hesitant to invite Pros into their homes. 
Turning to our DIY customers. We continue to see unprecedented levels of engagement from both new and existing customers across a variety of home improvement projects. And importantly, as these customers complete a project, they are gaining the confidence to tackle their next project and reengage with The Home Depot. 
During the third quarter, we saw customers take advantage of an extended selling season for our garden seasonal categories, resulting in significant growth in categories like hardscapes, soils, riding mowers and outdoor power equipment. However, garden seasonal were not the only projects our customers were working on. If we exclude our garden departments from our third quarter results, our comp was still north of 20%. 
We saw customers working on a variety of projects across their home with categories like garage organization, ceiling fans, vanities and power tools all posting comps well above the company average. The customer engagement we are seeing was also evident in our annual Halloween event. During the third quarter, we hosted our most successful Halloween event with both in-store and online offerings. Customers responded to our larger assortment of animatronics and [ bells ] and yard decor as evidenced by our 12-foot giant skeleton that sold out before October, helping drive a record level of sell-through for the event. 
As we turn our attention to the fourth quarter, we are excited about the upcoming holiday season and believe we are in a great position for continued customer engagement. During the quarter, we will be hosting our annual holiday, Black Friday and gift center events. However, this year, they're going to look a little different as we remain committed to prioritizing the health and safety of our customers and associates and promoting a safe shopping environment. 
We've adjusted our Black Friday event this year to cover an extended period of time and not just focus on 1 day. Additionally, for both our Black Friday and our gift center events, we've reorganized how we place and stage our product to assist with social distancing. For example, we've reduced the amount of product displayed on our front race track, and we've created more space for our gift center presentation. We've made deeper buys on fewer SKUs to bring great values to our customers. And we've also included some of our core SKUs in our event, which will help with replenishment as we continue to see strong comps. 
For example, featured in our gift center and Black Friday events this year are exclusive power tool products from our industry-leading assortment of Milwaukee, Makita, DEWALT, RIDGID, RYOBI and more. This year, we are especially excited about the launch of RYOBI 18 Volt 1 Plus HP brushes tools. These tools have been designed from the ground up to serve our DIY and Pro customers with more features and performance than ever. HP tools are up to 20% lighter and 30% more compact while delivering improved power and durability with brushless motors. The RYOBI 1 Plus platform has more than 100 million batteries in our customers' homes and job sites today. And this new HP lineup brings a strong pipeline of future innovation to the more than 175 RYOBI 1 Plus tools in the marketplace today. 
Our Black Friday and gift center events kicked off a little over a week ago. And we are thrilled with the early results. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard."

We appreciate everyone joining the call today, and we hope you and your loved ones are safe and healthy. In the third quarter, total sales were $33.5 billion, a 23.2% increase from last year. Foreign exchange",1201,"Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate everyone joining the call today, and we hope you and your loved ones are safe and healthy. 
In the third quarter, total sales were $33.5 billion, a 23.2% increase from last year. Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted total sales growth by approximately $100 million. 
Our total company comps were positive 24.1% for the quarter with positive comps of 21.8% in August, 27.8% in September and 23% in October. Comps in the U.S. were positive 24.6% for the quarter with positive comps of 22.6% in August, 28.5% in September and 23% in October. 
Our comps in August and September of this year were impacted by a shift in our Labor Day event. This year, our Labor Day event fell in fiscal September, and last year, it fell in fiscal August. If we adjust for this shift, our monthly comps in the U.S. would be 24.7% in August and 26.4% in September. All 19 of our U.S. regions as well as Canada and Mexico posted double-digit positive comps in local currency. 
In the third quarter, our gross margin was 34.2%, a decrease of approximately 30 basis points from last year. Gross margin was negatively impacted during the quarter by several factors, including product mix and pressure from shrink. Mix pressure from lumber alone negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 35 basis points in the third quarter. The decline in gross margin was partially offset by the benefit of reduced promotional events during the quarter. During the third quarter, operating expenses were approximately 19.7% of sales, representing a decrease of approximately 30 basis points compared to last year. 
Let me take a moment to comment on a few of our expense items. First, during the quarter, we continued to support our associates with enhanced benefits in response to COVID-19, which totaled approximately $355 million, resulting in approximately 105 basis points of expense deleverage. 
As you heard earlier from Craig, through the end of the third quarter, we have spent approximately $1.7 billion on enhanced associate pay and benefits in response to COVID-19. We've also made the decision to transition from our temporary weekly bonus program to permanent compensation enhancements for our frontline hourly associates. This will result in approximately $1 billion of incremental expense on an annual basis. We began making these adjustments in the third quarter, and we'll continue to make the majority of them in the fourth quarter on a market-by-market basis. 
Second, we incurred approximately $60 million of operational COVID-related expenses, including personal protective equipment for our associates and customers and enhanced cleaning of our stores, resulting in approximately 20 basis points of operating expense deleverage. 
Third, we recorded expenses related to our strategic investment plan of approximately $325 million, an increase of approximately $48 million compared to last year. 
And finally, during the third quarter, we showed strong expense control in other areas of the business and drove approximately 155 basis points of expense leverage. Included in this 155 basis points of leverage is approximately 70 basis points of pressure driven by accrued bonus expense primarily related to our current outperformance for our biannual store Success Sharing program and store and field-based management bonuses for the second half. The Success Sharing and store and field-based management bonuses are in addition to the $1.7 billion of enhanced pay and benefits in response to COVID-19. 
Our operating margin for the third quarter was approximately 14.5%, flat with the same period last year. Interest and other expense for the third quarter grew by $49 million to $329 million due primarily to higher long-term debt levels compared to 1 year ago. In the third quarter, our effective tax rate was 24.1% compared to 24.5% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. Our diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $3.18, an increase of 25.7% compared to the third quarter of 2019. 
At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories were $16.2 billion, an increase of $444 million versus last year. And inventory turns were 5.9x, up from 5x from the same period last year. 
Moving on to capital allocation. Our long-term principles for how we think about deploying capital have not changed. After investing in the business, it is our intent to return excess cash to shareholders through a balanced approach of paying a healthy dividend and through share repurchases. 
Let's take a moment to talk about our first priority. We are committed to reinvesting in the business to drive growth faster than the market, and the acquisition of HD Supply strategically positions us to drive accelerated sales growth in a highly fragmented MRO space. 
Under the terms of the merger agreement, a subsidiary of The Home Depot will commence a cash tender offer to purchase all outstanding shares of HD Supply common stock for $56 per share for a total enterprise value, including net cash, of approximately $8 billion. The closing of the tender offer is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the tender of a majority of the shares of HD Supply common stock then outstanding on a fully diluted basis and is expected to be completed during The Hone Depot's fiscal fourth quarter, which ends on January 31, 2021. 
We plan to finance the acquisition with cash on hand and new debt. We also expect the transaction to be accretive to EPS in fiscal 2021, with potential for significant shareholder value creation over the long term. 
During the quarter, we invested approximately $470 million back into our business in the form of capital expenditures and paid $1.6 billion in dividends to our shareholders. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 41.6%, down from 45.1% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. This decrease primarily reflects our decision to temporarily enhance our liquidity position, including the suspension of our share repurchase program back in March. 
Turning to the macro environment. The strong demand we've seen has continued. Comps have slightly accelerated in the first 2 weeks of November, reflecting an earlier start for our Black Friday and holiday events versus last year. We are encouraged by consumer sentiment and consumption trends, which show home improvement receiving more than its historical share of consumer spending. 
Housing metrics are significantly stronger than when we entered this crisis. Turnover is rising. We see continued growth in household formation, and home prices are appreciating as inventory on the market hovers near record lows. Our customers tell us their homes have never been more important, and they intend to continue their investment in the improvement of their homes. 
While the current demand environment is strong, it is important to remember that we are not through the COVID-19 pandemic. And we do not think it is prudent to extrapolate recent trends to predict future performance. Our main focus remains on meeting our customers' needs while prioritizing safety. And we believe that the investments we have made over the last several years have uniquely positioned us to capture market share regardless of the environment. 
Thank you for your participation in today's call, and we are now ready for questions."

We are transitioning the nature of those investments into permanent wage investments during the fourth quarter. 
So if you think about the fourth quarter, we're not going to quite be down to that $1 billion annualized run rate of some of these programs into the beginning of the fourth quarter. It will be lower than the third quarter run rate. But add it to $1.7 billion and say that 2020 will likely end at a total of $2 billion of investments in our associates.

That would have likely been more of a Q2 impact for us because we did go in with a little more conservative approach when the pandemic hit. As you know, we limited customer hours, limited customer accounts, and we also pulled back a bit on inventory. 
Since that time, though, between the merchandising team and the supply chain team and the sourcing teams and transportation team, they really have just done an incredible effort flowing product into the store. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we improved in-stock levels every week of the quarter. Our inventory grew over $400 million from the prior year. That was our first year-over-year increase that we had seen this year. 
And in pure volume, if you look at our accounts payable, that gives you an indication of how much goods we have flown into the buildings. It's over $3 billion from our low point. So the in-stocks still are not exactly where we'd like them to be but incredible improvement. And the work the merchants have done, even though the in-stocks still have some ways to go by working on the right SKUs with our supplier partners, updating planograms and the like, where -- we believe we have the product and the type of items in the store that our customers are looking for. 
As it relates to online trends, you're absolutely right. Our online business, we couldn't be happier with the performance of our digital assets. And remember, we are an interconnected business. So with everything I'm about to say, remember that over 60-odd percent of our goods are picked up in our store. Nonetheless, our interconnected business grew by 80%. The penetration was 13% to the business. The sales, that translates to nearly $2 billion of sales growth in the quarter for our online business. 
Our visits are up dramatically. We're up in mobile, desktop, mobile web. Our conversion is up despite the hyper growth in app and mobile web that tend to have lower conversion rates than desktop. Our app downloads are way up. Our active app users are way up. Our orders are up. Our my account, these are folks who are setting up an account with Home Depot, so obviously we know them better when they set up an account, are way up. Millennials are highly engaged with The Home Depot. 
You asked about customer profile. Our Pros are highly engaged. Our B2B website is seeing record volumes and engagement with our Pro customer. So I'll stop there, but it is a robust interconnected digital environment right now with The Home Depot."

We hope that you and your loved ones are safe and healthy.  
As we announced yesterday, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire HD Supply, a leading national distributor of maintenance, repair and operations products in the multifamily and hospitality end markets. Before moving to the results of the quarter, I want to take a moment to discuss how HD Supply fits into our strategic framework.  
As you know, the MRO customer is an important Pro customer for the Home Depot. We are committed to better serving the MRO customer and growing in this space. The success we've had with our existing MRO business makes us confident in our ability to accelerate sales growth in a highly fragmented $55 billion MRO marketplace. While the transaction is subject to customary regulatory approvals, I look forward to welcoming the HD Supply associates to The Home Depot. Richard will take you through the financial details shortly.  
Now let's discuss our third quarter results. Sales for the third quarter grew $6.3 billion to $33.5 billion, up 23.2% from last year. Comp sales were up 24.1% from last year, with U.S. comps a positive 24.6%. Diluted earnings per share were $3.18 in the third quarter.  
The third quarter was another exceptional quarter for The Home Depot as we saw the continuation of outsized demand for home improvement projects. Our results were driven by broad-based strength across the store and geographies. 
All of our top 40 markets posted double-digit comps, while Canada posted comps above the company average, and Mexico posted its best performance since the onset of the pandemic with double-digit comps in local currency. As Ted will detail, both tickets and transactions were up double-digit in the quarter, and we saw strong double-digit growth from both the Pro and DIY customers.  
As we mentioned last quarter, the step change in volume of business that we have witnessed over the last 6 months is not without its challenges, but our strategic investments, coupled with our near-term actions taken, have allowed us to better serve our customers. Our third quarter performance is a reflection of this, and as we continue to learn and adapt to meet the unprecedented level of demand we are seeing in the market.  
Actions we have taken across our supply chain, in our stores and in partnership with our suppliers have helped us to improve in-stock levels, reduce lead times, better manage in-store replenishment and improve fulfillment options and delivery times. All of this has ultimately translated to over 300 basis points of sequential improvement in customer satisfaction scores for the third quarter.  
Our interconnected retail strategy and underlying technology infrastructure have continued to support record-level web traffic on a consistent basis for over 6 months. Sales leveraging our digital platforms increased approximately 80% versus the third quarter last year, and approximately 60% of online orders were fulfilled through a store. We continue to invest in our digital assets, introducing new capabilities and different ways to engage with The Home Depot. 
Over the past several months, we have refreshed the digital experience in key categories and are extremely pleased with the customer response. In decorative lighting, for example, we enhanced the category experience to offer improved visual imaging and more lifestyle photos of our on-trend lighting assortment. As a result of these changes and increased marketing effort to better highlight our offering, we have seen significantly higher customer engagement with the category online, which helped to drive sales growth above the company average in the quarter. 
We also found new ways to leverage our online platform to better showcase our assortment for events. For our Halloween event, we increased our digital offering and enhanced our presentation, which resonated with our customers, resulting in the strongest customer response we've had to these events. 
We are focused on continuing the momentum of our strategic investments to enhance the interconnected shopping experience and position ourselves for continued share capture over the long term. Key components of our One Home Depot strategy, such as opening various supply chain facilities, technology investments and enhancements to the digital experience, remain on track. And we have now restarted many of the store investments that were paused at the onset of the pandemic. 
Our results through the first 9 months of the year clearly indicate that for many customers, the home has never been more important. And we hear from them that they will continue to invest in home improvement through a multitude of different projects and plan to embrace the upcoming holiday season.
As customers engage with The Home Depot, we see a continued blend of both the physical and digital worlds. As a result, the distinct competitive advantages and overarching benefits of an interconnected One Home Depot strategy have never been more relevant.  
I'm incredibly proud of our associates for the many ways that they have lived our values by serving our customers, communities and each other during these unquestionably challenging times. Our ability to grow the business by more than $15 billion through the first 9 months of the year while navigating the global pandemic and supporting our communities through multiple natural disasters is a direct result of our associates' extraordinary efforts.  
Given the ongoing demands and complexity of the current environment, we continue to focus on taking care of our people, in part by extending weekly bonuses for hourly associates in our stores and distribution centers for the duration of the third quarter. Through the end of the third quarter, we have spent approximately $1.7 billion on temporary pay and benefits in response to COVID-19.  
As Richard will discuss, we have now made the decision to transition from our temporary weekly bonus program to invest in permanent compensation enhancements for our frontline hourly associates. This will result in approximately $1 billion of incremental compensation expense on an annualized basis. Our orange-aproned associates are the heartbeat of The Home Depot, and supporting them through this time of uncertainty and beyond continues to be a key priority.  
We know that we must remain agile and flexible to execute against the demands of the current environment. And our third quarter performance highlights key progress that we have made as we continue to learn and adapt. I could not be more proud of the resilience and strength that our associates have continued to demonstrate, and I want to thank them and our supplier partners for their hard work and dedication to serving our customers and communities.  
And finally, I want to take a quick moment to congratulate Ted, Ann-Marie and Jeff, who are on the call with me today, on their recent promotions and expanded responsibilities. Their new roles are among a number of leadership development moves that we have made as we continue to invest and grow the deep bench of talent that we are fortunate to have here at The Home Depot.  
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ted."
278679,693849568,2144549,"The Home Depot, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 17, 2020",2020-11-17,"Earnings Calls","The Home Depot, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Craig, and good morning, everyone. I want to thank all of our associates and supplier partners for their incredible effort to serve our customers in this unprecedented environment.  The consistently strong demand we've seen over the last 6 month",1135,"Thanks, Craig, and good morning, everyone. I want to thank all of our associates and supplier partners for their incredible effort to serve our customers in this unprecedented environment.  
The consistently strong demand we've seen over the last 6 months has been remarkable. For the last 2 quarters, we have seen comps north of 20% for 25 of the 26 weeks. The strong demand has pressured supply chains, and we partnered with our supplier partners to make various improvements. As we mentioned last quarter, the actions we took include adjusting our assortments and planograms, introducing alternative products and, in some cases, reducing the number of SKUs in certain categories to focus on the highest demand products.  
In addition, we are further recognizing our rapid deployment center network that now implemented mechanized floor loading in 2/3 of our facilities, meaningfully improving our productivity in those buildings. As a result of all these actions, we have seen reduced product lead times and continued improvement in our in-stock positions. The in-stock level in our U.S. stores has improved for 12 straight weeks. While we are pleased with these results, we are not at prepandemic levels. 
We have also revisited customer fulfillment choices, some of which we paused earlier in the year. As a result, we are starting to reestablish premium delivery windows and expressed car and van delivery service that covers over 70% of the U.S. population.  
During the third quarter, each of our merchandising departments posted double-digit comps led by our lumber and decor and storage departments. Our comp average ticket increased 10% and comp transactions increased 13%. The growth in our comp average ticket was driven primarily by the continuation of project demand we saw in the second quarter, customers trading up to new and innovative items as well as inflation in certain commodity categories like lumber.  
Over the last 4 months, we've seen significant volatility in the pricing of lumber as the industry works to balance supply and demand. During the third quarter, the average price of framing lumber was approximately 130% higher than the same period last year. As we exited the quarter, pricing for certain lumber categories had fallen from the peaks we saw mid-quarter but still sit well above the levels we saw this time last year. Despite this significant inflation, we saw strong double-digit comps in lumber in the third quarter.  
During the third quarter, inflation from core commodity categories positively impacted our average ticket growth by approximately 260 basis points. Additionally, the strength of our comp transaction growth was driven by consistently strong in-store and online transactions, continuing the same trends we saw in the second quarter.  
During the third quarter, big ticket comp transactions or those over $1,000 were up approximately 23%. We saw strong performance across a number of big-ticket categories like appliances, vinyl plank flooring and lumber.  
During the third quarter, we saw double-digit growth with both our Pro and DIY customers. And while DIY sales grew faster than Pro sales, our Pro business posted the strongest growth we've seen all year.  
As we look at our different Pro cohorts, growth with our smaller Pro customers has been consistent with strong double-digit growth every month of the year. Growth with our larger Pro customers is healthy and accelerated from the second quarter. However, some large Pros still face headwinds related to the current operating environment, including some customers being hesitant to invite Pros into their homes.  
Turning to our DIY customers. We continue to see unprecedented levels of engagement from both new and existing customers across a variety of home improvement projects. And importantly, as these customers complete a project, they are gaining the confidence to tackle their next project and reengage with The Home Depot.  
During the third quarter, we saw customers take advantage of an extended selling season for our garden seasonal categories, resulting in significant growth in categories like hardscapes, soils, riding mowers and outdoor power equipment. However, garden seasonal were not the only projects our customers were working on. If we exclude our garden departments from our third quarter results, our comp was still north of 20%.  
We saw customers working on a variety of projects across their home, with categories like garage organization, ceiling fans, vanities and power tools all posting comps well above the company average. The customer engagement we are seeing was also evident in our annual Halloween event. During the third quarter, we hosted our most successful Halloween event with both in-store and online offerings. Customers responded to our larger assortment of animatronics, inflatables and yard decor as evidenced by our 12-foot giant skeleton that sold out before October, helping drive a record level of sell-through for the event.  
As we turn our attention to the fourth quarter, we are excited about the upcoming holiday season and believe we are in a great position for continued customer engagement. During the quarter, we will be hosting our annual holiday, Black Friday and gift center events. However, this year, they're going to look a little different as we remain committed to prioritizing the health and safety of our customers and associates, and promoting a safe shopping environment.  
We've adjusted our Black Friday event this year to cover an extended period of time and not just focus on 1 day. Additionally, for both our Black Friday and our gift center events, we've reorganized how we place and stage our product to assist with social distancing. For example, we've reduced the amount of product displayed on our front race track, and we've created more space for our gift center presentation. We've made deeper buys on fewer SKUs to bring great values to our customers. And we've also included some of our core SKUs in our event, which will help with replenishment as we continue to see strong comps.  
For example, featured in our gift center and Black Friday events this year are exclusive power tool products from our industry-leading assortment of Milwaukee, Makita, DEWALT, RIDGID, RYOBI and more. This year, we are especially excited about the launch of RYOBI 18-Volt ONE+ HP brushless tools. These tools have been designed from the ground up to serve our DIY and Pro customers with more features and performance than ever. 
HP tools are up to 20% lighter and 30% more compact while delivering improved power and durability with brushless motors. The RYOBI ONE+ platform has more than 100 million batteries in our customers' homes and job sites today. And this new HP lineup brings a strong pipeline of future innovation to the more than 175 RYOBI ONE+ tools in the marketplace today. Our Black Friday and gift center events kicked off a little over a week ago, and we are thrilled with the early results.  
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard."

We appreciate everyone joining the call today, and we hope you and your loved ones are safe and healthy.  In the third quarter, total sales were $33.5 billion, a 23.2% increase from last year. Foreign exchange",1201,"Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate everyone joining the call today, and we hope you and your loved ones are safe and healthy.  
In the third quarter, total sales were $33.5 billion, a 23.2% increase from last year. Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted total sales growth by approximately $100 million. Our total company comps were positive 24.1% for the quarter, with positive comps of 21.8% in August, 27.8% in September and 23% in October. Comps in the U.S. were positive 24.6% for the quarter, with positive comps of 22.6% in August, 28.5% in September and 23% in October.
Our comps in August and September of this year were impacted by a shift in our Labor Day event. This year, our Labor Day event fell in fiscal September, and last year, it fell in fiscal August. If we adjust for this shift, our monthly comps in the U.S. would be 24.7% in August and 26.4% in September. All 19 of our U.S. regions, as well as Canada and Mexico, posted double-digit positive comps in local currency.  
In the third quarter, our gross margin was 34.2%, a decrease of approximately 30 basis points from last year. Gross margin was negatively impacted during the quarter by several factors, including product mix and pressure from shrink. Mix pressure from lumber alone negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 35 basis points in the third quarter. The decline in gross margin was partially offset by the benefit of reduced promotional events during the quarter. 
During the third quarter, operating expenses were approximately 19.7% of sales, representing a decrease of approximately 30 basis points compared to last year.  
Let me take a moment to comment on a few of our expense items. First, during the quarter, we continued to support our associates with enhanced benefits in response to COVID-19, which totaled approximately $355 million, resulting in approximately 105 basis points of expense deleverage.  
As you heard earlier from Craig, through the end of the third quarter, we have spent approximately $1.7 billion on enhanced associate pay and benefits in response to COVID-19. We've also made the decision to transition from our temporary weekly bonus program to permanent compensation enhancements for our frontline hourly associates. This will result in approximately $1 billion of incremental expense on an annual basis. We began making these adjustments in the third quarter, and we'll continue to make the majority of them in the fourth quarter on a market-by-market basis.  
Second, we incurred approximately $60 million of operational COVID-related expenses, including personal protective equipment for our associates and customers and enhanced cleaning of our stores, resulting in approximately 20 basis points of operating expense deleverage.  
Third, we recorded expenses related to our strategic investment plan of approximately $325 million, an increase of approximately $48 million compared to last year.  
And finally, during the third quarter, we showed strong expense control in other areas of the business and drove approximately 155 basis points of expense leverage. 
Included in this 155 basis points of leverage is approximately 70 basis points of pressure driven by accrued bonus expense primarily related to our current outperformance for our biannual store Success Sharing program and store- and field-based management bonuses for the second half. The Success Sharing and store and field-based management bonuses are in addition to the $1.7 billion of enhanced pay and benefits in response to COVID-19.  
Our operating margin for the third quarter was approximately 14.5%, flat with the same period last year. Interest and other expense for the third quarter grew by $49 million to $329 million due primarily to higher long-term debt levels compared to 1 year ago. 
In the third quarter, our effective tax rate was 24.1% compared to 24.5% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. Our diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $3.18, an increase of 25.7% compared to the third quarter of 2019.  
At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories were $16.2 billion, an increase of $444 million versus last year. And inventory turns were 5.9x, up from 5x from the same period last year.  
Moving on to capital allocation. Our long-term principles for how we think about deploying capital have not changed. After investing in the business, it is our intent to return excess cash to shareholders through a balanced approach of paying a healthy dividend and through share repurchases.  
Let's take a moment to talk about our first priority. We are committed to reinvesting in the business to drive growth faster than the market, and the acquisition of HD Supply strategically positions us to drive accelerated sales growth in a highly fragmented MRO space. 
Under the terms of the merger agreement, a subsidiary of The Home Depot will commence a cash tender offer to purchase all outstanding shares of HD Supply common stock for $56 per share for a total enterprise value, including net cash, of approximately $8 billion. 
The closing of the tender offer is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the tender of the majority of the shares of HD Supply common stock then outstanding on a fully diluted basis and is expected to be completed during The Home Depot's fiscal fourth quarter, which ends on January 31, 2021.  
We plan to finance the acquisition with cash on hand and new debt. We also expect the transaction to be accretive to EPS in fiscal 2021, with potential for significant shareholder value creation over the long term. During the quarter, we invested approximately $470 million back into our business in the form of capital expenditures and paid $1.6 billion in dividends to our shareholders. 
Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 41.6%, down from 45.1% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. This decrease primarily reflects our decision to temporarily enhance our liquidity position, including the suspension of our share repurchase program back in March.  
Turning to the macro environment. The strong demand we've seen has continued. Comps have slightly accelerated in the first 2 weeks of November, reflecting an earlier start for our Black Friday and holiday events versus last year. We are encouraged by consumer sentiment and consumption trends, which show home improvement receiving more than its historical share of consumer spending.  
Housing metrics are significantly stronger than when we entered this crisis. Turnover is rising, we see continued growth in household formation and home prices are appreciating as inventory on the market hovers near record lows. Our customers tell us their homes have never been more important, and they intend to continue their investment in the improvement of their homes.  
While the current demand environment is strong, it is important to remember that we are not through the COVID-19 pandemic. And we do not think it is prudent to extrapolate recent trends to predict future performance. Our main focus remains on meeting our customers' needs while prioritizing safety. And we believe that the investments we have made over the last several years have uniquely positioned us to capture market share regardless of the environment.  
Thank you for your participation in today's call, and we are now ready for questions."

We started the year with a CapEx plan of approximately $2.8 billion. We have deferred less than $0.5 billion. And so while I won't give you an exact number, I would say we will see deferral of, call it, $300 million to $400 million from our original plans in 2020.

I think one thing I will just make sure that we clarify is how the shape of our investments to support our associates goes from 2020 into '21. So as we said, our expenses through the first 3 quarters of the year in support of our associates totaled approximately $1.7 billion. We are transitioning the nature of those investments into permanent wage investments during the fourth quarter. 
So if you think about the fourth quarter, we're not going to quite be down to that $1 billion annualized run rate as some of these programs leak into the beginning of the fourth quarter. We will be lower than the third quarter run rate. But add it to $1.7 billion and say that 2020 will likely end at a total of $2 billion of investments in our associates. Of that $2 billion, only $1 billion will remain in our cost base in 2021. So I think that's the most important fact with respect to our cost base that I'd like to make sure we clarify."

That would have likely been more of a Q2 impact for us because we did go in with a little more conservative approach when the pandemic hit. As you know, we limited customer hours, limited customer counts and we also pulled back a bit on inventory. 
Since that time, though, between the merchandising team and the supply chain team and the sourcing teams and transportation team, they really have just done an incredible effort flowing product into the store. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we improved in-stock levels every week of the quarter. Our inventory grew over $400 million from the prior year. That was our first year-over-year increase that we had seen this year. And in pure volume, if you look at our accounts payable, that gives you an indication of how much goods we have flown into the buildings. It's over $3 billion from our low point. 
So the in-stocks still are not exactly where we'd like them to be, but incredible improvement. And the work the merchants have done, even though the in-stocks still have some ways to go, by working on the right SKUs with our supplier partners, updating planograms and the like, we're -- we believe we have the product and the type of items in the store that our customers are looking for. 
As it relates to online trends, you're absolutely right. Our online business, we couldn't be happier with the performance of our digital assets. And remember, we are an interconnected business. So with everything I'm about to say, remember that over 60-odd percent of our goods are picked up in our store. Nonetheless, our interconnected business grew by 80%. The penetration was 13% to the business. The sales, that translates to nearly $2 billion of sales growth in the quarter for our online business. 
Our visits are up dramatically. We're up in mobile, desktop, mobile web. Our conversion is up despite the hyper growth in app and mobile web that tend to have lower conversion rates than desktop. Our app downloads are way up. Our active app users are way up. Our orders are up. Our My Account, these are folks who are setting up an account with Home Depot, so obviously we know them better when they set up an account, are way up. 
Millennials are highly engaged with The Home Depot. You asked about customer profile. Our Pros are highly engaged. Our B2B website is seeing record volumes and engagement with our Pro customer. So I'll stop there, but it is a robust interconnected digital environment right now at The Home Depot."

We did last quarter as well. Small Pro is leading the large Pro. We've seen that large Pro really strengthened in the larger metro markets. In our services business, if you look at that as a benchmark to Pro's business, we have one of the larger backlogs of to-be-installed sales jobs that we've ever seen. 
And as you'd imagine, a lot of this is special ordered goods. So getting the bespoke special order made and shipped to the particular job and then getting the labor to install that job continues to be a bit of a pressure and more so in certain markets, leading to that large backlog. But if what we're seeing in our services business translates to what the larger Pros are also seeing, that would be sizable backlog."
